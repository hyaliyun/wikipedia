History The Society of American Registered Architects was founded on November 9, 1956 by Wilfred J. Gregson. As a professional society that includes the participation of all architects, regardless of their roles in the architectural community. The society follows the Golden Rule and supports the concept of profitable professionalism for its members. It stresses a high degree of professional fellowship and supports its motto of \\"Architect helping Architect\\". Wilfred Gregson Wilfred J. Gregson (1900‚Äì1998) was an architect in the United States who founded the Society of American Registered Architects. The society presents an award named in his honor. He established the firm Gregson and Associates. Gregson had a Scottish father and an English mother. He was based in Atlanta. In 1939 he worked as an inspector for the Civilian Conservation Corps. Gregson was involved with the design of the Georgia exhibit at the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle. He testified before a U.S. House of Representatives Labor and Education subcommittee in 1966. He warned about structural issues at the U.S. Capitol and storing files in its attic, saying it was not designed for that purpose.

They were a follow-up to the prewar Bellanca 14-7 and its derivatives. Design and development The 14-13 retained the Bellanca 14-7's basic design, but featured an enlarged cabin, a horizontally opposed Franklin 6A4-335-B3 engine in place of the earlier models' Le Blond radial, and an oval vertical endplate on each horizontal stabiliser. This latter feature gained the type the affectionate nickname \\"cardboard Constellation\\", because the arrangement was similar to the contemporary Lockheed Constellation airliner.1978 Aircraft Directory 1977, p. 20. Taking its name from the Bellanca tradition of identifying the series from the wing area in square feet, dropping the final digit, while the second number was the aircraft's horsepower, again dropping the final digit, the 14-13 did not quite fit the naming convention. The Bellanca 14-13 wing was constructed of wood, while the fuselage was welded steel-tube framework with a fabric covering. The 14-13 was introduced in 1946; in its improved 14-13-3 version the aircraft remained in production until 1956. =Model 14-19= A higher-performance design revision was granted FAA approval as the 14-19 Cruisemaster on September 26, 1949.\\"Specification 1A3.\\" Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration Aircraft. The new model featured structural upgrades, a Lycoming O435-A engine, an increased gross weight of , hydraulically operated landing gear and flaps, and a deluxe interior. 99 of these airplanes were produced between 1949 and 1951. Externally, a near-look-alike to the earlier models, this version was distinguished by its larger, oval-shaped endplates.Bellanca Champion Club Literature. All production ceased in 1956 as Bellanca wound up its operations. =Model 14-19-2= Bellanca 14-19-2 Cruisemaster, built 1958 The 14-19 design was revived by Northern Aircraft and granted FAA approval on January 7, 1957 as the 14-19-2 Cruisemaster. The new model featured a Continental O-470K engine, an increased gross weight of 2,700 pounds, an updated instrument panel as well as new paint and upholstery schemes.1957 Bellanca 14-19-2 Owners Manual. A total of 104 of these aircraft were produced between 1957 and 1958. The company was renamed Downer Aircraft in 1959. Inter-Air acquired the production rights in 1962 and was renamed as the Bellanca Sales Company, a subsidiary of Miller Flying Service. Further development of the design by Inter-Air resulted in the modernized Viking series introduced in 1962.Palmer 2001, p. 51. Bellanca 14-19-3 Landing An updated 14-19 instrument panel 1946 model Bellanca 14-13 Cruisair Senior at the Western Canada Aviation Museum- note the large endplates of the initial 14-13 Operational history Designed and produced in the post-World War II era, the Bellanca 14-13 Cruisair Senior was aimed at a general aviation market. Pilot/owners were offered a combination of performance, low engine power and a modest price. Its performance and structural strength also made it attractive for utility work, but in many ways the Bellanca design was an anachronism, relying on a conventional landing gear configuration and wood-and-fabric construction that harkened back to an earlier age. Postwar economics along with a glut of surplus military aircraft precluded heavy sales although about 600 were produced. Despite its introduction into a period where private aircraft sales were stagnant, the aircraft remained popular through all of its incarnations and today is considered a classic cabin monoplane and is much in demand.\\"Bellanca 14-13 Cruisair history.\\" Pilotfriend.com, 2009.

She was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet upon completion in 1903 before she was briefly reduced to reserve in 1906. Bedford was recommissioned the following year for service with China Station and ran aground in 1910. Her wreck was sold for scrap later that year after being partially salvaged. Design and description Bedford was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by 31 Belleville boilers.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 70 Bedford was fitted for partial oil burning as an experiment.McBride, Keith, p. 23 She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 678 officers and enlisted men.Friedman, p. 336 Her main armament consisted of fourteen breech-loading (BL) Mk VII guns. Four of these guns were mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and the others positioned in casemates amidships. Six of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather.Friedman, pp. 251‚Äì52, 260‚Äì61 Ten quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder () 12-cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. Bedford also carried three 3-pounder () Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside. The ship's waterline armour belt was thick amidships and forward. The armour of the gun turrets, their barbettes and the casemates was four inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour.McBride, Keith, p. 21 Construction and service Bedford, named after the English county,Silverstone, p. 216 was laid down on 19 February 1900 by Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering at their Govan shipyard. She was launched on 31 August 1901, when she was christened by Charlotte Mary Emily Burns, wife of the Hon. James Cleland Burns, of the Cunard Line shipping family. In May 1902 she was navigated to Devonport for completion and trials. The ship was completed on 11 November 1903 and initially assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. Bedford was briefly placed in reserve at the Nore in 1906Friedman, pp. 251, 342 before being recommissioned in February 1907 for service on the China Station.Friedman, p. 251 On 20 August 1910, four armoured cruisers of the China Station, under the command of Vice-Admiral Alfred Winsloe aboard , departed Wei-Hai-Wei, bound for Nagasaki, Japan. Winsloe ordered his ships to conduct machinery trials en route, initially at full power before reducing to three-fifths power. As the ships rounded the tip of the Shandong Peninsula and entered the Yellow Sea heading southeast, Bedford was leading the cruisers by at least and each ship was navigating independently. The weather was misty and rainy with Force 3‚Äì5 head winds; there was a full moon with a spring tide. One of the other cruisers, , checked her navigation when she spotted Ross Island at 05:00 the following morning and found that she was north and east of her estimated position. Heavy cloud cover had prevented all four ships from using celestial navigation to fix their position with any certainty; Kent was the only one that spotted a landmark clearly enough to determine her position.McBride, K.D., p. 22 Bedford got a partial star observation at 04:15, but the bridge crew was distracted by spotting land off the port side just seven minutes later and did not make the calculations until later. The navigator was called to the bridge and he assumed that it was Loney Bluff on the southwest side of Quelpart Island in the East China Sea. There was nothing else visible eastwards and the position was within of the ship's estimated position. The stellar observation was finally worked out by 04:35 and it gave a position some north of the dead reckoning position, although it could not be confirmed. At 04:40 land was sighted ahead of the ship and the navigator ordered a turn to starboard to reverse course at 04:47. About 10 seconds after starting the turn a rock was spotted off the starboard bow and he attempted to reverse his turn, but Bedford ran aground on Samarang Reef, some north and west of her estimated position. The impact sprung seams between plates on the starboard side of the bow, ripped a hole some that flooded the forward boiler room, killing 18 of the 19 crewmen on duty there, and tore another hole in the side of the boiler room. Minotaur was some behind Bedford and was able to read signals from her by 04:55. Winsloe ordered Kent to continue on to Nagasaki to act as a radio relay as he requested assistance from the Japanese Ministry of the Navy under the terms of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Salvage ships were sent the following morning, but had to put back into port because of bad weather. In the meantime, Winsloe inspected the ship and decided to take her crew off in light of the deteriorating weather. Minotaur and the cruiser put men aboard on the morning of the 22nd to see what could be salvaged, but they were withdrawn by noon as the weather continued to worsen and Kent radioed news of a typhoon en route. Winsloe boarded Bedford again on the morning of the 23rd and found her partially flooded and with waves breaking over her quarterdeck. As the weather began to improve he ordered that her upper deck guns and their equipment be salvaged, despite the waist-deep water. The sailors were able recover nine 12-pounder guns, the ship's radio, searchlights, radio and gunsights that day.McBride, K.D., pp. 22‚Äì24 The Japanese salvage ships arrived on 24 August and began removing more equipment and guns and a Royal Navy naval architect arrived two days later to assess the possibility of refloating Bedford. He concluded that it was possible if the good weather continued, but it would be very expensive and did not recommend doing so. Winsloe decided to continue salvaging equipment from the wreck, although the Japanese returned home on the 27th, but was forced to abandon it on 31 August when another typhoon was approaching the wreck site. By this time the British and Japanese had salvaged 14 six-inch guns, 13 torpedoes, and much gunnery and fire-control equipment in addition to the items removed earlier. Winsloe contracted with Mitsubishi to salvage the wreck on 20 August, but they were only able to work seven days on it by 14 October. The wreck was later sold at auction in Hong Kong after the initial auction failed to meet the ¬£5,000 reserve.McBride, K.D., p. 24 Bedfords captain, Captain Edward Fitzherbert and the navigator, Lieutenant Dixie, were subsequently court-martialled. Although Dixie had accounted for the head sea and wind in his dead reckoning, he failed to account for currents or tides, expecting them to cancel out. They were both found guilty of \\"suffering the ship to be stranded\\" and Dixie was found not guilty of the charge of negligence while Fitzherbert was found guilty. Both were sentenced to be \\"dismissed their ship\\" and severely reprimanded. Fitzherbert later retired as a Vice-Admiral while Dixie became an instructor in navigation.McBride, K.D., p. 25 Notes Footnotes  Bibliography    Category:Monmouth-class cruisers Category:Ships built in Govan Category:1901 ships Category:World War I cruisers of the United Kingdom Category:Maritime incidents in 1910 Category:Shipwrecks in the East China Sea ","title":"HMS Bedford (1901)"},{"id":"11838452","text":"For the automobile see Paykan.

The Orkesta Runestones are 11th century runestones engraved in Old Norse with the younger futhark that are located at the church of Orkesta north-east of Stockholm in Sweden. Several of the stones are raised by, or in memory of, the Swedish Viking Ulf of Borresta who during the eleventh century returned home three times with danegeld. The leaders of the three expeditions were Skagul Toste (Tosti), Thorkell the Tall (√ûorketill) and Canute the Great (Kn√∫tr). This Ulfr also made the Risbyle Runestones in the same region, and he was mentioned on the lost runestone U 343. There are two other runestones that mention the danegeld and both of them are found in the vicinity (runestones U 241 and U 194). U 333 U 333 This runestone is in runestone style Pr3, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animals heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond- shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. =Transliteration= :usnekin ' uk ' sikne(o)t ' uk ' sihui√æ(r) ' lata ' reis(a) s(t)iin ' eft[ Ä '] b[r](u)s(a) ' fa√æur sin =Transcription in Old Norse= :Osnikinn ok Signiutr ok Sigvi√∞r lata r√¶isa st√¶in √¶fti Ä Brusa, fa√∞ur sinn. =Translation in English= :√ìsn√≠kinn and Signj√≥tr and Sigvi√∞r have raised the stone in memory of Br√∫si, their father.

U 335 U 335 The runestone U 335 was raised to commemorate the building of a new bridge by Holmi. He dedicated the bridge and the runestone to his father H√¶ra, who was the Housecarl of a lord named Sigr√∏√∞r. The reference to bridge-building in the runic text is fairly common in rune stones during this time period. Some are Christian references related to passing the bridge into the afterlife. At this time, the Catholic Church sponsored the building of roads and bridges through the use of indulgences in return for intercession for the soul.Gr√§slund 2003:490-492. There are many examples of these bridge stones dated from the eleventh century, including runic inscriptions S√∂ 101, U 489, and U 617. Like many other runestones, it was discovered in the walls of a church, where it still remains. =Transliteration into Latin letters= :ulmi √ó lit √ó risa √ó stin √ó √æina √ó uk √ó bru √æisi √ó i(f)ti Ä √ó iru √ó fa√æur sin √ó uskarl √ó sifru√æa Ä =Transcription in Old Norse= :Holmi let r√¶isa st√¶in √æenna ok bro √æessi √¶fti Ä H√¶ru(?), fa√∞ur sinn, huskarl Sigr√∏√∞a Ä. =Translation in English= :Holmi had this stone raised and this bridge (made) in memory of H√¶ra, his father, Sigr√∏√∞r's housecarl U 336 U 336 The runestone U 336 is raised by Ulf of Borresta, in memory of his uncle √ìn√¶mr. Ulf adds that they both lived at Borresta (Old Norse: B√°rista√∞ir). The name √ìn√¶mr, which means \\"slow learner,\\" is also mentioned on two nearby runestones, U 112 and U 328, and so the three runestones are held to refer to the same person.Pritsak 1981:389 This inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style RAK. =Transliteration= :[ul]f Ä √ó lit √ó risa stin √ó √æi[n]a √ó ifti Ä √ó unim √ó fa√æurs√óbru√ær sin √æi Ä √ó buku √ó ba√æi Ä √ó i √ó baristam =Transcription= :Ulf Ä let r√¶isa st√¶in √æenna √¶fti Ä On√¶m, fa√∞ursbro√∞ur sinn. √û√¶i Ä byggu ba√∞i Ä i Baristam. =Translation= :Ulfr had this stone raised in memory of √ìn√¶mr, his father's brother.

The runes are written from right to left with the orientation of the runes going in the same direction, but the last words outside the runic band have the usual left-right orientation.Enoksen 1998:122 It can be dated to the first half of the 11th century because of it still uses the ansuz rune for the a and √¶ phomenes, and because of its lack of dotted runes.Enoksen 1998:124 This stone is notable because it commemorates that the Viking Ulf of Borresta had taken three danegelds in England. The first one was with Skagul Toste,Pritsak 1981:343 the second one with Thorkel the High and the last one with Canute the Great. Since there were many years between the danegelds, it is likely that Ulfr returned to Sweden after each danegeld to live as a wealthy magnate.Enoksen 1998:125 It is a remarkable feat in itself to summarize his adventurous life in so few unsentimental words. U 344 is considered to be one of the England runestones. =Transliteration= :in ulfr hafi Ä o onklati ' √æru kialt takat √æit uas fursta √æis tusti ka-t ' √æ(a) ---- (√æ)urktil ' √æa kalt knutr =Transcription in Old Norse= :En Ulf Ä hafi Ä a √Ünglandi √æry giald takit. √ûet vas fyrsta √æet's Tosti ga[l]t. √ûa [galt] √ûork√¶till. √ûa galt Knut Ä. =Translation in English= :And Ulfr has taken three payments in England.

MolluscaBase eds. (2020). MolluscaBase. Ovulidae J. Fleming, 1822. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=1747 on 2020-05-25 Distribution The ovulids are a widespread family, occurring mostly in tropical and subtropical waters, with most species in the Indo-West Pacific region. But a few species live in temperate waters. Habitat Dentiovula dorsuosa camouflaged on a soft coral. Ovulids are carnivorous molluscs that feed on polyps and tissues of Anthozoa (as do the genera Cyphoma and Pseudocyphoma). They live on, and eat, soft corals and sea fans, and they are usually regarded as ectoparasites of these sessile colonial organisms, to which they are anchored by a long and narrow foot. This extreme specialisation in their alimentary regime has caused important morphological modifications to their radula.Thiele J. (1929). Handbuch der Systematischen Weichtierkunde, 1. Fischer, Jena, 376 pp.Vayssi√®re A. (1923). \\"Recherches zoologiques et anatomiques sur les mollusques de la famille des Cypraeid√©s, 1√®re partie\\". Annales du Mus√©e d‚ÄôHistoire naturelle de Marseille Zoologie 18(1921): 1-120. Plates 1-14. Shell description Ovulids mostly have smooth shiny shells with a very long aperture and a very low or invisible spire. The shell can be pyriform (shaped like a pear), ovate (egg-shaped) to sub-ovate, cylindrical or lanceolate (lance-shaped). The shell is often monochromatic white, but in some species the shell is pink or reddish. In a few species of ovulids, the shell quite closely resembles that of cowries. However in many other species, the shells are so elongate that they do not so much resemble the shells of that closely related family. When these snails are alive, the mantle completely covers the shell almost all of the time. Pictures of living animals usually show the brightly colored and decorated mantle, which looks very different from the often rather plain, shiny surface of the shell. The color patterns of the mantle closely resemble the color patterns of the host species. This is due to the phenomenon of \\"alimentary homochromy\\" (obtaining the same color as the host by feeding on the host). This phenomenon gives them a remarkable camouflage ability.

A big ratings success when it first aired November 10, 1970 (which happened to be the Marine Corps' 195th birthday), Tribes was later released theatrically in Britain and Europe under the title The Soldier Who Declared Peace. Tribes has been released on VHS, but, has not been released on DVD. Plot Private Adrian, a young United States Marine Corps Vietnam war era draftee who, despite being an anti-war hippie, reluctantly reports to boot camp to fulfill his duty as an American. Adrian excels as a leader, though his pacifist ideology presents continuing conflicts between himself and his superiors. Adrian's drill instructor, Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Drake quickly recognizes Adrian's leadership qualities, but is conflicted as he grows to respect Adrian while also realizing that he represents everything Adrian opposes. At one point, Adrian points out that his love of meditation is similar to Drake's drawing to relax, indicating a sketch of a flying bird. Both are ways of finding freedom. Drake responds angrily, denying that he had drawn the picture. Throughout the training, the Chief Drill Instructor, and Drake's superior, Master Sgt. Frank DePayster, takes an instant dislike to Adrian. He repeatedly argues with Drake about him, claiming that the fact that the man is performing all of his assigned tasks is not enough. He considers Adrian's attitude grounds enough for him to be set back and placed in the Motivational Platoon, a disciplinary unit for problem recruits. Drake disagrees and allows Adrian to continue training through to graduation, at one point personally bringing him back after he deserted. However, DePayster had gone behind Drake's back by filing a complaint against them both with the Company Commanding Officer. Without Drake's approval, the CO removed Adrian, placing him in the Motivational Platoon under DePayster. Drake accuses DePayster of carrying out a personal vendetta, to which DePayster replies \\"I'll forget I heard that.\\" Drake takes the drawing of the bird from his desk drawer and hangs it up, thus signifying his own method of rebellion and freedom. The platoon graduates without Adrian. As Drake awaits a new batch of recruits, DePayster informs him that Adrian went \\"over the hill\\" during the night. Cast * Darren McGavin as Gunnery Sgt.

The United States was to plant mines and have submarines on patrol at sites Germany might seize for a foothold in the Caribbean. The plan was revised in 1916 to concentrate the main US naval fleet in New England, and from there defend the US from the German navy. Following Germany's defeat, the plan lost importance.

The song was developed from an earlier Berlin song \\"To My Mammy\\" which was sung by Al Jolson in his film Mammy (1930). In the earlier song, the lyrics include the questions \\"How deep is the ocean? / How high is the sky?\\" and this was the genesis of \\"How Deep Is the Ocean?\\". The song was written at a low point in Berlin's professional and personal life, and is among the select few of his numbers that were introduced on the radio rather than on stage or film. The song is a series of questions posed one after another, the only exception being the second line, \\"I'll tell you no lie.\\" This song, together with \\"Say It Isn't So\\", were huge hits in 1932 and brought Berlin back to the top again. Popular versions of \\"How Deep Is the Ocean?\\" in 1932 were by Guy Lombardo (vocal by Carmen Lombardo), Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra (with vocals by Jack Fulton), Rudy Vall√©e and Ethel Merman. Bing Crosby was another who recorded the song for Brunswick on October 14, 1932. In the 1940s Alfredo Antonini and his orchestra collaborated with Victoria Cordova and John Serry Sr. to record the song for Muzak.

Shade horsetail can be commonly found in forests with tall trees or very thick foliage that can provide shade and tends to grow closer and thicker around streams, ponds and rivers. The specific epithet pratense is Latin, meaning pasture or meadow dwelling. Description Fertile shoot with growing branches Equisetum pratense has whitish-green and slender sterile stems that grow tall, with 8 to 20 ridges that bear three rows of flat spinules. The centrum is approximately one sixth of the diameter of the stem. The pale sheaths bear slender brown teeth with white margins. Cones mature in late spring. Habitat Equisetum pratense occurs in alluvial woods, thickets, mossy glades, and calcareous meadows. It is a common pioneer species, commonly growing where instability or water erosion leaves an often open ground surface or where sandy alluvium accumulates beside streams. Where vegetation is more abundant, the fern occurs only as sparse and diminutive shoots, as the fern is succumbing to competition in a later seral community. The plant is widespread, occurring from Iceland and northern Britain and Northern Ireland through northern and central Europe as far south as the Alps. It grows across most of northern Asia to Japan and through northern parts of North America from Alaska to Labrador. Toxicity Equisetum pratense contains the enzyme thiaminase which destroys thiamine (vitamin B1). In sufficient quantity it is therefore toxic.

Upon completion in 1904 she was assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. The ship was placed in reserve in March 1906 and recommissioned in 1909 for service with the 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station. In 1912, Essex returned home and was assigned to the Training Squadron of the Home Fleet. After a refit the following year, she rejoined the 4th Cruiser Squadron in early 1914. After the beginning of World War I in August, the ship captured a German merchantman the following month. Essex spent most of the first half of the war in the Atlantic Ocean, escorting convoys and searching for German commerce raiders. The ship captured another German merchantman in mid-1916 and was reduced to second-line roles such as depot ship and accommodation ship a few months later. She was paid off in 1919 and sold for scrap two years later. Design and description The Monmouths were intended to protect British merchant shipping from fast cruisers like the French , or the . The ships were designed to displace . They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of designed to give a maximum speed of . Essex, however, was one of three of the Monmouths that failed to meet her designed speed. The engines were powered by 31 Belleville boilers.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 70 She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 678 officers and ratings.Friedman 2012, p. 336 The Monmouth-class ships' main armament consisted of fourteen breech-loading (BL) 6-inch Mk VII guns.Friedman 2011, p. 81 Four of these guns were mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure, and the others were positioned in casemates amidships. Six of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather.Friedman 2012, pp. 251‚Äì52, 260‚Äì61 They had a maximum range of approximately with their shells.Friedman 2011, pp. 80‚Äì81 Ten quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12-cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. Essex also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. Beginning in 1915, the main deck six-inch guns of the Monmouth-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve seakeeping. The twelve-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At some point in the war, a pair of three-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the upper deck.Friedman 2012, pp. 280, 286 The ship's waterline armour belt was thick amidships and forward. The armour of the gun turrets, their barbettes and the casemates was four inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour.McBride, Keith, p. 21 Construction and service Essex, named to commemorate the English county,Silverstone, p. 230 was laid down at Pembroke Royal Dockyard, Wales, on 2 January 1900 and launched on 29 August 1901, when she was christened by Mrs. Charles Barlow, wife of the Captain-Superintendent of the dockyard. There was no dry dock at Pembroke large enough to accommodated Essex, and she was therefore sent to Devonport Dockyard in late 1902 for further for fitting-out. Her torpedo tubes were manufactured at Devonport and thus not installed until she arrived there. The ship was completed on 22 March 1904 and was initially assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. Essex was placed in reserve in March 1906 and suffered a six-inch gun explosion in July while training. She was recommissioned in September 1909 and assigned to the 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station. She was transferred to the Home Fleet Training Squadron in 1912 and refitted the following year. Essex rejoined the 4th Cruiser Squadron in January 1914Gardiner & Gray, p. 12 with Commander Hugh Tweedie in command. After visiting Madeira and Jamaica, the ship arrived in Veracruz, Mexico, on 9 February to relieve her sister ship, , and protect British interests during the ongoing Mexican Revolution. Two weeks later, she visited Galveston, Texas, before heading for Tampico, Mexico where she arrived on 11 March. Essex only spent a few days there before returning to Veracruz on 13 March. She was in Tampico when Mexican soldiers briefly detained American sailors buying gasoline for their ship on 9 April (the Tampico Affair) and returned to Veracruz ten days later, two days before the Americans began landing there on 21 April.Transcript They were not satisfied by the Mexican apologies and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson ordered the city occupied in retribution and to forestall a major arms delivery to Victoriano Huerta's forces.O'Shaughnessy, pp. 280‚Äì85 The Mexicans resisted and stray bullets hit Essex the next day, wounding one man who was shot in both feet. Tweedie, escorted by two ratings, was sent to take dispatches for the British Minister in Mexico City on the 26th and returned two days later.O'Shaughnessy, p. 319 Rear-Admiral Christopher Craddock inspected the ship and her crew on 5‚Äì6 May. Essex sailed for Tampico on 10 May before leaving Mexican waters on the 14th. A month later, the ship was in Quebec City when she was visited by the Canadian Minister of Marine and Fisheries on 16 June. The following month, Essex ferried the Governor General of Canada, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, to Newfoundland and Labrador before returning to Quebec City on 20 July. =World War I= When Craddock received the preliminary war warning on 27 July, he ordered Essex to join her sister in Bermuda, which she reached three days later. The ship was ordered to patrol the area north and northwest to protect British shipping and destroy any German commerce raiders. As the Germans appeared to be concentrating their efforts in the Caribbean, Craddock ordered Essex south to reinforce his forces there in early September. On 7 September, she captured the tender, , for the armed merchant cruiser , en route from Halifax to Jamaica.Corbett, I, pp. 45, 47, 136, 263 The ship continued to patrol the sealanes from the Caribbean Sea to Canadian waters until the end of February 1915, when she escorted a troop convoy from Halifax to Queenstown, Ireland.Corbett, II, p. 277 Essex then sailed to Barrow-in- Furness where she began a refit that lasted until 29 April. Now assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet, she spent the next several weeks in Avonmouth or Scapa Flow before being transferred to Cruiser Force I and began patrolling the area between the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde and Gibraltar on 8 June. Rear-Admiral Archibald Moore, commander of the 9th Cruiser Squadron, hoisted his flag aboard the ship on 4 September and pulled it down on the 29th. Essex began a brief refit at Gibraltar on 1 October that lasted until the 26th and then resumed patrolling the Central Atlantic. She captured a German merchantman, , on 3 May 1916 in the Canary Islands. The ship resumed patrolling until her arrival in Devonport on 17 August; Essex was paid off days later. Later in the year, she was recommissioned and served as a destroyer depot ship at Devonport.Friedman 2012, p. 343 By April 1918, Essex was an accommodation ship there. As of 1 December, she was serving as a training ship, but she reverted to her previous role as an accommodation ship by 1 May 1919. Essex was paid off again by October 1919 and was later sold for scrap on 8 November 1921 and broken up in Germany.

These games are based in dungeons (‚Äúmystery dungeons‚Äù) where a floor map is randomly generated. In the dungeons, players fight other Pok√©mon while obtaining items and finding stairs to the next floor, exiting the dungeon after a fixed number of floors. Across all installments, the series has sold over 14 million copies.  Gameplay  Although there are different features in each of the titles, the major aspects of gameplay in each title are the same. The player assumes the role of a Pok√©mon that was transformed from a human, found by the player's Pok√©mon partner in the start of the game. Before the game starts, the player will need to go through a personality test; this will decide which Pok√©mon the player is in the game (with the exception of the WiiWare games, Gates to Infinity, and Super Mystery Dungeon, where the player may choose their starter). Gameplay is based on a classic roguelike game, with the player navigating the randomly generated dungeon with their Pok√©mon team. Movement and actions are turn-based; the player can use basic attacks, Pok√©mon moves, and items. The game starts with one partner Pok√©mon, but the player can recruit other Pok√©mon that they meet in the dungeon into their team soon after the first mission.

It is part of the Mission la√Øque fran√ßaiseDocument sans nom efforts in Lebanon and provides a full cycle education from kindergarten to twelfth grade. All subjects are taught in French with language classes in Arabic and English. History The lyc√©e Abdel-Kader whose creation dates back to 1909, had been known till 1985, when it was bought to the Mission la√Øque fran√ßaise by the Hariri foundation, as the school of young girls, even though it had been a coed school for some time. The school went through multiple stages of expansion which led in 1995 to the construction of an elementary school which allowed it to offer a full cycle of studies that includes kindergarten, which accepts students from the age of three, through twelfth grade. The establishment is a tripartite convention between the Hariri Foundation, the Agence pour l'enseignement fran√ßais √† l'√©tranger and the Mission la√Øque fran√ßaise. The degrees are recognized by both the French ministry of educationLiban - lycee Abdel Kader and the Lebanese ministry of education. Grades Lyc√©e Abdel Kader consists of kindergarten/maternelle (first 3 years of school, where the children are aged 3‚Äì5 years), elementary school/√©l√©mentaire (1st grade until 5th grade), middle school/coll√®ge (6th grade until 9th grade) and high school/lyc√©e (10th grade until 12th grade). Activities The establishment has the option for students to sign up for activities for 60 000 LBP, including dance, sports and choir, which has been free since 2008 when a new conductor (Yasmina Sabbah) formed four new groups: elementary choir, middle school choir, a group of advanced singers and a glee club.

Six of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather.Friedman 2012, pp. 251‚Äì52, 260‚Äì61 They had a maximum range of approximately with their shells.Friedman 2011, pp. 80‚Äì81 Ten quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. Berwick also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes. Beginning in 1915, the main deck six-inch guns of the Monmouth-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve seakeeping. The twelve-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At some point in the war, a pair of three-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the upper deck, although Berwick had hers removed before the end of the war.Friedman 2012, pp. 280, 286 The ship's waterline armour belt was thick amidships and forward.

Rabelais' Pantagruel got a sea serpent when fishing. Exaggeration is the representation of something as more extreme or dramatic than it really is. Exaggeration may occur intentionally or unintentionally. The exaggerator has been a familiar figure in Western culture since at least Aristotle's discussion of the alazon: 'the boaster is regarded as one who pretends to have distinguished qualities which he possesses either not at all or to a lesser degree than he pretends...exaggerating'.Aristotle, Ethics (Penguin 1976) p. 165. It is the opposite of minimisation. Words or expressions associated with exaggeration include: Everyday and psycho-pathological contexts Contexts of exaggeration include: =Manipulation= The boasting and bragging by arrogant or manipulative people has been sent up on stage since the first appearance of the alazon ‚Äì 'a stock character in Greek comedy'.H. J. Rose, A Handbook of Latin Literature (London 1966)p. 49 Inflated praise in the form of flattery and puffery has a similarly lengthy history. Amplifying achievements, obstacles and problems to seek attention is an everyday occurrence, as 'in exaggerating what one feels by magnifying the emotional expression: this is the ploy used by the six-year-old who dramatically twists her face into a pathetic frown, lips quivering, as she runs to complain to her mother about being teased'.Daniel Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (London 1996) p. 113. Exaggerating is also a type of deception,Guerrero, L., Anderson, P., Afifi, W. (2007). Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships (2nd ed.). Los Angeles: Sage Publications. as well as a means of malingering ‚Äì magnifying small injuries or discomforts as an excuse to avoid responsibilities.R. Rogers Clinical Assessment of Malingering and Deception 3rd Edition, Guilford, 2008. =Cognitive distortions= Cognitive behavioral therapy views magnification (as opposed to minimization) as unconscious, unrealistic mental processing or cognitive distortion, which can take the form of probability overestimation or of catastrophizing. This is better known as 'making a big deal out of nothing.' 'Whereas probability overestimation refers to exaggerating the \\"likelihood\\" of an event, catastrophizing refers to exaggerating the \\"importance\\" of the event'.M. M. Antony/P. J. Norton, The Anti-Anxiety Workbook (2008) p. 83. Closely related 'is overgeneralizing, where one takes a single negative event and see it as a never-ending pattern of defeat'.Paul Gilbert, Overcoming Depression (London 1999) p. 286 Another form of cognitive exaggeration is inflation of the difficulty of achieving a goal after attaining it, possibly to improve self-esteem.Beth Azar All puffed up Monitor on Psychology June 2007, Vol 38, No. 6. In depression, exaggerated all-or- nothing thinking can form a self-reinforcing cycle: these thoughts might be called emotional amplifiers because, as they go around and around, they become more intense. Here are some typical all-or-nothing thoughts: * my efforts are either a success or they are an abject failure * I am/other people are either all good or all bad * if you're not with us, you're against usGilbert, p. 63 and p. 98. Reaction formation Reaction formation () is believed to be a defense mechanism in which emotions and impulses which are anxiety-producing or perceived to be unacceptable are mastered by exaggeration of the directly opposing tendency. Decatastrophizing In cognitive therapy, decatastrophizing or decatastrophization is a cognitive restructuring technique to treat cognitive distortions, such as magnification and catastrophizing, commonly seen in psychological disorders like anxiety and psychosis. =Pathology= Psychoanalysis considered that neurotic exaggerations were the products of displacementOtto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1994) p. 149 ‚Äì overvaluations for example being used to maintain a repression elsewhere. Thus a conflict over ambivalence may be resolved by means of exaggerating one's love for a person so as to keep an unconscious hatred in further check.Sigmund Freud, On Psychopathology (PFL 10) p. 317. The grandiose sense of self-importance observed in narcissists also uses exaggeration to thwart any recognition of a moderate fallibility, seeing any departure from complete success as total and hopeless failure.Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 1993) p. 71 \\"Self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion\\" can be observed in those with histrionic personality disorderDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV- TR) American Psychiatric Association (2000). and other Cluster B personality disorders; while \\"catastrophizing\\" is associated with depressive, neurotic or paranoid behavior ‚Äì focusing on the worst possible outcome, however unlikely, or thinking that a situation is unbearable or impossible when it is really just uncomfortable. =M√ºnchausen syndrome by proxy= M√ºnchausen syndrome by proxy is a controversial term for a behavior pattern in which a caregiver deliberately exaggerates, fabricates, or induces physical, psychological, behavioral, or mental health problems in those who are in their care. Alarmism Alarmism is excessive or exaggerated alarm about a real or imagined threat e.g. the increases in deaths from infectious disease. The alarmist person is subject to the cognitive distortion of catastrophizing ‚Äì of always expecting the worst of possible futures.P. Gilbert, Overcoming Depression (1999) p. 88-90 Cultural manifestations =Humour= Caricature from 1796, parodying the fashion of one or two feathers issuing vertically from a woman's headdress, and women's neo-classically influenced gown styles, which were new in England in 1796) 'Some theoreticians of the comic consider exaggeration to be a universal comic device'.Emil Draitser, Techniques of Satire (1994) p. 135 It may take different forms in different genres, but all rely on the fact that 'the easiest way to make things laughable is to exaggerate to the point of absurdity their salient traits'.M. Eastman/W. Fry, Enjoyment of Laughter (2008) p. 156. Caricature A caricature can refer to a portrait that exaggerates or distorts the essence of a person or thing to create an easily identifiable visual likeness: 'disproportionately increasing and emphasizing the defects of the features'.Filippo Baldinucci, quoted in Harold Osborne ed., The Oxford Companion to Art (Oxford 1992) p. 204. In literature, a caricature is a description of a person using exaggeration of some characteristics and oversimplification of others. Slapstick Slapstick is the recourse to humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of common sense. These exaggerated depictions are often found in cartoons, and light film comedies aimed at younger audiences. Paradoxical laughter Paradoxical laughter is an exaggerated expression of humor which is unwarranted by external events. It may be uncontrollable laughter which may be recognised as inappropriate by the person involved. Freud considered 'the compulsive laughter which so often occurs on mournful occasions'Sigmund Freud, Case Studies II (PFL 9) p. 74. the by-product of ambivalence. Miles Gloriosus Il Capitano uses bravado and excessive shows of manliness to hide his true cowardly nature. The boastful soldier or Miles Gloriosus has for thousands of years formed part of the Western stage. 'The original miles gloriosus in Plautus is a son of Jove and Venus who has killed an elephant with his fist and seven thousand men in one day's fighting. In other words, he is trying to put on a good show: the exuberance of his boasting helps to put the play over'.Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton 1973) p. 165. =Overacting= Overacting is the exaggeration of gestures and speech when acting. It may be unintentional, particularly in the case of a bad actor, or be required for the role. For the latter, it is commonly used in comical situations or to stress the evil characteristics of a villain. Since the perception of acting quality differs between people the extent of overacting can be subjective. =Animation= Exaggeration is an effect especially useful for animation, as perfect imitation of reality can look static and dull in cartoons. The level of exaggeration depends on whether one seeks realism or a particular style, like a caricature or the style of a specific artist. The classical definition of exaggeration, employed by Disney, was to remain true to reality, just presenting it in a wilder, more extreme form.Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 65-6. Other forms of exaggeration can involve the supernatural or surreal, alterations in the physical features of a character; or elements in the storyline itself. It is important to employ a certain level of restraint when using exaggeration. If a scene contains several elements, there should be a balance in how those elements are exaggerated in relation to each other, to avoid confusing or overawing the viewer. =Shock jock= A shock jock, a type of radio broadcaster or disc jockey, entertains listeners or attracts attention using humor and/or melodramatic exaggeration that some portion of the listening audience may find offensive. = Media = Schopenhauer saw exaggeration as essential to journalism. He may have exaggerated the case slightly, but yellow journalism thrived on exaggeration, and fact-checking and independent verification have not succeeded in suppressing clickbait or hyperbolic headlines. = Politics = Politicians can exaggerate. For example: In the electoral process one may expect exaggeration. For example: Outside the electoral process the exaggerations of propaganda can bolster the position of incumbents. = Advertising = =Tragedy= Hamlet, by William Morris Hunt Although the boaster (alazon) is primarily a comic figure, 'the alazon may be one aspect of the tragic hero as well: the touch of miles gloriosus in Tamburlaine, even in Othello, is unmistakable, as is the touch of the obsessed philosopher in Faustus and Hamlet'.Frye, p. 39. =Expressionism= '\\"Expressionist art\\"...attempted to intensify the expression of feeling and attitude by exaggeration'.Harold Bloom, Thomas Hardy (2010) p. 93 In its wake, even the 'new and hard realism...kept much of the distortion and exaggeration which had been one of the chief devices of earlier Expressionism'.Harold Osborne ed., The Oxford Companion to Art (Oxford 1992) p. 397. =Literary analogues= * In the BookWorld, warnings are issued about Poetry Island...any visit longer than a few hours will have an exaggerating effect on the senses. Upbeat poems will tend to have you laughing uncontrollably, while sombre poems will have you questioning your own worth in a most hideously self-obsessed manner'.Jasper Fforde, One of Our Thursdays is Missing (London 2011) p. 249. * The Monty Python Dirty Fork sketch demonstrates an absurd level of catastrophization where restaurant staff commit suicide and murder each other because of a customer complaint of a dirty fork. Compare with the scene in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail involving the Black Knight character which is the opposite extreme of absurdity (minimisation).

She was sent to West Africa after the beginning of World War I in August 1914 and captured 10 German merchant ships in September. Cumberland spent the rest of the war on convoy escort duties and patrolling for German commerce raiders. She was sold for scrap in 1921 and broken up two years later. Design and description Cumberland was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple- expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by 31 Belleville boilers.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 70 She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 678 officers and enlisted men.Friedman 2012, p. 336 Her main armament consisted of fourteen breech-loading (BL) 6-inch Mk VII guns.Friedman 2011, p. 81 Four of these guns were mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and the others positioned in casemates amidships.

Cumberland also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes. Beginning in 1915, the main deck six-inch guns of the Monmouth-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve seakeeping. The twelve- pounder guns displaced by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At some point in the war, a pair of three-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the upper deck.Friedman 2012, pp. 280, 286 The ship's waterline armour belt was thick amidships and forward. The armour of the gun turrets, their barbettes and the casemates was four inches thick.

The city of Morteros is one of the most important in the San Justo Department, it is near the intersection of two major highways RP 1 and RP 17 and near the ferrocarril Central Argentino. Morteros is around from the provincial capital C√≥rdoba (280 by road) and from Santa Fe. Geography and climate Morteros is around from the eastern shore of Mar Chiquita. The micro region around Morteros is an ecotone between the Humid Pampa semi arid Gran Chaco region. The temperature varies between with an annual average of . The first frost can be expected on March 21 and the last on September 5. The average precipitation is per year. Local flora include the cha√±ar, tala, Quebracho, caranday and the yatay. History Before the arrival of the conquistadores in the 16th Century the area was populated by ethnic Sanavir√≥nes and Mocov√≠es. In the 18th Century the Spanish established a fortress called Los Morteros on a rocky outcrop, the principal function of the fortress was to defend the local territory. It lay on an alternative route to the mining region of Potos√≠ in Peru, it was used as a market for contraband such as slaves to work in the mines and silver. Fortress Los Morteros and the local area were recaptured by the indigenous population after the May Revolution, although the Sanavir√≥nes had been virtually extinguished, Mocov√≠es and Abipones moved into the area. The European Argentines launched a counter-offensive and reclaimed the territory in the middle of the century. The indigenous population suffered a great deal from the ethnic cleansing campaigns of the mid 19th century. In 1891 the first railway arrived in Morteros, the railway brought a large number of European immigrants from the Piamonte, Friuli and Toscana in Italy. In 1965 Morteros acquired its status as a city. Economy The economy of the area is dominated by agriculture, especially the production of maize and dairy products. In 1952 the town started the production of Aero Boero which were mainly used for crop spraying and as training aircraft. Other industrial production included the production of agricultural machinery and industrial refrigerators. In the 1990s the area saw a massive increase in the amount of soya, alfalfa and sorghum There is little tourism in the region aside from the visitors to the Mar Chiquita Lake (Laguna Mar Chiquita o Laguna Ansenuza).

The song was produced by Larry Smith and Russell Simmons and released by Profile Records in March 1984. Following the popularity of their previous two singles \\"Hard Times\\" (1983) and \\"It's Like That\\" (1983), Profile Records head suggested to the producers and group that they should attempt to record an album as they already had four songs ready, and releasing a few more would not hurt them. Despite speculating low sales from the label and the group not feeling that hip hop was a genre appropriate for a full-length album, they were given an advance to start recording. This led to Run-DMC members Joseph \\"Run\\" Simmons and Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels going through their rhyme book to develop new songs, one of which would become \\"Rock Box\\". After having to wait for the heavy metal band Riot to finish their studio time so the group could record new tracks, the group and producers were influenced by their loud guitar sound and attempted to create a guitar based track. After McDaniels and Simmons recorded their rhymes, Smith developed the track, including inviting his friend Eddie Martinez to record layers of guitar solos to match the song. On its completion, McDaniels and Simmons were unhappy with the sound as they assumed it would not be as guitar heavy and Profile Records president Cory Robbins was also not confident with it, feeling that it was \\"weird\\". The group gave a version of the song without the rock backing to Kool DJ Red Alert to play on New York radio, but it was Smith's version with the guitar that became the more popular version. \\"Rock Box\\" also featured a music video that became the first hip hop song to get regular rotation on the music video channel MTV. \\"Rock Box\\" was released in early March, three weeks prior to the release of the group's debut album Run-D.M.C.. The song was praised in contemporary reviews receiving praise in magazines such as Creem and Rolling Stone. In the 1984 Pazz & Jop critics poll released by The Village Voice, \\"Rock Box\\" tied with Afrika Bambaataa & James Brown's single \\"Unity\\" (1984) at seventh place as one the top singles of the year. Run-DMC would continue their use of rock based tracks on many of the future songs, including \\"King of Rock\\" (1985), \\"Walk This Way\\" (1986) and \\"It's Tricky\\" (1986). Background Prior to the release of \\"Rock Box\\", Run-D.M.C. released their first single \\"It's Like That\\" in March 1983. The song was released by Profile Records, a small New York- based independent music label known for dance music. Journalist and Run-D.M.C. biographer, Bill Adler stated that \\"It's Like That\\" was a large step away from the previous three and a half years of hip hop which was known for polished and high spirited songs released by Sugar Hill record label. This was followed by a tour where the group opened for funk music bands on the bottom half of double bills. Profile released their second single \\"Hard Times\\" backed with \\"Jam Master Jay\\" in December 1983 which charted higher on Billboard's \\"Black Singles\\" chart than \\"It's Like That\\". After the success of the two singles, Profile Records decided to have Run-D.M.C. make a full-length album for both the group and the label. Profile's president, Cory Robbins, recalled that after the success of \\"It's Like That\\" the group should record an album, feeling that it would be just a few songs, and Run-DMC already had four. McDaniels, Joseph and Russell Simmons were originally against recording an album. Robbins told them that they would be making these songs anyway and encouraged them to record, despite knowing that hip hop albums had not really sold well before. Profile gave them a $25,000 advance for the album with fifteen thousand going towards recording and the remaining 10,000 being split between Smith, McDaniels, Russell and Joseph Simmons. Whether Jay Mizell (Jam Master Jay) was paid for the record remains unknown. =Recording= Joseph Simmons would tell McDaniels to write about a particular subject which led him to fill his notebook with rhymes. Russel Simmons and Larry Smith would go over lyrics deciding which ones to use, with McDaniels stating that both would \\"pass over any references to violence, guns, and shit like that.\\" McDaniels stated that Joseph Simmons and himself wanted to created \\"beat jams; we wanted to rhyme over the break beats that the DJs like Grandmaster Flash, Grand Wizzard Theodore, Charlie Chase, and Tony Tone were dropping on those cassette tapes before records were made.\\" Initially for \\"Rock Box\\", McDaniels was interested in using Billy Squier's \\"The Big Beat\\" (1980) as the backing music. Smith had McDaniels use his DMX drum machine to lay out the beat which McDaniels changed a bit as he \\"didn't want to bite a sample\\". The song predominantly uses the DMX drum machine while the rest of the track used a real bass, guitar, tambourines and cowbells and keyboards. Smith, who played the bass on the track, brought in his friend, Eddie Martinez, from Hollis, Queens to perform guitar on \\"Rock Box\\". McDaniels stated two versions of \\"Rock Box\\" were created as Joseph Simmons initially just wanted the beat, the rhymes and a little bit of echo on the track. When Martinez arrived, they played him the rhythm track and recorded one riff, rewound the tape and had Eddie play again which led to multitracking his part, which had him playing the harmony with himself, and the solo. McDaniels stated he \\"didn't want the guitar version playing in the hood.\\" and both McDaniels and Joseph Simmons were initially not happy with the rock version. McDaniels soon became more comfortable with the song after his friend named Yogi that lived near him kept \\"giving [him] all these praises about 'Rock Box,' and I'm looking at him like, 'You like it?'\\" Joseph Simmons would appreciate the song later in his career, stating it wasn't \\"King of Rock\\" (1985) or \\"Walk This Way\\" (1986) that helped them the most, it was \\"Rock Box\\" that was \\"the record that took us out of the hood.\\" Music and lyrics \\"Rock Box\\" has been described as belonging to the hip hop and rap rock genres. According to Simmons, Run-DMC had to wait for the heavy metal band Riot to finish their session before entering the recording studio. Simmons declared that after the group saw the guitars they wanted to use some as well. McDaniels stated that the idea for a rock guitar in the song was created by producer Larry Smith. Smith stated that his background was in rock music and that Russell Simmons \\"didn't care about rock'n'roll. Run didn't want nothin' to do with it.\\" Run-DMC were among the first hip hop releases to use a rock guitar; other notable predecessors' included the Treacherous Three's \\"Body Rock\\" from 1980. Musically, Ira A. Robbins described the songs backing music in the Trouser Press Record Guide as melding a simple bass riff to the \\"thunderous rhythm tracks\\" and the \\"blazing rock guitar\\". Adler described the lyrics of \\"Rock Box\\" as similar to that of their previous song \\"Sucker MCs\\" (1983). The lyrics of that song involved disrespecting other rappers and how superior Run-DMCs raps were. Joseph Simmons commented that when writing that song he wanted \\"nothing but hardcore b-boy, wizard, winning shit. Def b-boy stuff, like we used to do in the parks\\". In \\"Rock Box\\", Joseph Simmons discusses b-boy fashion with lyrics of \\"Calvin Klein's no friend of mine / Don't want nobody's name on my behind / It's Lee on my leg, sneakers on my feet, D by my side, and Jay with the beat.\\" Release Prior to releasing the song, Russell Simmons played the track for Robbins at Profile Records who recalled it \\"was so weird [...] it just took getting used to. Now it seems so normal, but the first time I heard it was like \\"What is this\\", and not necessarily in a good way.\\" \\"Rock Box\\" was released in March 1984, three weeks before the release of the studio album Run-D.M.C. on March 27, 1984. Simmons found that \\"At first black radio didn't know what the fuck it was. They liked everything else on the album better [...] But they tried it for us, kids called the stations requesting it, and 'Rock Box' became a hit in those markets.\\" McDaneils stated that \\"black people loved the guitar version more than the hip-hop version.\\" after the song was played by Kool DJ Red Alert in New York's KISS FM. By May 1985, \\"Rock Box\\" had sold over 750,000 copies. Darryl McDaniels stated it took the release of \\"Rock Box\\" and their first album to get public acknowledgement, noting that he would drive down the highway after the release and a car of young women who drive next to him and scream excitedly recognizing him from Run-DMC. A version titled \\"Rock Box (B-Boy Mix)\\" recorded on January 10, 1984, was released on a deluxe version of the album Run-D.M.C. in 2005. Music video The music video for \\"Rock Box\\" was directed by Steve Kahn. The video was budgeted at 27,000 dollars and was the first music video by the group and the Profile label. The video begins in with an introduction by Professor Irwin Corey, a comedian billed as \\"The World‚Äôs Foremost Authority\\" who humorously compares hip hop and other music until McDaniels and Joseph Simmons arrive in a limousine. The group arrives and begin performing \\"Rock Box\\" as their vehicle stops at the Danceteria, a then popular downtown rock club in New York. Throughout the video the group is being watched admiringly by a young boy. McDaniels recalled the making of the \\"Rock Box\\" video as \\"weird. We weren't into it. It was just something we were told to do. And the director had the idea to have some little boy chasing after Run-DMC, to show that we had appeal to the younger generation. A little white boy, too.\\" Run-DMC were the first rappers to get significant support from MTV as the video became the first hip hop music video to be in regular rotation on the channel. McDaniels recalled in 2011 that when \\"Rock Box\\" was shown on MTV, the staff at Profile Records were very excited, while at the time the group were unfamiliar with the network and were more interested in getting videos on thew New York based public access television shows New York Hot Tracks and Video Music Box. Joseph Simmons echoed the statement, recalling that the group \\"didn't know what MTV was, [...] but everyone was jumping around us like it was a big breakthrough. So we jumped with them.\\" Ann Carli, who worked with promotional material for artists at Jive Records, stated that Run-DMC's videos were played by MTV initially as the network felt Run-DMC \\"weren't threatening: they dressed like cartoon characters, in the hats and the jackets [...] a lot of their videos had a cartoon quality, and that was an easier fit for MTV.\\" The music video is shown again in a fictional Museum of Rock and Roll in the group's music video for \\"King of Rock\\" (1985). Reception Bill Adler described \\"Rock Box\\"'s reception as being loved by rock music critics. Roy Trakin praised the song in Creem, calling it \\"a searing rap rocker\\" and that the guitar solo by Martinez \\"does for hip-hop what Eddie Van Halen did for Michael Jackson - bringing it to a whole new audience.\\" On reviewing their debut album in August 1984, Debby Miller of Rolling Stone noted that Run-DMC style of \\"Trading off lines or even the words within a line, they get into a vocal tug of war that‚Äôs completely different from the straightforward delivery of the Furious Five's Melle Mel or the every-body-takes-a-verse approach of groups like Sequence.\\" and noted that varied musical approach of their songs including \\"Rock Box\\" which \\"set their clipped, back-and-forth exchanges to a crying hard-rock guitar solo, melting rap into rock lite it's never been done before.\\" A reviewer credited as \\"Push\\" declared in Soundcheck that was \\"a superbly orchestrated collision of funk and ripping guitar\\" Reviewing a Run-DMC concert at the Danceteria, Richard Grable wrote in the 26 May 1984 issue of the NME \\"\\"Rock Box\\" is a stroke ‚Äî the first guitar-fuelled beat box spawn of \\"Beat It\\" (1982) to mean anything.\\" In the 1984 Pazz & Jop critics poll released by The Village Voice, \\"Rock Box\\" tied with Afrika Bambaataa & James Brown's single \\"Unity\\" (1984) at seventh place as one the top singles of the year. From retrospective reviews, Robbins praised the track in the Trouser Press Record Guide, stating \\"Rock Box\\" was \\"The perfect combination ‚Äî verbal acuity and theatrical drama matched by an inexorable pounding beat and the power of electric guitar\\" and helped \\"chip away the barriers that kept \\"black music\\" and \\"white music\\" segregated all through the '70s.\\" Tom Breihan of Pitchfork referred to the track as \\"The only real misstep\\" from their debut album, stating that it \\"buries a decent banger under layers of unbearable hair-metal guitar wheedling.\\" Legacy alt=A man wearing a brimmed hat and a t-shirt with the Adidas logo on it. Martinez would return to play guitar for the group on \\"King of Rock\\" (1985). Steve Pond of the Los Angeles Times described that song as \\"Rock Box, Part II\\" and that it was \\"a conservative move that's paid off in MTV air play\\". Robbins wrote in the Trouser Press Record Guide that the use of electric guitar on \\"Rock Box\\" and \\"King of Rock\\" led to directly to the groups other rock based tracks, including \\"Walk This Way\\", and the use of The Knack's \\"My Sharona\\" (1979) riff on Run-DMC's song \\"It's Tricky\\" (1986). Murray Forman wrote in his book The 'Hood Comes First: Race, Space, and Place in Rap and Hip-Hop that the new rock guitar based sound seen in similar song \\"8 Million Stories\\" (1984) by Kurtis Blow and \\"Rock Hard\\" (1984) by the Beastie Boys and showcased a drift away from the disco-based music of earlier rap music such as the use of Chic's \\"Good Times\\" (1979) as used in \\"Rapper's Delight\\" (1979). Forman followed up stating this rock oriented sound made hip hop music more accessible to white teenagers and moved hip hop music being performed at discotheques to larger arenas. The song influenced contemporary groups of the period. Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys stated that the group was inspired by Run-DMC for their first album Licensed to Ill (1986), specifically noting \\"Rock Box\\" and \\"King of Rock\\" as their inspiration for a hybrid of rock and hip hop. Hip hop group Whodini changed the music they were initially going to have on their album Escape (1984) after hearing \\"Rock Box\\". Their album was initially going to have a rock music backing, but the group went with a more R&B; influenced sound on the record after hearing \\"Rock Box\\". \\"Rock Box\\" was listed among rapper and producer Questlove's top hip hop songs of all time in 2012, noting that the song's importance was not about its hybrid of rock and hip hop music, but that before Run-DMC, hip hop groups looked like they were \\"part of a Broadway production.\\" Questlove declared that America wanted music artists that looked and dressed like they did, and by doing so, \\"Run-DMC officially ushered in the B-boy period of hip-hop, where the every-man had a chance to escape poverty and invisibility and make it.\\" Questlove concluded that \\"the single that knocked down many obstacles enabling hip-hop to become the new gospel.\\" Track listing 12\\" single (PRO-7045) # \\"Rock Box\\" 6:56 # \\"Rock Box (Vocal Dub Mix)\\" 6:00 # \\"Rock Box (Dub Version)\\" 7:28 Credits Credits adapted from the liner notes and expanded with information in the article. * Larry Smith producer, composer, bass * Russell Simmons producer * Darryl McDaniels composer * Joseph Simmons composer * D.J.

Personal life He was in a relationship with TV judge Craig Revel Horwood, known for his role on Strictly Come Dancing; they split in early 2016. En- Masse En-Masse logo. Before becoming better known for his monkey routines Scott was part of a 40-strong group of singers from Southampton and Salisbury who come together to put on concerts twice a year under the name \\"En-Masse\\". The pop and soul collective covers a wide variety of music ranging from disco to Motown and rock to soul. As well as performing at the 900-capacity Salisbury City Hall twice a year, En-Masse toured many locations and released three albums and one single. British Resorts Association Search for a Star In 1999, Scott entered the nationwide British Resorts Association Search for a Star Contest, which was sponsored by the Southern Daily Echo. is open to any kind of act from singers to dancers and musicians. When Scott appeared in the semi-final at the Bournemouth Pavilion he received best speciality award, the Stan Sowden Memorial Trophy, ¬£500 cash, the judges' and the audience vote. The national final saw Scott take first prize, and collect a trophy, a cheque for ¬£2,750, a voucher for a ¬£400 costume, and entries in two stage publications, again winning the audience vote and best speciality act award. Following Scott's success he was spotted when the head cameraman from the BBC attended the Southern Daily Echo Star Trail semi-final and he suggested to fellow programme makers that Scott would be a perfect subject for a BBC2 real life series which profiles the lives and careers of people aged 18‚Äì25. When they started filming Scott they decided to make a special one-hour programme for BBC1 just about him and his puppets. In addition, they made a 20-minute pilot sitcom involving Damon playing a character called George, and his monkey puppet Bubbles. This was filmed over five days. For the documentary Scott was filmed around his home town of Salisbury with Bubbles. =Gene Pitney & Damon= An article on Pitney's tour, featuring Scott. Scott later landed a major UK tour with Gene Pitney. Scott was spotted by music promoter Derek Nicol after he won Southern Daily Echo Star Trail and went on to represent Bournemouth at the British Resorts Association national final in Leamington Spa. Nicol was one of the judges who awarded Scott not only first place but also the award for best speciality act. On the basis of an eight-minute performance, Nicol asked Scott to do the entire first half of each show on the 22-date tour. The tour started off at Southend's Cliffs Pavilion on 25 April 2000 and ended at the Bristol Hippodrome on 21 May 2000. A total audience of around 60,000 people saw him and many of the venues sold out.

Scott and his monkey puppet, which mimed Jackson's \\"Earth Song\\", was the first to be given the thumbs up from the judges after receiving a standing ovation from the 2,000-strong audience and rave reviews from the judges. Simon Cowell said \\"Your timing is perfect and that's the difference between being talented and entertaining. That was super entertaining\\" then went on to joke that \\"It says a lot about the world today that I'm enjoying a monkey puppet more than Michael Jackson.\\" =Semi-final= On 14 June 2007, the first of three semi-finals was broadcast live. Scott was among eight acts to perform for a place in the final. His act brought a different monkey puppet, named Stephen which he performed the song \\"No Matter What\\" by Boyzone, when Scott started singing as himself, Cowell hit his buzzer. Towards the end of the act, Scott sang with the puppet, getting the thumbs up from two of the three judges. =After the semi-final= After the semi-final in her Daily Mirror column Amanda Holden went on to say \\"In the auditions Monkey Boy was my top choice one of my personal favourites. I championed him from the start. He's got the talent and he'll give everyone a run for their money. He wasn't just another vent act, he injected new life into this art form. I've got no hint of what he'll do in the final but he'll pull out all the stops.\\" =Final= The final was broadcast live on 17 June 2007. Scott returned with Bubbles to the delight of the judges, however he came second to opera singer Paul Potts. =After the show= Scott was invited to the Grand Order of the Water Rats Annual ball 2007 as a guest in the Great Room of the Grosvenor House Hotel in London, and was delighted to not only be nominated for the 'Serge Ganjou Award' but to win it and collect the ¬£4,000 prize.

However, after saving Michael yet again and nursing him back to health after he gets stung by a jellyfish, he invites Micasan to live with him in his cave and begins opening up to Michael. Michael teaches Kensuke English, and Kensuke teaches Michael how to paint, how to fish with a spear and where to find the best food (such as red bananas) and water. He is eventually revealed to be a doctor and survivor of World War II. Kensuke believes that his family, including his wife Kimi and son Michaya, died in Nagasaki after the atomic bomb was dropped there on 9 August 1945. Over time Kensuke begins to understand how Michael feels and how he misses his family. Together they build a beacon that can be lit to signal to ships, but for a long time they see no sign of any ships. Eventually, however, Michael finds the remains of a ship. He consults with Kensuke as to whether or not they should light the beacon. Kensuke recognises the ship carries poachers, so he and Michael rush to gather all the apes into a cave, to protect them from the threat. They nearly succeed but cannot find one particular orangutan, the one Kensuke calls Kikanbo. The poachers disembark and they hear gunshots. When the ship leaves, they discover that some gibbons have been killed, but Kikanbo had survived. The next ship they sight is not the poachers', so they light the beacon. The crew on the ship see the fire and heads towards the island. When the boat is closer, Michael sees that it's the Peggy Sue, with his parents on board. However, Kensuke decides not to go home with Micasan after all, saying \\"This is my place. This Kensuke's Kingdom. Emperor must stay in his Kingdom, look after his people. Emperor does not run away. Not honourable thing to do.\\" Kensuke asks Micasan to keep his presence on the island a secret for ten years, after which Kensuke will probably be dead. Micasan is reunited with his parents. In the epilogue, it's revealed that four years later, Kensuke's son Michiya, who had survived the Nagasaki bombing, wrote to Michael l asking to meet him to talk about Kensuke. Michael notes that Michiya laughs just like his father.  Adaptations  In August 2018, WildChild Productions took a theatrical adaptation of Kensuke's Kingdom by Stuart Paterson to Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It featured a voiceover by Jenny Agutter. UK-based Lupus Films began production on an animated version of Kensuke's Kingdom (film) in 2020. Voice actors for the animated version include Sally Hawkins, Cillian Murphy, and Ken Watanabe.

Mandated by 32 Member States, and the European Commission, the REC has been providing structured assistance to the region of Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe and beyond (MENA, Central Asia, Southern Caucasus, Latin America), in helping communities to strengthen environmental governance, shifting to a low- carbon economy, building resilience to climate change, managing natural resources, and developing capacities for future environmental stewardship. The REC‚Äôs expertise focuses on the following areas: environmental governance, low- emission development, resilience to the impacts of climate change, sustainable mobility, water management and natural resources management. The status of the REC as an independent, non-partisan, non-advocacy and non-profit international organisation has become a model for open, transparent, efficient and accountable international cooperation in Europe and beyond. Mission and objectives The REC‚Äôs mission is to contribute to transparency, sustainability and European integration, implementing projects that build resilience to climate change, promote clean energy solutions, champion sustainable mobility and strengthen environmental governance in Central and Eastern Europe and beyond. We fulfill our mission by promoting cooperation among governments, non-governmental organisations, businesses and other stakeholders, and by supporting the free exchange of information and public participation. History In July 1989 during his visit to Hungary President George Bush made a pledge for million dollars to help establish an independent environmental protection center in Hungary* The European Commission agreed to match this offer and the Hungarian government offered additional funds and in- kind support. The Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe was opened in September 1990 in the presence of Hungarian President √Årp√°d G√∂ncz and Prime Minister J√≥zsef Antall. Soon additional European countries (Austria, Denmark, The Netherlands) and next year Canada and Japan joined the founding countries, providing additional funds. In 1995 the REC was chartered as an international non-governmental organization, headquartered in Hungary. Founding Executive Director Peter Hardi started to build a regional network of REC offices in former communist countries in Europe. This network now includes 8 regional offices. Since October 2019 the Center is de facto closed; negotiations are under way to consolidate its accumulated debt and legally close its operations. Major achievements The REC currently manages over 60 active projects worth a total amount of approximately EUR 20.8 million. Over the last ten years, the REC has successfully implemented more than 1,000 projects and has received in excess of EUR 130 million from more than 800 resource partners. The REC‚Äôs extensive experience and proven track in its focus areas allow partners to enjoy the benefits of specialization, shared knowledge and economies of scale. For more than 25 years, and working with funds totaling more than EUR 210 million, the REC has received public and private grants, implemented projects and programmes with earmarked contributions, and administered and operated funds, including trust funds. The REC offers a multi-stakeholder platform for policy dialogue and the advancement of regional and national debates in areas of emerging importance on the public agenda and those that require particular expertise, as well as diplomatic engagement. Through its headquarters in Szentendre, and a well- established office network covering the countries of Central, South Eastern Europe, and the Baltics, the REC has implemented, in a politically sensitive environment, national and transnational projects funded, among others, by the Government of the US, the Government of Canada, the European Commission, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), the Austrian Development Agency (ADA), the Government of Norway, and other partners.

In 1950, the music was adapted by Irving Aaronson with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster for the movie The Great Caruso, in which it was sung by Ann Blyth. Later, Mario Lanza recorded the song. It became one of the most popular songs of 1951, reaching number three in the US Billboard Charts. Lanza received his third Gold Disc for this song. In the UK, the song was a number one hit based on sales of sheet music. It reached the top spot in January 1952, staying there for four weeks. The song was also associated with Anne Shelton, whose contemporary recording was available alongside Lanza's. The instrumental version of the song is often associated with magicians performing their \\"magical tricks\\", and flying trapeze acts, with whom it is often played in the background, especially in animated cartoons.

Lat Jor belonged to the Geej or Guedj Wolof maternal dynasty that has ruled Baol and Cayor for two centuries.

With Lat Jor, Maba took part in the conquests of the states of Baol and Djolof. They, however, couldn't conquer the Serer Kingdom of Sine and were defeated at The Battle of Fandane- Thiouthioune (18 July 1867) by Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof (King of Sine).Alioune Sarr, Histoire du Sine-Saloum.

After the French conquered Waalo, (re-appointed) governor Louis Faidherbe invaded Cayor in 1865 to stop the Damel's opposition to the construction of the Dakar to Saint-Louis railway. Dior is reported to have told the later French Governor Servatius: \\"As long as I live, be assured, I shall oppose, with all my might the construction of this railway.BBC. The Story of Africa: Railways.\\" But the French defeated Lat Jor's forces at the battle of Dekheule on 26 October 1868, after Faidherbe's retirement. Lat Jor struck a deal for limited autonomy and re-installment in 1871. In response to further French expansion, Cayor rose again with Dior at their head, only to be defeated and be annexed again in 1879. The Cayor kingdom was extinguished in its entirety on October 6, 1886. The Legend of Lat Jor Faidherbe is reputed to have said of Lat Jor's troops: \\"Ceux-l√†, on les tue on ne les d√©shonore pas.\\" (\\"They can be killed but not dishonored\\"). This has been adapted as the motto of the Senegalese Army: \\"On nous tue, on ne nous d√©shonore pas\\".

All fins are a uniform tint of white or yellowish without any spotting. The skin is smooth and firm, the scales are modified into spines directed towards the back. The body coloration is light brown to sandy- yellowwith dark blotches circled with a white line and pale ventral surface. The only other fish with which it might be confused is the long-spine porcupinefish, (Diodon holocanthus) but it has much shorter spines and it lacks a dark streak running between the eyes. In case of danger, the porcupinefish can inflate itself by swallowing water to deter the potential predator with its larger volume and it can raise its spines defensively. The porcupinefish concentrates a poison, called tetrodotoxin, in certain parts of its body such as the liver, skin, gonads and the viscera. Tetrodotoxin is a powerful neurotoxin.

He ended up being tried guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison. * In prison, he met Doctor F. He told James about the ray gun that turns people invisible. After his release, he went into Dr. F's house and used the ray gun. It only turned his skin invisible but his insides are visible. If he tried to make himself completely invisible, he will die instantly. With his change came his new name, now going by Alabaster. In prison, he also learned how to flick small rocks and peanuts at people. * He killed Susan Ross with the ray gun and, with the three escaped convicts, Gen, and Ami, stole jewelry and money from the rich and killed them. He employed more criminals along the way. * One of the three original convicts used their peanut throwing skill from Alabaster, forcing him to drop his ray gun, and the beam kills him instead. ;Susan Ross * Susan Ross is a TV star who once dated James Block. When he went to jail, she lost her fame and fortune. After his release from prison, he sought her.

The town is located between Crowell and Vernon within sight of the Medicine Mounds just outside present-day Quanah, Texas. A monument marks the site where a group of Comanche Indians (mostly women and children) were killed by a detachment of Texas Rangers and militia under Ranger Captain \\"Sul\\" Ross. The Indian camp was attacked as retaliation against recent Comanche attacks on white settlers. This raid is primarily remembered as the place where Cynthia Ann Parker was recovered from the Comanche who had captured her twenty-four years earlier. Cynthia Ann Parker Cynthia Ann Parker was a woman of European descent who had been kidnapped as a child by the Comanche in the Fort Parker massacre in 1836. The nine-year-old Parker had grown up among the Comanche, who called her \\"Nadua\\". She had married war chief Peta Nocona and borne him 3 children. Nonetheless, the Rangers and her family had never given up hope of regaining her. Her uncle, James Parker, had spent most of his adult life, and his fortune, in a fruitless search for her. Her presence and rescue at Pease River was a matter of national importance, probably because, as Ross was quoted as saying in the book Indian Depredations, by J.W. Wilbarger, \\"Most families on the frontier had lost someone to the Indians. Cynthia Ann's recovery would be looked at as almost a miracle by those folks.\\" The famous picture of her with her daughter Topsanah at her breast was carried in almost every paper in the country.The Comanche Barrier to South Plains Settlement: A Century and a Half of Savage Resistance to the Advancing White Frontier. Arthur H. Clarke Co. 1933. Peta Nocona The greatly feared Comanche war chief Peta Nocona was a son of a chief of the Quahadi band of the Comanche known as the Wanderer, or possibly wanderer as in \\"outcast\\", or \\"he who wanders far and returns\\". Peta Nocona was one of the war chiefs present at the attack on Fort Parker, and had formed his own band of the Comanche called the Nokoni. They occupied territory along the Red River. Nocona had taken Cynthia Ann Parker as his wife a few years after she was kidnapped by the Indians in 1836. A great tribute to his affection to her was that he never took another wife, though it was common among the Comanche for such a successful war chief to do so. The couple eventually had two sons, Quanah Parker and Pecos, and a daughter, Topsannah. The assault In early 1860 Peta Nocona led the Comanches in a raid through Parker County, Texas, which ironically was named in honor of his wife's family. After the raid he returned with his band to what he believed was a safe retreat under the sandstone bluffs of Pease River near where Mule Creek flowed into the stream. The site was long a favorite of the Comanche, providing both cover from the fierce blue northers that hit the plains, and ample forage for their ponies, with easy buffalo hunting from the nearby herds. But the raids of the Comanche had brought pressure in Austin to protect the settlers, and Texas Governor Sam Houston had commissioned Ranger Captain Sul Ross to organize a company of 40 Rangers and 20 militia to put a stop to the Indian raids. The company of 60 was based at Fort Belknap, in Young County. Sul Ross quickly ascertained that he simply did not have sufficient men to guard the frontier,The Comanches: Lords of the Southern Plains. University of Oklahoma Press. 1952. and instead determined that the best way to protect the settlers was to take the offensive to the Indians at the earliest opportunity. In preparation, he began to scout the area for sign of Indian camps. After Peta Nocona's raid into Parker County, Sul Ross and his fighters started tracking the Nokonis, who were considered the hardiest fighters among the Comanche, who were in turn considered the fiercest of the Plains Indians. Modern research has revealed that Peta Nocona did not intend to stay at Pease River, and was preparing to move on when the attack came on his camp that December day. It was daybreak on December 18, 1860, when Ranger Captain Sul Ross himself scouted out the camp on the Pease River as his scouts reported the presence of a fairly large hunting party and camp on the banks of the Pease. With an oncoming blue northern blotting out sign, Ross was able to move up to spy out the location of the Noconi on the Mule Creek head bank as it came into the Pease River. Ross sent a detachment of 20 men out of his force of 60 to position themselves behind a chain of sand hills to cut off retreat to the northwest, while with 40 men, Ross himself led the charge down into the Indian camp. The result was that the band was taken completely by surprise and were either killed in the camp by the 20 men to the north as they attempted to flee. Sul Ross wrote, quoted in Indian Depredations, by J.W. Wilbarger, that they fired at everyone present, saying \\"The attack was so sudden that a considerable number were killed before they could prepare for defense. They fled precipitately right into the presence of the sergeant and his men. Here they met with a warm reception, and finding themselves completely encompassed, every one fled his own way, and was hotly pursued and hard pressed.\\" Cynthia Ann Parker and her daughter in 1861 after being taken at Pease River, in a picture which was famous all over the United States There are two distinct and very different stories about Peta Nocona's death. The first is that he died trying to escape with his wife and infant daughter, which is the generally believed story, and the one reported by Sul Ross officially. According to this story, seeing that the camp was hopelessly overrun, Chief Peta Nocona and Cynthia Ann Parker fled to the east up a creek bed. Reportedly, mounted behind Nocona was a 15-year- old Mexican girl, while Cynthia Ann Parker carried her two-year-old child, Topasannah (\\"Prairie Flower\\"). Captain Ross and his lieutenant, Tom Killiheir, pursued the man they believed to be the legendary Peta Nocona. But Quanah Parker, the chief's oldest son, once reportedly said in Dallas to Sul Ross, \\"No kill my father; he not there. I want to get it straight here in Texas history. After that, two year, three year maybe, my father sick. I see him die.\\" Certainly Quanah Parker said on numerous occasions to both friend and foe that his father had survived the attack on his warband, and died three to four years later of complications from old war wounds suffered against the Apaches. In this story, Peta Nocona was out hunting with his oldest son and a few others when the attack occurred. This story is supported also by an Army Colonel who reported interviewing reliable men who saw Nocona after his death at Pease River. In the popular account recollected by Sul Ross and first printed in James T. DeShields' 1886 book Cynthia Ann Parker, after a chase of a mile (1.6 km) or so, he and Ranger Tom Killiheir hotly pursued a man they thought was a chief from his headdress, who had a second Indian on the back of his pony, and a second pony with a woman carrying a small infant. The Rangers pulled up and either (Ross claimed he shot the man, Killiheir said he did, one of the two shot the second Indian on the back of the chief's pony. It turned out to be a Mexican girl on the back of Nocona's pony, and both white men would later claim that they did not know she was a girl, with only her head showing out of the buffalo robe. She was killed instantly by the shot, and as she died, pulled the chief, supposedly Peta Nocona, off the horse. The Comanche chief recovered and began to fire arrows at the approaching Ross, one striking the horse on which the Ranger captain was mounted. One shot from Ross's pistols reportedly broke Nocona's arm, while two other shots reportedly hit his body. Apparently mortally wounded, Nocona managed to drag himself to a small tree and bracing himself against it began to chant the Comanche death song. Captain Ross's Mexican-born servant, Antonio Martinez, who spoke Comanche, and reportedly had been taken captive as a child by Nocona, approached the dying warrior and spoke to him in the Comanche language. As an interpreter for Captain Ross, Antonio Martinez told Nocona to surrender. The fierce Comanche's response was a dying attempt to hurl a lance at the Ranger leader. His family captured‚Äîexcept for his son Quanah, who had escaped the slaughter‚Äîand his warriors dead or dying, their families dead or prisoners, Nocona was executed on the spot by a shotgun wielded by Martinez, while the woman supposedly screamed his name and wept. The popular account of the Battle of Pease River is called into question by conflicting accounts from participants including Ross himself. There is evidence in his later correspondence that Ross was aware of the political advantages conferred by widely held perceptions about his role in the incident at Pease River. The record also indicates his own version of the story changed over time, generally casting his involvement in a more positive and grandiose light. Once he had come into the reservation, and the topic arose with him, Quanah Parker adamantly denied that the man killed with his mother was his father. Further, Quanah Parker had told his fellow warriors for years that his father had made good his escape from Pease River, and had died years later. Quanah said that he and his father, along with a few others, had left the camp late the night before to go hunting, and thus were not present the morning of the attack on their warband, and when they returned, virtually no adults were left alive to tell him or his father exactly what had taken place, or what had become of his wife and two youngest children. Not knowing whether his wife and youngest children were even alive, Peta Nocona made the hard decision to flee, in order to assure the safety of his remaining son. According to Quanah, Ross did not know who the man he killed was, and his father was away with him, and virtually all the warriors when the attack occurred, and lived four more years, before old battle wounds finally killed him. It must be also noted that a rare book from that period supports Quanah's claim that his father did not die at Pease River. In a book decades out of print, written in 1890, Carbine & Lance, The Story of Old Fort Sill, by Colonel W.S. Nye, the Colonel buttresses Quanah's version of the story. Ney says: \\"Accounts vary as to what happened. Captain Ross, who was acclaimed a hero for the deed, claimed and probably honestly believed that he had caught and killed Peta Nacona. But in the melee he pursued and shot Nawkohnee's Mexican slave, who was trying to save the fleeing Comanche women.\\" Nye claimed that he encountered men who saw Nocona alive several years after Pease River, when he was ill with an infected war wound. This version strongly supports Quanah's claim that his father survived Pease River, and died three to four years later of an infected wound. A 2012 book, Myth, Memory and Massacre: The Pease River Capture of Cynthia Ann Parker by Texas Tech University history professor emeritus, Paul H. Carlson and Tom Crum debunks most of the material in the apparently politically inspired 1886 book of James T. Deshields. They also document the primary sources who verify that Peta Nocona was not at the scene of the massacre and died around 1865, not December 1860. Aftermath At first Ross believed the woman he had captured was an American Indian woman. Some accounts say Martinez noticed her blue eyes, a rare trait for a native Comanche, and as the woman was questioned, she pointed at herself and said \\"me Cynthia.\\" There were many claims as to who rescued Cynthia. Martinez claimed he identified her by her hair and eyes, as did Killhair. Another version, that of Sul Ross, in his official report on the battle wrote of identifying Cynthia Ann Parker, again quoted in Indian Depredations, by J.W. Wilbarger: 'Why, Tom, this is a white woman, Indians do not have blue eyes.' When Ross returned to Fort Belknap, Ross sent at once for Isaac Parker, a brother of Silas Parker and uncle to Cynthia Ann, who lived near Weatherford, Texas, but he was unable to positively identify this frail captive as his niece. Alas, though her remembered few words of English finally convinced Parker she was his niece, her travails had only begun. Although Cynthia Ann was lovingly cared for by her white family, she was unhappy in her new surroundings. Topasannah died of influenza in 1864, followed shortly by her mother, who starved herself to death. Cynthia Ann already was in mourning for her sons when her daughter died, leaving her without a reason to live. According to her neighbors \\"She thought her sons were lost on the prairie after she was captured. She would take a knife and slash her breasts until they bled and then put the blood on some tobacco and burn it and cry for hours.\\" Ironically, of Cynthia Ann's two sons, both escaped the Battle of Pease River, but one died later before he could be returned to his mother. Charles Goodnight, the famous scout and later rancher, found the sign of two horses who had trotted at a normal trot out of the camp for about a mile, then taken off at a dead run to the nearest large Comanche camp. Goodnight trailed the horses 50 miles to that camp, but as it had more than 1,000 Comanche present, and he had less than a dozen men with him, he abandoned the chase. Later in life, Quanah told Goodnight he was one of those horsemen, and his brother was the other. Though his brother died, Quanah became a famous chieftain among the Comanche's, indeed, he was the last of their war chiefs. Quanah Parker, the last Comanche war chief, at the end of his life would see his mother and sister's remains disinterred, and reburied beside him at Fort Sill. John Wesley of Foard County, Texas, in 1880, acquired the land upon which the fight had taken place, along Mule Creek. In 1918 he wrote \\"I became acquainted with Quanah Parker in 1882 or 1883 and met him quite often in Vernon where he and members of his tribe came to trade. He was very friendly and wanted to know all about his kinfolks in Parker County. He asked me to visit him at Fort Sill and I in return asked him to visit me, but he said he never went to Mule Creek because his father was killed there and his mother sister were captured and carried off. He said he never wanted to see the place.\\" See also * Cynthia Ann Parker * Fort Parker massacre * Peta Nocona * Quanah Parker Notes References * Bial, Raymond. Lifeways: The Comanche.

This avoidance may be based on appearance, smell, taste, texture, brand, presentation, or a past negative experience with the food, to a point that may lead to nutritional deficiencies or other negative health outcomes.  Signs and symptoms  People with ARFID have an inability to eat certain foods. \\"Safe\\" foods may be limited to certain food types and even specific brands. In some cases, individuals with the condition will exclude whole food groups, such as fruits or vegetables. Sometimes excluded foods can be refused based on color. Some may only like very hot or very cold foods, very crunchy or hard-to-chew foods, or very soft foods, or avoid sauces. Most people with ARFID will still maintain a healthy or typical body weight. There are no specific outward appearances associated with ARFID.Nicholls, D., Christie, D., Randall, L. and Lask, B.. (2001). \\"Selective Eating: Symptom, Disorder or Normal Variant.\\" Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry. Vol 6(2): 257‚Äì270. Sufferers can experience physical gastrointestinal reactions to adverse foods such as retching, vomiting or gagging. Some studies have identified symptoms of social avoidance due to their eating habits. Most people with ARFID would change their eating habits if they could. =Associated conditions= The determination of the cause of ARFID has been difficult due to the lack of diagnostic criteria and concrete definition. However, many have proposed other conditions that co-occur with ARFID. There are different kinds of 'sub- categories' identified for ARFID: * Sensory-based avoidance, where the individual refuses food intake based on smell, texture, color, brand, presentation * A lack of interest in consuming the food, or tolerating it nearby * Food being associated with fear-evoking stimuli that have developed through a learned history * Anorexia and bulimia often occur in individuals suffering from ARFID. = Autism = Symptoms of ARFID are usually found with symptoms of other disorders or with neurodivergence. Some form of feeding disorder is found in 80% of children that also have a developmental disability. Children often exhibit symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism. Although many people with ARFID have symptoms of these disorders, they usually do not qualify for a full diagnosis. Strict behavior patterns and difficulty adjusting to new things are common symptoms in patients that are on the autistic spectrum. A study done by Schreck at Pennsylvania State University compared the eating habits of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing children. After analyzing their eating patterns, they suggested that the children with some degree of ASD have a higher degree of selective eating. These children were found to have similar patterns of selective eating and favored more energy dense foods such as nuts and whole grains. Eating a diet of energy dense foods could put these children at a greater risk for health problems such as obesity and other chronic diseases due to the high fat and low fiber content of energy dense foods. Due to the tie to ASD, children are less likely to outgrow their selective eating behaviors and most likely should meet with a clinician to address their eating issues.Schreck KA, Williams K, Smith AF. A comparison of eating behaviors between children with and without Autism\\" Journal of Autism and Developmental Disabilities 2004; 34: 433-438.Evans, E. (2013). Selective Eating and Autism Spectrum Disorder. In Behavioral Health Nutrition. Retrieved April 2, 2013, from = Anxiety disorder = Specific food avoidances could be caused by food phobias that cause great anxiety when a person is presented with new or feared foods. Most eating disorders are related to a fear of gaining weight. Those who have ARFID do not have this fear, but the psychological symptoms and anxiety created are similar. Some people with ARFID have fears such as emetophobia (fear of vomiting) or a fear of choking, but this is not common.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is often based on a diagnostic checklist to test whether an individual is exhibiting certain behaviors and characteristics. Clinicians will look at the variety of foods an individual consumes, as well as the portion size of accepted foods. They will also question how long the avoidance or refusal of particular foods has lasted, and if there are any associated medical concerns, such as malnutrition. Unlike most eating disorders, there may be a higher rate of ARFID in young boys than there is in young girls. = Criteria = The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) renamed \\"Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood\\" to Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, and broadened the diagnostic criteria. Previously defined as a disorder exclusive to children and adolescents, the DSM-5 broadened the disorder to include adults who limit their eating and are affected by related physiological or psychological problems, but who do not fall under the definition of another eating disorder. The DSM-5 defines the following diagnostic criteria:American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5. Retrieved May 14, 2014, from * Disturbance in eating or feeding, as evidenced by one or more of: ** Substantial weight loss (or, in children, absence of expected weight gain) ** Nutritional deficiency ** Dependence on a feeding tube or dietary supplements ** Significant psychosocial interference * Disturbance not due to unavailability of food, or to observation of cultural norms * Disturbance not due to anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and no evidence of disturbance in experience of body shape or weight * Disturbance not better explained by another medical condition or mental disorder, or when occurring concurrently with another condition, the disturbance exceeds what is normally caused by that condition In previous years, the DSM was not inclusive in recognizing all of the challenges associated with feeding and eating disorders in 3 main domains: * Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) was an all-inclusive, placeholder group for all individuals that presented challenges with feeding * The category of Feeding Disorder of Infancy/ Early Childhood was noted to be too broad, limiting specification when treating these behaviors * There are children and youth who present feeding challenges but do not fit within any existing categories to date Children are often picky eaters, but this does not necessarily mean they meet the criteria for an ARFID diagnosis.  Treatment  = For adults = With time the symptoms of ARFID can lessen and can eventually disappear without treatment. However, in some cases treatment will be needed as the symptoms persist into adulthood. The most common type of treatment for ARFID is some form of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Working with a clinician can help to change behaviors more quickly than symptoms may typically disappear without treatment. There are support groups for adults with ARFID.Wang, S. (2010, July 5).

The four stages of the treatment are record, reward, relax and review. * In the record stage, children are encouraged to keep a log of their typical eating behaviors without attempting to change their habits as well as their cognitive feelings. * The reward stage involves systematic desensitization. Children create a list of foods that they might like to try eating some day. These foods may not be drastically different from their normal diet, but perhaps a familiar food prepared in a different way. Because the goal is for the children to try new foods, children are rewarded when they sample new foods. *The relaxation stage is most important for those children that suffer severe anxiety when presented with unfavorable foods. Children learn to relax to reduce the anxiety that they feel. Children work through a list of anxiety-producing stimuli and can create a story line with relaxing imagery and scenarios. Often these stories can also include the introduction of new foods with the help of a real person or fantasy person. Children then listen to this story before eating new foods as a way to imagine themselves participating in an expanded variety of foods while relaxed. * The final stage, review, is important to keep track of the child's progress. It is important to include both one-on-one sessions with the child, as well as with the parent in order to get a clear picture of how the child is progressing and if the relaxation techniques are working. It has also been suggested that making mealtimes fun is a great way to get young children to the dinner table, by helping to create positive associations with dining.Munchy Play - https://www.munchyplay.com/blog/top-10-tips-for-coping- with-a-fussy-eater  See also  *Food neophobia *Orthorexia nervosa  References   External links  Category:Eating disorders Category:Culture- bound syndromes fr:S√©lectivit√© alimentaire ","title":"Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder"},{"id":"11839210","text":"Washington Malianga (21 June 1926 ‚Äì 22 June 2014) is one of several leaders of the Zimbabwe African People's Union who left ZAPU in 1963 and founded the Zimbabwe African National Union.

The castle itself was bequeathed to the nation upon his mother's death in 1974. After his death, it was discovered that he had amassed, almost entirely in secret, one of the greatest collections of stamps of the former British Empire.  Early life  Sir Gawaine was raised at Leeds Castle, the ancient fortress in Kent that his mother Lady Baillie (n√©e Olive Cecilia Paget), a Whitney heiress, had bought with her sister Dorothy Paget in 1928. At age five, after World War II broke out, Baillie went to live with his American cousins, the Whitney family. Soon after returning to England, his father (Sir Adrian Baillie, 6th Baronet) died on 8 January 1947, and he succeeded to the family title, becoming 7th Baronet of Polkemmet, Linlithgowshire. Following education at Eton and Cambridge, he created HPC Engineering in 1959, a company which specialises in sub-contract manufacturing for the automotive, aerospace, computer, defence, medical and machine tool industries. He served as chairman and managing director of the company for the rest of his life. He was also an amateur race car driver, competing in numerous championships against Stirling Moss, Mike Hawthorn and Jackie Stewart. After retiring from motor racing, he returned to his boyhood hobby of collecting stamps.  Racing career  Sir Gawaine's driving career began in 1956, when he first started racing a Lotus Eleven sports car. By 1958, he became a member of the Equipe Endeavour team, earning several wins in a Jaguar Mark 1 including the John Davy Trophy at Brands Hatch as part of the inaugural British Saloon Car Championship season. By 1960, Sir Gawaine had purchased a Lotus Elite and entered several rounds of the World Sportscar Championship, including his first attempt at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 1961, Sir Gawaine entered the Tour de France automobile competition, finishing second in the touring car category. The following year, he crashed his Jaguar E-Type during the same competition and fell down a hillside, emerging with numerous cuts to his face. Sir Gawaine returned to the British Saloon Car Championship the following year, now campaigning an American-built Ford Galaxie. The Galaxie was also transported to Australia in 1964, where Sir Gawaine and Lex Davison entered the Sandown 6 Hour International. After Sir Gawaine's Australian tour with the Galaxie, he purchased a Ford Mustang for the 1965 British Saloon Car Championship, he finished second in the class championship behind his teammate Roy Pierpoint. In 1966 he finished first in class with a Ford Falcon which benefited from his expertise in engine compression technology. By 1967 Sir Gawaine had retired from racing.  Stamp collecting  2d Tyrian plum stamp Sir Gawaine's goal in stamp collecting was to build a comprehensive collection of postage stamps from Great Britain and the British Empire, starting with the earliest issues of Queen Victoria through to the present. Sir Gawaine was interested in only the most perfectly preserved stamps and his collection is distinguished from others of comparable scale by his exacting standards. He mastered at least ten areas of specialisation and acquired over 100,000 stamps, of the highest quality including a copy of the scarce Edward VII 2d Tyrian plum. The collection was considered the most comprehensive of its kind. When Sotheby's put the stamps up for auction after his death, the collection was described as the most important to be sold in more than 50 years. Sotheby's divided the stamps into ten separate auctions, the first nine of which exceeded the initial estimate of ¬£11m, by more than ¬£4m.  Personal life  In 1966, he married Margot Beaubien, the daughter of Senator Louis Beaubien of Montreal. They had a daughter, Liza (born 1969), and a son, Adrian (born 1973), who upon his father's death became Sir Adrian Louis Baillie, 8th Baronet.

Retrieved on February 3, 2010. Established in 1989 by actor Dick Van Patten, the company markets itself as \\"Food For a Lifetime\\" and promotes itself as having \\"the finest food you can buy for your pet.\\" A subsidiary of Big Heart Pet Brands, it is currently owned by the J.M. Smucker Company. History Natural Balance began in 1989 when Van Patten was a guest on John Davidson's show. Van Patten had lunch with the show's band drummer, Joey Herrick,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-dog-days-of-dick-van- patten/article1074265/ who rescued dogs and cats. Van Patten told him when he was a kid he had snakes, alligators, and other animals. The drummer and Van Patten had an idea of making a health food for dogs. At the time, Van Patten played tennis with a veterinarian and she said the best quality food should have no filler, no wheat, no corn, no soy, and no by-products. Many of Natural Balance's dry formulas maintain this initial ingredient list; others, such as the dog food rolls, include wheat flour and sugar. As of 2014, the food rolls have been reformulated to not contain wheat flour and instead utilize brown rice. Initially Natural Balance lost money, until the brand was picked up by Petco and featured in more than 625 stores. On May 22, 2013, Natural Balance merged with Del Monte Foods, maker of pet foods such as Kibbles 'n Bits, Meow Mix and Milo's Kitchen. In March 2015 The J.M. Smucker Company purchased Natural Balance Pet Foods and the Big Heart Pet Brands from Del Monte. Products The product line includes L.I.D. Limited Ingredient Diets, Original Ultra Whole Body Health, Vegetarian, and Wild Pursuit high protein diets. = Pet food formulas = Natural Balance has a large variety of both dog and cat formulas in dry, treats, rolls, or canned form, including: * Limited Ingredient Diets-Dry Dog * Limited Ingredient Diets-Wet Dog =Zoological formulas= Natural Balance was a member of Association of Zoos and Aquariums and has created zoological products that are formulated specifically for carnivores in zoos and wild animal parks and not sold to the general public. These foods were developed by Director of Zoological Product Research and Development Dr. Martin R. Dinnes, a founding member of the American College of Zoological Medicine. Natural Balance's zoological formulas were used by, among others, Big Cat Rescue,Big Cat Rescue testimonial Tippi Hedren's Shambala Preserve, Toledo Zoo, San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo Safari Park and SeaWorld.

The organizations aspire to raise $1 million to honor guide dogs and military service dogs across America. Natural Balance and Petco are working to build a National Monument for Military Working Dogs, which will be dedicated at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, in 2013.Natural Balance Website Recalls Natural Balance was one of the brands involved in the 2007 Melamine-Contaminated Pet Food Recalls. On April 16, 2007, the company informed the FDA that they had received complaints from consumers regarding a select amount of Venison & Brown Rice Dry Dog Food and Venison & Green Pea Dry Cat Food. Some animals were reported to have vomited and a few experienced kidney failures.Information on Natural Balance - FDA update Natural Balance immediately issued a voluntary recall for all its Venison dog products and its dry Venison cat food after lab results showed that some of the products contained trace amounts of melamine. The source of melamine was believed to be from rice protein concentrate. On April 27, 2007, Natural Balance issued a second recall for three canned dog food and one canned cat food. Like the first recall, the contaminants were melamine in rice protein concentrates. As with the venison based formulas, rice protein concentrate was not on the list of ingredients of the four products. This time, Natural Balance claimed that their canned food manufacturer American Nutrition, Inc (ANI) added the rice protein concentrate without their knowledge or consent, calling it a \\"manufacturing deviation\\".FDA Firm Press Release In response, ANI issued a press release denying any deliberate or intentionally wrongful conduct, claiming that \\"customers specifically required rice-based formulations\\".American Nutrition, Inc. Responds to Criticism Along with Natural Balance, other pet food organizations such as Blue Buffalo and Menu Foods were affected by the contaminated products and issued recalls. Additionally, in July 2007, a small lot of certain Natural Balance canned pet foods were recalled after it was determined that they may have been involved in a large-scale Botulism outbreak, associated with its producer Castleberry's Food Company. No illnesses were reported with the pet food.FDA News Release July 21, 2007 As a result of the 2007 recalls, the company built an ISO 17025-accredited laboratory to proactively test each production run of their products for nine different toxins before shipping the food to retailers. Natural Balance: Safety Testing On July 3, 2020, J.M. Smucker announced a voluntary recall of a single lot of Natural Balance Ultra Premium Chicken & Chicken Liver Pat√© Formula cat food upon discovering elevated levels of choline chloride after receiving complaints from cat owners whose pets had become sick after eating it. The company did not publicly divulge details as to which symptoms the affected cats had developed, but warned in its announcement that \\"Ingesting impacted product may cause nausea with excessive salivation, constricted pupils and poor vision, diarrhea or vomiting to more severe symptoms including difficulty walking, muscle shaking, tremors, irregular heartbeat, difficulty breathing, possible cardiac or respiratory failure and, in extreme situations, death.\\" Natural Balance 'Information' Page (archived July 7, 2020)FDA Recall July 3, 2020 References External links *Official Natural Balance website Category:Cat food brands Category:Dog food brands Category:Companies based in Los Angeles Category:Companies established in 1989 Category:1989 establishments in California Category:Pacoima, Los Angeles ","title":"Natural Balance Pet Foods"},{"id":"11839376","text":"Antoinette Tubman Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Monrovia, Liberia.

The reasons most often cited for this opinion is that Royer has combined the traditional warmth of vintage ribbon microphones with modern output levels. While older ribbon microphones had a great sound, the ribbons were weak and would break easily. Royer microphones, however, are still strong enough to be placed in front of electric guitar amps, a placement that certain older ribbons could not have weathered. David Royer designed his first ribbon microphone in 1997 and started the company that bears his name one year later. When that first microphone, the R-121, was released, it received positive reviews from all the major recording magazines. The R-121 Ribbon microphone contained two innovations that delivered the performance levels necessary for professional studio use. Neodymium (rare-earth) magnets produce a much stronger magnetic field than the AlNiCo magnets used by vintage designs, raising the microphone's sensitivity. High-grade output transformers raise the microphone's signal-to-noise ratio. The R-121 is also known for its use of Royer's patented \\"offset ribbon\\" design, in which the placement of the aluminum ribbon allows it to withstand louder sources from the front of the microphone, as well as giving the microphone a slightly different voicing from front to back. The company has continued to innovate, and was the first to develop a phantom powered ribbon microphone, and a tube-ribbon microphone. In Use Royer microphones have been used on many instruments. Sound engineers have had good results when recording classical guitars, drum kits, pianos, woodwinds, and electric guitars. Users of Royer microphones include Carlos Santana, Herb Alpert, Steve Albini, Ross Hogarth, and Ed Cherney.

He was killed in action at the Battle of Chancellorsville. Biography The son of Revolutionary War veteran and Ohio civil servant John Reily and his wife Nancy (n√©e Hunter), Robert was born in Hamilton County, Ohio. Reily was the founder of the village of Wyoming, Ohio. When civil war broke out in 1861, Reily joined the 75th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He was mustered in as a major, but was promoted to lieutenant colonel and then to colonel. During the Battle of Chancellorsville, the 75th Ohio was part of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division of the XI Corps in the Army of the Potomac. On May 2, 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee sent Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson and his corps on a 12-mile march around the Union lines with the hope of catching XI Corps by surprise. At 4:30 in the afternoon, Colonel Reily had heard reports of a Confederate movement in his direction. Unlike many top commanders, such as the XI Corps commander Major General Oliver O. Howard, Reily did not dismiss them. He prepared the 75th Ohio for an attack he knew was coming. He had his men lie down, rest by their weapons and wait for the attack. Within a half hour, Jackson's 12,000 Confederate soldiers rushed out of the thick underbrush. Most of the XI Corp was taken by surprise and broke for the rear without firing a shot. As other men of the XI Corp ran by in a panic, the 75th Ohio stood and fired back at the Confederates. They kept up the fire for ten minutes until the Confederates had overwhelmed their lines, forcing them to retreat. In those ten minutes, Colonel Reily was killed and 150 other men of the 75th Ohio were killed or wounded. Reily was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio, in Section 46, Lot 39.

Before the Nazi-Soviet invasion of the Polish Second Republic, Janowa Dolina was a model settlement built in the Kostopol County of the Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship by workers of the Polish State Basalt Quarry. The town was inhabited by 2,500 people. Its name, which translates as the \\"Jan's Valley\\" in Polish, came from the Polish king Jan Kazimierz, who reportedly hunted in the Volhynian forests, and after hunting ‚Äî rested on the shore of the Hory≈Ñ (Horyn) River. The town was destroyed during World War II by Ukrainian nationalists who murdered most of its Polish population including women and children. First years The settlement was built in the late 1920s and early 1930s following Poland's return to independence after a century of imperial Partitions. The area was ceded to Poland at the Peace of Riga, with large percentage of the ethnic Ukrainian population. The town was created next to the newly built major construction aggregate quarry. Production of basalt in the quarry started in 1929, when the 18 km rail connection between Janowa Dolina and Kostopol was completed (Kostopol is located on the main rail route Wilno‚Äì≈Åuniniec‚ÄìLw√≥w). As the quarry employed in late 1930s some 3,000 workers (97% of them were Polish). Homes were built for them and their families in a suburban setting. The quarry with a company town was the brainchild of Leonard Szutkowski, chief engineer who kept his post until 1940, and his deputies, engineer J. Niwinski and engineer Urbanowicz. Most workers lived in the freshly built houses; some commuted from nearby villages. The settlement Janowa Dolina was a very modern settlement; all houses had access to electricity and plumbing and its layout was based on a specially designed grid plan. Houses were placed in the beautiful pine forest. Streets bore no names; they were marked by letters ‚Äî A, B, C, D‚Ä¶ G (Glowna ‚Äî main), until the last one, Z, placed closest to the Horyn River. Along them there were houses, each designed for 4 families. As inhabitants of Janowa Dolina later remembered, the settlement was full of flowers, plants and trees and neighbors competed with each other, trying to have the most beautiful flower garden. The settlement was separated from the nearby quarry by a strip of dense forest. In the central part of the settlement there was a huge, U-shaped building, called BLOK. Inside there were several institutions ‚Äî a movie theater, hotel, cafeteria, stores. Next to the building there was a sports field, with a soccer stadium. The quarry sponsored its own sports club called Strzelec Janowa Dolina, which had several departments ‚Äî soccer, boxing, wrestling, swimming. A Roman Catholic church was planned, but it had never been built. Instead, the faithful used a large barn. Also, in Janowa Dolina there was a Polish police station, school, kindergarten and a health center. As both the quarry and the settlement belonged to the Polish State, private businesses were not allowed. In Janowa Dolina all trade was controlled by the national ‚ÄúSpo≈Çem‚Äù company, inhabitants were able to purchase all desired products but alcohol, which was not sold in the settlement. World War II In September 1939, Soviet troops, following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, attacked the eastern part of Poland, which was not guarded by the Polish Army, as at the same time the Poles were fighting the Germans in the West. Eastern Poland (Kresy) was quickly occupied, together with Janowa Dolina, which, like the entire Volhynian Voivodeship, became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Together with Soviet rule came mass deportations to Siberia and other areas of the empire; between September 1939 and June 1941 Janowa Dolina lost hundreds of inhabitants. =Destruction of the settlement= Monument in memory of Polish citizens of Janowa Dolina Wolyn murdered by Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) on 22-23 of April 1943 In June 1941, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Janowa Dolina was added to the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. As Volhynia was the area of activity for various Ukrainian nationalist groups whose aim was to cleanse the land of Poles and Jews, the settlement‚Äôs fate was inevitable. On the night of April 22‚Äì23 (Good Friday), 1943, the Ukrainians from the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, together with local peasants, attacked Janowa Dolina. Some 600 people, including children and the elderly, were brutally murdered (see Massacres of Poles in Volhynia). Most homes were burned to the ground and the settlement deserted. The perpetrators, commanded by Ivan Lytwynchuk (aka Dubowy) exercised rare cruelty. Poles, unprepared and caught by surprise, were hacked to death with axes, burned alive, and impaled (including children). The murderers did not spare anyone, regardless of age and sex. German garrison, numbering around 100 soldiers, did not act and remained in its barracks. After first wave of murders, the Ukrainian nationalists started searching the hospital. They carried its Ukrainian patients away from the building, while Polish patients were burned alive. Dr Aleksander Bakinowski, together with his assistant Jan Borysowicz, were hacked to death on the square in front of the hospital. In several cases, Ukrainians were murdered for trying to hide their Polish neighbours. Petro Mirchuk, Ukrainian historian, counted several hundred massacred Poles, with only eight UPA members killed. Current events Monument in memory of UPA. The present-day name of the settlement is Bazaltowe. In the place where buildings once stood, there is a monument, founded by Polish survivors. Its opening (18 April 1998) was marred by a demonstration of Ukrainian nationalists, and afterwards, the original inscription was changed. The date \\"April 23, 1943\\" was removed and now the inscription says only \\"In memory of Poles from Janowa Dolina\\", without giving further information of their fate. Nowadays in the village monument in memory of infamous action of Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) is situated. The inscription in Ukrainian says that on 21-22 of April 1943 \\"the base of Polish-German occupiers of Volhyn\\" was liquidated here.Memorial, promemoria.pl; accessed 13 December 2014.

The forum includes all United Nations member states and permanent observers, the UNFF Secretariat, the Collaborative Partnership on Forests, Regional Organizations and Processes and Major Groups. History In 1992, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, (‚ÄúEarth Summit‚Äù) held in Rio de Janeiro, adopted the Non-legally Binding Authoritative Statement of Principles for a Global Consensus on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests (Forest Principles) together with Agenda 21, which included a chapter (Chapter 11) on ‚ÄúCombating Deforestation‚Äù. Following the Earth Summit, the UN established the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF) and its successor, the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF), to implement the Forest Principles and Chapter 11 of Agenda 21. From 1995 to 2000, the IPF/IFF processes dealt with such issues as underlying causes of deforestation; traditional forest- related knowledge; international cooperation in financial assistance and technology transfer; development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management; and trade and environment. The IPF/IFF processes resulted in a set of 270 proposals for action for the promotion of the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests. In 2000, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) established the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) with the main objective to promote ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests and to strengthen long-term political commitment to this end‚Ä¶‚Äù based on the Rio Declaration, the Forest Principles, Chapter 11 of Agenda 21 and the outcome of the IPF/IFF Processes and other key milestones of international forest policy... Principal functions * To facilitate implementation of forest-related agreements and foster a common understanding on sustainable forest management; * To provide for continued policy development and dialogue among Governments, international organizations, including major groups, as identified in Agenda 21 as well as to address forest issues and emerging areas of concern in a holistic, comprehensive and integrated manner, * To enhance cooperation as well as policy and programme coordination on forest-related issues * To foster international cooperation and * To monitor, assess and report on progress of the above functions and objectives * To strengthen political commitment to the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests. Global objectives on forests In 2006, at its sixth session, UNFF agreed on four shared Global Objectives on Forests which seek to: * Reverse the loss of forest cover worldwide through sustainable forest management (SFM), including protection, restoration, afforestation and reforestation, and increase efforts to prevent forest degradation; * Enhance forest-based economic, social and environmental benefits, including by improving the livelihoods of forest-dependent people; * Increase significantly the area of sustainably managed forests, including protected forests, and increase the proportion of forest products derived from sustainably managed forests; and * Reverse the decline in official development assistance for sustainable forest management and mobilize significantly increased new and additional financial resources from all sources for the implementation of sustainable forest management.  United Nations Forest Instrument  On December 17, 2007, the UN General Assembly adopted the Non- Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests negotiated by the UNFF earlier that year. The purpose of this instrument is: * To strengthen political commitment and action at all levels to implement effectively sustainable management of all types of forests and to achieve the shared global objectives on forests; * To enhance the contribution of forests to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, in particular with respect to poverty eradication and environmental sustainability; * To provide a framework for national action and international cooperation; On December 22, 2015, the UN General Assembly renamed the instrument to the United Nations Forest Instrument though the content of the instrument did not change. The UN General Assembly also extended the objectives outlined in the global objectives to 2030, in line with the 2030 Agenda For Sustainable Development. https://documents-dds- ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N15/450/10/PDF/N1545010.pdf?OpenElement Collaborative Partnership on Forests The Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF), a grouping of 14 forest-related international organizations, institutions and convention secretariats, was established in April 2001, following the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The CPF works to support the work of the UNFF and its member countries and to foster increased cooperation and coordination on forests. Member organizations of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests include: * The Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) is an international forestry research organization established by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). It works through research partnerships as a 'centre without walls', taking a holistic, inter- disciplinary approach to solving general or widespread forest-related problems with the aim of contributing to the sustained well-being of people in developing countries, particularly in the tropics. * The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) helps developing countries and countries in transition modernise and improve their agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The Forestry Department champions a broad vision of sustainable forest management through policy advice, forest assessments and technical support to governments while fostering partnerships with civil society and industry in the implementation of national forest programmes. * The International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) promotes the conservation and sustainable management, use and trade of tropical forest resources. It develops internationally agreed policies and assists tropical member countries to adapt such policies to local circumstances and to implement them in the field through projects. As of 2009, it has supported more than 900 projects and activities with US$330 million in funding. * The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is a conservation network of states, government agencies, nongovernment organisations, scientists and experts. The goal of IUCN's Forest Conservation Programme is to enhance and optimise the contribution of forests and trees to rural poverty reduction, the long-term and equitable conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable supply of forest-related goods and services. * The International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) is a not-for-profit, nongovernmental international network of forest scientists. It promotes global cooperation in forest-related research and enhances the understanding of the ecological, economic and social aspects of forests and trees. It disseminates scientific knowledge to stakeholders and decision makers and contributes to forest policy and on-the-ground forest management. * The Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD Secretariat) supports the implementation of the convention, which has three goals: conservation of biodiversity, sustainable use of its components, and sharing the benefits from the use of genetic resources in a fair and equitable way. The CBD addresses forest issues directly through its expanded programme of work on forest biological diversity, with the ecosystem approach as the primary framework for action, and through its other thematic programmes of work and work on cross-cutting issues, including on traditional knowledge and protected areas. * The Secretariat of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) provides grants to developing countries for projects and programmes that benefit the global environment and promote sustainable livelihoods in local communities. As a financial mechanism for the three environmental conventions dealing with forests (UNFCCC, CBD and UNCCD), the GEF has been funding activities in the field of sustainable forest management since its inception in 1991. Of the GEF's six focal areas, biodiversity, climate change and land degradation are particularly relevant to forests. * The Secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification works with member countries to implement the UNCCD. This convention is the only international, legally binding framework set up to address desertification and is based on the principles of participation, partnership and decentralisation. The UNCCD focuses on improving land productivity, rehabilitating land, and the conservation and sustainable management of land and water resources. * The United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) Secretariat provides support to the international policy dialogue on sustainable forest management. The Secretariat works with a wide range of international organizations and stakeholders to facilitate cooperation and coordination on global forest issues. It serves as the focal point on all forest-related issues for the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and also serves as the secretariat for the Collaborative Partnership on Forests. * The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides the basis for concerted international action to mitigate climate change and to adapt to its impacts. The UNFCCC Secretariat supports all institutions involved in the climate change process, particularly the Conference of the Parties. Among other things, the Secretariat is responsible for the publication, compilation and technical review of annual greenhouse gas inventories by Kyoto Protocol Annex I parties, including in the land use, land-use change, and forestry sector, and the consideration of policy approaches and positive incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation in developing countries. * The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the UN's global development network, an organisation advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life. It operates on the ground in 166 countries. UNDP is an implementing agency for the Global Environment Facility. * The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the voice for the environment in the UN system. UNEP's mission is to provide leadership and encourage partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing and enabling nations and people to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations. UNEP is an implementing agency for the Global Environment Facility. * The World Agroforestry Centre, based in Nairobi, Kenya, is the world‚Äôs leading research institution on the diverse roles trees play in agricultural landscapes and rural livelihoods. As part of our work to bring tree-based solutions to bear on poverty and environmental problems, centre researchers, working in close collaboration with national partners, have developed new technologies, tools and policy recommendations for increased food security and ecosystem health. * The World Bank's mission is to reduce global poverty and improve living standards. Its forest strategy is built on three equally important and interlinked pillars: harnessing the potential of forests to reduce poverty, integrating forests into sustainable economic development and protecting global forest values. The World Bank is an implementing agency for the Global Environment Facility. =Wangari Maathai Forest Champion Award= In 2012, the Collaborative Partnership on Forests launched the Wangari Maathai Forest Champion Award to honour the life and work of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai.

Although it is not a temple (Wat), the park may be referred to as Wat Xieng Khuan (Lao: ‡∫ß‡∫±‡∫î‡∫ä‡∫Ω‡∫á‡∫Ñ‡∫ß‡∫ô;), since it contains numerous religious images. The name Xieng Khuan means Spirit City. The park contains over 200 Hindu and Buddhist statues. The socialist government operates Buddha Park as a tourist attraction and public park. Overview The top of the \`pumpkin' tower in Buddha Park, seen through the trees from the Thai side of Mekong. The park was started in 1958 by Luang Pu (Venerable Grandfather) Bunleua Sulilat. Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat was a priest-shaman who integrated Hinduism and Buddhism. His unique perspective was influenced by a Hindu rishi under whom he studied in Vietnam. After the revolution in 1975, anxious about the repercussions of the rule of Pathet Lao, he fled from Laos to Thailand where he built another sculpture park, Sala Keoku in Nong Khai. Both parks are located right next to the Thai-Lao border (Mekong river), only a few kilometers apart from each other, and the tallest structures of the Buddha Park can actually be seen from the Thai side of Mekong. The statues are made of reinforced concrete and are ornate, and sometimes bizarre, in design. The statues appear to be centuries old, though they are not. There are sculptures of humans, gods, animals, and demons. There are numerous sculptures of Buddha, characters of Buddhist beliefs like Avalokite≈õvara, and characters of Hindu lore, including Shiva, Vishnu, and Arjuna. These sculptures were presumably cast by unskilled workers under the supervision of Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat. One notable sculpture resembles a giant pumpkin. It has three stories representing three levels - Hell, Earth and Heaven. Visitors can enter through an opening which is a mouth of a and climb staircases from hell to heaven. Each story contains sculptures depicting the level. At the top, there is a vantage point where the entire park is visible. Another sculpture, an enormous reclining Buddha, is also a park attraction.

Distribution This species can be found from the Red Sea to South Africa and east to southern Japan, the Philippines, Australia and New Caledonia. Also found around the Galapagos Islands and in the Mediterranean.WoRMS Habitat The Spotbase burrfish is found in coastal waters near and around reefs at depths of 3m ‚Äì 90m. It lives in seagrass habitats and coastal slopes with sponges. It is usually found under rock or coral ledges during the day and is active during the night, generally being solitary in nature. Juveniles are pelagic. Description Cyclichthys spilostylus can reach a length of 34 cm. These fishes have short, rigid spines over the body. They have 11-13 dorsal soft rays and 10-12 anal soft rays. The colouration of the body is dusky above and light below, the spines arising from contrasting spots (lighter above and darker below). Fins are unspotted and caudal peduncle lack of spines.

The original version (sometimes referred to as RMON1) focused on OSI Layer 1 and Layer 2 information in Ethernet and Token Ring networks. It has been extended by RMON2 which adds support for Network- and Application-layer monitoring and by SMON which adds support for switched networks. It is an industry standard specification that provides much of the functionality offered by proprietary network analyzers. RMON agents are built into many high-end switches and routers.  Overview  Remote Monitoring (RMON) is a standard monitoring specification that enables various network monitors and console systems to exchange network-monitoring data. RMON provides network administrators with more freedom in selecting network-monitoring probes and consoles with features that meet their particular networking needs. An RMON implementation typically operates in a client/server model. Monitoring devices (commonly called \\"probes\\" in this context) contain RMON software agents that collect information and analyze packets. These probes act as servers and the Network Management applications that communicate with them act as clients. While both agent configuration and data collection use SNMP, RMON is designed to operate differently than other SNMP-based systems: * Probes have more responsibility for data collection and processing, which reduces SNMP traffic and the processing load of the clients. * Information is only transmitted to the management application when required, instead of continuous polling and monitoring In short, RMON is designed for \\"flow-based\\" monitoring, while SNMP is often used for \\"device-based\\" management. RMON is similar to other flow-based monitoring technologies such as NetFlow and SFlow because the data collected deals mainly with traffic patterns rather than the status of individual devices. One disadvantage of this system is that remote devices shoulder more of the management burden, and require more resources to do so. Some devices balance this trade-off by implementing only a subset of the RMON MIB groups (see below). A minimal RMON agent implementation could support only statistics, history, alarm, and event. The RMON1 MIB consists of ten groups: # Statistics: real-time LAN statistics e.g. utilization, collisions, CRC errors # History: history of selected statistics # Alarm: definitions for RMON SNMP traps to be sent when statistics exceed defined thresholds # Hosts: host specific LAN statistics e.g. bytes sent/received, frames sent/received # Hosts top N: record of N most active connections over a given time period # Matrix: the sent-received traffic matrix between systems # Filter: defines packet data patterns of interest e.g. MAC address or TCP port # Capture: collect and forward packets matching the Filter # Event: send alerts (SNMP traps) for the Alarm group # Token Ring: extensions specific to Token Ring The RMON2 MIB adds ten more groups: # Protocol Directory: list of protocols the probe can monitor # Protocol Distribution: traffic statistics for each protocol # Address Map: maps network-layer (IP) to MAC-layer addresses # Network-Layer Host: layer 3 traffic statistics, per each host # Network-Layer Matrix: layer 3 traffic statistics, per source/destination pairs of hosts # Application-Layer Host: traffic statistics by application protocol, per host # Application-Layer Matrix: traffic statistics by application protocol, per source/destination pairs of hosts # User History: periodic samples of user-specified variables # Probe Configuration: remote configure of probes # RMON Conformance: requirements for RMON2 MIB conformance  Important RFCs  * RMON1: RFC 2819 - Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base * RMON2: RFC 4502 - Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base Version 2 using SMIv2 * HCRMON: RFC 3273 - Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base for High Capacity Networks * SMON: RFC 2613 - Remote Network Monitoring MIB Extensions for Switched Networks * Overview: RFC 3577 - Introduction to the RMON Family of MIB Modules  See also  * Network performance management * Network tap  External links  * RMON: Remote Monitoring MIBs * RAMON: open- source implementation of a RMON2 agent Category:Network management ","title":"RMON"},{"id":"11839695","text":"Chicken meal is the dry rendered product from a combination of clean chicken flesh and skin with or without accompanying bone, derived from whole carcasses of chicken, exclusive of feathers, heads, feet and entrails.Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) Meal here is used in the sense of \\"an ingredient which has been ground or otherwise reduced in particle size.\\" It is mainly used in pet foods. Chicken meal is ground up chicken meat that has been carefully dried to a moisture level of 10%. The protein content is 65% and the fat level is 12%. Regular chicken contains about 70% water with 18% protein and 5% fat. To create chicken meal, ingredients are placed into large vats and cooked.http://en.engormix.com/MA-feed-machinery/formulation/articles/usa- poultry-meal-quality-t431/p0.htm This rendering process not only separates fat and removes water to create a concentrated protein product, it also kills bacteria, viruses, parasites and other organisms. Because meat can be rid of infectious agents through the rendering process, ‚Äú4D‚Äù animals (dead, dying, diseased or disabled) are allowable chicken meal ingredients. While not always present, the possible inclusion of these ingredients makes chicken meal always considered unfit for human consumption.http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/65791 Pet Food Chicken meal is mainly used in pet foods. Its protein content is much higher than regular chicken because most of the water has been removed. Typically when it comes to pet food, all of the ingredients (meats, grains, vitamins, minerals) are mixed together and put through a machine called an extruder. The extruder cooks the mixture by adding steam and water. The result is the familiar kibble coming out of the extruder and it is subsequently dried. Fat is added after drying. (This is the same process for making many breakfast cereals.) The final pet product has a moisture level of around 10%. The processing of chicken meat along with the other ingredients essentially is converting it to chicken meal. However, there are some characteristics of regular chicken meat that make it less flexible for use as an ingredient compared to chicken meal. The high moisture content of chicken limits the amount that can be formulated into a complete finished food. Chicken is generally stored frozen to minimize microbial growth. The frozen chicken is thawed and made into slurry before adding to the mix. Chicken meal, however, can be used in a finished food at levels much greater than chicken meat. Chicken meal in a finished food provides roughly 4 to 5 times the nutrients as the same weight of chicken meat because of the differences in moisture. A pet food made of chicken meat may therefore have only 20% of the chicken in the final product, providing only 3.6% protein. An equivalent proportion of chicken meal would provide 13% protein. (For example, 100 lbs of chicken meal provides 65 lbs of protein while 100 lbs of chicken provides only 18 lbs of protein.)

Despite several changes of government, and after a somewhat contentious selection process starting on 17 March 1977, the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet was selected as the winner of the NFA project on 10 April 1980. Designated, the CF-18 Hornet by Canadian Forces Air Command (now called the Royal Canadian Air Force), a total of 138 aircraft were delivered between 1982 and 1988. History =Background= Air resources within the Canadian Forces had suffered from a long period of neglect and downsizing during the late 1960s and early 1970s that led to the aging of much of their military equipment. In the early 1970s the government came under increasing pressure from its NATO allies to redress this imbalance. This period came to an end in November 1975 after the governing Liberal Party of Canada's tenth National Convention saw a policy reversing defence budget cutbacks in the early 1970s and the beginning of a modernization process across the entire Canadian Forces structure; this followed a decision in September 1975 that saw all air resources within the Canadian Forces merged into a new entity called Air Command (AIRCOM).Michael Tucker, \\"Canadian Foreign Policy: Contemporary Issues and Themes\\", McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 1980, pp. 155-163, As there had been little military capital expenditure over the prior five years, modernizing the forces would be an expensive process. In order to lower fiscal spending for the ambitious program, a series of individual procurement projects were proposed to be spread out over the five- year period from 1977 to 1982. During the 1970s, the Canadian Forces was tasked with four primary military duties; air defence of North America as part of NORAD, anti-submarine and related duties in the North Atlantic as part of NATO, a small role within the overall land-force structure of NATO in Western Europe, and the specialist role of reinforcing Norway with one brigade and all required air, sea and other support that might be needed for that mission (collectively known as \\"CAST\\").Nigel Thomas and Ron Volstad, \\"NATO Armies Today\\", Osprey Publishing, 1988, pp. 9-10, With the exception of air transport, equipment for all of these tasks was deemed to be lacking. Six procurement projects became the initial focus of the late 1970s upgrade process. For Maritime Command (MARCOM) a new \\"Long Range Patrol Aircraft Project\\" (LRPA) would dramatically increase their anti-submarine capabilities, while a new \\"Patrol Frigate Project\\" would supplement the recently procured and extremely capable . Force Mobile Command needed a new main battle tank to replace the outdated Centurion as well as new command and logistics vehicles. Force Mobile Command also identified the need for a new tactical ground attack aircraft to support Canada's ground forces in Western Europe, while the newly created Air Command needed a new aircraft to replace their somewhat motley collection of increasingly dated fighter and interceptor aircraft. Inter- service priorities were quickly decided. First up was the Long Range Patrol Aircraft Project (LRPA), eventually filled by the Lockheed CP-140 Aurora, a modified version of the P-3 Orion. Problems that arose during the LRPA project were particularly worrying for the other procurement initiatives. The LRPA project had initially settled on the Orion in November 1975, however, the project was cancelled in May 1976, before being re-instated at a later date. In 1978 the Minister of Supply and Services, Jean-Pierre Goyer, stated that he had been deliberately misled on the topic, a claim that led to a slander lawsuit.Kenneth Kernaghan, \\"Power, Parliament and Public Servants in Canada: Ministerial Responsibility Reexamined\\", Canadian Public Policy, Vol 5 Issue 3 (Summer 1979), pp. 388-389 A breakdown in communications between the various departments led to the budget request being $300 million smaller than was needed in startup costs, delaying service entry. Adding to the LRPA project's woes, the procurement procedure resulted in the addition of various \\"required features\\" that led to the aircraft's sensor suite being modified at considerable expense, a problem known in military circles as \\"gold plating\\". =NFA= The need for a new high-performance fighter was next on the list of priorities for the government's Department of National Defence (DND). With the problems in the LRPA project still ongoing, it was imperative that the NFA project avoid these issues at all costs. There was serious concern that the DND would be considered incapable of handling its newly increased budget if problems resulting from the LRPA project continued. In this case, they might be stripped of their direction over the purchasing process, or at least face a shake up within the ranks. Immediately following the NFA project would be the new Canadian Patrol Frigate Project (CPF), and if the NFA project ran into the same sorts of problems as the LRPA project, the CPF project would likely suffer from budgetary constraints, downsizing, or potential cancellation.Michael Atkinson and Kim Richard Nossal, \\"Bureaucratic politics and the new fighter aircraft decisions\\", Canadian Public Administration, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Winter 1981), pp. 531-558 In order to avoid these possibilities, DND put into place a number of new policies for the NFA project aimed at ensuring the established budget would be followed. For one, the NFA project demanded that whatever aircraft was selected would have to be completely \\"off the shelf\\", in order to avoid \\"gold plating\\" problems that had driven up the price of the LRPA. Additionally, the NFA project would request a budget that included all costs; training, spares, even the 12% import taxes that would have to be paid to the federal Department of Finance and any similar fees that might have to be paid to the foreign government to offset research and development they had spent on the program. Finally, a NFA project office was set up to ensure that all three stakeholders would have their requirements fairly presented in the procurement. Under the LRPA project the various departments responsible for coordinating military procurement reported to DND, however, under the NFA project they all co-managed a new NFA Project Office (NFA/PO). This ensured that the technical requirements of the DND would not override the budgetary ones of the federal Department of Supply and Services (DSS), nor the industrial benefits package required by the federal Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce (DITC). All three proposed aircraft considered for the NFA project would be considered peers, and the NFA project staff's work would be overseen by a group of deputy ministers and senior bureaucrats from the federal Department of External Affairs, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and the Privy Council Office.Mason, \\"Managing the NFA Program\\", p. 9 =Selection process= The CF-101 Voodoo was Canada's primary air defense platform, but was aging and needed to be replaced. The Freedom Fighter was new and inexpensive, but had very limited air-to-air capability, especially at night. The existing AIRCOM fleet consisted of the CF-101 Voodoo as the primary all-weather interceptor for duties within the NORAD framework, the CF-104 Starfighter as the primary day fighter and tactical attack aircraft in Europe, and the CF-116 Freedom Fighter supplementing both in multiple roles. By the late 1970s the Voodoo was considered outdated and growing increasingly expensive to operate and maintain, given its tube-based electronics. None of its primary systems - missiles, radar or engines - were still being used in other operational aircraft in the Canadian Forces or its allies, and spares had to be taken from mothballed units. The CF-104 Starfighter was originally the day counterpart to the CF-101 Voodoo and it had also served a nuclear- strike role when that was the basis for most military thinking in NATO. Since 1971 the nuclear weapons role of the Canadian Forces had been abandoned, and since then the CF-104 Starfighter saw its mission switched primarily to a low- level strike role that it was not particularly well suited to. The CF-116 Freedom Fighter was considerably more modern, but was a much simpler aircraft that was useful primarily in a supporting light strike role. The goal of the NFA project was to select a single multi-purpose aircraft that could fill all of the roles of the existing fleet, while also reducing operational costs and improving availability and capability. In the fifteen years since the CF-104s had been procured, there had been significant advancements in engines, aerodynamics and especially mission electronics to permit all of these roles to be combined in a single multi-role aircraft. A number of such designs were in the process of being introduced by air forces around the world. Of particular interest was the recent Lightweight Fighter (LWF) project in the United States that had produced the F-16 Fighting Falcon for the United States Air Force (USAF), an aircraft of such versatility that it had rapidly generated orders from other air forces around the world in what American public broadcaster PBS described as \\"The Sale of the Century.\\"\\"F-16: The Arms Sale of the Century\\", PBS, 1979 In September 1977 the NFA project office published a four-volume Request For Proposals (RFP), each volume outlining one area of interest. These included the technical specifications, risk mitigation, costs, the industrial benefit program and contractual obligations. In a subsequent decision, the NFA project budget was limited to around $2.34 billion [CAD] to procure between 130 and 150 aircraft, ideally as many as possible within the budget. This represented a decrease in fleet numbers; there were 66 CF-101 Voodoo and 200 CF-104 Starfighter aircraft being replaced by less than half that number of NFA aircraft. Cabinet officially approved the NFA budget on 27 November 1977. The RFP was sent to six companies who had aircraft that might fit the requirements; the Grumman Aerospace Corporation's F-14 Tomcat, McDonnell Douglas Corporation's F-15 Eagle and F/A-18, Northrop Corporation's F-18L (a Northrop-only stripped down version of the joint Northrop and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18), General Dynamic Corporation's F-16, Dassault-Breguet's Mirage F1 and the Panavia Tornado. The NFA project quickly eliminated the F-14, F-15, and the Tornado due to the high purchase prices. The Mirage F1 was withdrawn as it could not compete with the others in performance terms, however, Dassault-Breguet proposed the Mirage 2000 in its place. This proposal was not received by the February 1, 1978 cut-off date imposed by the NFA project, thus in 1978, the NFA project short listed just three aircraft; the F-16, the F-18L and the F/A-18. =A contender is eliminated= The original LWF contenders, a YF-16 flies beside a YF-17. The F/A-18 had started life as the Northrop F-17 Cobra, a direct competitor to the F-16 during the LWF competition.Baugher, Joe. \\"Origin of McDonnell Douglas F-18 Hornet\\", April 2000 When the United States Navy expressed an interest in a new multi-role fighter jet under their VFAX project, the United States Congress instead cancelled VFAX and demanded that the U.S. Navy use one of the LWF aircraft under a new program called the \\"Navy Air Combat Fighter Project\\" (NACF). Accordingly, the U.S. Navy asked for proposals for versions of the two aircraft with various carrier-based features, including arrestor hooks, catapult bars, folding wings and dramatically strengthened landing gear and fuselage. Another requirement was that the entries would have to be built by companies with recent naval aircraft experience, however, neither General Dynamics nor Northrop had built a carrier aircraft for some time. Both partnered with other companies for the modified design; General Dynamics with Ling-Temco-Vought for what would be termed the F-16N, and Northrop with McDonnell Douglas for what would become the F/A-18. Among the many features that fighter jets used by the U.S. Navy for carrier operations required was the ability to quickly \\"spool up\\" their engines to full power. Should the aircraft miss the arrestor wires as it attempts to land on a carrier, there is no way that it can stop in time and must immediately add power for a go- around. This is not a minor concern; it occurs so commonly that such a landing has its own name, a \\"bolter\\". Generally speaking, the rate that an engine can be spooled up is roughly a function of its cross-sectional size, so an otherwise identical aircraft mounting two smaller engines instead of one larger one will typically have much better throttle response. For this reason, among others, the U.S. Navy favored the two-engine layout of the F-18 from the start, and selected it as the winner of NACF project in 1976. When the two companies joined forces for the F/A-18, part of the agreement was that Northrop would develop a land-based version of the F/A-18 that removed the naval equipment and lightened the airframe. The resulting F-18L was about 30% lighter than the F/A-18A, about take-off weight as opposed to and as a result had considerably better performance and range.Lynn Norman, \\"F-18L: Kampfflugzeug f√ºr die Luftwaffe?\\", Flug Review, 27 March 1978 The aircraft was over 80% similar otherwise, and would be built on the same production lines. Naval versions (the F/A-18 Hornet) would be built 60% by McDonnell and 40% by Northrop, while the land versions would reverse this arrangement. Like the U.S. Navy, the upper upper echelons of the Canadian Forces Air Command (AIRCOM) also favoured having an aircraft with two engines, although for different reasons. Additionally, AIRCOM was adamant about having the ability to fire the medium-range AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile.\\"Canada gets tough on NFA offsets\\", Flight International, 29 September 1979, p. 1028. Neither the F-16 Falcon nor the YF-17 Cobra supported the Sparrow, in keeping with the short-range \\"dogfighter\\" role as originally envisioned. The U.S. Navy had also demanded support for the Sparrow, as they were less interested in fighter-to- fighter combat as they were in long-range interception of both aircraft and anti-shipping missiles. Both aircraft in the LWF project studied supporting longer-range radar as part of their naval modifications, but as the F-16 modification never proceeded beyond the mockup stage, only the F/A-18 actually added AIM-7 support. This put the two F-18 variants in the lead from the start. From a strict technical point of view the F-18L (the Northrop version) was the better aircraft for the NFA project, with performance roughly equal to the F-16, Sparrow capability, and the twin-engine design that the Canadian Forces favored. Compared to the F/A-18A (the McDonnel-Douglas version), its lower weight and resulting better range would also be very useful in the air defence role over Canada. The F-18L was also offered with a lucrative industrial program; Northrop agreed to move major portions of the F-18L project to Canada, including investing in carbon composite construction techniques to build the wings and tail sections. If accepted, Canada would become the primary construction site for all of these components, which meant that any additional orders for the F-18L from other countries would result in major export contracts for Canadian companies. Unsurprisingly, the federal Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce (DITC) strongly favored the F-18L offer for the industrial benefits to the Canadian economy. However, contrary to the original conception of the NFA project office, DITC had only two full- time staff in the office compared to dozens from the Department of National Defence (DND) and the Department of Supply and Services (DSS). Both of the other groups expressed concerns about the offer. As there appeared to be no orders from the United States for the F-18L variant, any production run would be based on the Canadian procurement and any potential exports. Several other countries had expressed a similar interest in the F-18L, notably Greece, Turkey, Spain and Australia, but none of these were a \\"sure thing.\\" If these deals did not go through, Canada would be the only operator of the aircraft, something DND considered completely unacceptable. Likewise, DSS's primary interest was iron-clad contracts with predictable delivery time frames and budgets, and strongly supported the \\"off the shelf\\" requirement. Therefore, in October 1978 the NFA project office overrode DITC's concerns and reduced the list to only the F-16 and the F/A-18A, a decision that the federal cabinet accepted on 23 November 1978. At the time there was some talk of going ahead with the F-18L based on the potential Canadian order alone. Several other air forces were in the process of looking at similar aircraft, and the upgrades carried out during the conversion from the F-17 to the F/A-18 made the F-18L a much more worthy competitor to the F-16 in the export market. However, Northrop found themselves constantly being outmaneuvered by the McDonnell Douglas sales team who would make counteroffers whenever the F-18L was proposed for foreign sales.Joe Baugher, \\"Northrop F-18L\\", April 2000 This eventually led to a lawsuit between the companies, which was settled in 1985 with McDonnell Douglas agreeing to pay Northrop $50 million for complete rights to the design without admitting wrongdoing. By then Northrop had ended work on F-18L. =Selecting the winner= With the elimination of the F-18L on November 23, 1978 the NFA project moved into its final phase. In order to expedite the eventual order, the NFA project office started negotiating contracts with both companies with the understanding that one would be selected once a final decision had been made. This led to intensive investigations of the industrial offset programs. General Dynamics was somewhat limited in their offers due to similar arrangements made with European countries, which stated that 15% of all aircraft delivered to 3rd party countries, including Canada, would have to be built in Europe. This would not be insurmountable, but definitely presented some problems in negotiations. Douglas (prior to the formation of McDonnell Douglas) had been building tail assemblies for the DC-9 at the former Avro Canada factories at the Toronto International Airport for some time. Their industrial offset program would include modernizing these plants and moving in additional work to include wings for the KC-10 and MD-11, wings, empennage and cabin floors for the MD-80, as well as side panels and pylons for the F/A-18.Mike Lombardi and Larry Merritt, \\"Toronto's long history of aerospace achievement\\", Boeing Frontiers, Vol. 04, Issue 2 (June 2005) This proposal was greatly worrying to the DITC, and they became much more active in the negotiations. Their concern was based on existing Defence Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) between the United States and Canada that was put in place to balance the amount of trade in military goods between the countries. A major procurement like the NFA meant the United States either had to purchase a similar amount of military equipment from Canada, or alternately offset the purchase though military production in Canada. A program like Northop's F-18L was purely military in nature, so any production in Canada would be counted against this balance, but the McDonnell Douglas offer was mostly in civilian goods, which had to be accounted separately. McDonnell was adamant that their DC-9 and DC-10 work be counted against the balance, an attitude the Canadians described as \\"insistent\\". The DITC was concerned that the U.S. government would have to be persuaded to re-negotiate the agreement in this case, or make a large military purchase. Neither option seemed straightforward, and would have placed a burden on the DITC's dealings in the future. While the negotiations with McDonnell Douglas were continuing, Air Canada announced it was purchasing the Lockheed L-1011 to add to its wide-body fleet. This greatly angered James Smith McDonnell, the Chief Executive Officer of McDonnell Douglas, who personally threatened to cancel his company's participation in the NFA project. Neither DND and DSS wanted this to happen, and wanted both the F-16 and F/A-18 aircraft to remain in contention for the NFA project. However, these concerns were later muted when a report was leaked that suggested the F/A-18 was favoured to win the NFA project, and it appeared that the DITC's concerns were going to be overridden. As a result, McDonnell Douglas became much less vocal about the Air Canada purchase. Contract negotiations went on throughout 1978 and 1979, continuing through two federal elections. The proposed contracts were finalized by June, when then new Progressive Conservative Party of Canada formed a minority government. A lengthy review of the contracts followed, and was completed in early December. These were tabled to be signed off on December 14, however, on the 13th the Progressive Conservative government failed a vote of non-confidence and the NFA project was set aside. The Liberal Party of Canada was elected to a majority government in the ensuing elections, and on February 19, 1980 formal negotiations for the NFA project started again. Rumours that the F/A-18 was the winner had surfaced by this point, and General Dynamics started a campaign to have the selection discarded. As part of their industrial program, the Pratt & Whitney F100 engines used in the F-16 would be built at Pratt & Whitney Canada in Quebec, which would have been a major windfall for that province. In late March Ren√© L√©vesque of the governing Parti Qu√©b√©cois publicly announced that the F-16 should be selected because it would provide Quebec with considerably more than the competing McDonnell Douglas offer. This led to a meeting between several interested parties in the federal government on April 9, 1980 and after transferring several million dollars from federal projects in Ontario to Quebec the objections disappeared. Among these, General Electric agreed to open a plant in Quebec that would produce turbine fan blades for commercial engines.\\"Canada gets relief from F-18 R&D; costs\\", Flight International\\", 10 January 1981, p. 56 The following day (April 10, 1980) the F/A-18 Hornet was officially announced as the winner of the NFA project. On 16 April the procurement contracts were signed, with a ceiling of $2.369 billion (USD) for 137 aircraft, and an industrial package of C$2.453 billion to be invested by McDonnell Douglas in Canada over a period ending in 1995. =Aftermath= The next day (April 11, 1980) the federal government ran a series of advertisements in national newspapers to explain their choice for the NFA project. The arguments focused primarily on the financial aspects of the deal. Despite the higher unit cost of the F/A-18 Hornet, the industrial program would more than pay for the entire program. Reasons for the selection listed by the Canadian Forces included two engines for reliability (considered essential for conducting Arctic sovereignty and over-the-water patrols), an excellent radar set, and a lower cost than the F-14 or F-15. Nevertheless, the press was skeptical of the program, particularly its aircraft carrier-based design, even though Canada operated no aircraft carriers. As the CBC's As It Happens noted, the F/A-18 could not even fly from Toronto to Montreal without carrying extra fuel. In spite of outward appearances, the selection of the F/A-18 Hornet for the NFA project was not a \\"sure thing\\". The contract had been left open to the very last minute and continued to see changes even in the weeks immediately before the selection was announced. Additionally, the F-14 almost ended up being purchased from Iran, as their fleet was facing the prospect of falling into disuse due to a lack of spares in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution. Canadian diplomats tried to convince the Iranians to sell its fleet of eighty almost-new fighters at cut-rate prices. However, the negotiations fell through in the aftermath of the Canadian caper in which six American diplomats were smuggled out of Iran from the Canadian embassy. Several changes were made to the program in the following years. The government came under increasing criticism for replacing a large number of aircraft with a much smaller one, a number that would not allow the forces to provide both their NORAD role as well as their ground attack role in Europe. Over the next months a deal was worked out with the US government that dropped $70 million from the price of each aircraft's embedded R&D; costs, in exchange for the promise to buy additional aircraft to the same total cost. This raised the purchase to 137 aircraft, eight more than originally planned. The same deal also allowed the purchase of an additional 20 \\"attrition aircraft\\" without paying any R&D;, reducing the price by $880,000 per aircraft. A total of 138 aircraft, designated the CF-188 Hornet, were delivered to Canada from 1982 to 1988.Jenkins, Dennis R. F/A-18 Hornet: A Navy Success Story, McGraw- Hill, 2000. .

Founded in the 13th century, it has been the property of the Conventual Franciscan friars since then. The church has been raised to the rank of a Roman Catholic basilica by the Holy See. History The Franciscans had occupied a modest house in the city called Santa Maria delle Pugliole, founded in 1211 by Bernard of Quintavalle, one of the first members of the Order. Their noted founder, St. Francis of Assisi, visited the city in 1222 to preach to the people of the city, which sparked a great interest in the Order he had founded. At the urging of Pope Gregory IX, the authorities of the medieval commune gave the property on which the basilica is now built to the friars in 1236 for a church of their own. It was located in the area of the city known as civitas antiqua rupta (the old city ruins), where the remains of the Roman city of Bononia were located. Construction was begun and sufficiently complete by 1251 that it was consecrated by Pope Innocent IV. The main structure was finally completed in 1263. During the 18th century, the friary was a center of musical performance and study. A renowned girls choir sang at the services of the church, which was directed by Friar Giambattista Martini, O.F.M. Conv., a noted composer. Among his many students was another friar of the community, Stanislao Mattei, O.F.M. Conv. During the occupation of Italy by the French Revolutionary Army, in 1796 the church was desecrated and the friary was seized and used as a barracks by the occupying forces. The artworks of the church were seized and scattered. The church was restored to religious use in 1842, but was later seized again in the course of the Second Italian War of Independence and used as a military storehouse. It was finally returned to the Franciscans in 1886. The restoration of the church to its original aspect was carried out under the supervision of Alfonso Rubbiani, an expert in restoration, and were completed in 1919. Architecture The architect is not known. Early sources gave Friar Mateo of Brescia as having designed the church. This seems to have been a confusion with Giovanni of Brescia, a leading architect of the period. The 14th-century chronicler of the friary, Bartolomeo of Pugliole, recorded that, when the vault of the apse collapsed in 1254, the restoration work was supervised by one Friar Andrea Maestro della Ghiexia, who is described as \\"of the twisted legs\\". Despite its Romanesque facade, it is one of the best examples of French Gothic architecture in Italy. This is manifest in the interior, which has a nave and two aisles, in the apse with corridor, in the high vaults divided into six sections (like in Notre-Dame de Paris) with ogival arches, and in the use of buttresses. The church is home to the church monuments of the jurist Accursius and his son Francesco, Odofredus and Rolandino dei Romanzi.

The manuscripts that were used to reconstruct 4QMMT were found in Cave 4 at Qumran between the years 1953 and 1959. They were kept at the Palestinian Archaeological Museum, now known as the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. The sigla \\"4QMMT\\" designates manuscripts found in Cave 4 at Qumran, so the manuscripts are designated \\"4Qxxx\\" The \\"MMT\\" is the title of the document as provided by its editors. The document was provisionally designated \\"4QMishnique\\" (Mishnah) by J. T. Milik. The designation at final publication was \\"4QMMT\\" (Miqsat Ma‚Äôase ha-Torah, Hebrew for \\"Some Precepts of the Torah\\" or \\"Some Rulings Pertaining to the Torah\\"). The two primary scholars who identified, reconstructed, and published 4QMMT are John Strugnell and Elisha Qimron, the official editors of these manuscripts.  The Manuscripts of 4QMMT  = The Reconstructed Composite Text = 4QMMT is a reconstructed composite text from fragments of six separate manuscripts discovered in Cave 4 of Qumran. The six fragmented manuscripts are designated 4Q394, 4Q395, 4Q396, 4Q397, 4Q398, and 4Q399. Five of the manuscripts were written and preserved on parchment (4Q394, 4Q395, 4Q396, 4Q397, and 4Q399); and one was written on papyri (4Q398). All of these six manuscripts are also fragmented (e.g., 4Q397, the most fragmented of these scrolls consists of 68 small fragments). These manuscripts are also separately designated as 4QMMTa-f with 4QMMTa designating manuscript 4Q394, and continuing in series concluding with 4QMMTf designating manuscript 4Q399. = Dating the Original Composition = Qimron and Strugnell date the original composition of 4QMMT at c.150 BCE. This early date is proposed based on an evaluation of its content. The congenial tone of the letter from the author to the recipients suggests a composition of the text to a time either before or contemporaneous with the earliest organizational stages of the Qumran community.Elisha Qimron, John Strugnell, et al., Qumran Cave 4.V: Miq·π£at Ma øa≈õeh Ha-Torah, DJD 10 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994), 121. From other texts discovered at Qumran and associated with the Qumran community, scholars believe the Yahad (the Qumran community) had a more hostile attitude to the religious leaders at the Jerusalem Temple and that they were prohibited from corresponding with the Jerusalem leaders. Lawrence Schiffman dates 4QMMT to c.152 BCE at a time when the Hasmoneans took over the high priesthood and began to follow temple practices identified as pharisaic by later sources. This text is a challenge to the leaders of the Jerusalem Temple regarding their understanding of these purity regulations identified as those of the Pharisees. Hanan Eshel dates the composition of 4QMMT to c.152 BCE, the beginning of the rise to power of Jonathan Maccabaeus.Eshel, ‚Äú4QMMT and the History of the Hasmonean Period,‚Äù 64. = Dating the Manuscripts = Although the original composition of the text is about 150 BCE, estimates of the dates of the copying of these particular six manuscripts range from 75 BCE to 50 CE. Palaeographic analysis of the manuscripts of 4QMMT was performed by Strugnell and Qimron, with Ada Yardeni, who analyzed manuscripts 4Q397 and 4Q398. They dated the manuscripts palaeographically to the early or mid-Herodian period.DJD X, 3-6; 14; 16-18; 21-25; 29-34; 38-39. Frank Moore Cross had given one of the 4QMMT manuscripts a late Hasmonean date. These dates place the texts between the early 1st century BCE and the late 1st century CE.  The Publication of 4QMMT  In 1959, John Strugnell was assigned the task of publishing the manuscripts that make up the text of 4QMMT. In 1979, Hebrew scholar Elisha Qimron joined him to assist in the publication of 4QMMT. The text was officially published in 1994, in the series Discoveries in the Judean Desert. The first public knowledge of the manuscripts of 4QMMT came in 1984 at the International Congress on Biblical Archaeology, a conference held in Jerusalem. Qimron informed the conference that he and Strugnell possessed and would publish what is now 4QMMT. The text was the subject of a legal dispute in the early 1990s when Qimron successfully sued Hershel Shanks of the Biblical Archaeology Society and others for a claim of copyright after they published his reconstruction of 4QMMT out of 70 fragments, without his permission.'Israeli Court Upholds Scholar's Rights to Dead Sea Scrolls Work', The New York Times, 31 August 2000  Content  = Authors and Recipients = The text appears to be sent from the leader of the Qumran community to the leaders of the priestly establishment in Jerusalem. When the general substance of this manuscript was first announced to the public, this text was understood to be a letter written by the founder of the Qumran community, the Teacher of Righteousness, to his opponent the Wicked Priest, in order to explain the reasons for the Qumran community's existence. The purpose of the letter was to spell out the differences between the two parties, the Qumran community and the authorities at the Jerusalem Temple, and to summon the leadership of the Jerusalem Temple to a stricter interpretation and application of certain laws. This announcement by Qimron was recognized as significant because it showed that important information about the Qumran community had not yet been published. = Genre = The genre of the text was initially identified by Strugnell and Qimron as a personal letter. The editors described the text as a letter by the leader of the Qumran community, possibly even by the Teacher of Righteousness, to the leader of its opponents, a high priest in Jerusalem.Elisha Qimron and John Strugnell, ‚ÄúAn Unpublished Halakhic Letter from Qumran,‚Äù in Biblical Archaeology Today: Proceedings of the International Congress on Biblical Archaeology, Jerusalem, April 1984 (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1985), 400‚Äì7. But both later rejected this view. = Structure of 4QMMT = 4QMMT is structured in three sections. Section A is the introduction or incipit, section B is the main body of the letter that contains a series of interpretations of Jewish law (Halakhah), and section C is the conclusion. 4QMMT A commences with a discussion of how to calculate the Jewish calendar 4QMMT B is the main body of the text with a discussion of Jewish laws. 4QMMT C is the conclusion of the letter. = Content of the Letter =  4QMMT A - Introduction  The content of section A includes a discussion of following moon phases and advocates for a Lunar Calendar for Sabbath and feast. The reconstructed text includes a discussion of how to calculate the calendar. And had the Babylonian style Lunar months in place of biblical months.  4QMMT B - Halakhah  The manuscript identifies twenty-two laws (Halakhah) that concern sacrificial laws, priestly gifts, ritual purity, and other matters. The text is a polemical argument setting forth the views of the Qumran leadership and calling on their opponents to accept their views. It presents twenty-two points of the Halakhah, the Jewish law, on which the Qumran community differs from the religious leaders of the Jerusalem Temple. These points of Halakhah generally oppose Pharisaic views and coincide with Sadducean positions. This led scholars to the conclusion that the community at Qumran were the Essenes who had withdrawn from Jerusalem about 150 BCE, following disagreements with the Sadducean Jewish authorities concerning religious practices and their understanding of the Halakhah.  4QMMT C - Conclusion  4QMMT C is the conclusion in which the author of the text, the leader of the Qumran community, encourages his addressees to modify their understanding Halakhah to conform to his view. The title of the document, MMT, comes from line C26 which uses the words, Miqsat Ma‚Äôase ha- Torah, Hebrew for \\"Some Precepts of the Torah.\\"  Interpretation  The majority view is that the Qumran community is to be identified with the Essenes. If this is correct, then 4QMMT helps scholars understand the issues that may have caused the separation of the Essene community who separated themselves from the Jerusalem Temple to Qumran. While part of 4QMMT seems to be addressed to priests at the Temple in Jerusalem, the third section is addressed to a respected individual, whose honesty and integrity are acknowledged by the author, encouraging him to study carefully 'the book of Moses and the books of the Prophets and David.' He also refers to the blessings and curses on the Israelite kings and asks the recipient to remember their actions, giving the impression that the recipient may himself be a Judaean monarch. Almost certainly a Hasmonean ruler is being addressed. There is no formal breach between the two, only disagreement, giving rise to the suspicion that 4QMMT may have been written at a time of dispute between the Qumran community and the Judaean political and religious establishment in Jerusalem, concerning Halakhah. Some scholars believe that this section is a letter from the Teacher of Righteousness to the Wicked Priest, believed by many to be Jonathan Apphus or his brother Simon. Other scholars have seen in 4QMMT evidence of having been written solely by the Sadducees, one of the major religious factions in Judea at that time. Since its publication in 1994, there has been much debate about whether 4QMMT really is a letter, and if so, from whom to whom; whether it is actually a Sadducean manuscript; and even whether the document has been properly reconstructed. Hanne von Weissenberg's book, 4QMMT: Reevaluating the text, the function, and the meaning of the epilogue, maintains that Qimron and Strugnell define the genre of 4QMMT as a letter, yet they want to clarify that this is perhaps more than just a letter, but perhaps a public letter or treaty with another community. According to Strugnell, the Halakhic Letter is neither a letter nor a treatise. He argues that the introduction to the letter does not resemble a letter at all, but suggests the introduction is a possible collection of laws, sent to a particular person. John Kampen and Moshe Bernstein support the idea of 4QMMT being a letter in their analysis of the document in their introduction of Reading 4QMMT. They maintain that Strugnell's argument that the document is a collection of laws is false, due to the argumentative tone it gives off. Instead they believe 4QMMT to be a text which deals with legal disputes among two parties. Furthermore, they advocate the idea that the document's epilogue and final sections blur the interpretations of the classification of 4QMMT's genre.

Failla's crew was based in Brooklyn, with operations stretching into Staten Island, Manhattan, and New Jersey. Early days Failla was raised in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, a neighborhood dominated by New York's La Cosa Nostra families. Failla eventually relocated to a modest home in Staten Island. In 1951, Failla was convicted of bookmaking and illegal gambling charges and paid a $25 fine. During the 1950s, Failla became close to Carlo Gambino, underboss to Albert Anastasia, boss of the Gambino family. Failla later served as Gambino's chauffeur/bodyguard. After the 1957 murder of Anastasia, the new boss Carlo Gambino appointed Failla as his point man in the waste-hauling industry. In 1966, Failla was again fined for bookmaking and illegal gambling. In 1970, Failla was charged with contempt of court for refusing to testify before a grand jury, but the charge was later dropped. By 1971, Failla had become a caporegime in the Gambino family. Man of power and caution Failla was one of the most respected and feared racketeers in New York, and one of the all-time top earners. A resident of Ocean Breeze, Staten Island, Failla's nickname \\"Jimmy Brown\\" derived from his fondness for brown clothes. Despite his power and wealth, Failla lived modestly. Law enforcement agents characterized Failla as being extremely cautious and constantly wary of electronic surveillance. Failla had a reputation as being one of the most discreet mobsters. During 1983, when the FBI was bugging Castellano's house, Failla was present for hundreds of hours of meetings. During that six-month period, Failla barely spoke ten words on all the tapes combined. To avoid electronic surveillance, Failla did not have a landline telephone in his social club in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. He did hang a poster on the wall showing a cockroach wearing a headset with the caption \\"Our bugs have ears\\".\\"He Runs Trash Hauling With Silence and Pastry\\" By SELWYN RAAB New York Times February 20, 1993 Failla's cautious habits allowed him to avoid criminal prosecution for many years. Failla directed a large crew that was involved in loansharking, illegal gambling, and extortion. This crew included made members Joseph \\"Joey Cigars\\" Francolino, Joseph \\"the Cat\\" LaForte, Anthony Vitta, Thomas \\"Tommy Sparrow\\" Spinelli, Louis Astuto, Nunzio Squillante, Philip Mazzara, and Angelo Paccione. Failla's closest confidant, an associate he met in grammar school as a child, Bill \\"Willy The Fox\\" Martoccia, could often be found at Failla's side. Failla and others in power both recognized and respected Martoccia for his negotiating prowess in facilitating the large majority of the family's legitimate waste hauling contracts. It was no secret that New York City's garbage hauling and long haul trucking was an industry largely under the power and control of Failla, and as such, Martoccia managed both the insurance underwriting and claim's adjusting of the family's garbage hauling and long haul trucking accounts. When in New York, Failla and Martoccia could be found together at the Veterans and Friends Social Club on 86th Street and 14th Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. During the New York winter months Failla and Martoccia, along with their wives and children, stayed at the beachfront Diplomat Resort near Fort Lauderdale in South Florida. Failla and his associates are notoriously known to be heavily discreet, often avoided being seen with certain individuals in public, and frequently utilized Failla's infamous \\"walk-and-talk\\" method to avoid surveillance while discussing legitimate and lawful business dealings. While Failla was feared by many, as his reputation was of a fierce and vicious operator and handler of his trade, he did in fact conduct the majority of his business in a lawful manner, which for many years forged the blockade between him and the criminal judicial system. Failla avoided incarceration for many years which is explained by his unique manner of conducting himself and his business. Failla is acknowledged and distinguished as one of the all-time top earners for the Gambino family. Nevertheless, after many years of unsuccessful efforts by the FBI to indict Failla, he was eventually incarcerated and then soon after passed while serving a sentence in prison for conspiracy to commit murder; a charge the District Attorney's Office constructed with much help from the mobster turned government informant Sammy \\"The Bull\\" Gravano. Garbage rackets For 30 years, Failla controlled the Trade Waste Association of Greater New York, an association of trash haulers in the New York area. Failla skimmed off 50% of the association dues for the Gambino family.\\"To Prosecutors, Breakthrough After 5 Years of Scrutiny\\" By SELWYN RAAB New York Times June 23, 1995 Failla allocated hauling routes and set pricing. Companies were prohibited from switching trash-hauling companies or using non- union drivers. To prevent competitors from entering the New York City market, Failla used threats and intimidation. In 1993, the Houston-based Browning- Ferris Industries (BFI), a national trash-hauling corporation, started doing business in New York. In February of that year, a company executive found a dog's severed head on his doorstep in Rockland County, New York. The following note had been placed in the dog's mouth: \\"Welcome to New York.\\"\\"Judge Backs Competition In Trash-Hauling Industry\\" New York Times February 28, 1994 Due to this mob control, New York businesses paid twice as much in trash fees as comparable businesses in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Boston. Coupled with Failla's control of Teamsters Union Local 813, the union local for trash-haul drivers, Failla was able to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from New York businesses. John Gotti, after taking control of the Gambino family, was recorded on Federal surveillance saying: \\"Jimmy Brown, he took the garbage industry and turned it into a candy store.\\" Castellano years In 1976, Gambino died and Failla became the acting boss of the Gambino family. However, Gambino's successor was Paul Castellano. Failla built a strong relationship with Castellano, meeting him weekly at Castellano's Todt Hill mansion on Staten Island. On December 16, 1985, Failla was waiting for Castellano at the Sparks Steak House in Manhattan to discuss family matters. When Castellano arrived outside the restaurant, gunmen allied with Gambino capo John Gotti assassinated him on the street. Soon after Castellano's death, Gotti became the new boss. Despite Failla's ties with Castellano, Gotti left Failla in charge of the lucrative trash-hauling rackets. Gotti years Over time, Failla built a close partnership with the Genovese crime family. It was rumored that the Genovese leadership wanted to install Failla as Gambino boss after a failed assassination attempt on then Gambino boss John Gotti. In 1986, as a result of the tapings at Castellano's house in 1983, Failla was indicted on racketeering charges. However, in June 1987, Failla was acquitted on federal racketeering charges. The reason cited for the acquittal was his lack of conversation on those tapings. In 1989, Failla participated in the murder of Gambino mobster Thomas Spinelli. A member of Failla's crew, Spinelli had recently testified before a grand jury and was due to appear again. Gambino underboss Sammy Gravano ordered Spinelli's murder to prevent him from providing further testimony. Spinelli was murdered inside a Brooklyn factory.\\"Sammy 'the Bull' Gravano\\" by Allan May TruTV Crime Library In December 1990, when Gotti went to jail awaiting trial, he appointed Failla as acting boss of the family.\\"Wanted: a Mob Boss Without the Flash\\" New York Times April 4, 1992 After Gotti's incarceration, Failla and Peter Gotti both jointly held the acting street-boss position until Peter took over control compelely.

In the sixth Thirumurai, this temple is mentioned as Ayneeswaram in the 8th Verse of 71st Chapter. Originally the temple was constructed during the reign of King Raja Raja Chola. During the reign of Emperor Raja Raja Chola this village was donated for Vedic Scholars for chanting Four Vedas and hence named as Chaturveda Mangalam or Brahmadhayam. Subsequent additions were constructed by Pandya Kings and [Hoysala] Kings. Big compound walls and front Rajagopuram of 7 stories and the back Gopuram of 5 stories were constructed by King Viswanatha Naick, who was ruling from Tirunelveli. Specialities Brahmadesam Kailasanathar Temple is very big, ancient and rich in sculptural wealth. There are five siva lingas with separate Sanctum sanctorum in the temple namely # Sri. Kailasanathar # Sri Badari Vaneswarar # Sri Viswanathar with Sri Visalakshi # Sri Arunachaleswarar with Unnamalai # Sri Sundareswarar with Sri Meenakshi. # Sri Nadikeswara # Sri Nataraja (Punuku Sabhapathi) # Sri Athma Vyakya dhakshinamoorthy with chin mudra facing His ownself and Jwarahara Deva are certain examples of the iconographic treasures of the temple. Pradosha Sabhai with Pradosha Moorthy, Ashta Dik Balakas with their respective Vahanas, Siva Boothaganas and Apsaras women is a very rare specimen of deities. Chandikeswari goddess Saraswathi and Uchchishta Ganapathy are seen in the Praakara of the goddess Brahannayaki‚Äôs shrine. The Arudra Mandapam is an example of Architectural Excellence. The Dharma Nandhi is of a very big size made in a single stone carved with magnificent skill. There are separate sannidhis for Vigneswara, Subrahmanya, Dharma Sastha, Balamurugan, Surya, Chandra, Dhakshinamoorthy and Navukkarasar, Appar & Sundarar. The big doors of the main entrance with wooden carvings and wood sculptures inside the temple are proving that artisans from Kerala were taking active rolls in this temple. The Somawara Mandapam is another masterpiece of the sculptors of that age. Many more details can be seen when one pays a visit to the temple.

Personal life Sisler was the son of Mr. and Mrs. George R. Sisler of Dexter, Missouri. He was married to Jane and had two sons, David and James. Sisler also worked as an Alaskan smokejumper to fight wildfires in remote parts of the state. Education and service Sisler served in the United States Air Force from 1958 to 1962. After attending Arkansas State University and joining Sigma Pi fraternity, Sisler joined the Army from his birth city of Dexter, Missouri in 1964.Service Profile By February 7, 1967 was serving as a first lieutenant in the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces. On that day, when his unit came under heavy enemy attack in the Republic of Vietnam, Sisler organized the defense, rescued a wounded soldier, and single-handedly attacked an enemy position before being mortally wounded. For his actions during the battle, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Sisler, aged 29 at his death, was buried at Dexter Cemetery in his hometown of Dexter, Missouri. He was a 1964 graduate of Arkansas State College (now Arkansas State University) with a degree in education. He was a member of the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Corps. He was also famous for his toughness, once parachuting while having a broken bone. The ASU ROTC department's Ranger Challenge team is named Sisler's Raiders in his honor. Medal of Honor citation First Lieutenant Sisler's official Medal of Honor citation reads: :For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life and above and beyond the call of duty. 1st Lt. Sisler was the platoon leader/adviser to a Special United States/Vietnam exploitation force. While on patrol deep within enemy dominated territory, 1st Lt. Sisler's platoon was attacked from 3 sides by a company sized enemy force. 1st Lt. Sisler quickly rallied his men, deployed them to a better defensive position, called for air strikes, and moved among his men to encourage and direct their efforts. Learning that 2 men had been wounded and were unable to pull back to the perimeter, 1st Lt. Sisler charged from the position through intense enemy fire to assist them. He reached the men and began carrying 1 of them back to the perimeter, when he was taken under more intensive weapons fire by the enemy. Laying down his wounded comrade, he killed 3 onrushing enemy soldiers by firing his rifle and silenced the enemy machinegun with a grenade. As he returned the wounded man to the perimeter, the left flank of the position came under extremely heavy attack by the superior enemy force and several additional men of his platoon were quickly wounded. Realizing the need for instant action to prevent his position from being overrun, 1st Lt. Sisler picked up some grenades and charged single-handedly into the enemy onslaught, firing his weapon and throwing grenades. This singularly heroic action broke up the vicious assault and forced the enemy to begin withdrawing. Despite the continuing enemy fire, 1st Lt. Sisler was moving about the battlefield directing air strikes when he fell mortally wounded. His extraordinary leadership, infinite courage, and selfless concern for his men saved the lives of a number of his comrades. His actions reflect great credit upon himself and uphold the highest traditions of the military service.

The Biography of an Anglo-Irishman, Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe 1986, p. 22. ‚Äì 6 March 1892) was an Anglo-Irish writer and politician, who is now less remembered than his wife Augusta, Lady Gregory, the playwright, co-founder and Director of Dublin's Abbey Theatre, literary hostess and folklorist. Earlier life and education The only child of Robert Gregory (1790 ‚Äì 20 April 1847) and Elizabeth Gregory (n√©e O'Hara from Raheen, 1799 ‚Äì 7 January 1877), William Gregory was born at the Under- Secretary's residence, Ashtown Lodge, in Phoenix Park, Dublin. From 1830 to 1835 he attended Harrow, where he was an award-winning student. He entered Christ Church, Oxford in 1836, leaving three years later without getting a degree. William' father, Robert, had been an improving landlord who died of a fever contracted while visiting his tenants during the Great Famine in 1847. Political career In 1842 Gregory was elected to the British House of Commons in a by-election as a Conservative member for Dublin. Among his close associates were Sir Robert Peel, Lord Lincoln and Lord George Bentinck, but he was also friendly with Daniel O'Connell and sympathetic to Catholic interests. He was responsible for the \\"Gregory Clause\\" which said that anyone applying for relief during the Great Famine would not be eligible if they were occupying more than 1‚ÅÑ4 of an acre (0.1 ha). After the death of his father and following his failure to retain his seat in the general election of 1847 he took up residence on the family estate at Coole Park in County Galway. He was appointed High Sheriff of County Galway in 1849. He had inherited a large fortune, mainly derived from the earnings of his grandfather, also named Robert Gregory, in the East India Company, but he lost a large part of it at the racetrack.Sir William Gregory, Joseph M. Hone, Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, Vol. 44, No. 175 (Autumn, 1955), pp. 337‚Äì341, Irish Province of the Society of Jesus, JSTOR In 1850 he fought a duel with a Captain Vaughan, but Robert Peel who was his second, persuaded him not to shoot to kill as had originally been his intention. Sir William‚Äôs autobiography, written in the 1880s, edited by Lady Gregory, published in 1894 Gregory travelled to Egypt in 1855 and wrote a two-volume work on his travels, Egypt in 1855 and 1856, and Tunis in 1857 and 1858, published privately in London in 1859. In 1857 he was returned to Parliament for County Galway on a liberal-conservative platform. In 1859 he travelled through North America, befriending several southern Congressmen, including James Murray Mason of Virginia and William Porcher Miles of South Carolina. Throughout the American Civil War Gregory was an avid supporter of the Confederacy. He also argued that Britain should pursue a strong anti-Turkish policy, and supported the cession of the Ionian Islands and Crete to Greece. In domestic affairs Gregory was active in defending the Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland and working for land reform. His interest in the arts led to a long association with the British Museum. In 1867 he was appointed a Trustee of the National Gallery. On 10 July 1871 Gregory was made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland and in the following year he was appointed Governor of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). In 1875, he played host to the Prince of Wales and was presented with the Order of St. Michael and St. George. Gregory retired from office in 1877 and returned to England via Australia. He spent most of the following years travelling. From October 1881 to April 1882 he toured Egypt and reported on the revolution there. He also visited Ceylon in 1884 and 1885. Gregory was a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) and a member of the Kildare Street Club in Dublin.Thomas Hay Sweet Escott, Club Makers and Club Members (1913), pp. 329‚Äì333 Personal life Gregory was addicted to horse racing, which led to financial difficulties throughout his life. He remained fond of classical languages and literature, and always took an interest in artistic affairs. Gregory married twice. On 11 January 1872 he married Elizabeth Temple Bowdoin, widow of James Temple Bowdoin and daughter of Sir William Clay. She died on 28 June 1873. On 4 March 1880 Gregory married Augusta Persse, later to become famous as Augusta, Lady Gregory. Their only child, William Robert Gregory, was born on 20 May 1881. Death The Gregory family vault near Coole Park, County Galway in 2016. Originally located on the demesne, it now lies on farmland in Kiltartan between the N18 and M18 (construction site) roads. Information sign on the Gregory family vault. Gregory died of respiratory failure in London on 6 March 1892. His autobiography was edited and published by Lady Gregory in 1894. He bequeathed the important painting Christ in the House of Martha and Mary by Diego Vel√°zquez, along with three other works including a Jan Steen, to the National Gallery, London of which he had been a Trustee from 1867 onwards. Gregory is buried in the Gregory family vault at Kiltartan, County Galway. Though originally part of Coole Demesne, the area overlooking the Gort river is now used as farmland. At the time of Lady Gregory's death in 1932, the land had already been sold to former tenants so she was buried with her sister at Bohermore Cemetery near Galway. Lake Gregory in Nuwara Eliya and Gregory's Road in Colombo are named for William Gregory. Popular culture He lends his name to the inspector in Arthur Conan Doyle's Silver Blaze, 1892. The Sherlock Holmes story is centered on the disappearance of a race horse on the eve of a major race. He is sometimes considered to have been the model for Anthony Trollope's character Phineas Finn in the Palliser novels. Trollope went to school with Gregory.

After the Second World War, Geloso expanded and expanded his production, becoming from 1950 onwards a real point of reference for domestic electronics enthusiasts and hobbyists. The many products under the brand name Geloso were known throughout Italy and much appreciated abroad. It was innovative products, high quality, well-made and the low price. The big production was formed of radios, amplifiers, tape recorders, televisions, boxes of assembly, professional laboratory instruments etc. but also components such as capacitors, resistors, potentiometers, switches, connectors, transformers, microphones, etc. Bulletins Geloso was considered a good businessman, but also strongly wanted to share his passion for electronic. He created in 1932 Technical Bulletin GELOSO, a free quarterly publication that not only contained everything needed for the repair and development of its equipment, but also and above all, updates, tips, instructions, characteristics, schemes and everything that technicians and enthusiasts had to know. Those were the years in which there were no training centres and schools electronics were extremely rare. These bulletins had the merit of spreading, so simple and clear, the knowledge to people who otherwise would not have any way to learn and develop their passion. Mounting kits Another important contribution of Geloso were mounting kits. The kits allowed for TVs and radios to be home-assembled almost from scratch, beginning with raw metal frames onto which components were installed. There was also a user- friendlier line of pre-assembled, pre-calibrated kits and, also available, were cabinets, knobs, keys, etc. - all branded Geloso. Bulletins instructed how to calibrate finished units. By 1969 - the year John Geloso died - S.p.A. Geloso had become an empire of eight manufacturing facilities. Production persisted till 1972, when the business closed. Several were the reasons for the end of activities: fierce foreign competition, managerial problems, union demands and massive indebtedness to banks. Some of S.p.A.

The company transformed healthcare in Abu Dhabi under the leadership of Dr Kassem Alom and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Butti and for many years the company was the largest healthcare operator in Abu Dhabi: it had a market share of 39% at the time of its initial public offering. It also provided support for several major humaitarian operations in the region including relief for the victims of Bam earthquake in southern Iran in 2003 and setting up the Emirates International Humanitarian Mobile Hospital in the remote town of Juba in southern Sudan in 2009. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it merged with Mediclinic International in a transaction which valued Al Noor Hospitals at ¬£1.4 billion (US$2.1 billion) in February 2016. History The company was first established as an eight-bed operation on Hamdam Street in Abu Dhabi by Dr Kassem Alom and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Butti in 1985. Dr Kassem Alom originally came from Syria and trained in Spain before practicing at Charing Cross Hospital in London: when he arrived in Abu Dhabi there was no healthcare provision other than a group of caravans known as \\"Central Hospital\\". Through organic growth, Alom expanded the business such that the company secured a major share of the healthcare market in Abu Dhabi. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and President of the United Arab Emirates subsequently went to Al Noor Hospitals for treatment. Alom was subsequently appointed to the supreme council of the Ministry of Health. Al Noor Hospitals benefited from the financial support of Sheikh Mohammed bin Butti Al Hamed, who was at the time of the founding of the business, chairman of the municipality of Abu Dhabi and the Ruler's representative in the Western Region. It also received financial backing from Ithmar Capital. The company became the first healthcare business to open a fertility unit in the country in 1993. The company's second facility was at Khalifa Street, a small polyclinic facility established in 2001, that grew until it had 1,200 patients. In 2003 the company led an initiative to provide emergency medical treatment to the victims of Bam earthquake in southern Iran; working with the Emirates Red Crescent, it sent a team of doctors and paramedics together medicines worth Dh 0.5 million (US$ 135000; ¬£106,000). The company expanded further with the opening of a 50-bed hospital in Al Ain in 2006. The company was also involved in lobbying for and, ultimately, benefited from the introduction of compulsory medical insurance, which led to higher per capita health spending, in Abu Dhabi in 2007. The company supported the Emirates Red Crescent and the Department of Health again, this time in setting up the Emirates International Humanitarian Mobile Hospital in the remote town of Juba in southern Sudan in 2009. The mobile hospital, which was the region's first civilian field hospital, was long and offered air-conditioned intensive care unit, operating theatre and pharmacy facilities. The business considered seeking a listing on a recognised stock exchange in 2011 but abandoned plans because of weak market conditions in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Al Noor Hospitals was the subject of an initial public offering, which raised ¬£221 million in June 2013. The flotation valued the company at ¬£672 million (US$1.04 billion) and provided funds for future expansion in the gulf states were money is available but where diabetes is prevalent. The company made three acquisitions in the United Arab Emirates in 2014 including the Gulf International Cancer Centre, the only private cancer treatment centre in Abu Dhabi. The acquisition of the Gulf International Cancer Centre, was an important strategic step by the company in the context that while, cancer is widespread around the world, like diabetes, it also very prevalent in the region. In September 2014 Dr Kassem Alom stood down as Chief Executive and handed over to Ron Lavater, who had previously managed Corniche Hospital in Abu Dhabi and joined from Johns Hopkins Medicine International. Continued growth led to Al Noor Hospitals entering the FTSE 250 Index of leading companies in October 2014. The company which had first performed open heart surgery in 2003, established a 24-hour cardiology department at the Al Noor Hospital on Airport Road in Abu Dhabi in November 2014. In August 2015, the company entered into leases to expand its existing facilities at Airport Road in Abu Dhabi, at Khalifa Street in Abu Dhabi and at Al Ain Hospital in Al Ain. On 14 October 2015 Mediclinic International announced a merger with Al Noor Hospitals. Shortly thereafter NMC Health also announced a potential bid for Al Noor Hospitals, as did VPS Healthcare on 20 October 2015. A major bidding battle for dominance of the healthcare market in the Gulf Region ensued and, although NMC Health withdrew from the bidding on 16 November 2015, it was not until 30 November 2015 that VPS Healthcare withdrew. The final deal valued Al Noor Hospitals at ¬£1.4 billion (US$2.1 billion). One analyst even suggested that the bidding battle would result in the healthcare sector becoming the next mining sector in terms of its attractiveness to international financial markets. The merger between Al Noor Hospitals and Mediclinic International was completed on 15 February 2016. The size of the merger resulted in Mediclinic joining the FTSE 100 Index of leading companies in March 2016. Operations The company operated 227 operational beds at primary, secondary, and tertiary care through three hospitals (Airport Road in Abu Dhabi, Khalifa Street in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain Hospital in Al Ain) and nine medical centres. At the time of its flotation its market share in Abu Dhabi was 39%, more than double its nearest competitor. It employed 4,500 people, including 550 doctors.

On the last day of the 2003‚Äì04 season he scored his first goal to equalise against Huddersfield Town, which later prevented Huddersfield achieving automatic promotion. Duff's performances during season 2004‚Äì05 earned him the club's Player of the Year award and established him as a first choice player. He went on to play an important part as the Robins won promotion in 2006 via a play off final victory over Grimsby Town at the Millennium Stadium and retained their League One status the following season. During both the 2006‚Äì07 and 2007‚Äì08 League One campaigns Duff's appearances were curtailed slightly by injury but he still managed to start nearly two-thirds of the over the course of both seasons. It was another frustrating campaign for Duff during 2008‚Äì09 when injury saw him unavailable for four and a half months during the middle part of the season. Nevertheless, he returned with gusto towards the end of that campaign becoming an important facet within a side that, despite suffering relegation, showed true spirit and determination. =Bradford City= On 2 July 2010 Duff signed a contract with Bradford City, with an option of keeping the 28-year-old for a further 12 months. Duff has also captained Bradford City as Simon Ramsden was injured, and vice captain Zesh Rehman was a substitute. However Duff was substituted during the second half of the game and was replaced by the vice captain. =Retirement= Duff left Bradford City at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season and in January 2012 announced his retirement at the age of 29 because of a spinal problem. In September 2011, Duff began studying for a degree at Hartpury College. In the summer of 2012 he became the under 18's coach at Bishops Cleeve. Personal life Also a talented cricketer, Duff appeared as a wicketkeeper-batsman for Shipton- under-Wychwood in the 2002 National Village Knockout final at Lord's.

Identification of the breed was begun in 1981 by the Patronato para las Razas Aut√≥ctonas de Mallorca (\\"authority for the autochthonous breeds of Mallorca\\"). The Mallorqu√≠n is listed in the Cat√°logo Oficial de Razas de Ganado de Espa√±a in the group of autochthonous breeds in danger of extinction.  History  The origins of the breed are obscure. According to a genetic study of \\"Spanish Celtic horse breeds\\", the Mallorqu√≠n and Menorqu√≠n are connected to the now extinct Catalan horse, itself the result of introgression of populations with strong African genetic influence into an original population of Celtic horses introduced to the Iberian peninsula by the Celts in about the eighth century BC. The study showed clear grouping of the two Mediterranean breeds and clear separation from the five \\"Atlantic\\" Celtic breeds examined, the Asturc√≥n, Gallego, Jaca Navarra, Losino and Pottok. Identification of the breed was begun in 1981 by the Patronato para las Razas Aut√≥ctonas de Mallorca (\\"authority for the autochthonous breeds of Mallorca\\"). A stud-book was started in 1988, and a breed association, the , was established in 1992. The official breed standard was approved in 2003. The Mallorqu√≠n is listed in the Cat√°logo Oficial de Razas de Ganado de Espa√±a in the group of autochthonous breeds in danger of extinction. Its status was listed as \\"critical-maintained\\" by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2000 and in 2007. In approximately 2005 the number of Mallorqu√≠n horses recorded in the stud-book was 247, but a census conducted by the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino in 2003 identified only 172. In 2010 a population of 146 was reported, which by 2018 had risen to 320.  Characteristics  The Mallorqu√≠n may only be black, in all its variations; horses of any other colour can not be registered. Limited white facial markings are permitted, white leg markings are not. The minimum permissible height is for males and for females. It has an upright mane, short, thick, but arched neck, a head with a convex profile but refined bone structure.  Uses  This breed is used by the local population only as a riding horse; farm work in the islands was traditionally done by the Balearic donkey. Mallorqu√≠n mares were traditionally bred to imported stallions, usually of French Trotter or Orlov Trotter breed, to produce Trotador Espa√±ol, \\"Spanish Trotter\\", horses. Approximately 85% of the Spanish Trotter population is in Mallorca; however, genetic study has found little recent influence of the Mallorqu√≠n on the Spanish Trotter breed. They were also much used in the production of mules.

The club adopted The Hatters as their nickname, owing to Stockport's history as the centre of the Victorian hat-making industry, a nickname that is shared with Luton Town. Stockport played in the Lancashire League until 1900, when they gained admission to the Football League Second Division. Stockport's first Football League match was against Leicester Fosse which ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw. Stockport left their Green Lane home in 1902 and moved to Edgeley Park where they currently reside. The club finished in the bottom three for their first four seasons, and at the end of 1903‚Äì04 they failed to gain re-election. They spent one year in the Lancashire Combination (a league which they won) and the Midland League. At the end of the season, they were re-admitted to the Football League after being re-elected through the Midland League. In their first season back in the Football League, Stockport reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time; however, they were knocked out by Lincoln City. Stockport finished the league in 10th position that season. Photo of the 1913‚Äì14 Stockport County team Stockport remained in Division 2 of the Football League for seven years until 1912‚Äì13 when they again had to seek re-election. Stockport gained 22 votes and was therefore re-elected. Despite an unsuccessful 1920‚Äì21 campaign that saw Stockport end the season bottom of the Second Division, which would normally have seen them face re-election however, they were placed in the new Third Division North. After winning five of their first six matches; along with going unbeaten from New Years Day 1921 to Easter Weekend 1922; Stockport set the standard for the division and gained their first Football League title when they beat Darlington in front of 18,500 fans at Edgeley Park. Albert Williams (the then manager) was presented with the trophy seven days later before the home game with Lincoln City. This title win began a remarkable coincidence which has occurred in each of Stockport's title winning seasons where Lincoln City have been the last opponents in each of those seasons. Joe O'Kane; who joined Stockport the previous season, was a major factor in the club's promotion although he left the club at the end of the season. Once Stockport returned to Division 2, they struggled and survived an automatic relegation by one point. The 1923‚Äì24 season saw Stockport County finish 13th, one place above Manchester United. This is the only time in history Stockport has achieved better than Manchester United. During this campaign Stockport goalkeeper Harry Hardy was called up to play for the England national team and kept a clean sheet in a 4‚Äì0 win against Belgium. He is the only player to be capped at full level by England while on Stockport's books. Two seasons later (1925‚Äì26) Stockport returned to the bottom division after finishing bottom of the league and only picking up 25 points. Stockport finished 6th the next season (1926‚Äì27) but suffered a 2-point deduction and ¬£100 fine for fielding an ineligible player after the registration documents for Joe Smith were not received by the Football League. Stockport closed out the 1920s in Division Three North with a 3rd-placed finish in 1927‚Äì28. Joe Smith was Stockport's and the division's leading goalscorer in this particular season contributing to 38 of Stockport's 89 goals. Stockport also finished second on two occasions, one in 1928‚Äì29; Where Stockport amassed 62 points, scored over 100 goals in a season and averaged 10,000 fans for the first time, it was a memorable season, but one that in the end had been disappointing after Stockport won nine of their last 11 matches it had still not been enough to win the league. Stockport also finished second the following season; 1929‚Äì30 with an even better record than in the previous season, finishing four points behind the champions Port Vale despite beating them 2‚Äì1 away on Christmas Day and 4‚Äì2 on Boxing Day, 1929. Frank Newton was Stockport's and the division's leading goalscorer in this particular season contributing to 36 of Stockport's 106 goals. 1930‚Äì1950 From the start of the 1930s, Stockport County played in a home strip of white and black and were nicknamed the 'Lilywhites'. The 1933‚Äì34 season saw them achieve 115 goals. These included a 13‚Äì0 home win over Halifax Town on 6 January 1934; Joe Hill made his debut for Stockport scoring twice to making the score 2‚Äì0 at half time. Hill completed his hat trick on 51 minutes also Percy Downes make a notable performance scoring four of Stockport's goals on this day. This record victory still stands as a Football League record today. Over the course of the 1933‚Äì34 season Alf Lythgoe scored 46 goals for Stockport . Both of these records still stand in the club's history. Another first for Stockport was also seen during this season when Stockport's 2‚Äì1 home defeat to Crystal Palace in the second round of the FA Cup was shown on television . Stockport finished third in this season. The Main Stand of Edgeley Park, which in 1935 was made of wood, burned down in a fire, destroying all of Stockport County's records before 1935. Besides having to rebuild a significant section of the ground, the club had to piece together historical information. The current Main Stand, was built a year later in 1936 and officially opened by Charles Sutcliffe, then President of the Football League. In 1936‚Äì37 County won the Third Division North, gaining 60 points and 23 wins. Towards the end of this season, Stockport had a ten-game unbeaten run that included seven victories before a last-day title decider against Lincoln City in which more than 27,000 fans watched. The following season, Stockport finished 22nd out of 22 in the Second Division and were relegated to Division 3 (North) after only earning 31 points. During the 1939‚Äì40 season football was stopped following Britain's declaration of war and was not resumed until the end of World War II. This was because most British men were sent to the army. Stockport played only two matches in the 1939‚Äì40 season before war was declared, losing both and being bottom of the league. Regional league competitions were set up; appearances in these tournaments do not count in players' official records. Due to teams having a depleting number of players most teams resigned from football, the clubs that were left to compete used guest players to make up their numbers. The FA Cup was also suspended and replaced with the Football League War Cup. In the first war league after the outbreak of World War II (1940‚Äì41) Stockport finished in 35th place overall in the Northern Regional League after playing 29 games. League standings were calculated by goal average over the course of games played, with some teams playing more than others. In 1945‚Äì46, English football still did not have a football season; however, The FA Cup competition was resumed. Stockport was eliminated from the 1945‚Äì46 FA Cup in the first round after a 3‚Äì2 aggregate loss to Rochdale. The first post-war league season 1946‚Äì47 saw Stockport finish fourth in Division 3 (North) with 24 wins and 50 points. 1950‚Äì1995 Chart of yearly table positions of Stockport County in the English football league system The 1950s brought little league success, but were notable for goal-scoring by Jack Connor, whose 140 goals in five seasons are still a club record. These included 13 hat-tricks (three of which were consecutive ‚Äì once against Crewe Alexandra and twice against Chester), two instances of four goals in a match (against Workington and Carlisle United), and two of five goals in a match (against Bradford Park Avenue and the Tranmere Rovers). When the regional Third Divisions were to be combined into national Third and Fourth Divisions after the 1957‚Äì58 campaign, Stockport finished in the top half of the Third Division North and so were placed in the following season's national Third Division. Stockport spent one season at this level before the club was demoted. Stockport played in the first League Cup competition in 1960‚Äì61, beating Carlisle United in the first round, but the club was eliminated in the second round after a 3‚Äì0 defeat against Manchester City. In the 1964‚Äì65 FA Cup run Stockport were drawn against reigning Football League champions Liverpool at Anfield. Stockport footed the 4th Division table. Stockport pulled off a shock 1‚Äì1 draw at Anfield after deservedly taking the lead with enough chances to have won.http://www.lfchistory.net/Images/newspapers/echo/1965-01-30-stockport-267.JPG Unfortunately the replay was a 0‚Äì2 home defeat after another excellent performance against top class opposition. Despite Stockport's ability to match the 1964‚Äì65 European Cup semi-finalist they finished bottom of the 4th division and survived re-election in the 1964‚Äì65 season. After finishing bottom of the league with 27 points, the club was re-elected by gaining 45 votes. During the 1964‚Äì65 season, then Stockport Chairman Vic Bernard re- introduced the royal blue strip, colours they still play in. Two seasons later Stockport returned to Third Division by winning the Fourth Division in 1966‚Äì67 after gaining 64 points. After the club was relegated in 1969‚Äì70, the 1970s, and 1980s consisted of little other than mediocrity and struggling against relegation. In February 1984 Stockport competed in their first Associate Members' Cup match against Crewe Alexandra in a competition their chairman at the time' Dragan Lukic' helped create. The matched finished 2‚Äì2 after extra time and as so was decided in a penalty shoot-out; the first in Stockport's history. Stockport went on to lose 3‚Äì0 on penalties. The introduction of automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League and the Conference was not a good sign for Stockport, and in 1986‚Äì87 they had just six points from 13 games and faced a real prospect of non-League football, exemplified by being eliminated from the FA Cup by Caernarfon Town. Colin Murphy was brought in for his second spell as manager. Stockport gained 45 points from their final 31 games and survived, although Murphy left shortly after the end of the season. Danny Bergara was appointed as manager in March 1989, quickly transforming the team, and automatic promotion was gained in 1990‚Äì91. The next three seasons saw Stockport make the play-offs, losing 2‚Äì1 to Burnley in 1994. Stockport finishing with 9 men after Michael Wallace was sent off for spitting at Ted McMinn and Chris Beaumont was dismissed. There was trouble in the stands due to the manner of the defeat. In March 1995 Bergara was sacked after an altercation with then-chairman Brendan Elwood, 1995‚Äì96 to 1997‚Äì98: The Dave Jones Era The 1995‚Äì96 season was Dave Jones' first full season as manager, having taken over from Bergara in April 1995. Although the league season was unremarkable, the club reached the 3rd round of the FA Cup, where they faced holders Everton. County held the Toffees to a 2‚Äì2 draw at Goodison Park, and for the replay ten days later over 11,000 squeezed into Edgeley Park to witness Everton's late winner in a 3‚Äì2 victory. The 1996‚Äì97 season proved to be possibly the most memorable in the club's history. The season began in a forgettable fashion, recording 2 draws and 4 defeats in the first six league matches. A 2nd round League Cup tie against Sheffield United proved to be a catalyst, and Stockport won with a 7‚Äì3 aggregate win, including a 5‚Äì2 victory at Bramall Lane. Although County reached the northern final of the Auto Windscreens Shield, losing 2‚Äì0 on aggregate to Carlisle and just missing out on a visit to Wembley, it was the League Cup which provided the major highlights of the season, with 4 victories over top-flight opposition. A 1‚Äì0 win away at Blackburn Rovers in the 3rd round was followed by a 4th round 1‚Äì1 draw away to West Ham and a 2‚Äì1 victory in the replay at Edgeley Park, a quarter final 2‚Äì2 draw against Southampton at Edgeley Park followed by a 2‚Äì1 victory in the replay at The Dell, and then a semi-final meeting with Middlesbrough. Although County lost the first leg at Edgeley Park 2‚Äì0, they won 1‚Äì0 at the Riverside Stadium, failing to convert several chances to equalise on aggregate. The league season was also going very strong, and the Hatters eventually gained promotion with a 1‚Äì0 victory at Chesterfield in the penultimate match of the season, a game which, had County failed to win, they would have faced a deciding match away at promotion rivals Luton Town on the final day of the season. As it turned out, County travelled to Kenilworth Road with a chance to win the title, but a 1‚Äì1 draw meant that local rivals Bury finished top of the table. 1997‚Äì98 to 2001‚Äì02: First Division era 1997‚Äì98 saw County playing in the top two divisions for the first time in 60 years, facing the likes of Nottingham Forest, Sunderland, Birmingham City, Manchester City, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth and many others. However, even before the season had started things had taken a turn for the worse - Dave Jones had been poached by Premiership Southampton, taking goalkeeper Paul Jones & full back Lee Todd with him. Gary Megson left Blackpool to take over the reins, and in his first season County finished 8th, just two places off the playoffs to reach the Premiership - the club's best ever league placing. The season also saw the first of several memorable derby matches with Manchester City, a 3‚Äì1 victory at Edgeley Park in front of more than 11,000. That was as good as things were going to get, however, and the following 1998‚Äì99 season saw Stockport finish 16th, winning just 3 of their final 14 matches. A 5‚Äì0 defeat at relegated Oxford United on the final day signalled the end of Megson's time at Edgeley Park. The club decided to promote from within and Andy Kilner was soon put in charge. Again, he had an encouraging start to his management at County and by Boxing Day the club were 6th, holding a playoff spot, having picked up another unforgettable win over Manchester City, this time 2‚Äì1 at Maine Road. However, the team then went a club-record 19 games without a victory, eventually finishing the 1999‚Äì2000 season 17th, with two late wins helping stave off relegation. The 2000‚Äì01 season saw them again narrowly avoid relegation, finishing 19th overall. 2001‚Äì02 turned out to be the club's worst ever at the time. With County already bottom of the league, a 4‚Äì0 home defeat to Millwall saw manager Kilner sacked. Shortly after he was replaced with former England international Carlton Palmer. A 2‚Äì1 win over Norwich game some hope, but County then went on to lose 11 matches in a row, another unwanted club record. The Hatters picked up just 3 more wins during the rest of the season (one of these being another unforgettable 2‚Äì1 victory over Manchester City, having been 1‚Äì0 down with just 5 minutes left) finishing the season with just 26 points, going down on 16 March, the quickest post-war relegation. 2002‚Äì03 & 2004‚Äì05: Two steps back, none forward Season 2002‚Äì03 set a trend of optimism followed by great disappointment that would continue in the following years. The season started well enough, a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Colchester on the opening day forgotten after consecutive wins over Port Vale, Mansfield, Swindon & Lincoln. However, those wins turned out to be the exception rather than the rule and County languished in the relegation zone for much of the season, until another run of four victories (over Wycombe, Plymouth, Northampton & Huddersfield) helped the club climb to mid- table at the end of the season. The summer of 2003 saw the club change ownership, as chairman Brendan Elwood sold the club to Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy, in a move that would see Sale play their home games at Edgeley Park. A new company was created, called 'Cheshire Sports', which would have ownership of Stockport County, Sale Sharks & the Edgeley Park stadium. The 2003‚Äì04 season saw Palmer sacked after another poor start to the season, following home defeats to Hartlepool & Blackpool in the space of one week. John Hollins, who had been Director of Football during Palmer's reign, took over as caretaker manager, but was replaced full-time by former Northern Ireland manager Sammy McIlroy. After a poor start to his time at Edgeley Park & yet more relegation worries, an 11-match unbeaten run saw the club again climb to safety at the end of the season. 2004‚Äì05 was another season that promised much, with several promising signings over the summer. The previous season's excellent form failed to carry over, the new signings failed to gel and again County were in the relegation places by the Autumn. McIlroy was sacked in November and replaced by Chris Turner a month later. Turner failed to turn things around and, for the second time in three years, Stockport County finished a season with just 26 points and were relegated. 2005‚Äì06: The Great Escape 2005‚Äì06 saw Stockport County change owners again. After reportedly losing ¬£4m, Cheshire Sports chairman Brian Kennedy handed ownership of the club to the Supporters Trust, whose aim was to rescue the club from revenue loss, eventually breaking even & turn Stockport County into a community based football club. On the 8 July at 10:30 the deal went through, making County one of a handful of supporter-owned clubs in the country. On the pitch, despite the lower level of football the team failed to adapt. On Boxing Day 2005, already five points from safety, County lost 6‚Äì0 at local rivals Macclesfield Town, leading Turner to resign after just seven wins in 50 matches. Former player Jim Gannon came in as caretaker manager, while the club searched for a replacement. An impressive change to both results and performances under Gannon's leadership led the club to give him the position full-time, and the remarkable run of form continued. Stockport picked up 35 points from the final 23 games, compared to just 17 from the first 23 matches. On an extremely tense final day of the season, County held champions Carlisle United to a 0‚Äì0 draw; a last minute winner for Leyton Orient at Oxford United sent Oxford down and brought the Hatters to safety, sparking scenes of celebration at Edgeley Park. 2006‚Äì2012: Up, then down and out The 2006‚Äì07 season started poorly, with the club picking up just five points from the first eight league games of the season, and back where they had spent most of the previous season, in the relegation zone, also losing 1‚Äì0 at home to Derby County in the first round of the League Cup. Results slowly improved through the rest of the calendar year, and by the time County were knocked out of the FA Cup at the third round stage (4-1 away to Premiership club Watford), County had risen to mid-table. During the January transfer window, two players - goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey (on loan for three months from Wolves) and striker Anthony Elding (from Boston United) signed for County; beginning with their debut against Elding's former club, County won nine games in a row without conceding a goal. Both the nine game winning run and the nine consecutive clean sheets were and remain club records, whilst the combination of nine wins without conceding a goal set a Football League record, eclipsing the eight such games that had been achieved four times previously, most recently by Hartlepool United earlier in the 2006‚Äì07 season. At the end of the record- breaking run, County had climbed to sixth in the table, but following the end of the run, County's form dipped, picking up only one point from a possible fifteen. County remained sixth, however, and picked up four points over the Easter weekend, but the team failed to win again in April, resulting in a drop to 8th place before the final game of the season. That game resulted in a 5‚Äì0 victory away at Darlington, but it was not quite enough to secure a place in the play-offs, as a win for Bristol Rovers combined with a draw for Shrewsbury saw County finish in 8th place, losing out to Shrewsbury on goal difference. The 2007‚Äì08 season started on a somber note, with a friendly between Stockport and Dave Jones' Cardiff marking the passing of Danny Bergara. Stockport played promisingly and were just three points off the top of the table at the end of September, but a downturn in form throughout October and November saw County slip as low as 17th in the division. Despite losing top scorer Anthony Elding to Leeds in the January transfer window, the New Year saw a sharp upturn in fortunes as the club lost only three further games until the end of the season, climbing into the playoffs by mid-February. The new year also saw Stockport equal a league record of eight consecutive away victories. Approaching the end of the season they had an outside chance to qualify for promotion automatically but missed out, finishing the season in 4th place. However, after beating Wycombe Wanderers 2‚Äì1 on aggregate in the play-off semi-final, Stockport played Rochdale at Wembley in the final, coming from behind to secure a 3‚Äì2 victory and their place in League One for the next football season. On 30 April 2009, Stockport County FC announced that they had been placed into administration by a creditor, and Leonard Curtis were appointed as administrators of the club. Jim Gannon and his team were made redundant as cost-cutting measures, and the new season saw Gary Ablett take over as manager. The season was one of the worst in Stockport County history, winning only five league games all season and breaking the club record for the most consecutive league defeats. A consortium led by former Manchester City player Jim Melrose attempted to buy the cash-strapped club out, a process which dragged on for 14 months, as they were not able to fulfilled the Football League Buy-Out Criteria. Another consortium, led by supporter Dave Schofield, was put together comprising a group of local Stockport based business people, calling themselves the '2015 Group'. It was announced on Thursday 17 June 2010 that the 2015 Group had taken control of the club. On the same day, it was announced that Gary Ablett had been relieved of his managerial duties by 'mutual consent'. The following season in League 2 began with Paul Simpson as manager, before being replaced by Peter Ward as caretaker manager. He too was replaced in the same season by Ray Mathias and although there was an upturn in performance, it was not sufficient to prevent the club from dropping out of the Football League for the first time in 106 years. The 2011‚Äì12 season began with Mathias being given the manager's role, but a week later, with the (ultimately failed) takeover by a Liverpool-based consortium, he was replaced by Liverpool and Germany international former player, Dietmar Hamann. He was unable to stop the ongoing slump of the club, and resigned in November 2011, to pave the way for the return as Director of Football Jim Gannon, who had been made redundant by the administrators of the club whilst they were in League One. It took until New Year's Day 2012 for him to record a first win. References Category:Stockport County F.C.

A former amateur sumo champion at Nihon University, he entered professional sumo in 2004 and first reached the top makuuchi division in 2007. His highest rank was maegashira 12. He spent much of his career in the j≈´ry≈ç and makushita divisions, and won a yusho or tournament championship in each. He won promotion back to the top division in 2014 after a seven-year and 37-tournament absence, the longest ever. He was a member of Onoe stable. He retired in November 2018 and is an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name of Sanoyama. Career A former amateur sumo champion at Nihon University, Satoyama made his professional debut in March 2004, joining Mihogaseki stable alongside his team-mate at Nichidai Sumo Club, Shiraishi. He was attracted to the stable because of his admiration for Onoe Oyakata, (ex komusubi Hamanoshima), himself a former amateur champion. Initially he was somewhat overshadowed by Shiraishi and Baruto, who made their j≈´ry≈ç division debuts together in September 2005. However, Satoyama was still highly regarded, despite his short height and relatively light weight. He made his way quickly up the ranks, recording only one make-koshi along the way to sekitori status, which he achieved in January 2006 upon promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division. In September 2006 Satoyama, Shiraishi, Baruto and a number of other wrestlers scouted by Onoe Oyakata joined his newly created Onoe stable. In March 2007 Satoyama won the j≈´ry≈ç division championship or y≈´sh≈ç with a 12‚Äì3 record and he entered the top makuuchi division for the first time in May 2007 at maegashira 12, where he scored seven wins against eight losses. After a poor 2‚Äì13 record in July he was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç. Restricted by a neck injury, he had two more losing scores in September and November 2007, pushing him towards the bottom of the second division. In January 2008 he won only two bouts in the first 11 days, and although he won his last four matches to finish on a 6‚Äì9 score, it was not enough to prevent demotion to the third makushita division. Satoyama produced a 2‚Äì5 score in March 2008, and 3‚Äì4 in May, meaning he had chalked up seven consecutive losing scores. In July 2008 he returned to form and won the makushita championship with a 6‚Äì1 score after an eight-way playoff, defeating his 232 kg stablemate Yamamotoyama Ry≈´ta in the final. It was his first kachi-koshi or winning score since his j≈´ry≈ç division championship in March 2007. However he could manage only two wins in each of his next two tournaments. Remaining firmly stuck in the makushita ranks, he became a tsukebito, or personal attendant, to Baruto. However, in the July 2011 basho he scored 5‚Äì2 at makushita 6 which returned him to j≈´ry≈ç for the first time in 21 tournaments. His score of 7‚Äì8 in September was enough to keep him in the second division, but not the 6‚Äì9 that followed in November. However he achieved his majority of wins against losses in the January 2012 basho, coming from 0‚Äì3 down to score 4‚Äì3, and this was enough to return him immediately to j≈´ry≈ç. In the January 2014 tournament Satoyama returned to the top division for the first time since July 2007. The 37 tournament gap between appearances in makuuchi is the most in sumo history, breaking the record of 28 tournaments held by Wakanoyama. However, he only lasted two tournaments before being demoted. He was promoted to the top division in July 2015 and again in March 2016, but a kachi-koshi or majority of wins in a makuuchi tournament continued to elude him. Nevertheless, he maintained his sekitori status until September 2017, when he was demoted to makushita for the first time since 2012. For the next year he recorded solid results in the third division but was unable to gain promotion and he announced his retirement after a 4-3 result in November 2018. Retirement from sumo Satoyama retired after the November 2018 tournament. He has stayed with the Japan Sumo Association as a coach at his stable under the borrowed elder name of Sanoyama Oyakata (owned by Chiyootori). His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, was held on 29 September 2019 at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan, on the same day as Kisenosato's. Fighting style At and Satoyama was one of the smallest sekitori and had to rely on technical skill to defeat his heavier opponents. According to his Japan Sumo Association profile Satoyama favoured yotsu-sumo, fighting on the mawashi or belt. His preferred grip was listed as hidari- yotsu, with his right hand outside and left hand inside his opponent's arms. He is known for his underarm throw, or shitatenage. However, his most common winning kimarite was actually oshi-dashi, or push out. Personal life Satoyama was married in September 2012 and the wedding reception was held the following February, with Kitanoumi and Hakuho among the 500 guests. His wife also has an amateur sumo background, and is a former winner of the Women's Asian Championships.

History  On March 3, 2006, in compliance with a court order from District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, the DoD released 57 files that contained transcripts from the Guantanamo Bay inmates' Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRT) and Administrative Review Board hearings. These transcripts were only identified by the prisoners' ISNs. On April 20, 2006, the DoD released the first of two official lists of captives, which contained the captives' ISNs, names, and nationalities. That list provided information about the 558 Guantanamo captives whom the DoD acknowledges were held in Guantanamo in August 2004 and whose status as \\"enemy combatants\\" was confirmed or disputed by a CSRT. On May 15, 2006, the DoD released a longer list of 759 individuals, which they asserted listed all those who had been held military custody at Guantanamo. The two lists contain incompatible names for numerous individuals. Several dozen men who are known to have been held in Guantanamo are not present on either official list. A ghost detainee originally known only as Triple X was not assigned an ISN because his secret imprisonment was requested by the Central Intelligence Agency. On January 16, 2010, the DoD published a list of 645 captives who were held in the Bagram Theater internment facility, in Afghanistan. Historian Andy Worthington, author of The Guantanamo Files: The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America's Illegal Prison, published an annotated version of the list, in which he noted that the numbers were not always assigned sequentially. Three former Guantanamo captives were re-apprehended after their release, and are held in Bagram under their original ISN.

A capable soldier and administrator, he consolidated Muslim rule in the area and expanded the Caliphate's border to include most of Transoxiana. From 705 to he consolidated Muslim control over the native principalities of Tokharistan and conquered the principality of Bukhara, while in 710‚Äì712 he conquered Khwarizm and completed the conquest of Sogdiana with the capture of Samarkand. The latter opened the road to the Jaxartes valley, and during the last years of his life Qutayba led annual campaigns there, extending Muslim control up to the Fergana Valley. To increase his strained manpower, Qutayba initiated the wide-scale levy of native Khurasani and Transoxianian soldiers who fought alongside the Arab Muslim troops. Following Walid's death, Qutayba, insecure of his position under the new regime, rebelled but failed to secure the support of his army, and was killed. Most of his conquests in Transoxiana were lost in the years after his death; only in the 740s was the Muslim position restored to the line reached by Qutayba, and only after the Battle of Talas in 751 did the region come solidly under Muslim control. Origin and early life Qutayba was born in 669 CE in Basra, to an influential family of the Bahila tribe. His father, Muslim ibn  øAmr, had enjoyed the favour of the Umayyads, but fought for their enemy Mus'ab ibn al- Zubayr at the Battle of Maskin during the close of the Second Muslim Civil War. He was killed in the fighting, but while he lay wounded he obtained assurances of safety for Qutayba from Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. Qutayba rose at first as the protege of Anbasa ibn Sa'id, but was noticed by the powerful governor of Iraq and the East, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, during the suppression of the revolt of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath in 700/701. Under al-Hajjaj's patronage, he took Rayy from the rebel Umar ibn Abi'l-Salt in 701, and became the city's governor. Then, in late 704 or early 705, Abd al-Malik appointed Qutayba as governor of Khurasan. The choice of Qutayba, who hailed from the relatively weak Bahila tribe, was intended by al- Hajjaj to heal the destructive feud between the South Arab or \\"Yemeni\\" (Azd and Rabi'ah) and North Arab (Qaysi) tribal confederations in Khurasan by providing a governor who did not belong to either. The Bahila were neutral between the two groups, but generally allied themselves to the Qays, thus furthering al-Hajjaj's policy of emasculating Azdi power, which had been dominant in Khurasan during the governorship of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab. Furthermore, as Qutayba lacked a strong tribal base of his own, he could be expected to remain firmly attached to his patron. Qutayba would spend the next ten years of his life in Central Asia, consolidating and expanding Muslim rule there. In this endeavour, both his military and diplomatic and organisational abilities came him in good stead; most importantly, he was able to enlist the support of the local Iranian population and the powerful (the Iranian \\"gentry\\") class. Conquests in Central Asia The Arabs had reached Central Asia in the decade after their decisive victory in the Battle of Nihavend in 642, when they completed their conquest of the former Sassanid Empire by seizing Sistan and Khurasan. The first Arab attacks across the Oxus ranged as far as Shash (Tashkent) and Khwarizm, but they were little more than raids aiming at seizing booty and extracting tribute, and were interrupted by the intertribal warfare that broke out in Khurasan during the Second Fitna (683‚Äì692). Subsequent governors, most notably Sa'id ibn Uthman and al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra, made attempts to conquer territory across the river, but they failed. The native princes, for their part, tried to exploit the Arabs' rivalries, and with the aid of the Arab renegade Musa ibn Abdallah ibn Khazim, who in 689 seized the fortress of Tirmidh for his own domain, they managed to eject the Arabs from their holdings. Nevertheless, the Transoxianian princes remained riven by their own feuds, and failed to unite in the face of the Arab conquest, a fact which would be suitably exploited by Qutayba after 705. =Conquest of Tokharistan and Bukhara= Map of Khurasan, Transoxiana and Tokharistan The first task which Qutayba set himself was the suppression of the rebellion in Lower Tokharistan, which was accomplished swiftly with the reconquest of Balkh. Qutayba then secured the submission of the local princes in the upper Oxus valley, most notably of Tish, king of al-Saghaniyan, who invited Qutayba to aid him in his dispute with the ruler of nearby Akharun (or Akhrun) and Shuman, in the northern mountainous districts of Tokharistan. After extensive negotiations led by Sulaym the Persian, the tarkhan Nizak, ruler of the Hephthalite principality of Badghis, surrendered to Qutayba, and pledged to accompany him in his expeditions. In 706‚Äì709, Qutayba occupied himself with the long and bloody conquest of Sogdia. The Sogdians were at the time divided by civil war in which Bukhara had been seized by the ruler of nearby Wardana, the Wardan Khudah, while another local magnate, Khunuk Khudah, had declared himself king of Bukhara (Bukhar Khudah). Taking advantage of the conflict, Qutayba was able to easily capture the city of after a two-month siege. He left a small garrison there and departed, but the inhabitants launched a revolt soon after. The Arab army then turned back and proceeded to sack the city. The men of fighting age were executed, the women and children sold off as slaves, and enormous booty amassed, especially in armour and weapons, which equipped the Arab army. The brutal punishment meted out to Baykand shocked the region: the Sogdians patched up their quarrels and the Sogdian princes of Kish and Nasaf united behind the Wardan Khudah. Arab accounts mention the participation of Turgesh troops as well, but this is probably an anachronism. In the campaign of 707, Qutayba was able to capture two outlying towns, Tumuskath and Ramithana, before he was threatened in his rear by the allied Sogdian army. Qutayba avoided a battle, and engaged in negotiations to gain time, before executing a rapid retreat to safety through the Iron Gate to beyond the Oxus, crossing the river at Tirmidh. The campaign of 708 was also a failure, which drew the ire of al-Hajjaj. For 709, al-Hajjaj drew up a new plan for his subordinate: the Arabs launched a direct attack on Bukhara, which caught the alliance‚Äîpossibly weakened by the death of its leader, the Wardan Khudah‚Äîby surprise. The city was taken by storm, a tribute of 200,000 dirhams imposed, and an Arab garrison installed. In its direct aftermath, Tarkhun, the ruler of Samarkand sent envoys to Qutayba and became a tributary vassal to the Caliphate. This success was followed however by the rebellion in the autumn of 709 of much of Lower Tokharistan under Nizak of Badhgis, with the support of the principalities of Yalqan and Faryab, and the city of Balkh. In an effort to raise the entire region in revolt, Nizak also forced the nominal suzerain of Tokharistan, the Yabghu, to join the uprising. The year was too advanced for a direct confrontation and the Muslim levy-based army mostly disbanded, but Qutayba ordered his brother Abd al-Rahman to take the garrison of Merv, some 12,000 men, and head to Balkh to secure the Muslim position there. This move proved effective in discouraging the rebellion of more local princes, and in spring, Abd al-Rahman was able to re-establish Muslim control over Tokharistan almost without bloodshed. Most of the rebel rulers fled or capitulated, and finally, Nizak was captured and executed on al-Hajjaj's orders, despite promises of pardon, while the Yabghu was exiled to Damascus and kept there as a hostage. Tokharistan was more firmly incorporated into the Caliphate, as Arab district representatives were appointed alongside the local princes, who were gradually relegated to secondary positions. Qutayba's brother Abd al-Rahman ibn Muslim was installed with a garrison near Balkh to oversee the affairs of the province. Despite the swift end of Nizak's revolt, the king of Shuman and Akharun decided to rebel as well. Qutayba led his forces against him, besieged his citadel and took it. The king fell in battle, and his supporters were executed. Qutayba then marched west over the Iron Gate, taking Kish and Nasaf and visiting Bukhara, where he settled relations between the Arabs and the locals, installed the young Sogdian prince Tughshada in the position of Bukhar Khudah and established an Arab military colony in the city. Later, in 712/713, Qutayba built a mosque in the city's citadel, but although the Arab authorities encouraged the conversion of the native population by paying them to attend prayers, Islamization proceeded slowly. At the same time, Qutayba began to adopt a measure that marked a radical departure from previous practice in the East: he ordered the raising of native Khurasani auxiliary levies, usually some ten to twenty thousand strong and mostly composed of non-converts, to supplement the Arab tribal army, the . This measure was later expanded to include the newly conquered territories in Sogdiana and Khwarizm. Gibb suggests that this move may be seen as an answer to the need for more troops to control the conquered territories and continue Muslim expansion, as well as a means of placing the local manpower in Arab service and depleting it at the same time, reducing the risk of anti-Arab revolts. Gibb also suggests that the creation of an indigenous force may have been an attempt by Qutayba to establish a power base of his own. From , Qutayba also appears to have recruited a special corps, known as the \\"Archers\\", from among the Khurasani, Tokharian and Sogdian nobility. Their skill was such that they were known as (\\"archers who pierce the pupils of the eyes\\"), and they apparently served as a bodyguard. Among the local Khurasani converts, Hayyan an-Nabati emerged as the foremost leader, and appears frequently in Tabari's account both as the main military leader of the Khurasani conscripts and as chief negotiator with the Sogdians. Later in 711, al-Hajjaj ordered Qutayba to march against the Hephthalite kingdom of Zabulistan, whose ruler, titled Zunbil, had long remained an indomitable thorn in the Arabs' side and menaced their province of Sistan. Repeated expeditions against him had failed, and a truce had been agreed in exchange for tribute. In addition, the existence of a free Zabulite kingdom was a threat to the security of Muslim control over the Hephthalite principalities of Tokharistan, who might be encouraged to seek support from it. Thus Qutayba led a large army south, but the Zunbil readily offered his submission and the payment of tribute. Satisfied with this easy success, and unwilling to hazard a campaign in the mountains of Zabulistan, Qutayba departed. No garrisons were installed, and as soon as the Arab army had departed, the Zunbil ceased the payment of tribute. Qutayba's victories, parallel with the conquests of Muhammad ibn Qasim in northwestern India, awoke such enthusiasm and hopes among the Muslims that al-Hajjaj is reputed to have offered the governorship of China to whomever of the two first reached it. =Conquest of Khwarizm and the expeditions in the Jaxartes valley= Taking advantage of Qutayba's absence in the south, the inhabitants of Samarkand overthrew their ruler Tarkhun due to his passive stance towards the Arabs, and installed the prince Ghurak in his stead. As Qutayba prepared to march against Samarkand during the winter of 711/712, he received envoys from the king of Khwarizm (the Khwarizmshah). Khwarizm had been previously subdued in the mid-690s by Umayya ibn Abdallah, but as soon as his forces departed, the Khwarizmshah had renounced the treaty, and subsequent efforts by Yazid ibn al-Muhallab against Khwarizm had failed. The Khwarizmshah, whose name is given as Jigan or Chigan by Bal'ami, faced a rebellion by his younger brother Khurrazadh and a powerful rival, the king of Khamjird, and asked Qutayba for help, offering recognition of the Caliphate's suzerainty, money, livestock and the payment of tribute in exchange. Qutayba, after announcing that he would head for Sogdia, advanced with his troops in a lightning campaign to the Khwarizmian capital Hazarasp. His brother Abd al- Rahman defeated and killed Khamjird's troops in battle and took 4,000 prisoners, who were then executed. Khurrazadh and his followers were also captured and executed. The Khwarizmians however rebelled shortly after Qutayba's departure and killed the Khwarizmshah. Qutayba replaced the governor, Iyas ibn Abdallah ibn Amr, with his own brother Abdallah ibn Muslim, but the revolt persisted until, after the capture of Samarkand, a strong force under al-Mughir ibn Abdallah could be sent to subdue the region. The local Afrighid dynasty was left in place, with Askajamuk II, the son of Azkajwar II, as the new Khwarizmshah, but the conquest of Khwarizm was accompanied by great brutality: the 11th-century Khwarizmian scholar al-Biruni compares the events with a barbarian sack, as the Arabs proceeded to massacre most of the upper classes who had fomented the revolt, and destroyed a great many objects of Khwarizmian culture, including manuscripts. After leaving Khwarizm, Qutayba initially turned towards Merv, for his army had grown weary and demanded an end to the campaign. During the march, however, Qutayba suddenly turned the army around towards Samarkand. The Sogdians had disbanded most of their forces, and the Arabs, reinforced with levies from Bukhara and Khwarizm, were able to brush aside the local resistance and advance straight to the city itself and lay siege to it. Ghurak and the inhabitants of the city resisted the Arabs with determination, and called upon the rulers of Shash and the Ferghana Valley for aid. The ruler of Shash indeed sent a strong army to aid them, but it was ambushed and destroyed by the Arabs. The news of this arrived at the time where the Arab siege weapons had effected a breach in the city walls, forcing Ghurak to sue for peace. Qutayba initially granted surprisingly lenient terms: the payment of an annual tribute and the provision of an auxiliary corps as with Bukhara and Khwarizm, as well as the construction of a mosque inside the city and the celebration of prayers there by the Arab army. Once inside the city however, Qutayba proceeded to occupy and garrison it. One of his brothers (accounts differ between Abd al-Rahman and Abdallah) was left as governor, and orders were given prohibiting any non-Muslim access to the city citadel. Ghurak and his retinue left the city and founded a new town, Farankath, further to the north. This treachery enabled Qutayba to bring most of Transoxiana under his (albeit tentative) control, but it also considerably tarnished his prestige among the Sogdians. Arab sources indicate that at about his time, the Sogdian princes called upon the Western Turks or the Turgesh for help against the Arabs, although the chronology and veracity of these accounts is open to question. At any rate, over the next two years Qutayba engaged in an effort to push the Caliphate's borders further and gain control of the Jaxartes valley. A large force, supported by some 20,000 Transoxianian levies, marched into the valley in early 713. The native levies were dispatched against Shash, which was reportedly taken, while Qutayba with the Arabs marched in the direction of Khujand and Ferghana. Little is known of these expeditions, although successful battles are recorded before Khujand and at Minak in Ushrusana, and the dispatch of an Arab embassy to the Chinese court is verified by Chinese sources. Al-Tabari reports that Qutayba marched into Chinese-held territory up to Kashgar, but this claim is dismissed by modern scholars. In 714, Qutayba renewed his expeditions along the Jaxartes, probably with Shash as his base, but his campaign was cut short upon receiving the news of the death of al-Hajjaj. Unsure of his position now that his patron was gone, he disbanded the army and returned to Merv. =Rebellion and death= Caliph Walid quickly re-confirmed Qutayba as governor, and even made his province independent from the governor of Iraq, but Qutayba's position was not secure: the Arab army was tired of constant campaigning and was still riven by factional rivalries, while Qutayba himself had alienated the most powerful Arab tribal groups. He was generally popular among the native Iranians, but the leader of the native auxiliaries, Hayyan an-Nabati, had secretly turned against him. Qutayba was completely unaware of the situation however, and began preparations for the campaign of 715, during which he intended to finally capture the Ferghana Valley and complete the subjugation of the Jaxartes valley. His only concern was that his old rival, Yazid ibn al- Muhallab, might be restored to the Caliph's favour after al-Hajjaj's death, and he took few precautions except for removing his family and belongings from Merv to Shash and placing a guard on the Oxus. His campaign against Ferghana was under way when news reached the army of Caliph Walid's death and the accession of his brother Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik to the throne. The new Caliph was a bitter enemy of Qutayba, for the latter had argued in favour of excluding him from the succession. Although Sulayman re-confirmed him in his position as governor, Qutayba feared that he would soon be removed. At the last, after negotiations with the new regime in Damascus failed, Qutayba resolved to rebel. The Khurasani Arabs refused to support him, and the native auxiliaries, although favourably disposed towards him, were prevented from declaring their support by Hayyan al-Nabati. Only his family, his fellow Bahili tribesmen and his bodyguard, the Archers, remained faithful. The opposition, led by the Tamim tribe, coalesced around their leader Waki ibn Abi Sud al-Tamimi. In August 715 (according to al-Tabari) or early 716 (according to Ibn Qutaybah), Qutayba and other members of his family were killed at Ferghana by Arab soldiers. Waki ibn Abi Sud succeeded him as governor, and ordered the army to return to Merv, where it was disbanded. After Qutayba's death, the Arab position in Transoxiana swiftly crumbled. His successors did not command his prestige among the local population and were unable to maintain his conquests in the face of local revolts and invasion by the Turgesh khaganate, and most of Transoxiana was abandoned or became hotly contested territory in the years after his death. During this period, the Arabs suffered the grave defeats of the \\"Day of Thirst\\" and the Battle of the Pass and were weakened by internal conflicts as well. Only after 738, under Nasr ibn Sayyar, were the Umayyads able to restore the Caliphate's control over most of Transoxiana, and only with the decisive victory of the new Abbasid Caliphate against the Chinese armies at the Battle of Talas in 751 did the local princes accept Muslim control as final. In the south too, the Zunbil of Zanbulistan ceased his payment of tribute to the Caliphate and remained resolutely independent for decades after. Qutayba's role in the conquest and gradual Islamization of Central Asia was crucial, and in later times, a number of locations in Ferghana where his tomb was supposedly located (Narshakhi and Jamal Qarsh) were venerated by pilgrims. His descendants too continued to hold influential positions: his son Qatan served as governor of Bukhara, Salm, another son, governed Basra and Rayy, and his nephew Muslim was governor of Balkh. His grandsons, especially the numerous sons of Salm, continued in high office under the Abbasids until well into the 9th century.

Munro played for Dundee United and Aberdeen in his native Scotland before moving to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1968. Here he won a League Cup winners medal while with the club, and played in the first-ever UEFA Cup Final. He was posthumously inducted into the Wolverhampton Wanderers Hall of Fame in 2017. Career =Early= Munro started his career as a centre-forward with Chelsea at junior and amateur level in 1961‚Äì62, after leaving school, but he left without signing professional forms. Following this, he returned home to his native Scotland and signed as a professional for Dundee United. He broke into the first team in 1964 and won four Scotland youth caps during his time at Tannadice. In October 1966, he moved to fellow Division 1 outfit Aberdeen for ¬£10,000. His first season proved a success as he collected a runners-up medal as the team fought its way through to the 1967 Scottish Cup Final, losing 0‚Äì2 to Celtic at Hampden Park. This was sufficient to qualify for Europe though, and they competed in the Cup Winners' Cup the following season, giving Munro his first ‚Äì but not last ‚Äì taste of European football. Munro scored Aberdeen's first goal in European competition, in a 10‚Äì1 win against KR Reykjavik. In the summer of 1967, Munro and Aberdeen travelled to America to compete in the newly formed United Soccer Association league. Due to the lack of existing teams, the league organisers instead imported several established teams from around the globe to compete under 'franchise' names. Aberdeen competed as the \\"Washington Whips\\", based in the capital. The Whips won the Eastern division and so progressed through to the championship play-off match in July, where they faced the Western champions, Los Angeles Wolves (represented by Wolverhampton Wanderers). The Whips eventually lost 5‚Äì6 in extra time, but Munro's performance in scoring a hat-trick, caught the eye of the opposition manager Ronnie Allen. =Wolverhampton Wanderers= In October 1968, Wolves acted upon this display and signed Munro for ¬£55,000. Munro went on to play 371 times in total for the club, becoming firmly established at centre back, despite signing as a midfielder. He also chipped in with 18 goals in total, including scoring in both legs of the 1972 UEFA Cup semi final defeat of Ferencv√°ros and played in the final, collecting another runners-up medal after a 2‚Äì3 aggregate defeat to Spurs. Munro didn't have to wait too long though for a winners' medal as Wolves lifted the 1974 League Cup, after a 2-1 victory over Manchester City at Wembley. The Wolves also won the Texaco Cup in 1971. His performances for Wolves also won him nine Scotland caps ‚Äì as well as four at under-23 level ‚Äì spread from 1971 to 1975. His full debut coming on 18 May 1971 against Northern Ireland. His last appearance for Scotland was in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Romania in Bucharest. Shortly after helping the Midlanders to regain their First Division status in 1976‚Äì77 ‚Äî after a year outside it ‚Äì Munro returned to Scotland when the lure of Celtic proved too strong. He signed after a short loan period in December 1977 for ¬£20,000. Munro was the last player Jock Stein signed as Celtic manager. =Later life= Stein saw Munro as being a replacement for the injured Pat Stanton. His time in Glasgow was to prove short-lived, however. Despite picking up another runners-up medal (in the 1978 Scottish League Cup), Celtic only finished fifth in the Scottish Premier Division. Munro was released by Celtic in the summer of 1978 and he headed for a new challenge in Australia by signing for South Melbourne Hellas, managed by former Wolves goalkeeper Dave MacLaren. Although initially this was only planned as a short-term arrangement, he ended up moving there permanently. During the 1980s Munro took up a player/coach role at Albion Rovers, before retiring as a player. He later managed Hamlyn Rangers (now known as Geelong Rangers F.C.) and Keilor Park (formerly Keilor Austria). He returned to the UK in 1991 and settled in Wolverhampton, with his partner Naomi. He suffered a stroke in the early 2000s that left him confined to a wheelchair for his remaining life. He died on 16 August 2011 after suffering acute breathing difficulties.

She was a daughter of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282‚Äì1328) and Irene of Montferrat. In Medieval Serbia Simonida is best remembered as a patron of the Arts, Music and Literature.  Life  Simonida was born in Constantinople ca. 1294. In 1298, as a result of a Byzantine defeat, Emperor Andronikos II promised a marriage alliance to the Serbian ruler Milutin. Initially, Andronikos II intended to wed his sister Eudokia, the empress-dowager of Trebizond, but after she refused, Simonida was proposed instead. Church circles in Constantinople opposed the marriage, but the emperor was determined to push the deal through, and in late 1298 he sent his trusted minister Theodore Metochites to Serbia to conduct the negotiations. On his part, Milutin too was eager to accept, and even divorced his third wife, Ana Terter, the daughter of the Bulgarian tsar George Terter. Simonida was five years old, and Milutin was almost 50, was married three times, with adult children. The marriage was celebrated in Thessalonica in spring 1299, and the couple departed for Serbia in April. As a wedding present, Byzantines recognized Serbian rule north of the line Ohrid‚ÄîPrilep‚Äî≈†tip. According to some Byzantine sources Milutin did not wait until Simonida reached maturity before consummating their relationship, causing damage to her uterus and preventing her from ever carrying children. When this became known, Empress Irene, who was Andronikos II's second wife and had hoped to use the Serbian marriage to advance her own progeny, then offered Milutin to adopt one of her own sons as his heir. Simonida showed great interest in theology at a rather young age and wanted to become a nun. After her mother Irene died in 1317, Simonida attended her funeral in Constantinople and decided not to return to Serbia after nearly a decade and a half of discussion. When Milutin's men came for her, she came to them in monastic habit. They were shocked, but her own half-brother Constantine Palaiologos took off her monastic habit and ordered her to take the civil dress. He then sent her to Serbia with Milutin's men, although she was reluctant to go. After Milutin threatened to start a war, Simonida came back to him. She was 22 years old. When Milutin fell ill, she was beside him all the time, much to the surprise of the rest of the court. Milutin died on 19 October 1321, and already on 29 October, Simonida returned to Constantinople, where she entered the monastery of Saint Andrew in Krisei as a nun. There is very little information about her later life. It is known that she order a funeral song for her father's funeral. Simonida was last mentioned in historical documents in 1336 as an attendee at an assembly of civil and religious dignitaries, who prosecuted the conspirators against the government. She died some time after 1345.  Legacy  Her beauty was well known, and she was known as a figure of purity and beauty in Serbian tradition. A fresco of her in Graƒçanica monastery is regarded as one of the most valuable frescoes in Serbian art. Unfortunately, the fresco is partly ruined, so that Simonida has no eyes. She brought a large entourage to Serbia, and with her arrival, Serbia received a massive injection of Byzantine culture. Byzantine-style court ceremonials and dress were adopted, Byzantine functional and honorary titles appeared, court offices were renamed, and Byzantine administrative, fiscal and legal institutions were copied. Byzantinization was further expanded by Serbia's newly won populous Greek-speaking regions, in which Milutin retained all former Byzantine political, social and cultural activities. Strangely enough, none of this would have happened due to a near-death experience in 1303 during a small festival being held in Ras. A maid had nearly killed her by jumping off a known balcony but had failed to do so.The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism by D. Hupchick, page 89 Milan Rakiƒá wrote a lyric poem about her named Simonida, and Milutin Bojiƒá wrote a psychological drama called Kraljeva Jesen (\\"King's autumn\\") about her. Asteroid 1675 Simonida discovered by Serbian astronomer Milorad B. Protiƒá was named after her.

These are commonly repeated by organizations which oppose all classified drug use, often causing the true effects and dangers of drugs to be misunderstood and less scrutinized. The most common subjects of such false beliefs are LSD, cannabis, and MDMA. These misconceptions include misinformation about adulterants or other black market issues, as well as alleged effects of the pure substances. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) Some of the strangest urban legends told are those about lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a potent psychedelic drug that gained popularity in several countries in the 1960s and 1970s, and experienced a resurgence in the mid 2010s to present. The drug's relation to the 1960s counterculture was likely part of the reason for such legends. =Babysitter places baby in the oven while high on LSD= This is an unverifiable drug-scare story dating to the 1960s of a hippie babysitter girl putting a baby in the oven and a turkey in the bassinet. It has been debunked by Snopes.com. This myth is parodied in The Simpsons episode \\"The Secret War of Lisa Simpson,\\"episode 4F21, The Simpsons Archive - ref date: May 29, 2010 in which the children go on a school field trip to a \\"scared straight\\" wax museum at the local police station. One exhibit contains a wax dummy of a hippie woman eating a sandwich with a baby in it. Chief Wiggum says \\"That's right, she's got the munchies for a California Cheeseburger!\\" In May 2009, partial ostension of this legend may have occurred when an Ohio man high on PCP allegedly tried to put his 28-day- old son into a conventional oven, only to be stopped in time by the child's mother. Also, in March 2010, a Kentucky man put his five-week-old baby in an oven (without turning it on, and without any injury) while drunk and high on marijuana (that he had smoked earlier that night) that he alleged made him feel strange and suspected of being laced with a different drug that made him hallucinate; he was also tired from working. In 2005 China Arnold murdered her near month-old baby with a microwave oven, but she claimed to be under the influence of alcohol, not LSD. There are a limited number of cases reported in which babies were put into microwaves, though these cases were not known to involve any drugs. These were often cases of deliberate infanticide. However, there have been no known cases of microwaving (or baking) babies involving LSD specifically, or any other psychedelic drug, including cannabis. There are, however, many reported cases of psychotic violence under the influence of PCP (see below). PCP is not related to LSD. =Bad LSD= A \\"bad trip\\" is easily caused by an expectation or fear of ill effects, which may later be blamed on \\"bad acid.\\" This legend was made famous at the 1969 Woodstock festival, when concert-goers were warned to stay away from \\"the brown acid\\", which was allegedly bad.No brown acid: Woodstock anniversary concert draws a cell phone crowd, Associated Press Archive - August 15, 1998 One possible reason people believe that they had \\"bad acid\\" could be because they were simply sold a much higher dose than usual, which is not uncommon due to the inherent lack of quality control of illicit drugs, and with LSD in particular being effective at microgram rather than milligram doses. The stronger the dose, the stronger and potentially more anxiety-provoking the trip can get. However, drugs sometimes falsely represented by sellers as LSD in the 1970s were actually PCP, amphetamine, or other drugs that have quite different, and often unfavorable, effects from LSD, causing unwitting users to incorrectly attribute a \\"bad trip\\" to LSD. There are now many research chemicals (DOB 2C-I, DOC, DOI, etc.) that can be nearly indistinguishable from real LSD before use, and thus can be easily confused with \\"bad acid.\\" Some of these, such as 25I-NBOMe are even potent enough for psychoactive doses to fit on blotter paper, and may occasionally be sold as LSD when the latter is scarce. The idea of adulterating blotter LSD with these chemicals, however, has no known basis in fact. =\\"Bananadine\\" LSD= The false claim states that it is possible to synthesize LSD or some similar hallucinogenic drug called \\"bananadine\\" from banana peels or other common household foods and chemicals. The actual synthesis of LSD usually requires advanced knowledge and experience in organic chemistry and requires both expensive laboratory equipment and expensive, carefully controlled precursor chemicals. Originating from a recipe originally published as a hoax in the Berkeley Barb in March 1967,Will smoking banana peels get you high? The Straight Dope, April 26, 2002 variants of this legend often circulate on the Internet and were popular on BBSs well before the widespread availability of Internet access through William Powell's \\"The Anarchist Cookbook.\\" This book claimed \\"Musa sapientum Bananadine\\" was a mild psychoactive drug found in banana peels. The slang terms \\"mellow yellow\\" and \\"saffron\\" (for the color of the peels) were borrowed from the 1966 Donovan song, \\"Mellow Yellow,\\" perhaps because the phrase \\"electrical banana\\" is mentioned in one of the lines. According to The Rolling Stone Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, Donovan claimed he was actually referring to a banana-shaped vibrator. The song itself, despite its \\"psychedelic\\" feel, was written about Donovan's bout with hepatitis (which causes jaundice). =Blue star tattoos= One popular legend is the blue star tattoo legend. This legend frequently surfaces in American elementary and middle schools in the form of a flyer that has been photocopied through many generations, which is distributed to parents by concerned school officials. It has also become popular on Internet mailing lists and websites. This legend states that a temporary lick- and-stick tattoo soaked in LSD and made in the form of a blue star, or of popular children's cartoon characters, is being distributed to children in the area in order to get them addicted to LSD. The flyer lists an inaccurate description of the effects of LSD, some attribution (typically to a well- regarded hospital or a vaguely specified \\"adviser to the president\\"), and instructs parents to contact police if they come across the blue star tattoos. No actual cases of LSD distribution to children in this manner have ever been documented. LSD is not addictive, and it is unlikely to be abused by an unwitting user. Therefore, there is no plausible motivation for a drug dealer to distribute LSD in this manner. =Legally insane= There is an urban legend that a person who has used LSD more than seven times is automatically declared legally insane. The same claim is often suggested with large doses, the difference being that the person is considered psychotic only for the duration of the trip. An extension of this legend is that a person who does LSD more than \\"X number of times\\" is permanently disqualified from the military as a result of being \\"legally insane,\\" a version which was likely inspired by wishful thinking of drug-using draft dodgers in the 1960s. However, no such law exists, at least not in the United States. However, the United States Air Force has regulations limiting and prohibiting recruitment of pre-service drug users, including prohibition of proven or admitted LSD users. A version of this legend was repeated as fact on TV's Dragnet series in 1967, in an episode revolving around the use of LSD before it was made illegal. The script described a shipment containing \\"one pound of LSD [tabs], enough to turn the entire population of Los Angeles into dangerous psychotics\\" on the premise that one dose made a person legally insane due to the recurrence of completely unpredictable flashbacks throughout the user's life after a single dose. =LSD causes genetic mutations= Beginning in 1967, studies raised concerns that LSD might produce genetic damage or developmental abnormalities in fetuses. However, these initial reports were based on in vitro studies or were poorly controlled and have not been substantiated. In studies of chromosomal changes in human users and in monkeys, the balance of evidence suggests no increase in chromosomal damage. For example, white blood cells of people who had been given LSD in a clinical setting were examined for visible chromosomal abnormalities; overall, there appeared to be no lasting changes. Several studies have been conducted using illicit LSD users and provide a less clear picture. Interpretation of this data is generally complicated by factors such as the unknown chemical composition of street LSD, concurrent use of other psychoactive drugs, and diseases such as hepatitis in the sampled populations. It seems possible that the small number of genetic abnormalities reported in users of street LSD is either coincidental or related to factors other than a toxic effect of pure LSD. A 2008 medical review concluded, \\"The available data suggest that pure LSD does not cause chromosomal abnormalities, spontaneous abortions, or congenital malformations.\\" However, this refutation has not stopped this perennial legend from being told, nor has it stopped the jokes about such \\"mutations\\" allegedly messing up the children of the Baby Boomers. =Man permanently thinks he is a glass of orange juice (or thinks he becomes an orange)= Another common legend, again dating back to the 1960s, was that a man who took LSD went insane and permanently thought that he was a glass of orange juice. Because of this, he could never bend over, slept upright and did not make any sudden movements over fear of being \\"spilt\\". Alternative versions sometimes have the man thinking he is a glass of milk or a whole orange. Another version of this myth states that the man believed he had become an orange, and was afraid he would be 'peeled' by his friends. =Police officer unwittingly drinks LSD= In this legend, which dates back to 1970, a police (or customs) officer pulls over a driver believed to have been drinking, sees that the driver has a water bottle, and demands a taste of it to see if it contains alcohol. The officer does not taste any alcohol, so the driver either gets off completely or merely gets a speeding ticket. Shortly afterward, the officer begins tripping very hard and stares into space, since the swig of \\"water\\" he took actually contained numerous \\"hits\\" of LSD. In some versions of the legend, the officer consumes enough LSD to actually go insane. According to Snopes.com, there are no verifiable reports of this ever happening, even decades after the legend was first told, and it is thus considered spurious. =\\"Permatripping\\" and retention of LSD in spinal fluid= This legend may have its foundation in the fact that chronic use can result in flashbacks and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). There remains no consensus regarding the nature and causes of HPPD or flashbacks. A study of 44 HPPD subjects who had previously ingested LSD showed EEG abnormalities. Given that some symptoms have environmental triggers, it may represent a failure to adjust visual processing to changing environmental conditions. There are no explanations for why only some individuals develop HPPD. Those affected by HPPD are not psychotic, as they clearly recognize the unrealistic nature of their visual disturbances. Explanations in terms of LSD physically remaining in the body for months or years after consumption have been discounted by experimental evidence. LSD is metabolized by the liver, and has an elimination half-life of around 2.5 to 4 hours. =Strychnine= Anti-drug educators frequently tell their students some variant on the theme of inevitable strychnine poisoning through LSD use, for example, that strychnine is commonly sold as a cheaper substitute for LSD by unscrupulous drug dealers; that strychnine is a byproduct of LSD synthesis; that the body produces strychnine as a result of LSD metabolism; or that strychnine is used as a preservative to prevent the otherwise natural, rapid decomposition of LSD, allowing it to be stored; or that strychnine is somehow necessary to bond LSD to blotter paper. None of this is true.Braden, William. The Private Sea: LSD and the Search for God. New York: Quadrangle Books, 1967. ASIN B0006BQD7C These claims may even be believed and propagated by drug users themselves. In reality, most hallucinogens cause some degree of mental or physical discomfort after the \\"trip\\" is over. This is an indirect effect of the drug, not strychnine or any other adulterant. Additionally, strychnine is one of the most bitter substances known. The bitter taste can be detected at 1 part per million, which is well below the toxic level. Finally, the dangerous dose of strychnine is too high to be contained in a blotter square, even if the entire square were composed of the poison. Strychnine has indeed rarely been discovered mixed with LSD and other drugs in a few samples recovered by law enforcement agencies, but these were all found in murder or attempted murder investigations where someone was being specifically targeted for poisoning, and not associated with recreational LSD use. A related myth is that a new type of gang initiation requires the initiate to put a mixture of LSD and strychnine on the buttons of as many payphones as possible. This too is debunked by the urban legends website Snopes.com. =Sungazing while tripping= A popular legend dating back to the 1960s, it has been claimed that several people took LSD and stared at the sun, going blind as a result. This myth appeared in 1967 on the cop show Dragnet, and twice in the mainstream news media. The legend is considered to be unfounded, since in 1968 the source of the hoax, Norman M. Yoder, commissioner of the Office of the Blind in the Pennsylvania State Welfare Department, admitted that he had completely made up the story because of his \\"concern over illegal LSD use by children.\\" After the sun-gazing on LSD story was widely publicized, a small number of case reports were published in the medical literature which describe this phenomenon temporarily occurring. In one case, the patient was a teenage girl described as having a \\"hysterical personality\\" who heard warnings about staring at the sun under LSD in a school anti-drug lecture and thought this \\"would be a neat thing,\\" and in another case the patient had paranoid schizophrenia. Cannabis Many misleading urban legends about cannabis exist. Like LSD rumors, many were spread during the 1960s and 1970s, and are believed to continuously circulate today. These widespread legends claim that it is easy to overdose on the smokeable variant of cannabis and that it is extremely dangerous and addictive when compared to alcohol and tobacco. Withdrawal from heavy, chronic cannabis use does not usually exceed 3‚Äì4 days, but it has the potential to be psychologically addictive.IOM, 1999Mikuriya, 1972.Young, 1988.LaGuardia Comsn., NY Mayor's Report. 1944. Withdrawal symptoms are generally mild - loss of appetite, insomnia, feelings of uneasiness/anxiety, tension, stomach ache, headache and irritability all being common symptoms. There are studies that show no actual increased risk of cancer from smoking marijuana, even when duration of use is expanded over several years. In fact, some studies indicate THC to have anticancer properties, with studies showing tumor reduction in mice. =Confusion with Jimson weed= Historically, and possibly related to the \\"Reefer Madness\\" legend, some people (particularly Americans) had confused cannabis with Jimson weed (Datura stramonium). Jimson weed, which grows wild in the United States and several other countries, is a potent deliriant which can cause true hallucinations and delusions that are believed by the user to be real, as opposed to the pseudohallucinations and perceptual distortions typically caused by cannabis. Confusion could have resulted from the fact that Datura's common name contains the word \\"weed,\\" which is also a slang term for cannabis, and the fact that both plants (as well as others) have been given the moniker \\"locoweed\\" in the first half of the 20th century. Aside from these superficial similarities, the two plants are not related, do not resemble one another, and are very unlikely to be confused. Jimson weed is highly toxic and can cause delirium, confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, photophobia, dry mouth, urinary retention, hyperthermia, incoordination, hypertension, and rapid heartbeat among other effects. An overdose (or suspected overdose) on this substance is a medical emergency, as it can cause seizures, coma, or death by cardiac arrest.Deadly hallucinogenic weed sends 15 teens to hospital, CBC News, October 24, 2007 =\\"Flashbacks\\" due to release from fat cells= Similar to one of the most enduring myths about LSD, and also somewhat related to the \\"multi-day impairment\\" legend described further down on this list, this legend claims that residual THC stored in fat cells gets released spontaneously into the bloodstream in enough quantities to get one high again long after the last use of cannabis, be it days, weeks, or even months later. This legend is typically accompanied by anecdotal evidence of people who experience a \\"high\\" after doing exercise of some sort. While somewhat more biologically plausible than the discredited LSD legend due to the fat- solubility of THC, this phenomenon remains scientifically unproven. A 2009 study of rats that involved injecting them with large quantities of THC (equivalent to 5-10 joints per day in humans) each day for ten days straight, then subjecting them to simulated severe stress or food deprivation led to double the blood levels of THC-COOH two days after the last THC exposure compared to rats that were neither stressed nor deprived of food. If such results occurred in humans, then it is theoretically possible for a chronic cannabis user to fail a drug test long after the usual detection time due to exercise, dieting, or severe stress shortly before the test‚Äîand several anecdotal reports of this exist. However, there is currently no hard evidence that enough active THC would be released to get one \\"high\\" or cause \\"flashbacks.\\" One should also note that flashbacks from psychoactive drugs in general are now known to be psychological phenomena, and drug residues typically play no significant role in their occurrence and recurrence. As for the anecdotes about exercise, they likely experienced a \\"runner's high\\" due to their bodies releasing endorphins, which are endogenous opioid agonists, along with anandamide and other endogenous cannabinoid agonists. These flashbacks have also been reported after one has stretched or stood up/sat or laid down abruptly. In addition, some studies find that the body produces endocannabinoids such as anandamide during exercise, which may also explain such effects since they activate the same receptors as THC. =George Washington smoked cannabis= There is a common belief that George Washington (and/or other Founding Fathers such as Thomas Jefferson) used cannabis for its psychoactive or medicinal properties. This has even made its way into popular films such as Dazed and Confused. Both Washington and Jefferson grew cannabis to produce hemp, and Washington used hemp fiber to make clothes for his slaves, but there is no direct evidence that either Washington or Jefferson consumed it for its psychoactive properties. Washington is commonly mis-quoted as saying \\"Make the most of the Indian hemp seed, and sow it everywhere,\\" often cited as a note to his gardener published in The Washington Papers. However the closest phrase to this in The Washington Papers is in a letter to William Pearce ‚Äì \\"I am very glad to hear that the Gardener has saved so much of the St. foin seed, and that of the India Hemp. Make the most you can of both, by sowing them again in drills. [...] The Hemp may be sown any where.\\" In The Papers of George Washington, \\"hemp\\" is defined as Cannabis sativa grown for fiber, and \\"Indian hemp\\" typically refers to the closely related Cannabis indica. While Washington was growing cannabis for its fiber, both of these species are also cultivated for their psychoactive and medicinal properties. When cannabis is grown for its medicinal or psychoactive properties, male plants are routinely separated from females to prevent pollination, as non- pollinated female plants produce the most potent and prized flowering tops, known as sinsemilla (from the Spanish \\"sin semilla\\", meaning \\"without seed\\"). To produce sinsemilla, the sexes must be separated before pollination occurs. On August 7, 1765, Washington wrote in his diary \\"Began to separate the Male from the Female hemp at Do.‚Äì rather too late.\\" While this has been taken as evidence that Washington was growing cannabis for its psychoactive or medicinal properties, The Straight Dope points out that later entries in Washington's diary suggest that \\"he divided the plants because the males made stronger fiber while the female plants produced the seed needed for the next year's crop.\\" Two days after he wrote the aforementioned entry in his diary, Washington wrote that he had \\"put some Hemp in the Rivr. to Rot,\\" a technique called water retting used for producing hemp, not psychoactive cannabis. The following month he wrote that he \\"Began to Pull the Seed Hemp but it was not sufficiently ripe,\\" and three weeks later that the \\"Hempseed seems to be in good order for getting ‚Äì that is of a proper ripeness.\\" The introductory editorial for the June 2010 cannabinoid-themed issue of the British Journal of Pharmacology said that \\"there are sources that suggest that chronic tooth-ache may have led the first President of the United States, George Washington, to grow the plant for medicinal purposes,\\" though these sources are not cited. The cover of the issue featured images of Washington and Queen Victoria placed on either side of a cannabis leaf. = An allergic reaction to molecules found in marijuana killed Bruce Lee= A number of rumours surfaced surrounding the cause of action film star Bruce Lee's death in 1973, one of which was that he had been killed by the consumption of cannabis. Lee died of a cerebral edema several hours after taking the painkiller and muscle relaxant equagesic. His autopsy showed trace amounts of cannabis in his stomach, and he had been known to use cannabis. However, a doctor at the coroner's hearing was quoted as saying that the cannabis in Lee's stomach was \\"no more significant than if Bruce had drunk a cup of tea that day.\\" Lee's physician, Donald Langford, and Peter Wu, a doctor who had treated Lee for another edema ten weeks earlier, believed that the fatal edema could have been caused by a rare allergic reaction to an alkaloid in cannabis, as a large quantity of hashish was removed from his stomach during the earlier edema, and he had been warned not to use it again. Wu told the coroner he believed the death was due to hypersensitivity to either cannabis or equagesic. However, Ronald D. Teare, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of London who was flown in to be the chief expert in the coroner's report, said that it was both \\"irresponsible and irrational\\" to attribute either edema to cannabis, and concluded the fatal edema was due to a rare reaction to equagesic. Teare, who had supervised nearly 100,000 autopsies and provided evidence for nearly 20,000 inquests in his 35 years of experience, was echoed by R. R. Lycette, the clinical pathologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Lycette told the hearing that his death could not have been caused by cannabis, and that Lee had died from an edema caused by a reaction to one or both of the ingredients in equagesic. At the time in Hong Kong, Cannabis was seen in an extremely negative light ‚Äî worse than opium ‚Äî and was \\"considered a 'foreign' drug with sinister and evil undertones.\\" Bruce Thomas, author of Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit stated that \\"this view had a massive impact on the official findings,\\" and that Wu's inclusion of cannabis as a suspected cause of death \\"reflected this cultural and even political pressure.\\" Wu later said in a 1992 interview with Thomas: > Professor Teare was a forensic scientist recommended by Scotland Yard; he > was brought in as the expert, so we can't contradict his testimony. The > dosage of cannabis is neither precise nor predictable, but I've never known > anyone to die simply from taking it. Although it could not be completely ruled out that cannabis caused the edema, Teare's view was accepted by the coroner, and the official verdict was \\"death by misadventure\\" caused by a reaction to equigesic. Cannabis was not included as a possible cause of Lee's death. =Marijuana today is 10‚Äì20 times more potent than in the past= An oft-repeated legend is that today's cannabis is at least an order of magnitude stronger than in the past (and by implication much more dangerous). THC levels are allegedly 10, 20 or even 30 times higher than in the 1960s or 1970s. Although potency levels have risen in several countries (such as the US and UK), the actual increases have been much more modest (almost threefold from 1982 to 2007 in the US) and high-potency strains have always existed, as have various concentrated forms of cannabis. Furthermore, potency of seized samples was not tested before 1971, leaves were not distinguished from buds by testers at first, and samples from before the early 1980s (when testing and storage procedures were changed) were often degraded, making comparisons going that far back inaccurate. Non- representative sampling was also an issue.Marijuana Health Mythology , Dale Gieringer, Ph.D., June 1994 Since most of the increase happened after 2000, this legend can be considered an example of ostension (people have been making such claims as far back as the 1970s). A related claim, especially in the UK, is that the cannabidiol/THC ratio has decreased over the past few decades, resulting in a new and presumably more dangerous form of cannabis that never existed before (since CBD is thought to attenuate some of the negative side effects of THC). While there is little to no reliable data before 2005 on such ratios in the UK, making comparisons to the past impossible, the US data going back to the 1970s shows little to no clear trend, and there have always been strains with extremely low ratios. Ratios are also known to vary widely between strains and growing/harvesting methods. Some versions of this legend claim the potency change is due to \\"genetic modification,\\" a term which often evokes fear in the popular consciousness, but there is no hard evidence that anything other than selective breeding and enhanced growing techniques are behind the change. \\"Genetic modification\\" insofar as attempting to emphasize desirable traits by the practice of selective breeding is standard practice across many areas of farming, including the production of cannabis. It is likely that the term \\"genetic modification\\" is used by people who do not understand that selective breeding is not the same as genetic engineering. =Multi-day impairment= Another claim about cannabis is that impairment due to smoking it lasts many days after using it, since THC is stored in the fat cells, leading to a low-grade haze long after the primary high is gone. This myth is based primarily on anecdotal evidence and the known fact that urine drug tests remain positive for at least several days after using, and longer for regular users. The tests however measure non-psychoactive metabolites, not active THC. And the blood levels of THC generally fall well below the psychoactive threshold within 2‚Äì4 hours of smoking (4‚Äì8 hours after oral use). A cannabis equivalent of a hangover may occur the morning after taking high doses, but even that ends much sooner than the legend suggests. Although smoking cannabis on a Friday night would most likely test positive in a urinalysis Monday, no amount of the psychoactive effect would be retained by that time. One possible origin of this idea is the fact that some (but not all) studies with airline pilots have shown a modest decrease in capabilities on a flight simulator up to 24 hours after use of one fairly strong marijuana cigarette. In two of the four studies (one of which was not placebo- controlled) the ability of the pilots to safely navigate a simulated aircraft was apparently compromised somewhat up to 24 hours later, while the other two did not show any impairment beyond 4‚Äì8 hours.NORML's Marijuana Health Mythology, June 1994 by Dale Gieringer, Ph.D. Despite the inconsistent replication, these studies have led some experts to recommend drug testing of people in safety-sensitive jobs (pilots, bus drivers, etc.). In contrast, no driving studies have found any significant cannabis-related impairments lasting beyond 2‚Äì6 hours. It is also worth noting that the same research group that conducted three out of the four flight simulation studies on cannabis also conducted a similar study using alcohol. They found noticeable hangover- related impairment 14 hours after consuming enough alcohol to reach a BAC of 0.10, despite the fact that the BAC had returned to zero by that point. =Reefer madness= Originating in the 1930s, this myth was the basis for films like Reefer Madness, and used by Harry Anslinger of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics as justification for outlawing cannabis. The allegation was that even the calmest, most normal person could be transformed into a psychopathic killer or rapist solely from smoking a joint. No relationship has ever been proven linking such crimes to the acute intoxication of cannabis alone, and cannabis' psychological effects tend to be more associated with pacifism and inactivity than with aggression. For example, studies of the Jamaican working class showed no difference in the crime rates between users and non-user of cannabis.Perrine, Daniel M. The Chemistry of Mind-Altering Drugs: History, Pharmacology, and Cultural Context, American Chemical Society =Smoking or \\"chasing\\" cannabis with tobacco increases the high= In many places, cannabis is routinely mixed with tobacco when rolled into joints. In North America cannabis in any form is also often \\"chased\\" with a tobacco cigarette, and hollowed-out cigars filled with cannabis (blunts) are also popular in some subcultures. Some users say that smoking tobacco increases the cannabis high, and this is often attributed to either the nicotine or additives such as menthol. Until recently this was based solely on anecdotal evidence. There may be at least some truth to this legend, as a 2005 study found that a transdermal nicotine patch modestly enhanced the subjective \\"high\\" of cannabis relative to a placebo patch‚Äîbut only in males. Females actually saw a slight reduction in subjective effects. Reasons for the enhancement are not well understood, and this study appears to be the only one as of 2010 that found such effects. However, another study found a significant downside to the practice. It appears that tobacco, which is known to be highly addictive, also enhances the likelihood of developing cannabis dependence symptoms when the two substances are used concurrently. =Some Lucky Strike cigarettes contained cannabis= It has been claimed the cigarette brand Lucky Strike is so named because every so often, a consumer of the product would have a \\"lucky strike,\\" finding a cannabis spliff in a pack of cigarettes. The rumor varies in how often the cannabis cigarette would be included, anywhere from one in every thousand cartons to one in every pack. It is unclear when this myth originated; Snopes.com claims it has been floating around for \\"many years.\\" Lucky Strike's slogan \\"It's Toasted\\" fueled belief in the myth further ('toasted' being one slang term for being high on cannabis). Despite the popularity of the myth, there are no reliable reports of any Lucky Strike cigarette containing cannabis. The name \\"Lucky Strike,\\" in reality, is only a marketing ploy, implying to customers that obtaining their brand is a \\"Lucky Strike.\\" The \\"It's Toasted\\" slogan refers to the product's tobacco being toasted instead of sun-dried, making a supposedly better-tasting product. Other urban legends offshoot from this one. One of the explanations for the origin of flipping a \\"lucky\\" cigarette upside down claims the practice originated from the Lucky Strike myth; it is presumed the superstition arose from flipping the marijuana-containing cigarette upside-down in order to save it for last. =Popularity in the United States in the 1960s= Although the 1960s are commonly perceived as a time of rampant marijuana use compared with the present day, in a 1969 Gallup poll only 4% of American adults had tried marijuana and 34% did not know its effects. In contrast, later Gallup polls show that the percentage of adults who had tried marijuana had risen to 33% by 1985 and 34% by 1999. MDMA (ecstasy) The third most common illicit drug that is the source of urban legends is 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), better known as \\"ecstasy.\\" In the United States, this substance was banned in 1985, and other countries followed suit as well. Among American youth, MDMA was most popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, peaking in 2001 and declining thereafter. It was during this time of rather faddish use that numerous urban legends and misconceptions began to surface and be spread through the media, and not all of them necessarily originated from anti-drug organizations. =Holes in the brain= A common legend that surfaced around the year 2000 was that ecstasy can put holes in the brain, akin to Swiss cheese, which are presumed to be permanent. Actually, the only drugs known to cause anything similar to this are PCP and ketamine, which have been posited to cause small holes in the cortex known as Olney's Lesions. However, structural changes observed over time in the brains of methamphetamine users, and various other substances (e.g., neurotoxins), though not 'holes' in any manner, can still be significantly damaging. The concept of \\"holes\\" most likely comes from a misinterpretation of SPECT (and other) scans which show the levels of activity (or lack thereof) in certain areas of the brain, by measuring glucose usage, blood flow, and other proxies for activity. Such scans do not, however, show the physical structure of the brain. This misconception was likely popularized by an episode of MTV's True Life, \\"I'm on Ecstasy\\" (2000), which featured a former poly-drug user (including heavy use of MDMA) whose brain scan showed several areas of greatly diminished activity. =MDMA causes Parkinson's disease= Another legend, often mentioned together with the \\"holes in the brain\\" myth discussed above, is that MDMA causes Parkinson's disease, possibly with even one night of exposure. This was partially based on an animal study that found neurotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons after administering the drug to monkeys. However, the study has been retracted by the researchers who conducted it because they had accidentally given methamphetamine instead of MDMA to the animals, given the similar chemical names (MDMA stands for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Ironically, it is now being investigated as a possible treatment for Parkinson's disease. The neurotoxicity of MPTP was first hinted at in 1976 after Barry Kidston, a 23-year-old graduate chemistry student in Maryland, synthesized MPPP (a synthetic opiate related to pethidine and the prodines) with MPTP as a major impurity, and self-injected the result. Within three days he began exhibiting symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The National Institute of Mental Health found traces of MPPP, MPTP, and other pethidine analogues in his lab. They tested the substances on rats, but due to rodents' tolerance for this type of neurotoxin nothing was observed. Kidston's parkinsonism was successfully treated with levodopa but he died 18 months later from a cocaine overdose. Upon autopsy, destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra was discovered. In 1982, seven people in Santa Clara County, California were diagnosed with Parkinsonism after having used MPPP contaminated with MPTP. The neurologist J. William Langston in collaboration with NIH tracked down MPTP as the cause, and its effects on primates were researched. Eventually the motor symptoms of two of the seven patients were successfully treated at Lund University Hospital in Sweden with neural grafts of fetal tissue.Success reported using fetal tissue to repair a brain, The New York Times, 26 November 1992 Like MDMA, MPPP is a designer drug, but its effects are more akin to morphine or other opiates. Despite the similarity in name, MDMA and MPPP are unrelated and should not be conflated. =MDMA drains spinal fluid= This myth appears to be derived from research in 1994 in which serotonin breakdown products were measured in the spinal fluid of ecstasy users. However, it was the researchers, not the drug, who drained the fluid (for the purpose of testing). Nonetheless, this legend (and related ones about it damaging one's spinal cord and/or spinal column, which is also false) was popularized in 2000 by Eminem's songs \\"Drug Ballad\\" and \\"The Kids\\". =\\"Stacks\\"‚ÄîSingle, double, triple etc.= Many ecstasy users describe the potency of various ecstasy pills in terms of their stack such as double stack or triple stack pills. These claims are dubious as there is no way to verify potency objectively without proper testing. The term \\"stack\\" is not intended to measure potency of ecstasy pills, but it is used as a measurement of mass. Single stacks weigh in at 0.20 grams, doubles at 0.40 grams, and triples at 0.60 grams. Furthermore, a high percentage of what is sold as \\"ecstasy\\" may contain a combination of MDMA and one or more other substances or may in fact contain no MDMA at all. For these reasons, the \\"stack\\" system of strength description is not necessarily trustworthy‚Äîas is commonly the case in the underground drug market. Methamphetamine Though initially there were not very many urban legends about methamphetamine (\\"crank\\", \\"crystal meth,\\" \\"ice\\"), the \\"meth epidemic\\" of the late 1990s and early 2000s (especially in the USA) led to quite a few new legends. =Lung damage from recrystallization= One meth legend refers to the method of administration in which the user will heat/melt crystal methamphetamine and inhale the resulting methamphetamine vapor. The legend states that the drug, once inhaled, will re- crystallize in large amounts inside the lungs, damaging them in the process. This is a false claim as crystallized methamphetamine is always in the form of a salt (usually methamphetamine hydrochloride), which is highly soluble in water, as well as hydrophilic, and is instantly absorbed into the user's bloodstream via the alveoli. However, intravenous methylphenidate (Ritalin) use results in a type of lung damage commonly known as Ritalin lung. Methylphenidate tablets are crushed and dissolved into solution for IV injection. The tablets contain talc and other particulates which can deposit in the lung (talcosis) and result in severe emphysema affecting all the lobes of the lung.Wolff AJ, ODonnell AE. Pulmonary effects of illicit drug use. Clin Chest Med. Mar 2004;25(1) 203-16 The \\"Ritalin lung\\" effect could be a possible source of how rumors about methamphetamine damaging the lungs could have surfaced. =Strawberry Quik= Another meth legend is that dealers are selling colored and flavored meth resembling candy (often with names like Strawberry Quick, originating from an idea that dealers would mix the drug with strawberry-flavored Nesquik) to entice children to buy it. It was first reported in 2007 in the western United States, and children were allegedly ingesting it thinking it was candy, and ending up in the ER. According to Snopes.com there is no hard evidence, , that flavored meth is being handed out in schoolyards, nor that children are mistaking meth for candy. Heroin =Cotton fever= Cotton fever is a high fever supposedly caused by injecting cotton fibers into the bloodstream when shooting up heroin. Cotton is sometimes used as a crude filter for particulate matter prior to IV injection. Other commonly blamed substances include fiberglass if a cigarette filter was used (cigarette filters do not contain fiberglass), or dirt if Mexican heroin was injected. In general, cotton fever refers to a fever that users believe is caused by inanimate particulate matter injected into the bloodstream. In reality, the particulate matter causing cotton fever is bacteria from lack of sterile technique. Most cases of cotton fever resolve as the body clears the infection. Users will often seek medical attention when cotton fever persists. Persistent cotton fever is often infective endocarditis. Although endotoxin shed by the bacteria Enterobacter agglomerans, which colonizes cotton plants, has been implicated as the cause of cotton fever,D. W. Harrison and R. M. Walls, \\"'Cotton Fever': a benign febrile syndrome in intravenous drug abusers,\\" Journal of Emergency Medicine, March‚ÄìApril 1990, pp. 135-139 most clinical cases demonstrate blood cultures positive for skin and fecal bacteria. = \\"Cheese\\" = \\"Cheese\\" or \\"Tylenol with Smack\\" is a heroin-based recreational drug that came to the attention of the media inside and outside the United States\\"US-Teenager riskieren mit \\"Cheese\\" ihr Leben.\\" Der Spiegel. after a string of deaths among adolescents in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, between 2005 and 2007. It is generally reported to be a mixture of heroin and Tylenol PM (an OTC acetaminophen and diphenhydramine combination) or its generic equivalent, in varying ratios. It seems likely that the concept was originally created as a joke, and after seizures of low purity heroin cut with paracetamol (acetaminophen) \\"validated\\" the claims, the DEA issued a warning. Although the source of the original hoax is gone, newspapers and media outlets continue to make reference to each other with no mention of any primary sources, perpetuating the myth of cheese as \\"starter heroin\\" for children. However, there may have been some ostension of this legend in 2007 involving a few individuals in Texas.Associated Press. \\"Tarrant officials confirm 2 'cheese' heroin deaths,\\"The Dallas Morning News, September 24, 2007. In the South Park episode \\"Major Boobage\\", which aired for the first time on 28 March, 2008, 'cheesing' referred to a moral panic about children using cat urine to get high. Phencyclidine (PCP) =Embalming fluid= A commonly held misconception is that phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust) is the same as (or is synthesized from) embalming fluid. Some people, believing this myth, have actually attempted to smoke cigarettes or cannabis dipped in real embalming fluid (i.e. formaldehyde), which is highly toxic. Conversely, some users of PCP-laced cannabis believe (and are often told) that it contains embalming fluid proper and not PCP, or that the slang term \\"dust\\" really means embalming fluid proper. Sometimes, the two substances are even mixed together, in a further ostension of this legend.Illegal drug users dip into embalming fluid By Douglass Dowty / The Post-Standard August 3, 2009 The combination might be called \\"fry,\\" \\"wet,\\" \\"illy,\\" \\"sherm,\\" \\"worm,\\" \\"water-water,\\" \\"amp,\\" \\"dust(ed),\\" or other names. =Rodney King was on PCP at the time of his 1991 beating and arrest= The Rodney King police beating case in Los Angeles was a source of much controversy and outrage, as well as urban legends. Because King resisted arrest, with several officers needed to subdue him, he was assumed to be on PCP at the time since the drug is notorious for inciting violent and unpredictable behavior coupled with an inability to feel pain (often misinterpreted as \\"superhuman\\" strength). However, toxicology results show that the only drugs found in his system were alcohol and traces of marijuana.\\"Chapter 1: The Rodney King Beating .\\" Report of the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department: p. 8. 1991. =Man slices off his face and feeds it to dogs= One legend holds that a man who, while under the influence of the drug, thoroughly sliced off pieces of his own face, including his eyes, to feed to his pet dogs. Some versions of this tale say he suffered permanent brain damage as well. This legend is remarkably similar to what the character Mason Verger did in Thomas Harris' 1999 novel Hannibal. The legend, however, dates back earlier than 1999, and can be traced to former New York homicide detective Vernon J. Geberth, who writes about it in his book Practical Homicide Investigation. According to Geberth, this actually did occur to a man named Michael, and that Geberth was one of the detectives called to the scene.\\" A 1989 book by Dr. Joseph Sacco also mentions this story, albeit with a few differences in the details. =Superhuman strength= Some reports cite a widely held belief that PCP can give its users \\"superhuman\\" strength for the duration of its effects, and there are several anecdotes alleging this phenomenon. However, it does not typically make the user significantly stronger in reality than they otherwise would be. The exception is when a user experiences excited delirium, a severe and life- threatening reaction that occasionally results from use of PCP as well as various stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines. Excited delirium has also been reported to occur without any drug use, and the increased strength that results is most likely caused by a massive increase in adrenaline.\\"White Paper Report on Excited Delirium Syndrome\\" , ACEP Excited Delirium Task Force, American College of Emergency Physicians, September 10, 2009 Psilocybin mushrooms =Super Mario= One legend that is popular among both the drug and video gaming subcultures is that the mushroom powerup in Super Mario games is actually based on psilocybin mushrooms. Somewhat lending credit to the legend, Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of the Super Mario series, has stated that he chose mushrooms for their relationship to \\"magical realms\\", and has drawn connections to other works featuring mushrooms with mysterious powers, such as Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, a story in which eating specific mushrooms cause one to change size. The mushrooms depicted in the game (white circles on red caps) also have a similar appearance to Amanita muscaria which, while being quite distinct from psilocybin mushrooms (\\"magic mushrooms\\"), still has hallucinogenic properties, and has been used by humans for its intoxicating effects for hundreds of years. Desomorphine (Krokodil) There have been reports of \\"krokodil\\"‚Äîaccording to media reports, a street name for desomorphine, a semi-synthetic opioid which has similar strength and narcotic effect to heroin (diacetylmorphine) -- appearing with increasing frequency in Russia and supposedly, more recently, in the United States. Krokodil, which has been associated with and indeed named after the severe side-effects of its use, has been described as 'flesh-eating' or, as the name suggests, causing 'greenish and/or scale-like' flesh in those who inject the drug. Reports of the drug's appearance and of the severe skin infections apparently originated in Russia ten years prior to recent appearances in the Phoenix, AZ area of the United States, in the fall of 2013. It was also reported in Joliet, Illinois and McHenry, Illinois in October 2013, but no laboratory tests have confirmed that desomorphine was present in the blood, urine or tissues of hospitalized krokodil patients. On the contrary, an October 17, 2013 article in the Lawton Constitution quoted the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics as saying that reports of krokodil use on the Internet should be \\"taken with a grain of salt.\\"http://www.swoknews.com/news- top/area/item/10945-doubts-cast-on-reports-of-krokodil#! The article pointed out that a prior case of drug overdose in Oklahoma had been linked to krokodil, but that toxicology tests revealed no desomorphine in the victim's body, but rather morphine, which can appear in tissue as a metabolite of heroin. In Illinois, heroin is known to be extremely cheap and unusually pure, making it unlikely that a drug user would make or purchase krokodil. Further, krokodil is a liquid, while heroin is a powder, and drug users would not be likely to confuse one with the other. In the linkedin.com discussion group \\"Emerging Drugs of Abuse,\\" with 2500 members in the United States and 43 other countries, toxicology, street drug pharmacology, medical, public health and law enforcement experts expressed doubts about the validity of the krokodil reports after a wave of media stories about the appearance of krokodil in the Chicago area poured from radio, television and print sources. The group believes that the symptoms displayed by krokodil users in the United States are due to a bacterial infection such as necrotizing fasciitis, a \\"flesh eating\\" disorder that is spread through the sharing of dirty hypodermic needles. This and the fact that krokodil has never been identified anywhere in the world other than Russia bolster the contention that this drug is not in the US. However, the increasing popularity of krokodil is likely related to the ability of lay persons (with little or no chemistry training or equipment) to chemically produce a heroin-like opiate drug, at home, using readily available solvents and internet-obtained 'recipes' which are posted on drug forums and chat rooms. By using the available, though dangerously unreliable, instructions, users are converting the much cheaper and easier-to-obtain drug codeine, which is often available over-the-counter or with an easily obtained prescription, into desomorphine, a much stronger opiate. With the street price for heroin or oxycodone much higher than the cost of the codeine and chemicals, users manufacture krokodil for a cheaper, comparable high. However, lacking proper equipment, training, and testing equipment, users are extremely unlikely to produce desomorphine in a pure form at home, and as a result end up injecting a highly impure mixture of codeine, desomorphine, and the toxic chemicals used in the crude reaction such as lye or acetone. While studies are as yet unavailable of various samples of krokodil seized in different regions, it is likely that the drug is in fact not a single chemical, recipe, or 'designer' drug, but rather the medical symptoms caused by the injection of toxic chemical used in a variety of 'home-bake' drug synthesis methods, although traditionally such processes are used by methamphetamine home producers. While there have been no detailed studies of desomorphine in its pure form publicly available, it is highly likely that it is not causing the severe inflammation, necrosis, and flesh-eating symptoms of krokodil. Such damages are much more likely to be related to the toxic chemicals used in the crude at-home synthesis than to desomorphine itself. There is no indication that desomorphine - one of hundreds of known opioids which differ primarily in strength and duration of action - has any unique 'qualities' which would make it desirable to opiate users in its pure form, nor that in pure form desomorphine would cause the symptoms associated with krokodil. More research is needed to fully define whether krokodil is a drug or a collection of symptoms associated with injecting toxic chemical by-products of home drug chemistry, but since desomorphine is one of hundreds of known opiates in a chemical family with no association to the symptoms, it is much more likely that the drug is a set of symptoms associated with the injection of household chemicals, rather than a specific drug itself. A comparison could be made to the effects of methanol poisoning from illicitly produced alcohol during the U.S. prohibition. Methanol was sometimes added to the distillate to enhance profits. There are many home-based drug 'recipes' which could, and likely do, result in users injecting highly impure, dangerous, and toxic chemicals, causing krokodil symptoms. Although drawing attention to the dangers of trying to produce or alter drugs using kitchen chemistry and internet 'recipes' is important and valuable, that krokodil is a single drug is unproven and highly unlikely. Designer drugs The advent of novel illegal or quasi-legal designer drugs intended as substitutes or alternatives to illegal drugs has given rise to several new legends as well. =Cannibalism from bath salts= In 2012, various drugs nicknamed \\"bath salts\\" were implicated in several violent attacks, including a few cases of cannibalism. However, the most well- known cannibal attacker from Miami, Rudy Eugene, tested negative for all drugs known to be nicknamed \\"bath salts\\" and every other known psychoactive substance except traces of cannabis. General In addition to legends about specific drugs, there are also some more generic ones that are often applied to several types of drugs. Typically, these legends involve rather morbid themes and/or targeted children, but some are told with more levity for the purpose of humor. =Drugs smuggled in baby's corpse= This legend, dating back to the early 1970s and first appearing on the Internet in 1996, claims that drug traffickers are smuggling illegal drugs (typically cocaine) in hollowed-out dead babies to avoid detection. Allegedly, tourists' babies are kidnapped, killed, cut open, filled with drugs, and sewn shut so the contraband can be more readily sneaked over the border. However, according to U.S. Customs and other law enforcement agencies, there are no verifiable reports of this ever happening, and thus this myth is unfounded. =Drug-laced candy or lollipops given to schoolchildren= This legend, which surfaced on the Internet just in time for Halloween in October 2004, claimed that drug dealers were giving lollipops laced with drugs, typically a combination of THC and PCP, to unsuspecting children and causing them great harm. Such suckers are allegedly referred to as \\"dro pops\\" or something to that effect, and various towns around the country have had their own versions of the legend.http://www.snopes.com/horrors/drugs/suckers.asp Drugs in Suckers, Snopes.com. Retrieved 07-06-2010. According to the U.S. DEA, suckers containing THC and/or PCP have been found and confiscated in Chicago in the spring of 2004. They also report that in 2003 and 2004 some psilocybin mushroom chocolate candies were seized near Amarillo, Texas, and that hollowed-out lollipops filled with heroin have been seized in New York City. The goal of doing so was likely to evade detection by law enforcement by disguising the drugs as candy. There is no evidence that these were ever given to children, much less that any such children were harmed, or even that such lollipops have been found outside of these specific locations or anywhere since early 2004. Thus, this legend can be considered to be in a similar vein as the infamous blue star tattoo legend. =Drug-related Halloween legends= Related to the above legend, various drugs have also found their way into the more general and perennial Halloween poisoning legends. Allegedly, unsuspecting trick-or-treaters are given candy (or sometimes fruits) laced with poisons, needles, razor blades, and drugs by strangers. However, virtually all reports of this happening are now known to be either hoaxes, events unrelated to Halloween candy, or non-random poisonings by relatives made to look random. The latest manifestation of drug-related Halloween legends was a prediction by Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles that cannabis edibles (from medical marijuana dispensaries) would possibly end up in the hands of trick-or-treaters on Halloween in 2010. Baca even went so far as to confiscate cannabis edibles from circulation in an attempt to prevent this from happening, and displayed them on television two days before Halloween. Again, there is no evidence that cannabis-laced treats were ever given out to trick-or-treaters in 2010 or in any other year.LA‚Äôs Sheriff Baca Stirs Fear Against Marijuana Days Before The Election, Alternet, Accessed 10-31-2010Police: Parents be on the lookout for pot-laced Halloween sweets Southwest Riverside News Network, Accessed 10-31-2010 =\\"Gnome\\" legend= Another legend involves a group of teenagers who, while drunk and/or tripping on some sort of hallucinogen, find what they perceive to be a gnome (sometimes a dwarf, hobgoblin or smurf), capture it, and bring it home. They sleep off the drug's effects, and the next morning they find out that the \\"gnome\\" was really a lost (and very frightened) child. Though the story may be told by some tellers in a negative light, it may also have a positive spin in that the teens become unwitting heroes in finding a missing child whose parents (as well as the police) had been unable to find. According to Snopes.com, the legend had first surfaced in 2004, and the legend's truth status remains undetermined and unverifiable. In some versions of a legend the \\"gnome\\" is not a child but a midget or a person with Down Syndrome; some have even gone as far to say it was a dead baby. =\\"Homeopathic\\" drug water= In 2004‚Äì2005, an Internet rumor was being spread that claimed that LSD (and other drugs) were being diluted with water to extremely low concentrations, which allegedly made the drugs more powerful, yet cheaper and undetectable. This is related to the pseudo-scientific \\"Law of Infinitesimals,\\" one of the principles behind homeopathy. However, there is no evidence that this actually has effects different from a placebo, or that a significant number of users or dealers were ever actually doing this. Drug testing The increasingly common practice of drug testing, especially urinalysis, has led to an increase in the number of drug users looking for ways to beat the tests, and has spawned a number of urban legends as a result. One should note that time is the only scientifically proven method for certainly passing a test, apart from not consuming any substances at all that are likely to be tested for. However, this does not stop users from getting creative in their attempts to somehow shorten the detection times and/or mask the contents of their fluid specimens, with varying degrees of success or lack thereof. =Secondhand exposure will cause you to fail= This legend is technically true but highly misleading. According to a U.S. Army study, the amount of secondhand cannabis smoke needed to cause a false positive result (failure) is quite large indeed, and would require being sealed in an unventilated car or small room filled with marijuana being actively smoked (often referred to as a \\"hotbox\\") for several hours. Hair testing, however, is a different matter, particularly with passive exposure to crack/cocaine, which can deposit onto hair and be readily incorporated into it. With regards to cannabis, however, typically only metabolites (produced by the body and thus not found in smoke) are tested rather than THC, so failure is unlikely to result from non-extreme passive exposure. =High doses of niacin will help you pass= Niacin, also known as Vitamin B3, is speciously claimed by some to \\"burn it out\\" of one's system when taken at high doses (250‚Äì500 mg per day). While some Internet (and other) sources claim that this works wonders, there is no supporting scientific evidence. Very high doses can also cause adverse side effects. This legend may have been (inadvertently) inspired by Narconon, a Scientology-based drug rehabilitation program that uses exercise, saunas, and dangerously high doses of niacin (and other vitamins) to detox. It is also part of L. Ron Hubbard's general Purification Rundown, which can supposedly remove pollutants as well as drug residues. Although some drug users claim that this has worked, there are currently no peer-reviewed scientific studies to back these methods up. =Poppy seeds cause false positives for opiates= This partially true, but exaggerated, legend has been featured in several movies and television shows, such as Seinfeld and The Big Bang Theory. Poppy seeds do contain trace amounts of opium alkaloids, including morphine. Poppy seed-filled pastries (such as hamantashen or kolaches), contain enough opiates to potentially cause a false positive test result, even when a fairly high cutoff level is used. However, drug tests rarely screen for the actual drug used; instead they detect metabolites or increased enzyme levels as markers indicative of drug use. When substance use has been established (and the drug type, i.e. opiate or amphetamine), one can then be tested to identify the specific substance by means of more expensive Gas Chromatography drug screens. An episode of MythBusters tested this legend and found that as little as three poppy-seed bagels was enough to cause a positive result for the remainder of the day they were eaten (though participants tested clean the following day). The results of this experiment are inconclusive, however, because a test was used with an opiate cutoff level of 300 ng/mL instead of the current SAMHSA recommended cutoff level used in the NIDA 5 test, which was raised from 300 ng/mL to 2,000 ng/mL in 1998 in order to avoid such false positives from poppy seeds. Despite these measures, false positives do still occur, such as in the case of a mother whose newborn baby was taken into care for five days after she tested positive for opiates because of an \\"everything\\" bagel from Dunkin' Donuts. In addition, poppy seed consumption does not serve as a defense for heroin consumption. This is because a unique metabolite (6-monoacetylmorphine) is produced from heroin use that is never produced from consuming any other substance, even other opiates like the ones present in poppy seeds. Modern tests can thus readily determine whether it was heroin or some other opiate that was ingested, should someone who had used heroin try to claim he or she merely ate poppy seeds. It is widely believed that there is no way to distinguish between poppy seeds and any other kind of opiate. However, a study published by the University of Connecticut's Department of Chemistry proposed that thebaine could be used as a marker of poppy seed consumption. They examined the urine of test subjects given 11 grams of poppy seeds, the urine of heroin users and clean urine spiked with thebaine, as a reference for GC- MS. They also tested street heroin, one morphine tablet and one codeine tablet. Urine specimens were screened by EMIT and confirmed for thebaine by GC-MS using a solid-phase extraction method. Only the subjects who had consumed the poppy seeds had thebaine in their urine, with concentrations ranging from 2 to 81 ng/mL with a limit of detection of 0.5 ng/mL. Thebaine was not detected in any of the tested powdered drugs (street heroin, morphine tablet, codeine tablet) or the urine of the heroin users.

A prop forward, his long club career with the Newtown Bluebags was from 1938 to 1951 with four Test appearances for the Australian national side between 1946 and 1948. Outside of football he was a policeman in the New South Wales force; he rose through the ranks and was stationed in Sydney's tough inner-city suburbs, where he earned a reputation as feared and revered detective in the Vice Squad. Early life Farrell was the great-grandson of an Irish convict named Patrick Farrell who was shipped to the Sydney in 1837 for stealing a pig. His father, Sydney-born Reginald Francis Farrell (1889‚Äì1983), was a jeweller and his mother, Scottish-born Margaret Theresa Wynne (1886‚Äì1977), an ironing lady. His parents were married in 1913. Frank, their second child, was born at St. Margaret's Hospital in Surry Hills, an inner suburb of Sydney. He was brought up in the tough Sydney city suburbs of Redfern, Tempe, Arncliffe and Marrickville. Frank was educated at Patrician Brothers' school, Redfern and Marist College Kogarah, and remained a committed Roman Catholic throughout his life. Frank Farrell married Phyllis Dorothy Read (1912‚Äì1981) on 11 November 1944 and had two sons and two daughters. Footballer North sydney. Farrell was a rugby league footballer with a long sporting career. He rose through the ranks to become The Greatest Bluebag of them all.Through Blue eyes, by Terry Williams. (2008) Graded in 1936, he made his d√©but for the Newtown Rugby League Football Club's first-grade team in the 1938 NSWRFL season. He played his entire New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership career of over 250 games with the Newtown club. He made his state representative debut for New South Wales against Queensland in 1939 and went on to play thirteen career matches for his state. He became captain of the club in 1942, leading them to victory in the 1943 NSWRFL season Premiership Final against North Sydney. One of Farrell's closest and lifelong friends, Frank Hyde, was his opposing captain that day. Farrell was captain in 1944 when Newtown finished the regular season on top of the table. Decimated by injuries and the active-duty call up of servicemen Len Smith and Herb Narvo who had starred for them all season the Bluebags were beaten by Balmain 16‚Äì19 in a Final. Newtown exercised their \\"right of challenge\\" as minor premiers and called for a Grand final in which Farrell led the side. Balmain again prevailed in a low scoring match when their representative centre Joe Jorgenson kicked two late penalty goals to give the Tigers a 12‚Äì8 win.Collis/Whitaker p96 In a famous incident during a game on 28 July 1945, he was accused of biting off a portion of St. George player Bill McRitchie's ear during a match at Henson Park. He formally denied the allegation at the time. It took seven months for the New South Wales Rugby League judiciary to finalise their inquiry and Farrell was found not guilty.Canberra Times. 31 July 1945. \\"Footballer's Ear Nearly Bitten Off\\".

Ligare Books. 2008. (P. 48) Policeman While playing football, Farrell was employed in the New South Wales Police Force in a career that lasted from 1938 to 1976. During his long tenure as sergeant of the 21st Division Darlinghurst (Kings Cross) police station in Sydney he was outwardly respected as an honest and tough member of the community and police force as a member of the Vice Squad. Farrell became one of Sydney's most famous Policemen and was featured in hundreds of media reports between the 1940s and the mid-1970s. His highest rank was Inspector 1st Class. However articles including two published by the ABC, and oral history interviews with long term residents of the Kings Cross precinct uncover the dark underside as the community remember and recite Farrell's legendary status for his harassment and intimidation of local business people and residents, particularly anyone considered \\"bohemian\\", \\"Some of the gambling dives were chockablock with thuggish cops, like Bumper Farrell, whose reputation for turncoat behaviour was legendary. Farrell hunted vagrants (and anyone he didn't like the look of, myself included) to boost the score of arrests at Paddington Police Station, while turning a blind eye to grander villainy\\".Michael Sharkey, Overland, No. 180, Spring 2005 \\"The Darlinghurst police back in those days with Bumper Farrell, they weren't very nice.

But they'd never leave a mark\\". Debra Deveraux, George Negus Tonight, ABC, 2004. In the 1950s a scandal was quickly quashed when the cover of Melbourne newspaper Truth ran the headline \\"Sex Chocolates: Anna Hoffmann Strikes Again\\" Anna Hoffman was a supposed vagrant working as a prostitute, when she allegedly spiked Farrell's food with marijuana during a tryst with him, and recorded the event with equipment placed under her bed. This wasn't Hoffman's first experience with the legal system; after a few run-ins with the police force and allegedly threatening to expose details of corruption, this was second time around in a court room for her since 1955. She was allegedly deported, never to set foot in Australia again. The incident was efficiently brushed under the carpet in record time. Bill Jenkings, a well-known Australian writer and newspaper reporter, refused to believe allegations about the involvement of Frank \\"Bumper\\" Farrell in corrupt activities ‚Äì having known him personally for 40 years. Jenkings said in his biography As Crime Goes By.. (Ironbark Press, 1992) that the Queens of Sydney's underworld, Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh, constantly earned Bumper Farrell's wrath. \\"He'd run them in every chance that he got.\\" A biography about Frank Farrell called \\"Bumper. The Life and Times of Frank Bumper Farrell\\" (2011), by author Larry Writer states \\"he enforced law the 'Bumper' way, with his fists and boots, and by his own moral code, which while terribly politically incorrect, was certainly effective.

Condon joined the team during the 1942 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1951 championship. During that time he won three All- Ireland medals and three Munster medals. An All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion, Condon captained Cork to a fourth successive All-Ireland title in 1944. At club level Condon was a four-time county club championship medalist with St. Finbarr's. Playing career =Club= Condon played his club hurling with St. Finbarr's and enjoyed much success. He first played for the famous \\"Barr's\\" club in the minor grade and collected three successive championship medals in that grade between 1939 and 1941. In 1942 Condon played in his first senior county final with \\"the Barr's\\". Ballincollig, a team who had defeated nine-in-a-row hopefuls Glen Rovers in the semi-final, provided the opposition. St. Finbarr's made no mistake and powered to a 5‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì2. It was Condon's first championship medal. Both St. Finbarr's and Ballincollig met in the championship decider again the following year. A 3‚Äì3 apiece draw, thanks to a late goal by Condon, was the result on that occasion, however, St. Finbarr's made no mistake in the replay and powered to a 7‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì1 victory. It was Condon's second championship medal. Three-in-a-row proved beyond St. Finbarr's as Glen Rovers claimed victory in the championship decider in 1944. Both sides lined out in opposition to each other again two years later. Condon was singled out for special praise and collected a third championship medal following a 2‚Äì3 to 2‚Äì1 defeat of their north side rivals. Twelve months later St. Finbarr's put their title on the line against Sarsfield's in the county decider. A record crowd saw \\"Sars\\" lead \\"the Barr's\\" by a single point as the game entered injury time. They failed to clear a seventy which was flicked to the net by Jim Sargent to give St. Finbarr's a 4‚Äì6 to 4‚Äì4 victory. It was Condon's fourth and final championship medal. =Inter-county= Condon first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team in 1940. His first season on the team was unsuccessful, however, in 1941 Condon was appointed captain of the side. He won a Munster medal that year following a 4‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì3 defeat of Tipperary. Condon later led his team to an All-Ireland decider against Kilkenny. A 5‚Äì2 to 2‚Äì2 score line gave Cork the victory and gave Condon an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. In 1942 Condon made his senior championship debut in a Munster semi-final defeat of Limerick. He won his first Munster that year as Tipp were downed by 4‚Äì15 to 4‚Äì1 in the subsequent provincial decider. The All-Ireland final was a replay of the previous year with Dublin providing the opposition once again. The game was a close affair with just a point separating the sides at the three-quarter stage. In the end Cork won comfortably enough by 2‚Äì14 to 3‚Äì4 and Condon collected his first All-Ireland medal. Condon missed Cork's Munster final triumph, however, he later lined out in a second All-Ireland decider with Antrim becoming the first Ulster side to qualify for a final. Unfortunately, the occasion got to the Glensmen as Cork built up an unassailable 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì2 half-time lead. The final score of 5‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì4 gave Cork their second-ever hat-trick of All-Ireland titles while it also gave Condon a second All-Ireland medal. In 1944 Condon was appointed captain of the team as Cork were attempting to capture a fourth All-Ireland title in-a-row. No team in the history of the hurling championship had won more than three consecutive titles. The year got off to a good start when Cork defeated Limerick by 4‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì6 after a replay to give Condon a second Munster medal. For the third time in four years Cork faced Dublin in an All-Ireland decider. Joe Kelly was the hero of the day and he contributed greatly to Cork's 2‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì2 victory. It was a third successive All-Ireland medal for Condon while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. Five-in-a-row proved to be a bridge too far for Cork in 1945, while Condon was later dropped from the starting fifteen for Cork's successful championship campaign the following year. Condon was back on the starting fifteen again in 1947 and picked up a third Munster medal following a three-point victory over Limerick. The All-Ireland final was a repeat of the previous year with Kilkenny providing the opposition. The stakes were high for both sides as Cork were aiming for a record sixth championship in seven seasons while Kilkenny were aiming to avoid becoming the first team to lose three consecutive All-Ireland finals. In what has been described as one of the greatest deciders of all-time, little separated the two teams over the course if the hour. A Joe Kelly goal put Cork one point ahead with time almost up, however, Terry Leahy proved to be the hero of the day. He converted a free to level the sides again before sending over the match-winner from the subsequent puck-out. With that the game was over and Condon's side were beaten by 0‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì7. It was the fifth time that Kilkenny had pipped Cork by a single point in an All-Ireland final. That defeat saw the break-up of the great four-in-a-row team of the 1940s and was followed by four lean years of championship hurling for Cork. Three consecutive defeats by Tipperary in 1949, 1950 and 1951 proved too much and Condon retired from inter-county hurling in 1951. =Inter-provincial= Condon also had the honour of being selected for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games and captained the province for his one season on the team. A 4‚Äì10 to 4‚Äì4 defeat of Connacht in 1944 gave Condon his sole Railway Cup medal.

Early life The Apthorp mansion, where Sarah grew up, is the second on the right. Sarah was born in Boston, Massachusetts in August 1759. She was the third of ten children born to James Apthorp (1731‚Äì1799), a merchant and slave-trader, and Sarah Wentworth (1735‚Äì1820), whose family owned Wentworth Manor in Yorkshire. Her father was one of eighteen children born to her paternal grandparents, Charles Apthorp (1698‚Äì1758), the prominent British-born merchant in 18th-century Boston, and Grizzelle (n√©e Eastwicke) Apthorp (1709‚Äì1796). Her maternal grandfather was Samuel Wentworth (1708‚Äì1766), also a Boston merchant, and his father was John Wentworth (1671‚Äì1730), the colonial Lieutenant Governor of New Hampshire who lived in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Writing In 1792, she wrote an anti-slavery poem entitled The African Chief, which was, in fact, an elegy on a slain African at St. Domingo in 1791. In 1796, Sarah and her husband Perez moved to Dorchester. From an early age, Sarah had begun writing poetry, but until 1788 her works had only circulated among her friends. She began publishing under the pen name Philenia, and her first book was printed in 1790. Her work was widely acclaimed, with Robert Treat Paine, Jr., in the Massachusetts Magazine dubbing her the \\"American Sappho\\". At one time she was thought to be the author of The Power of Sympathy (1789), widely considered to be the first American novel, but that has since been attributed to her uncle, William Hill Brown. Personal life Portrait of Sarah's daughter, Charlotte Morton Dexter, by Gilbert Stuart (1808) In 1781, she was married to Boston lawyer Perez Morton (1751‚Äì1837) at Trinity Church, Boston. Morton served as the Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, from 1806 to 1808 and again from 1810 to 1811, and was the Massachusetts Attorney General from 1810 to 1832. The couple lived on a family mansion on State Street. From around 1796 to around 1803, the Mortons owned a house on Dudley Street in Dorchester; the house may have been designed by Charles Bulfinch.Dorchester Atheneum. Perez Morton, 1750-1837. Retrieved 2011-09-07 Together, they were the parents of five children who lived to maturity, including:Oliver, Andrew and James Bishop Peabody, eds.

Sarah died on May 14, 1846 in Braintree, Massachusetts. She was buried at King's Chapel Burying Ground in Boston. =Husband's affair and sister's suicide= In the mid 1780s, Sarah's younger sister Frances Apthorp (1766‚Äì1788), or Fanny as she was known, came to live with her and her family. Reportedly, Fanny was seduced by, or fell in love with, Sarah's husband Perez. Fanny gave birth to his child in 1787 or 1788, after which their father \\"demanded a confrontation with Perez, which Fanny begged him not to do. She argued it would cause a scandal and disgrace the family.\\" Once the affair became public, Fanny took an overdose of laudanum and committed suicide due to the family backlash. Fanny left a suicide note proclaiming her \\"guilty innocence\\" that was published in the local newspapers shortly after her death. In January 1789, as the scandal settling down, Sarah's brother Charles Apthorp challenged Morton to a duel. When the two men met to duel, the sheriff was there and prevented the illegal encounter. With the affair and her sister's suicide, the Morton's marriage had deteriorated, however, the couple later reconciled. In spite of this reconciliation, fifteen years later Sarah would have an affair with founding father Gouverneur Morris. =Legacy and descendants= Her Dorchester home is a site on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.

He excelled in all these genres, and before 1920 gave classic performances of key roles in modern works, and created lead roles in those of Hans Pfitzner. He was the first husband of Maria Ivog√ºn and was considered by many the ideal Evangelist in the St Matthew Passion of Johann Sebastian Bach.The primary source for this article is the Life by Maria M√ºller-G√∂gler (see Sources).  Origins and early training  Karl Erb stageshoes at the museum in Ravensburg, Germany Erb was born in Ravensburg. As a child, he was enrolled in the local Liebfrauenkirche charity choir and music class. His mother taught him to love poetry and he excelled at school. His voice did not break abruptly, but deepened and intensified to a beautiful and spiritual timbre. He was sought out for private musical events and performed in amateur theatre at the Ravensburg Konzerthaus. He later worked at Wolfegg and at Rot as cashier for the State Gas and Waterworks. In 1902, the Konigliche Hoftheater in Stuttgart burnt down, and the company worked temporarily in Ravensburg. Erb, assisting the choir in Cavalleria rusticana, was noticed by . Von Putlitz had been appointed Theatre Intendant at Munich long before through the personal efforts of Richard and Cosima Wagner, cf Ernest Newman,Life of Richard Wagner IV (Knopf, New York 1946), 54‚Äì60, 81‚Äì83. and offered a chance to sing solo. He declined, but further offers were made.  Stuttgart  In 1906, aged 29, he started an unpaid probationary year at Stuttgart (beginning January 1907, which led to a five-year paid contract. He had the help of a young r√©p√©titeur, a singing teacher, a drama tutor (Hans Islaub, who got rid of his Swabian accent) and a ballet master. He studied the roles of Max (Der Freisch√ºtz), Lionel (Martha), Walter (Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg) and Mathias in Der Evangelimann by Wilhelm Kienzl. Through the singer Elsa Wiborg, he was given the chance to sing privately for the King and Queen; then, on 14 June 1907, he made his debut in Evangelimann at the new Hoftheater. Erb was also gave recitals and made oratorio appearances during his probation at Stuttgart. He then appeared as Lohengrin (in which the shimmering brightness of his voice was especially effective), as Buddha (in Adolf Vogel's Maja ), as Little Massarena in Le domino noir, Achilles (Iphigenia in Aulis), Walter (Meistersinger) and as Faust in the title role of Gounod's opera. By the end of the trial year he had sung at the Hoftheater at 30 evenings or masterclasses: an unparalleled success. Soon afterwards, at von Putlitz's urging, Erb took singing lessons from Felix Decken, a tenorbuffo, who tried to break and rebuild his technique. Erb, deeply undermined, sacked him and nearly broke with von Putlitz, but instead they agreed that he pass the winter season 1908 as leading lyric tenor for the brand new Theatre at L√ºbeck.  L√ºbeck  Erb opened triumphantly (October 1908) in Lohengrin. He maintained a sober existence, but gravitated to the social circle of Ida Boy- Ed, where he mixed with Hermann Abendroth, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and others. He travelled to Hamburg to see Caruso and Edith Walker in Tosca. Greatly inspired, he added Lionel (Martha), Manrico (Il trovatore), Gomez (Das Nachtlager in Granada (Kreutzer)), Froh (Das Rheingold), Florestan (Fidelio), Alessandro Stradella in Friedrich von Flotow's opera, the Duke of Mantua (Rigoletto), Turiddu (Cavalleria rusticana), Fenton (Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor (Carl Otto Nicolai)), Hoffmann in Jacques Offenbach's opera, and Alfred in Die Fledermaus to his repertoire. All these parts were sung in German. In April 1909 at the end of his first season in L√ºbeck, he returned to Stuttgart and showed how he had benefited from the experience. He returned to L√ºbeck for a second season in Autumn 1909, adding Tannh√§user, Les Huguenots, Die Zauberfl√∂te, Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, the G√∂tterd√§mmerung Siegfried, Naraboth in Salome, The Barber of Seville, and Fredy Wehrburg in The Dollar Princess to his repertoire. He made his May 1910 farewell in Martha. He then sang in Kiel and Hamburg, returning to Stuttgart for the winter season of 1910. Through Frau Boy-Ed, Erb was invited to Graf von Bernstorff's house at Lake Starnberg, where he also met Felix Mottl, Stenka Fassbender and Graf Sporck (poet-author for Cyrill Kistler's music-drama Kunihild). He sang Schubert for Mottl, who was deeply impressed, and started planning to get him to Munich. Graf Spork, a friend of the Wahnfried house, was also interested, and Erb and Frau Boy-Ed attended a Bayreuth Parsifal with him. But amid the rivalry, a place at Munich was already secure (through Mottl) when, at a concert under Siegfried Wagner's baton, Erb realized he could not work for the latter.  Stuttgart and Munich  Hans Pfitzner as Director of the Strasbourg Opera from 1910, sought to stage his Der Arme Heinrich at Stuttgart, but needed a suitable tenor to convey the spiritual depths of the work. Von Putlitz decided that Erb was the only singer suitable. Pfitzner himself came to Stuttgart to ask him, and he made a great success. The Munich Hoftheater, urged by Mottl, offered to engage him when the Stuttgart contract ended. Erb wanted to go, but there were three years remaining at Stuttgart: he declined a Munich offer of a guest Tannha√ºser as too heavy for his voice. However Pfitzner, seeking to raise a Munich Hoftheater boycott on performance of his works, rewrote the Arme Heinrich role for Erb, and staged it with him at the Prinzregententheater at Munich, privately, whereupon von Speidel for the Hoftheater asked Erb his price and was told 24,000 Marks per year. Munich offered a guest role in Lohengrin, which he took, and later a Florestan and a Hoffmann. In 1912 and 1913 he sang six performances a month at Stuttgart and fitted in guest appearances at T√ºbingen, Ulm, L√ºbeck, Berlin, and Wiesbaden. In September 1912 the new Stuttgart Hoftheater was completed and Erb sang Walter in Meistersinger. A month later, 25 October, at Stuttgart, Richard Strauss conducted the premi√®re of his Ariadne auf Naxos. The first and third performances were with the √©lite soloists Maria Jeritza, Margarethe Siems, Herman Jadlowker: the second was the Stuttgart team, Erb as Bacchus. In May 1913 at the Imperial performance at Wiesbaden he sang H√ºon in Oberon. The Kaiser said to him, 'You must be a good Lohengrin. Tell Baron von Putlitz I thank him for having sent such a good performer of Huon.' Erb's farewell to Stuttgart after his six years there was as Lohengrin.  Munich  Soon after arrival at Munich in 1913, where Bruno Walter (from Vienna) had succeeded Mottl, Erb appeared as Loge in Das Rheingold. He completely rethought the part, dispensing with Briesemeister's flaming and dancing impersonation. Walter realised he was a thinking artist, and the Press had 'not seen such a Loge since Bayreuth'. He sang this role (his 42nd) for 12 years at the Munich Festivals. In a September 1913 double-bill Caruso sang Canio at Munich but left Turiddu to Erb. He now sang Erik, Tannh√§user, Loge, Pinkerton and Cavaradossi. His dramatic skills were admired as Achilles in Gluck's Iphigenia in Aulis, and he sang Graf Adolar in Weber's Euryanthe. In 1914, when Parsifal was first freely given in Germany, he was the first Munich Parsifal, bringing spiritual and religious insight. He was already singing Strauss's Bacchus and Naraboth, and Pfitzner's Arme Heinrich. Bruno Walter brought Hugo Wolf's Der Corregidor to Munich Festival for him, at some expense, and Erb became completely, almost exclusively associated with it. The theatre valued his growing dramatic power and insight, and he relished such works as Franz Schreker's Der ferne Klang and (later) Die Gezeichneten. During the War the work of the theatre was reduced, and restricted to German and Italian music. In summer 1916, he travelled with the Stuttgart Theatre ensemble to France and Belgium to sing and play to the German troops. He encountered Ravensburger soldiers at Lille. In Brussels, after a concert, an officer gave him his gold finger-ring as the token of homage to his art, from him, an unknown soldier returning to the front who should perhaps be dead tomorrow. Erb wore it until the outbreak of the second war. St Matthew Passion In 1914, Bruno Walter persuaded Erb that he should sing the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion. His first performance was at the Munich Odeon, March 28, 1915, with Paul Bender as Jesus. In that period he was learning the Pfitzner, Wolf and Schreker roles, and (by his own account) increasingly sought to develop the emotional, spiritual and intellectual depth of his interpretations. He sank his whole artistic personality into the Evangelist, reading what Albert Schweitzer and Heuser had written. In 1915, Paul Ehlers thought him the finest Evangelist since Heinrich Vogl. A 1916 Cologne performance won extravagant praise, and wonder at his versatility, from Hermann Abendroth, and from the press. The poet Romain Rolland heard the 10 March 1916 performance at Basel Minster under Herman Suter (with Maria Philippi) and extolled it, and soon Amsterdam also recognised a new genius. Pfitzner's Palestrina Munich's greatest wartime artistic project was the premiere of Hans Pfitzner's Palestrina in 1917. Erb created the title role, with Maria Ivog√ºn as Ighino. and Friedrich Brodersen also sang and Walter conducted. The Swiss took the whole show with the Munich ensemble, in midst of war, to Basel, Berne and Z√ºrich. Thomas Mann, who had seen Erb's St Matthew Passion, described how he completely grasped the spiritual meaning of Palestrina, and Pfitzner felt he had found his ideal interpreter. (Ivog√ºn had come to Munich in Walter's troupe in 1913, and in 1916 she and Erb realised they were in love, during a performance of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Der Ring des Polykrates.) Erb always wanted to sing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart roles, but it was during rehearsals for a Schreker work that he suddenly had to stand in as Belmonte in Die Entfuhrung. Erb was a very great Mozartian singer, and thereafter he played many roles, including Octavio, Belfiore, Tamino and Ferrando, as well as Belmonte. In 1918, shortly before the end of the war, the King of Bavaria bestowed on Erb (the last) title K√∂niglich Bayerische Kammers√§nger. During the Rhine occupation early in 1919 Erb was touring the Rhine towns and in the Netherlands with St Matthew Passion. He was held up, returning, at Ingolstadt, and the Munich revolution had settled by the time of his return there.  The Erb-Ivog√ºn partnership  In July 1921, Erb and Maria Ivog√ºn were married. That week Erb sang five Parsifals and a Belmonte at Zurich Festival. Over the next years their musical partnership in theatre, concert, and 'Lieder-abend', grew increasingly famous. Their voices and personalities seemed ideally matched. They appeared together as Ernesto and Norina, Almaviva and Rosina, Chateauneuf and Marie, Hoffegut and Nachtigall, Martha and Lionel, Fenton and Frau Fluth, Max and Aennchen, Wilhelm Meister and Mignon, Ritter Hugo and Undine, Fenton and Alice, Duke and Gilda, Palestrina and Ighino, Bacchus and Zerbinetta, Rudolf and Mimi, Hoffmann and Olympia, and above all in the Mozart roles, Belmonte and Konstanze, Tamino and the Queen of the Night, Ferrando and Despina and Ottavio and Zerlina. In the concert hall they sang Italian duets, duets of Handel, Schumann and Schubert, and of modern composers as yet less well-known. Between 1920 and 1924, Ivog√ºn toured twice in the United States on her own, and developed a large following there. The couple toured there widely together between December 1924 and late February 1925, when, after Willem Mengelberg had failed to persuade Erb to sing the St Matthew Passion in New York City, amid press sensations offering to 'buy' the performance, Erb left Maria to complete her tour and went home. He had to deliver Matthew Passions twice each in Munich, Elberfeld, Dortmund, Hagen, Cologne and Haarlem, all between 22 March and 13 April. America did not suit Erb as it suited Ivog√ºn, and although their partnership continued for several years, they began to go their separate ways.  Tribulations  During the voyage home in March 1925, news came to the ship that Friedrich Ebert had died ‚Äì and for the first time Adolf Hitler spoke again openly in Munich. His April engagements complete, and with Maria back, Erb returned to Munich ready to resume his work. But Bruno Walter had left Munich for the Berlin-Charlottenburg St√§dtische Oper in 1922: his successor Hans Knappertsbusch had little time for the Swabian tenor, whose contract expired in summer 1925. It was not renewed. After 12 years at Munich he was permitted a farewell (15 June) in Das Nachtlager in Granada (hardly a showcase) and Erb, who loved Munich, left in bitterness. A year later his baritone colleague Brodersen died, and was replaced by Heinrich Rehkemper: the bass Paul Bender, at Munich since 1903, remained. Ivog√ºn would not remain under Knappertsbusch, and went to the Berlin-Charlottenburg Oper. In 1926 Erb, Ivog√ºn and their accompanist Michael Raucheisen were giving recitals in Bremen, and shortly before a Duetten-abend Erb tripped on the hotel steps and broke his right leg. Two painful months later in Berlin he resumed singing with Lieder-abends and a Matthew Passion. In 1927 he appeared in London, Covent Garden, as Belmonte, with Paul Bender as Osmin, and after this he sang in Berlin, in The Hague, in Halle, D√ºsseldorf and Mannheim, as Belmonte, Tamino, Loge, Bacchus, Ernesto and Florestan and in Der Corregidor. In summer of 1929, he sang the Matthew Passion at La Scala in Milan, to a very enthusiastic audience. That July while swimming in the Starnbergersee Erb was dashed against a rock by the sea and found later on the beach by Frau Ivog√ºn. By luck his life was saved, but the convalescence was long and painful and he never fully recovered. In January 1930 he reappeared before the public with Ivog√ºn, and still in much pain travelled to the Netherlands to sing Florestan. In June 1930, he made his last operatic appearance, a performance worthy of his powers, at the Berlin-Charlottenburg Oper under Furtw√§ngler, as Florestan. In April 1931, Erb and Ivog√ºn were divorced, torn apart by deep and conflicting feelings. Two years later, he learnt that she had married Michael Raucheisen, his former accompanist, with whom he had hoped to work again: it was a doubly crushing blow.  Later career  Erb continued to sing the Matthew Passion Evangelist yearly at Amsterdam for Willem Mengelberg, and in the course of thirty years sang it some 360 times, in most major German town and cities, and in Z√ºrich, Berne, Basel, Lucerne, Solothurn, Lausanne, Milan and Brussels, under Bruno Walter, William Mengelberg, Hermann Suter, Fritz Busch, Hermann Abendroth, Alfred Sittard, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Karl Straube and Eugen Papst. With the passage of decades his interpretation grew and was increasingly called authoritative. He sang it throughout the second war, and after, in Germany: a 1940 reviewer described his Cologne cathedral performance as an 'unfassbaren, √ºbermenschlichen, unirdisch wirklichen Vollendung' (an inconceivable, more-than-human, supernally real perfection). When Erb left the stage his career was just entering its last great development, which was as one of the most serious and accomplished lieder singers of his age. Between 1935 and 1940 he made an impressive series of records (HMV) of Schubert, Schumann, Brahms and Wolf songs, accompanied by Sebastian Peschko, Bruno Seidler-Winkler or Gerald Moore. The many strands of his singing experience, the thoughtfulness of his Pfitzner, Wolf and Schreker, the musical discipline of his Bach and his Mozart, Beethoven, Gluck, Weber and lyric Wagner roles, had laid the foundations for this last work, in which he excelled. His vocal technique, breath control and distinctive tone survived almost unchanged into his mid-seventies. Hans Hotter, who held Erb in high esteem, said that 'it was Paul Bender and Karl Erb who sparked my great love for the art song.' In 1947, aged 70, he gave a concert for his mother's 90th birthday in his home church at Ravensburg. His last records, five songs by Schubert, were made in December 1951 when he was 74. He died in Ravensburg, on his 81st birthday, in 1958.  Literary reference  In his Doktor Faustus, Thomas Mann refers to the first performance of Adrian Leverk√ºhn's work Apocalypse as being under Otto Klemperer in 1926 at Frankfurt. The narrator role 'is here written for a tenor..., one of castrato-like high register, whose chilly crow, objective, reporter-like, stands in terrifying contrast to the content of his catastrophic announcements.... This extremely difficult part was taken and sung by a tenor with the voice of a eunuch,This description is a direct quote from Richard Wagner's disparaging expression for a high lyric tenor, see Ernest Newman, Life of Richard Wagner III (Knopf, New York 1948), 59. named Erbe ('von einem Tenoristen eunuchalen Typs names Erbe gesungen')... the singer had with the greatest intelligence grasped the idea.' (Ch XXXIV, conclusion). The famous Mann irony applies here to the slight change of the name Erb, which has here become the German word for \\"heritage\\" ‚Äì Erbe.  References   Sources  *H.

It takes its name from the best condition a frozen entree can be in according to the film's fictional Mesa Frozen Entree Enthusiast's Club. It was filmed in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area by director Sean Anders on a budget of approximately $35,000. Various reviewers referred to the comedy as a mockumentary in the tradition of This Is Spinal Tap and Best in Show. Plot The film revolves around the personal life of main character Shawn Anderson (played by writer- director Anders) and his two life pursuits, the Mesa Frozen Entree Enthusiast's Club and his band The Christers. The club is an eclectic group of people who collect frozen entrees. The film follows the group planning their first Frozen Entree Enthusiasts Convention and the power struggles between Shawn and wealthy group member Vince, who is also a corporate trainer who models his training seminars after Viet Cong prison camps. The Christers are Shawn's rock band. Formerly named The Reach Arounds, they have turned from hardcore punk rock to Christian rock believing it will be easier to sign a record deal. The story documents the interplay among Anderson and supporting characters. Shelly Toue is an \\"Intercourse Prevention Hotline\\" councilor who is obsessed with Shawn, but who has attracted the affection of Christers member Al McTavish who works at a hair salon for children named Klown Kutz that requires him to dress up as a clown and go by the title \\"Smilist\\". The Christers are managed by Milo Bender (played by Phoenix realtor John Angelo) who also manages a pro-life cafe named the No Choice Cafe that he opened next door to an abortion clinic. Milo also organizes a music festival called Christapalooza where Shawn's band is supposed to play. Other eclectic characters play minor roles in the plot. An effeminate fire fighter named Scott has been \\"converted\\" to heterosexuality by a church ministry. He scavenges commemorative plates from house fires and displays them in his home. Shawn's deaf brother Chris hangs around in his underwear and routinely requests beer and cigarettes from Shawn via TDD telephone calls. Gags Christian Profiteer Magazine Never Been Thawed contains a number of gags intended to bolster its comedy. The principal gag is the absurd array of frozen entrees collected by members of the fictional club, including a \\"Gene Simmons Beef Tongue\\" meal. The members also store and display their entrees in improbable ways such as cramming a number of huge chest freezers into a tiny apartment. Another gag seen throughout the film is the music of Shawn's band The Christers. A former punk rock band, they replace the word \\"fuck\\" in all of their lyrics with the word \\"pray\\" to make the transition to Christian rock. Matt participates in a competitive \\"Alphabet Game\\" league that involves driving around and locating the letters of the alphabet on road signs and billboards. Visual gags that make brief appearances include the character Shelly working at the \\"William Jefferson Clinton Abstinence Center\\" and the character Matt wearing a portable bladder so he doesn't have to get up to urinate. Director Anders displays his skill as a graphic designer by placing posters, gag magazines such as The Christian Profiteer, Apathy Monthly, and Roadside Memorial, and other visuals throughout the film. Cast and crew Anders and LeVinus cast friends and amateur actors for the film, which helped keep the budget low. Many of the people who worked as crew members on the film did double-duty as actors including Anders himself who plays the lead role of Shawn Anderson. Los Angeles therapist and sometime actress Shelly Frasier plays Shelly Toue, Phoenix guitarist and teacher Allen Zwolle plays Al McTavish, producer Chuck LeVinus, who is also a Phoenix firefighter, plays Al's brother Chuck, and co-writer and composer John Morris plays Shawn's deaf brother Chris. Arizona politician Scott Isham agreed to play a formerly gay firefighter in the film believing that it would never be completed or screen anywhere. Anders' actress sister Andrea Anders has a cameo. Production and release Never Been Thawed started as more of an experiment in film making than a serious production, with Anders and LeVinus planning it as a \\"learning experience\\" before embarking on a real production. However, positive reactions at initial film festival screenings led to a successful project that turned a profit. The idea for the film came from some fictional biographies Anders wrote for his band Stone Bogart. One of the biographies claimed that a member had collection of frozen entrees in freezers in his apartment. People frequently e-mailed Anders about the biography, leading him to create a five- minute short film that eventually inspired the story for Never Been Thawed. Anders and LeVinus filmed Never Been Thawed in more than 50 Phoenix area locations including local cafes and wine bars, Squaw Peak, Anders' Mesa, Arizona home, and stretches of Interstate 10 between Phoenix and Casa Grande. They used DV camcorders for shooting more than 100 hours of footage and cast friends in the major roles, accomplishing the production in 18 months on an extremely low budget of $25,000. One of the only experienced actors in the film is Shelly Frasier. The production team initially had problems getting film festivals to accept Never Been Thawed. The Silver Lake Film Festival eventually accepted the film, where Los Angeles Times reviewer Kevin Thomas saw it and subsequently gave it a good review. Thomas' review generated more festival interest, and the film screened at the Wisconsin Film Festival and the Sedona Film Festival in early April 2005. On April 15, 2005, Never Been Thawed premiered at Harkins Theatres Valley Art theater in Tempe, Arizona. The film ran for a total of eight weeks in Arizona, and in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Reception Never Been Thawed received praise for its independent approach to making a successful comedy and its use of \\"astute, straight-faced\\" acting to achieve comedic effect. Some reviewers criticized Anders' use of the film to make fun of various aspects of American culture such as Christian rock, abstinence education, and pro-life advocacy, and his heavy use of gags.

This is one of the most important factors in understanding human group differences in IQ test scores and other measures of cognitive ability. It is estimated that genes contribute about 20‚Äì40% of the variance in intelligence in childhood and about 80% in old age. Thus the environment and its interaction with genes account for a high proportion of the variation in intelligence seen in groups of young children, and for a small proportion of the variation observed in groups of mature adults. Historically, there has been great interest in the field of intelligence research to determine environmental influences on the development of cognitive functioning, in particular, fluid intelligence, as defined by its stabilization at 16 years of age. Despite the fact that intelligence stabilizes in early adulthood it is thought that genetic factors come to play more of a role in our intelligence during middle and old age and that the importance of the environment dissipates. Neurological theory As babies, our neuronal connections are completely undifferentiated. Neurons make connections with neighboring neurons, and these become more complex and more idiosyncratic as the child ages, up until the age of 16, when this process halts. This is also the time frame for development of what is defined in psychometric studies as the general factor of intelligence, or g, as measured by IQ tests. A person's IQ is supposed to be relatively stable after they have reached maturity. It is likely that the growth in neuronal connections is largely due to an interaction with the environment, as there is not even enough genetic material to code for all the possible neural connections. Even if there was enough genetic material to code neural connections, it is unlikely that they could produce such fine tuned connections. In contrast the environment causes meaningful processing as the neurons adapt to stimuli presented. The capacity of the brain to adapt its connections to environmental stimuli diminishes over time, and therefore it would follow that there is a critical period for intellectual development as well. While the critical period for the visual cortex ends in early childhood, other cortical areas and abilities have a critical period that lasts up through maturity (age 16), the same time frame for the development of fluid intelligence. In order for a person to develop certain intellectual abilities, they need to be provided with the appropriate environmental stimuli during childhood, before the critical period for adapting their neuronal connections ends. The existence of a critical period of language development is well established. A case illustrating this critical period is that of E.M., a young man who was born profoundly deaf and did not have any interaction with the deaf community. At the age of 15 he was fitted with hearing aids and taught Spanish; however, after 4 years he still had severe difficulties in verbal comprehension and production. Some researchers believe that the critical period effect is a result of the manner by which intellectual abilities are acquired‚Äîthat changes in neuronal connections inhibit or prevent possible future changes. However, the critical period is observed at approximately the same age in all people, no matter what level of intellectual ability is achieved. Environmental influence =Sociocultural= Family Having access to resources of the home, and having a home life conducive to learning is definitely associated with scores on intelligence tests. However, it is difficult to disentangle possible genetic factors from a parent's attitude or use of language, for example.Neisser, U.; Boodoo, G.; Bouchard Jr, T.J.; Boykin, A.W.; Brody, N.; Ceci, S.J.; Halpern, D.F.; Loehlin, J.C.; Perloff, R.; Sternberg, R.J.; Others, (1998). \\"Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns\\". Annual Progress in Child Psychiatry and Child Development 1997. Retrieved on 2008-03-18. A child's ordinal position in their family has also been shown to affect intelligence. A number of studies have indicated that as birth order increases IQ decreases with first borns having especially superior intelligence. Many explanations for this have been proposed but the most widely accepted idea is that first borns receive more attention and resources from parents and are expected to focus on task achievement, whereas later borns are more focused on sociability. The type and amount of praise received from family can also affect how intelligence develops. Research by Dweck and colleagues suggests that feedback to a child on their academic achievements can alter their future intelligence scores. Telling a child that they are intelligent and praising them for this 'intrinsic' quality indicates that intelligence is fixed, known as entity theory. Children holding the entity theory of ability have been reported as performing less well after a failure, perhaps because they believe that failure on a task indicates that they are not intelligent, and that therefore there is no point in trying to challenge themselves after failure. Dweck contrasts this with incremental theory beliefs ‚Äì the idea that intelligence can be improved upon with effort. Children who hold this theory are more likely to develop a love for learning rather than for achievement. Parents who praise the child's effort at a task rather than the result are more likely to instill this incremental theory of intelligence in their children and thus to improve their intelligence. Peer group JR Harris suggested in The Nurture Assumption that an individual's peer group influences their intelligence greatly over time, and that different peer group characteristics may be responsible for the black-white IQ gap. Several longitudinal studies support the conjecture that peer groups significantly affect scholastic achievement, but relatively few studies have examined the effect on tests of cognitive ability. The peer group an individual identifies with can also influence intelligence through the stereotypes associated with that group. The stereotype threat, first introduced by Claude Steele, is the idea that people belonging to a stereotyped group may perform poorly in a situation where the stereotype is relevant. This has been shown to be a factor in differences in intelligence test scores between different ethnic groups, men and women, people of low and high social status and young and old participants. For example, females who were told that women are worse at chess than men, performed worse in a game of chess than females who were not told this. Education IQ and educational attainment are strongly correlated (estimates range form .40 to over .60.) There is controversy, however, as to whether education affects intelligence ‚Äì it may be both a dependent and independent variable with regard to IQ. A study by Ceci illustrates the numerous ways in which education can affect intelligence. It was found that; IQ decreases during summer breaks from schooling, children with delayed school entry have lower IQ's, those who drop out of education earlier have lower IQ's and children of the same age but of one years less schooling have lower IQ scores. Thus it is difficult to unravel the interconnected relationship of IQ and education where both seem to affect one another. Those who do better on childhood intelligence tests tend to have a lower drop out rate, and complete more years of school and are predictive of school success. For instance, one of the largest ever studies found a correlation of 0.81 between the general intelligence or g-factor and GCSE results. On the other hand, education has been shown to improve performance on intelligence tests. Research controlling for childhood IQ and treating years of education as a causal variable suggests that education causes an increase in total IQ score, although general intelligence was not affected. For instance a natural experiment in Norway where the school leaving age was changed suggested that IQ was raised by additional year of school. School may alter specific knowledge, rather than general ability or biological speed. In terms of what matters about school, it appears that simple quantity or years-in-school may be what underpins the linkage of education with performance on IQ tests. Training and interventions Research on the effectiveness of interventions, and the degree to which fluid intelligence can be increased, especially after age 16, is somewhat controversial. Fluid intelligence is typically thought of as something more innate, and defined as immutable after maturity. One recent article however, demonstrates that, at least for a period of time, fluid intelligence can be increased through training in increasing an adult's working memory capacity. Working memory capacity is defined as the ability to remember something temporarily, like remembering a phone number just long enough to dial it.S. Jaeggi et al. Improving Fluid Intelligence with training on working memory. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2008 In an experiment, groups of adults were first assessed using standard tests for fluid intelligence. Then they trained groups for four different numbers of days, for half an hour each day, using an n-back exercise that worked on improving one's working memory. It supposedly does so through a few different components, involving having to ignore irrelevant items, manage tasks simultaneously, and monitor performance on exercise, while connecting related items. After this training, the groups were tested again and those with training (compared against control groups who did not undergo training) showed significant increases in performance on the fluid intelligence tests. A study by Blackwell et al. found that they could improve a child's mathematics achievement depending on which theory of intelligence they were taught; incremental or entity theory. Entity theory supposes that intelligence is fixed and cannot be altered by working harder. Incremental theory on the other hand assumes that intelligence is malleable and can be developed and improved with effort. Over the course of a year they found that students who had been taught the incremental theory of intelligence showed an upward trajectory in grades in mathematics throughout the year whereas those who had been taught entity theory showed no improvement. This indicates that teaching incremental theory may improve performance on academic tasks, though further research is needed to investigate whether the same results can be found for general intelligence. Other studies have looked at improving intelligence and preventing cognitive decline by using cognition enhancing substances known as nootropics. One such study gave participants a number of known nootropics in combination in the hopes of targeting numerous cellular mechanisms and increasing the effects on cognition that each would have if administered individually. They conducted a double blind test and administered the combination treatment or placebo to adults for 28 days. They administered Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices as a measure of intelligence on the first day and after 28 days. The results indicated a significant improvement in performance for those who had taken the treatment compared to those taking the placebo. The effect was equivalent to an increase in IQ of around 6 points. Environmental enrichment Environmental enrichment affects cognition and intellectual development from a neurobiological perspective. More stimulating environments can increase the number of synapses in the brain which increases synaptic activity. In humans this is most likely to occur during the development of the brain but can also occur in adults. Most of the research on environmental enrichment has been carried out on non human animals. In an experiment, four different habitats were set up to test how environmental enrichment or relative impoverishment affected rats' performance on various measures of intelligent behavior. First, rats were isolated, each to its own cage. In a second condition, the rats were still in isolation, but this time they had some toy, or enriching object in the cage with them. The third condition placed the rats in cages with each other, so they were receiving social enrichment, without any enriching object. The fourth and final condition exposed the rats to both social interaction and some form of object enrichment. In measuring intellectual capacity, the rats who had both forms of enrichment performed best, the ones with social enrichment performed second best, and the ones with a toy in their cage performed still better than the rats with no toy or other rats. When the volume of the rat's cortices was measured the amount of enrichment again correlated with larger volume, which is an indicator of more synaptic connections, and greater intelligence. Attaining this sort of information in humans would be difficult as it requires histological research. However, studies where environmental deprivation has occurred provide insight and indicate that a lack of stimulation can lead to cognitive impairment. Further research using educational attainment as an indicator of cognitive stimulation have found that those with higher levels of education show fewer signs of cognitive aging and that stimulating environments could be used in the treatment of cognitive aging dysfunctions such as dementia. Biological influences =Nutrition= Nutrition has been shown to affect intelligence prenatally and postnatally. The idea that prenatal nutrition may affect intelligence comes from Barker's hypothesis of fetal programming, which states that during critical stages of development the intrauterine environment affects or 'programmes' how the child will develop. Barker cited nutrition as being one of the most important intrauterine influences affecting development and that under-nutrition could permanently change the physiology and development of the child. It has been shown that under-nutrition, particularly protein malnutrition, can lead to irregular brain maturation and learning disabilities. As prenatal nutrition is difficult to measure, birth weight has been used as a surrogate marker of nutrition in many studies. Birth weight needs to be corrected for gestational length to ensure that the effects are due to nutrition and not prematurity. The first longitudinal study looking at the effects of under-nutrition, as measured by birth weight, and intelligence focused on males who were born during the Dutch famine. The results indicated that there were no effects of under-nutrition on intellectual development. However, many studies since have found a significant relationship and a meta-analysis by Shenkin and colleagues indicates that birth weight is associated with scores on intelligence tests in childhood. Post-natal malnutrition can also have a significant influence on intellectual development. This relationship has been harder to establish because the issue of malnutrition is often conflated with socioeconomic issues. However, it has been demonstrated in a few studies where pre-schoolers in two Guatemalan villages (where undernourishment is common) were given protein nutrition supplements for several years, and even in the lowest socioeconomic class, those children showed an increase in performance on intelligence tests, relative to controls with no dietary supplement. Malnutrition has been shown to affect organizational processes of the brain such as neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, cell migration and cellular differentiation. This thus results in abnormalities in the formation of neural circuits and the development of neurotransmitter systems. However, some of these effects of malnutrition have been shown to be improved upon with a good diet and environment. Early nutrition can also affect brain structures that are actually correlated to IQ levels. Specifically, the caudate nucleus is particularly affected by early environmental factors and its volume correlates with IQ. In an experiment by Isaacs et al., infants born prematurely were either assigned a standard or high-nutrient diet during the weeks directly after birth. When the individuals were assessed later in adolescence, it was found that the high-nutrient group had significantly larger caudate volumes and scored significantly higher on verbal IQ tests. This study also found that the extent to which the caudate volume size related selectively to verbal IQ was much greater in male participants, and not very significant in females. This may help explain the finding in other earlier research that the effects of early diet on intelligence are more predominant in males. Another study done by Lucas et al. confirms the conclusions about the importance of nutrition in the cognitive development of individuals born prematurely. It also found that the cognitive function of males was significantly more impaired by poorer postnatal nutrition. A unique finding however, was that there was a higher incidence of cerebral palsy in the individuals who were fed the non-nutrient enhanced formula. Breast feeding has long been purported to supply important nutrients to infants and has been correlated with increased cognitive gains later in childhood. The link between intelligence and breast feeding has even been shown to persist into adulthood. However, this view has been challenged in recent times by studies which have found no such link between breast feeding and cognitive abilities. A meta-analysis by Der, batty and Deary concluded that there was no link between IQ and breastfeeding when maternal intelligence had been accounted for and that mothers' intelligence is likely to be the link between breastfeeding and intelligence. Other studies have indicated that breast feeding may be particularly important for children born Small for Gestational Age (SGA). A study by Slykerman et al. found that there was no association between breast feeding and higher intelligence in their full sample but that when looking only at SGA babies there was a significant increase in intelligence for those who had been breastfed over those who had not. A 2007 study provides a possible resolution to the different results found across studies investigating breastfeeding's effect on intelligence. Caspi et al. found that whether breast feeding increased IQ was linked to whether the infant had a certain variant of the FADS2 gene. Children with the C variant of the gene showed an IQ advantage of 7 points when breastfed, whereas those with the GG variant showed no IQ advantages with breastfeeding. However, other studies have failed to replicate this result. =Stress= Maternal stress levels may affect the developing child's intelligence. The timing and duration of stress can greatly alter the fetus' brain development which can have long-term effects on intelligence. Maternal reactions to stress such as increased heart rate are dampened during pregnancy in order to protect the fetus. The impact of stress can be seen across many different species and can be an indicator of the outside environment which can help the fetus to adapt for surviving in the outside world. However, not all maternal stress has been perceived as bad as some has been seen to induce advantageous adaptions. Stress during early childhood may also affect the child's development and have negative consequences on neural systems underlying fluid intelligence. A 2006 study found that IQ scores were related to the number of traumas and symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adults. Similarly, another study found that exposure to violence in the community and the subsequent distress, were related to a significant decrease in intelligence scores and reading abilities in children aged 6‚Äì7 years. Exposure to violence in the community had similar cognitive effects as experiencing childhood maltreatment or trauma. =Maternal age= Maternal age has been shown to be related to intelligence with younger mothers tending have children of lower intelligence than older mothers. However, this relationship may be non-linear with older mothers being at increased risk of giving birth to children with down syndrome which greatly affects cognitive abilities. =Exposure to toxic chemicals and other substances= Lead exposure has been proven to have significant effects on the intellectual development of a child. In a long-term study done by Baghurst et al. 1992, children who grew up next to a lead- smelting plant had significantly lower intelligence test scores, negatively correlated with their blood-lead level exposure. Even though lead levels have been reduced in our environment, some areas in the United States, particularly inner cities, are still at risk for exposing their children. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to alcohol can greatly affect a child's performance on intelligence tests, and their intellectual growth. At high doses, fetal alcohol syndrome can develop, which causes intellectual disabilities, as well as other physical symptoms, such as head and face deformities, heart defects and slow growth. It is estimated that 1 in 1,000 babies born in the general population are born with fetal alcohol syndrome, as a result of heavy use of alcohol during pregnancy.Fundamentals of Abnormal Psychology 5th ed. Comer, 2008. However, studies have shown that even at slightly less severe doses, prenatal exposure to alcohol can still affect the intelligence of the child in development, without having the full syndrome. Through a study done by Streissguth, Barr, Sampson, Darby, and Martin in 1989, it was shown that moderate prenatal doses of alcohol, defined as the mother ingesting 1.5 oz. daily, lowered children's test scores by 4 point below control levels, by the age of four. They also showed that prenatal exposure to aspirin and antibiotics is correlated with lower performance on intelligence tests as well. However, more recent studies have found that low to moderate alcohol consumption is not associated with children's intelligence scores. This contradictory evidence could perhaps be explained by findings that the effects of alcohol may depend on the genetic makeup of the fetus. In a recent study Lewis et al., looked at alcohol dehydrogenase genes and their mutations, which humans can have between 0 and 10. These mutations slow the breakdown of alcohol so the more mutations the fetus has the slower they will breakdown alcohol. They found that in children whose mothers had drank moderately, those children with four or more mutations performed worse on an intelligence test than those with two or less mutations. In another study, prenatal drug exposure was shown to have significantly negative effects on cognitive functioning, as measured at the age of five, compared again controls matched for socioeconomic status and inner-city environment. The researchers concluded that prenatally drug-exposed children are at greater risk for learning difficulties and attention problems in school, and therefore should be the subject of interventions to support educational success. It could be hypothesized that the effect of these drugs on the development of the brain prenatally, and axon guidance could be the root of the negative consequences on later deficits in intellectual development. Specifically, prenatal exposure to marijuana affects development of intelligence later in childhood, in a nonlinear fashion, with the degree of exposure. Heavy use by the mother within the first trimester is associated with lower verbal reasoning scores on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale; heavy use during the second trimester is associated with deficits in composite, short-term memory as well as lower quantitative scores on the test; high exposure in third trimester associated with lower quantitative scores as well. A study by Fried and Smith indicated that marijuana exposure did not lead to a decrease in global intelligence but that it did lead to problems with executive functions in childhood. However, another study found that when influences such as maternal age, mother's personality and home environment, there was no longer a difference between children exposed to marijuana and those not exposed with relation to executive functions. Exposure to tobacco smoking has been associated with diminished intelligence and attentional problems. One study indicated that children whose mothers had smoked 10 or more cigarettes a day were between 3 and 5 months behind schoolmates in reading, maths and general ability. However, other studies have found no direct link between IQ and tobacco smoking with maternal intelligence accounting entirely for the relationship. =Perinatal factors= There is also evidence that birth complications and other factors around the time of birth (perinatal) can have serious implications on intellectual development. For example, a prolonged period of time without access to oxygen during the delivery can lead to brain damage and mental retardation. Also, low birth weights have been linked to lower intelligence scores later in lives of the children. There are two reasons for low birth weight, either premature delivery or the infant's size is just lower than average for its gestational age; both contribute to intellectual deficits later in life. A meta analysis of low birth weight babies found that there is a significant relationship between low birth weight and impaired cognitive abilities; however, the relationship is small, and they concluded that, although it may not be relevant at an individual level, it may instead be relevant at a population level. Other studies have also found that the correlations are relatively small unless the weight is extremely low (less than 1,500 g) ‚Äì in which case the effects on intellectual development are more severe and often result in mental retardation. Development of genius It has been hypothesized that the development of genius in an area results from early environmental exposure to the topic in which the \\"genius\\" has prodigious knowledge or skill. This is utilizing the definition of genius that is not just a significantly higher than average IQ score, but also having some type of exceptional understanding or ability in a specific field. Albert Einstein is often used as an example of genius; he did not demonstrate generalized exceptional intelligence as a child; however, there is evidence that he started exploring the ideas of physics and the universe at a young age. This fits with the model of development of fluid intelligence before age of maturity because the neuronal connections are still being made in childhood. The idea is if you expose a child to concepts of, for example theoretical physics, before their brain stops responding to the environment in a plastic way, then you get exceptional understanding of that field in adulthood, because there was a framework developed for it in early childhood. However, Garlick proposes that early environmental experience with their field of genius, is necessary but not sufficient to the development of genius. Intelligence alone is not enough for the development of genius but the pathways and neural connections for divergent thinking are also necessary. Thus the home must encourage creativity. The parents of gifted children tend to supply enriching environments with intellectually and culturally stimulating materials thus increasing the child's likelihood to engage in creative activities. There are many environmental influences on intelligence, typically divided into biological and non-biological factors, often involving social or cultural factors. The commonality between these two divisions is the exposure in early childhood. It seems as though exposure to these various positive or negative influences on intelligence levels needs to happen early on in the development of the brain, before the neuronal connections have ceased forming. Parents of gifted children also tend to have above average educational achievement and at least one tends to work in an intellectual profession. There is also evidence that the probability of a gifted child becoming a genius may be increased if the child has had to face adversity or trauma and that a traditional upbringing may encourage conformity and discourage the necessary divergent thinking. Training Training at an early age reduces synaptic pruning, which helps save neurons. =Musical= Early musical training in children is said to improve IQ. Schellenberg conducted a study in which children either received music lessons, drama lessons or no lessons and measured their intelligence scores. He found that children in the music group showed a greater overall increase in IQ scores than the children in the other groups. However, a study claimed that musical training improves verbal, but not visual memory. Significant differences in brain structure between musicians and non- musicians have been found. It was shown that there were significant differences in gray matter volume in motor, auditory and visual-spatial regions of the brain. The authors suggest that this could in part be because musicians from a young age translate visually perceived musical notes into motor commands whilst listening to the auditory output. Studies have shown that listening to Mozart before taking an IQ test will improve scores. This is called the Mozart Effect. The Mozart Effect improves spatial-temporal reasoning. For example, one study found that college students scores on a spatial abilities test increased by 8-9 points after they had listened to Mozart whereas there was no increase when they listened to relaxation instructions or silence. =Chess= Studies have shown that chess requires auditory-verbal-sequential skills, not visuospatial skills. A German study found that Garry Kasparov, a Soviet / Russian former World Chess Champion, regarded by many as the greatest chess player of all time, has an IQ of 135 and an extremely good memory. Similarly, a study looking at young Belgian chess experts found that they have an average IQ of 121, a verbal IQ of 109 and a performance IQ of 129. However, a recent study looking at an elite group of young chess players found that intelligence was not a significant factor in chess skill. One study found that students who were taking a chess class improved mathematical and comprehension performance. Despite this a recent study found that chess did not improve students' academic or cognitive abilities. At-risk students were put into 2 groups: one group was given a chess class once a week for 90 minutes, the other group was not. The results indicated no differences between the groups in changes in math, reading, writing or general intelligence.

He is most known for his 1899 novel El problema, though he is recognized in Central America for the whole of his literary output. He was born in Guatemala City in 1871, and served in the dictatorship of Manuel Estrada (whose government served as a model for Miguel √Ångel Asturias' novel El Se√±or Presidente) until 1919, at which time he emigrated to Costa Rica, and then to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he served as a journalist for the newspaper La Prensa. He died in 1944 in Buenos Aires and his body is interred in the San L√°zaro cemetery in Antigua Guatemala. Many of his novels, including El problema and La sombra de la Casa Blanca, concern the presence and influence of the United States in Central America. La sombra was published by El Ateneo in Buenos Aires. His works traverse a great number of literary traditions, including Modernismo and the historical novel, the latter influenced by his fellow countryman Jos√© Milla. He also wrote poetry, as well as political treatises and sociological works.

The EP was headlined by the song \\"Night Boat to Cairo\\", from the band's debut album One Step Beyond.... It entered the UK Singles Chart on 5 April 1980, reaching a high of number 6. Retrieved on 19 June 2007. Background After the release of \\"My Girl\\", the band felt that they had exhausted the material from One Step Beyond..., and did not want to release any more singles from the album. However, Dave Robinson, head of Stiff Records, disagreed. Eventually, a compromise was made, and the band decided to release an EP featuring one album track and three new tracks. The \\"Work Rest and Play\\" EP was the result. Content The EP's success was largely down to \\"Night Boat to Cairo\\", which headlined the set and had an accompanying music video. The fourth song, \\"Don't Quote Me On That\\", was a commentary on press coverage which had tried to paint the band as racists who supported the National Front. Some of the band's shows had been disrupted by skinhead violence and, in a 1979 NME interview, Madness member Chas Smash was quoted as saying \\"We don't care if people are in the NF as long as they're having a good time.\\" This was quoted to add to the speculation that Madness was a racist band supporting the National Front, although the band members denied those allegations. Retrieved on 19 June 2007. A promotional 12\\" single was issued in the UK featuring \\"Don't Quote Me On That\\" backed with \\"Swan Lake\\" from the One Step Beyond... album. The version of \\"Don't Quote Me On That\\" is a different, shorter mix from the one eventually used on the UK EP, and seems to have been used in all European countries outside the UK. It can be heard during the opening titles of the Madness film Take It Or Leave It. The 2010 re-release of the band's first studio album One Step Beyond... includes the three original songs from the Work Rest and Play EP as bonus tracks on a second CD. International releases Releases varied. Some countries opted to issue \\"Night Boat To Cairo\\" as a two-track 45rpm single, containing a variety of B-sides: in France \\"Swan Lake\\"; in Belgium \\"The Young & The Old\\" and in Germany \\"Don't Quote Me On That\\". In the Netherlands \\"Night Boat To Cairo\\" was the B-side and \\"Tarzan's Nuts\\" from One Step Beyond... was the A-side of the 45rpm single, this is in addition to the 33rpm EP which was also issued there. In Portugal, the EP featured a different mix of \\"Night Boat To Cairo\\". In the UK 45rpm DJ and jukebox editions were printed up with \\"Deceives The Eye\\" as the B-side. In Italy a 33rpm 12\\" single was released with \\"Un Passo Avanti\\" (\\"One Step Beyond\\" sung in Italian) and \\"Night Boat To Cairo\\" on one side and \\"The Young & The Old\\" and \\"Don't Quote Me On That\\" on the other. When Japan released the \\"Grey Day\\"-led 6-track 12\\" EP in 1981, it contained the three 1980-recorded Work Rest & Play EP tracks, two of which were alternate mixes; the aforementioned \\"Don't Quote Me On That\\" plus \\"Deceives The Eye\\" which ends cleanly without Suggs's echoing, fading vocal. \\"Night Boat to Cairo\\" music video Lee Thompson plays saxophone.After the decision to issue the EP, a promotional music video was needed. However, there was a lack of time before the release, and not enough to make an effective one. As \\"Night Boat to Cairo\\" was the leading track from the EP, a music video of the song was created to represent the EP as a whole. Madness filmed a karaoke type video in front of a blatantly chroma keyed backdrop of an Egyptian pyramid, with the lyrics appearing on screen in \\"bouncing ball\\" style as Suggs sang them. During the long instrumental sections of the song, the band often run around the set, marching and performing their signature \\"Nutty Train\\". Despite the video's poor effects and unprofessional feel, it became very popular amongst fans. This is possibly due to the carefree nature and fooling around of the band, probably down to the large amount of alcohol drunk while filming.

She died of heart failure May 8, 2007 in Miami, Florida. Bisz was a prominent Florida attorney. A survivor of infantile polio (which briefly paralyzed her from the neck down), she was one of three sisters, an avid fisher, and played church piano music when she wasn't busy with her job. Bisz went on to become one of the Florida's first female lawyers. Professional career Bisz graduated high school in 1927 and was sponsored by the Citizens and Southern Bank of Atlanta loan to attend a business college. She was 18 when she left the business office and got a job at a law office. However, it wasn't until her uncle encouraged her to become a lawyer that she pursued it. Though Bisz had no formal college degree, she studied law at the South Florida College of Law but dropped out after learning four of the thirty two subjects on the bar exam so that she could teach herself the rest in time. Bisz passed the bar is exam in 1937 and was admitted to a Florida Bar the same year. She was so dedicated to her job that when her arm was seriously injured in 1954, she was back to work as soon as she was released from her three month hospitalization. The very same year, she traveled to Washington, D.C. to be admitted to the Supreme Court of the United States and the Court of Military Appeals (the country's two highest courts). Bisz was one of the first woman admitted to the Dade County Bar Association in 1937. She sat on its courts committee and was unanimously voted in to take Director George Smathers position in July 1942 after previously serving three terms as secretary. Bisz was the first woman to hold such a prestigious position with the Dade County Bar. Furthermore, Bisz was giving at least one day a week to draw up wills for members of the armed services (or legal matters for anyone dependent on them) for free. Additionally, Bisz was the secretary for Sunset Lanes Groves Inc. and director of Boulevard Grocery Corporation. Bisz specialized in probate law: proving that a will is valid and administering estate according to the will of the deceased person. Most notably, Bisz represented clients whose property had been seized in Fidel Castro's 1959 Cuban revolution. A few of whom she represented included Fernando Cabeza, Winnifred Clover Frodin, Gerladine F. Walsh, Margy F Thiel, and Joseph E. Fitzgerlad. In the cases against the Cuban government, previously mentioned, Bisz was able to get each of the people she represented a cash refund for their lost land. Additionally, she won them a settlement of 6% interest from the time the land was lost until the court date. Bisz also represented Ted Williams, the Boston Red Sox baseball legend.

It won The Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Comedy that same year. The sequel, Up 'n' Under II, followed in 1985. Plot It followed the story of an inept pub team from the Wheatsheaf Arms pub in a rugby league sevens competition in Kingston upon Hull in England. Ex-pro Arthur's only passions in life are his wife and rugby league. When he hears about the 'Cobblers Arms' pub team and their corrupt manager, Arthur bets his life savings with Reg Welch that he can train any team to beat them. However, the 'Wheatsheaf Arms' can only muster a side of four whose pride lies in their unbroken record of defeat. The pitifully unfit set of men have to accept the help of a coach, who just happens to be a woman. They have to struggle through adversity, come up triumphant and become a team. They are given a bye to the final of the competition where they have to play The Cobblers. Up 'n' Under II The sequel to the original play is centred on the return match between the amateur rugby league team from the 'Wheatsheaf Arms' and the 'Cobblers Arms'.

He played as a left half and spent his entire 14-year professional career with Blackpool. Club career Born in Valleyfield, Fife, Kelly began his career with Perth-based junior club Jeanfield Swifts. He joined English club Blackpool in 1943 as a 20-year-old, but due to the ongoing World War II, he didn't make his League debut for the Seasiders until September 1946. During the war, he guested for several clubs, including East Fife. It took some time for Kelly to establish himself in Blackpool's half-back line, but by 1948‚Äì49, the trio of Harry Johnston, Eric Hayward and Kelly was becoming legendary. He played in both the 1948 and 1951 FA Cup Finals. However, in the final home league game of the 1952‚Äì53 season against Liverpool he suffered a broken ankle following a tackle by centre- forward Louis Bimpson and he missed the famous 1953 match-up with Bolton Wanderers, although the club asked the Football Association to produce a special winners' medal for his nomination as \\"twelfth man\\". Kelly later said, \\"I lived a great journey to Wembley. That's what fascinated me. And it was a privilege to know such a good crowd of players. They were lovely. Even though we'd lost the other two, it was great to have played on the sacred turf at Wembley and I have fond memories.\\" The 1950s was the most successful decade in Blackpool's history to date, and Kelly was at the club playing top division football throughout, as were goalkeeper George Farm, defender Tommy Garrett, right winger Stanley Matthews, forward Jackie Mudie and outside left Bill Perry. In 1955‚Äì56 he took over as Blackpool skipper from Johnston and helped the club to their highest-ever league finish, runners-up to Manchester United. He remained club captain until his retirement from the professional game in 1960. At the end of 1959‚Äì60 he was given a free transfer, and Lancashire Combination side Ashton United came in for his services as their player- manager. International career Kelly won one cap for Scotland, in a 6‚Äì0 victory over the United States on 30 April 1952. He also appeared twice for Scotland B. Personal life Kelly was married in 1949 and had three daughters. After retiring, he remained in Blackpool and was later on the backroom staff at Bloomfield Road. He also started a business in the North Shore area of the town as a grocer and ice-cream manufacturer.

On 6 October 1973, Egypt launched a massive surprise attack on Israel that included over 200 Egyptian aircraft participating in an opening airstrike. The Israeli Air Force Base Ofir at Sharm el-Sheikh came under attack by 20 Egyptian Air Force MiG-17s and their eight MiG-21 escorts. Not realizing the extent of the attack, Israel quickly scrambled two F-4E Phantom II fighter jets. The Israeli pilots proceeded to jettison their external fuel tanks and engage all 28 MiGs in aerial combat. In just under six minutes, seven Egyptian MiGs had been shot down and the remaining Egyptian planes disengaged and returned to Egypt.Aloni (2001), p. 80 The Israeli Phantoms returned to their base.Pollack (2002), p. 125 The Egyptians dispute the Israeli account of the battle, but they never did provide their own version of what happened. Prelude In the summer of 1973, Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 accidentally flew over the Sinai. It was intercepted by the IAF and ordered to land but refused and was subsequently shot down. IAF high command feared this might lead to a reprisal against El-Al aircraft en route to South Africa and back and therefore maintained fighter aircraft on quick reaction alert (QRA) at Ofir. These aircraft were also meant to counter the threat posed to the small Israeli Navy Red Sea flotilla and the Hawk missile batteries guarding the Red Sea straits from Egyptian MiGs at Hurghada.Yonay (1993), pp. 318‚Äì319 Base commander at the time was Ya'acov 'Yak' Nevo. Two IAF 107 Squadron F-4E Phantoms were present at Ofir on Yom Kippur, October 6, 1973, when war broke out. These were manned by four airmen: pilot Amir Nahumi with navigator Yossi Yavin and pilot Daniel Shaki with navigator David Regev, all relatively inexperienced at the time.Aloni 2004, p. 26. At 9:00 AM they were issued a red alert by the controller. At 1:50 PM the sirens were sounded. Several approaching low-flying formations were spotted on radar, yet the controller did not scramble the pair, failing to realise the significance of the attack. No longer waiting for the order to scramble, Nahumi ordered the mechanics to start up the planes and took off. Shaki joined him.Cohen (1990), pp. 453‚Äì454 Nahumi later described the scene: Battle according to the Israeli account Israeli F-4E Phantom. Flag markings on nose credit the aircraft with 3 combat kills. Soon after take off, the MiGs began bombing the runways. Nahumi ordered Shaki to dump the detachable fuel tanks and to take the west end of the base while he would take the east one. Nahumi then shot down one MiG with a Sidewinder missile. He turned back toward the base and crossed the path of two MiGs bombing it. These rose and flew away. The base's MIM-23 Hawk battery held fire to avoid hitting the Israeli aircraft, and two MiGs dived down to destroy it. Nahumi started to chase the leading MiG flying as low as possible and fired his Gatling gun but missed. The MiG aborted its bombing mission. Nahumi tried to chase it, but found out his left engine had suffered a compressor stall, presumably following a cannon burst. After a short period of flying on one engine he managed to restart the engine and broke away from the MiG to attack its partner's tail. The MiG turned sharply toward him. Nahumi pulled up until he was facing the MiG and shot it down as it passed by. The second MiG fled.Cohen (1990), pp. 454‚Äì457 Nahumi then saw another pair of MiG-17s attacking a communications unit near the bay. These were startled to encounter Nahumi and one of them fired its air-to-surface missiles at the Phantom. The Phantom shot down that MiG with a guided missile from a distance of 600 meters. Shaki, meanwhile, had shot down three planes and was looking for the fourth, when MiG-21s attacked. One of them found itself in an inferior position and descended at a speed of 500 knots to sea level, hit the water and bounced back up twice, before pulling up and flying away. Shaki was running out of fuel and decided to land on the damaged runway. Nahumi was then blinded by a flash of light reflecting from another pair of MiGs trying to escape. Nahumi shot one down and its partner fled to the safety of the mountains. Nahumi had also almost run out of fuel and decided not to give chase.Cohen (1990), pp. 457‚Äì458 Aftermath Nahumi and Shaki consulted the forward air controller and decided to land on the parallel runway, which was shorter but less damaged. Once on the ground, they began preparing their planes for another Egyptian attack, which never materialized.Cohen (1990), p. 458 The four airmen were later awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their performance during the battle. Egyptian account According to the Egyptians, Ras Nasrani Air Base, the former Egyptian name of Ofir,Israeli Air Force Air Bases was indeed among several Israeli bases in the Sinai targeted by the Egyptian air strike on October 6, in which around 220 aircraft took part.Hassan El Badri, The Ramadan War, 1973 p.156. The MiG-21 aircraft escorting the MiG-17s in the airstrike against Ras Nasrani were part of the No. 25 Sqn of the EAF's 102nd Air Wing. The MiG-21s did not participate in the ground attack, and according to the pilots, no aerial opposition was ever encountered. Egyptian commanders claim that five aircraft were lost in the opening airstrike of the war altogether; Saad El Shazly, the Egyptian Chief of Staff, stated that total losses from October 6 up to the morning of October 7 were five aircraft.Saad El Shazly, The Crossing of the Suez p. 226‚Äì227El Gamasy, The October War, 1973 p.206 Another Egyptian commander, Abdel Ghani el-Gamasy, reported just five aircraft losses for the entire air strike as well, as do other sources. Another source mentions the loss of seven aircraft to Israeli fighters and several others to anti-aircraft fire.Nordeen and Nicolle 1996, p. 279 Simon Dunstan mentions the claim that the air strike resulted in a total of five Egyptian aircraft losses (although without specifying which air bases were attacked),Simon Dunstan, The Yom Kippur War 1973 The Arab-Israeli War of 1973, p.33 yet nevertheless places Egyptian losses for the opening strike at \\"nearly 40 aircraft\\".Dunstan 2007, p. 58 References =Bibliography=  English:  External links * Category:Battles of the Yom Kippur War Category:Air-to-air combat operations and battles Category:Sinai Peninsula Category:Aerial operations and battles involving Israel ","title":"Ofira Air Battle"},{"id":"11841188","text":"Mary Tate Engels (born March 27, 1943) is an American writer of almost thirty romance novels since 1982 as Tate McKenna and Mary Tate Engels.

Born in California, Willams had first arrived in Alaska in 1900 at the age of 19, looking for adventure. He spent the next three decades trapping, hunting, breeding dogs, and blazing trails throughout the frontier. In October 1929, he was recorded for the 1930 census as a 47-year old hunter/fur trader born in California living with his wife Aileen in Jokona village (Gakona?) in the Chitina, Alaska district.United States Census, 1930 In 1933, to show the viability of the Alaska Highway, Slim traveled down the proposed route by dogsled. He only used crude maps in what was previously unmapped territory. When the spring thaw made sledding impossible, he rigged up his sled with Model-T wheels and continued through the muddy Canadian plains toward his destination, the Chicago World's Fair. By the time he reached Seattle, he had become a small celebrity. After the World's Fair had closed for the season, Slim and his team of half-bred wolf/dogs proceeded to Washington, D.C., where he camped in a city park and spent the winter discussing Alaskan concerns with legislators. He also met with President Franklin Roosevelt. Slim returned to Chicago in the summer of 1934 and married his wife Gladys Pennington in 1936. The authorized biography by Richard Morenus does not mention any relationship prior to this marriage, but another memoir recounts an earlier marriage to Aileen Gallaher (see citations below). In 1939 Williams made a second trip with John Logan down the proposed Alaska Highway route. This time he traveled during the summer with a 300 lb motorbike. He said he never missed a meal, but sometimes he got a few days behind. Logan documented this trip with video footage showing, among other things, how they cooked over the campfire, built boats, and crossed rivers (in one clip, they used a hand-powered tram to haul their motorcycles across). These videos are available at Alaska's Digital Archives (see external link below). Slim Williams was a strong proponent of the Alaska Highway before WWII. However, officials decided that there was no need for a highway at that time. When they finally did build the highway in 1942, it went along a route east of the trail Slim had blazed in 1932/33. The decision-makers believed their chosen route would present greater opportunities for economic growth. Later in life, Slim enjoyed success as a popular lecturer. He traveled around the country, entertaining his audiences with his stories about overcoming the challenges of the vast, frozen wilderness of the north. Slim and Gladys lived in Old Town in Chicago on North Park Avenue. He died at Ravenswood Hospital at age 93 and was buried in Mitchell Indiana, per his featured obituary in the Chicago Tribune.Death certificate in Illinois, Cook County Deaths, 1878-1994 References ;Books * Biography: Alaska Sourdough: The Story of Slim Williams by Richard Morenus. 1968, Rand McNally; out of print. 1st ed. was 1956.

After the band finished touring for Alive and Amplified, they had some troubles. Founder guitarist Graham Tyler's father died, a strong supporter of the band from its early days, and Graham left to tend to his family. Then, the rhythm section dropped out. Sammy James Jr., guitarist and singer, wrote many of these songs during the troubled time. When he finally got around to recording them, Graham had rejoined, along with original drummer Will Rockwell-Scott. Current bass player Reno Bo and ex-bass player Michael Bangs are both credited with backing vocals in the liner notes. Ironically, neither of them actually plays bass, Sammy James Jr. covers that. After all of this, the band eyed an August 2006 release. However, their label V2 Records instead changed it to January 2007 for a better publicity push. Then, V2 folded, and the band spent 5 months looking for a way to release the album. It finally came out in June 2007 with bonus tracks on Elixiia Records/Templar Label Group.

It was published in German by Amigo Spiele as Um Krone und Kragen (Around Crown and Collar) in 2006, and in English as To Court the King by Rio Grande Games. The basic mechanics of rolling and re-rolling dice have drawn comparisons to the game of Yahtzee. Publication History When Amigo Spiele was designing this game, they invited players to comment on the ongoing development and make suggestions. This started with the initial conceptualization, and continued through the prototype game, initial sketches of the character cards, final oil paintings, and selection of the symbols appearing on each card. Players were also invited to submit suggestions for a game title, and one of them, Um Krone und Kragen, was chosen. Description =Components= The game components are: * 60 character cards with 19 different characters * 12 dice * 5 character overview cards * a starting player marker * rulebook =Gameplay= For setup, the character cards are distributed in the middle of the table. The first player receives the starting player marker and starts a round of dice rolling with three dice. After the first roll, the active player may choose to reserve any number of those dice (but must choose at least one), and then re-rolls the rest. The active player can repeat this process a second time. Once the active player is done rolling, they may use those dice to claim any of the character cards. Different cards will require different combinations of dice. The Laborer, for example, requires a total of 15 or greater. The Knight requires 5 of a kind. Each character card claimed will give the owner an additional ability, ranging from rolling more dice or having additional re-rolls to the ability the change the die to the number of your choice, but a player cannot claim more than one of any type of character. Claimed cards are placed face-up in front of the owner. Once the first player is finished, play then passes to the player on the left. Once everyone has had a chance to roll dice and claim characters, the starting player marker is passed to the right, and the new starting player begins a new round of dice rolling. Dice-rolling abilities gradually progress due to abilities conferred by owned character cards. =Endgame= The first player to roll seven identical dice acquires the king and queen. One final round of dice rolling follows this action, where each player is given the opportunity to wrest ownership of the king from the current owner by rolling a better dice result than the current owner rolled. If the king is successfully claimed by another player during this final round, the owner of the queen has one last chance to roll a better total of dice to win back the king. =Victory conditions= After the final round of dice rolling is complete, the owner of the king is the winner. Reception The independent board game review site Games of Tradition gave this game an above average rating of 7.5 out of 10, saying \\"Typically played under 45 minutes, this is also a good family filler: the rules are easy, there is competition, and even kids from 10 years old will enjoy it. On a rainy Sunday afternoon, you‚Äôll appreciate opening the box for a few rounds.\\" The reviewer did warn that due to the requirement for a table, it might not be suitable for camping, but concluded that it \\"will be a great one for a nice friendly evening.\\" On the German game website Reich der Spiele, Carsten Pinnow found the game generally took about 10‚Äì20 minutes per person, so that a game with five players could much longer than the 45 minutes claimed by the publisher; this increased substantially if some of the players \\"take their time when they have already collected five or six cards.\\" Although Pinnow liked the \\"excellently designed character cards\\", he criticized the tiny pictograms on the cards, saying, \\"even people with normal eyes need a magnifying glass.\\" He concluded that if played with fewer players, the game \\"offers relaxed gaming fun.\\" On the German game review website Holgs Spieleteufel, the reviewer found the cumulative dice rolling was hard for new players to understand, and led to \\"considerable delays. If five newcomers play, the game will certainly last longer than the specified 45 minutes.\\" The reviewer also didn't like the fact that your character cards improve your chances in the final round but have no bearing on the final point total. \\"It can happen that you were better than everyone else during the game, but in the end you did not win because you had a bad final round [...] There is the feeling that you 'struggle' for 45 to 60 minutes and in the last round everything depends on a single happy or unfortunate roll of the die.\\" Despite this, the reviewer concluded, \\"I really liked this strategic dice card game [...] but I will not play with more than three players again, unless everyone knows the game well and is very familiar with the requirements and skills of the characters.\\" On the German game review site Starstpieler, the reviewer admired the high production values of the components and \\"beautiful artwork\\"of the cards, but found the game \\"a bit too lengthy.\\" The reviewer also felt that new players had difficulties learning the various abilities of the character cards. The reviewer concluded with a thumbs up, but recommended not playing with any more than 3 players to shorten the length of the game.

Biography Seay joined the Army from Montgomery, Alabama in 1967,Service Profile and by August 25, 1968 was serving as a Sergeant in the 62d Transportation Company (Medium Truck), 7th Transportation Battalion, 48th Transportation Group. On that day, a convoy of the 81 trucks escorted by eight Military Police gun jeeps left Long Binh Post for the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division at T√¢y Ninh Combat Base. Traveling at the mandated convoy speed of 20 mph, the convoy passed through the village of Ap Nhi. Approximately 11:45, a battalion sized enemy force opened fire from the Ben Chu Rubber Plantation on their right. The lead 30 5-ton cargo trucks escaped the kill zone, but the enemy set two fuel tankers on fire at the front of the convoy and two ammunition trailers on fire at the rear trapping the convoy in between. The enemy fire forced the crews of the trucks and gun jeeps to quickly dismount and take cover leaving their M60 machine guns on their jeeps. The enemy then made a concerted effort to destroy the radios and M-60s on the gun jeeps, but one MP managed to get to his jeep and put in a call for help about 15 minutes into the fight. Meanwhile, SGT Seay and SP4 David Sellman took cover behind the trailers of their rigs and fought back. Seay left the cover of his position several times to toss hand grenades back and was finally wounded in the wrist. The nearest mechanized infantry security forces approached with M113 armored personnel carriers but the intense enemy fire would not allow them to enter the kill zone, so they established casualty collection points at both ends of the kill zone. Truck drivers and MPs either fought in small pockets like Seay and Sellman or maneuvered to the safety of the ends of the convoy. Seay found LT Howard Brockbank and four other soldiers where they treated his wound. He continued to fight back enemy assaults until he died from loss of blood. The ambush lasted for over nine hours and for his actions during the battle, Seay was awarded the Medal of Honor.Richard E.

The Seay Army Reserve Center on Commanders Drive in Mobile, Alabama was dedicated and named in honor of William Seay for his heroic service. Lt.Col (dec) Arthur Jones Jr. was responsible for this name assignment and dedication. Medal of Honor citation Sergeant Seay's official Medal of Honor citation reads: 130px :For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Seay distinguished himself while serving as a driver with the 62d Transportation Company, on a resupply mission. The convoy with which he was traveling, carrying critically needed ammunition and supplies from Long Binh to Tay Ninh, was ambushed by a reinforced battalion of the North Vietnamese Army. As the main elements of the convoy entered the ambush killing zone, they were struck by intense rocket, machinegun and automatic weapon fire from the well concealed and entrenched enemy force. When his convoy was forced to stop, Sgt. Seay immediately dismounted and took a defensive position behind the wheels of a vehicle loaded with high-explosive ammunition. As the violent North Vietnamese assault approached to within 10 meters of the road, Sgt. Seay opened fire, killing 2 of the enemy. He then spotted a sniper in a tree approximately 75 meters to his front and killed him. When an enemy grenade was thrown under an ammunition trailer near his position, without regard for his own safety he left his protective cover, exposing himself to intense enemy fire, picked up the grenade, and threw it back to the North Vietnamese position, killing 4 more of the enemy and saving the lives of the men around him. Another enemy grenade landed approximately 3 meters from Sgt. Seay's position. Again Sgt. Seay left his covered position and threw the armed grenade back upon the assaulting enemy. After returning to his position he was painfully wounded in the right wrist; however, Sgt. Seay continued to give encouragement and direction to his fellow soldiers. After moving to the relative cover of a shallow ditch, he detected 3 enemy soldiers who had penetrated the position and were preparing to fire on his comrades. Although weak from loss of blood and with his right hand immobilized, Sgt. Seay stood up and fired his rifle with his left hand, killing all 3 and saving the lives of the other men in his location. As a result of his heroic action, Sgt. Seay was mortally wounded by a sniper's bullet. Sgt. Seay, by his gallantry in action at the cost of his life, has reflected great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.: See also *List of Medal of Honor recipients *List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Vietnam War *Circle the Wagons, The History of US Army Convoy Security, Richard E.

The park is set in of landscaped parkland and gardens 2 miles south of Burford, on the A361, Oxfordshire, England. Around 350,000 people visited the park in 2012.  Animal exhibits  *Walled Garden houses aviaries, including a Humboldt penguin enclosure and a Tropical House with exotic plants and free-roaming sloths, and tropical birds such as great blue turacos, Bali starlings and bleeding heart pigeons. Penguin feeding and talk is held daily at 11 am and 3 pm. Mammals in the Walled Garden include meerkats, yellow mongooses, prairie dogs and a breeding group of Oriental small-clawed otters. There is also a collection of small primates, including squirrel monkeys, pygmy marmosets, red-handed tamarins and emperor tamarins. *Madagascar, opened in 2008, is a walk-through exhibit which draws attention to the plight of endangered lemur species. The mixed exhibit features ring-tailed lemurs, collared lemurs, mongoose lemurs, crowned sifaka, Madagascar teal and radiated tortoise are also on show, and were brought into the collection especially for \\"Madagascar\\". The breeding record of the lemur collection is very good with the ring-tailed lemurs giving birth regularly since their introduction in 2009, and the red-bellied lemurs also having bred successfully. Lemur feeding and talk is held daily at noon. *Woodland Walk houses a number of larger animal species from South America including: Brazilian tapir, capybara, Patagonian maras and giant anteaters, as well as Visayan warty pigs. Other enclosures in the walk-through include Canadian timber wolves, white-naped cranes and parma wallabies. The entrance to the woodland walk is via a bridge over the lake, which has a wide variety of ducks and Chilean flamingos. *Large mammals - Large moated paddocks are home to a trio of giraffe, a herd of Chapman's zebra, a group of ostriches and breeding groups of white rhinoceros and Bactrian camels. Nearby are the park's big cat enclosures which house clouded leopards and Asiatic lions. *Reptile House, Bat House and Insect House - The Reptile House is home to species such as black mambas, crocodile monitors, bearded dragons, poison dart frogs, and rhinoceros iguanas. The reticulated pythons, and anacondas are particularly large specimens. The park achieved the first UK breeding for Morelet's crocodiles in 2007, with 12 eggs hatching successfully. The Insect House is home to leaf-cutter ants, scorpions and tarantulas and other species of invertebrates. The Bat House holding Seba's short-tailed bats, Egyptian fruit bats and Turkish spiny mice are in the Reptile Courtyard. and nearby are enclosures for white-handed gibbons and siamangs. *Around the manor house and next to the 600-year-old oak tree outside the orangery, is home to the red pandas. In front of the manor house, next to the rhino paddock, is the Aldabra giant tortoise enclosure. Behind the manor house is the Skymaze adventure playground, picnic area and restaurant. * Around the railway station includes a variety of owls and birds of prey, such as the great grey owl, snowy owl, and turkey vulture. Nearby is an enclosure for black-and-white colobus. Next to the railway station entrance is the wolverine enclosure. In 2012 the park's wolverines gave birth to the UK's first-ever cubs to be born in captivity. The Park is the only collection in Europe to have successfully bred wolverines. Next to the wolverines are the pheasant aviaries.  History  Georgian-Gothic manor house In 1804 the estate's owner William Hervey had the current manor house called Bradwell Grove Manor House designed by William Atkinson and built by Richard Pace of Lechlade, in the then-fashionable Georgian Gothic style. This followed the example of Strawberry Hill, Horace Walpole's masterpiece at Twickenham. The house replaced an original 17th-century Jacobean residence, part of which was incorporated into the north service wing. Hervey also planted a great number of trees in the park, many of which can still be seen including a huge wellingtonia tree on the west lawn. This tree is over 40 metres high and can be seen on the skyline from many miles away. In 1923 the house and estate were purchased by Colonel Heyworth-Savage, and on his death when killed in action in North Africa on 28 December 1941 the estate was passed to his grandson John Heyworth. John Heyworth was born in the manor house on 21 August 1925 and when he left school he served from 1943‚Äì1947 in the Royal Dragoons, the regiment which had been commanded by his father. The house was rented out for twenty years to Oxford Regional Hospital Board, until in 1969 John Heyworth decided to open the gardens to the public, and since 1970 the house has been the heart of the Wildlife Park. John Heyworth died on 24 November 2012, and now the managing director is his son Reggie Heyworth. The Walled Garden was originally a kitchen garden, the area now houses the marmosets and tamarins, contained cold fruit frames full of parma violets and other delicate plants, and on the site of the gardeners' greenhouse stood two structures reputed to be the oldest greenhouses in Oxfordshire. The Tropical House has taken the place of three adjoining greenhouses, the first for carnations, the second for rare hot-house plants and a fig tree, and the third for nectarines and peaches. The water supply for the Walled Garden came from a central well now covered over but still marked. There was a cricket pitch on what is now the grass car park, and two grass tennis courts outside the drawing room and brass-rubbing room. Many years ago, there was even a private nine-hole golf course covering what is now the ostrich enclosure and surrounding area. The manor house now has various roles, with its many rooms being used as visitor areas. The old dining room ‚Äì still with its original curtains, panelling and fireplace ‚Äì has become the brass-rubbing centre; the drawing room is used for meetings, exhibitions and conferences; the library is now a bar area; the original kitchen has been turned into a storeroom and a self-contained flat; and other rooms are used as administration and maintenance offices, storerooms and staff accommodation. Even the maze of cellars is used for hibernating certain species from the reptile collection. The old stables and other out-buildings now the reptile and bat houses, classrooms, offices and the quarantine area. The billiard room is now the restaurant kitchen, and its billiard table was turned into the lower tier of the waterfall in the penguin enclosure.  Other exhibits  A small train taking visitors around the grounds = Train = The narrow gauge railway runs in a circuit (just under a mile long) around the park. The station is located on the edge of the woods between the owl aviaries and the Walled Garden. The railway was first installed in 1974, in a horseshoe-shaped circuit from the current station round to the giant tortoises in front of the manor house. The circuit was completed and the station rebuilt in 2007, when it was officially opened by the local M.P., the Rt. Hon. David Cameron. The train is called Bella in memory of one of the original white rhinos at the park. = Park and gardens = Gardens The park is well known for its exotic planting, particularly in the favourable micro-climate of the Walled Garden, where bananas and cannas are a speciality. There is a huge pair of Californian redwood trees, imposing tree ferns and giant rhubarb with unusual foliage. The exotic birds and animals are complemented by flamboyant planting schemes. The South Terrace has been given a period feel, although in fact the terrace, balustrade and pond were constructed in 1989, thanks to a generous legacy from a regular visitor to the park, Miss Daisy Louise Eley. By contrast, the planting around the West Terrace, in front of and around the restaurant is more contemporary. In May the front of the restaurant is draped in wisteria flowers. The 'Winter Garden', between the owls and the siamang gibbons is planted with a wide range of perennials, bulbs and woody plants with an emphasis on providing interest in winter. Bamboo is a particular favourite at the park, with over fifty varieties planted. They are cut regularly for browse for the animals. The bamboo grows well here because of regular mulching of rhino manure. There is prairie-style planting around the rhino paddock to echo the African plains. The remains of a huge cedar of Lebanon in the Adventure Playground now supports the children's tree house and slide.  Conservation  As of October 2006, the Cotswold Wildlife Park holds 40 species, which are part of either an ESB (European Studbook) or EEP (European Endangered Species Programme). It is the studbook holder for the red-crested turaco and Mount Omei babbler. In addition, both the crested pigeon and blue-winged kookaburra are monitored species. In August 2015, the park announced that a second white rhinoceros had been born at the park.  Gallery  All photographs were taken in the park.

It shares many features with modern Romanian, having similar morphology and syntax, as well as a large common vocabulary inherited from Latin. An important source of dissimilarity between Romanian and Aromanian is the adstratum languages: while Romanian has been influenced to a greater extent by the Slavic languages, Aromanian has been more influenced by the Greek language, with which it has been in close contact throughout its history. The largest Aromanian-speaking community in North Macedonia can be found in the town of Kru≈°evo (~10% of the municipal population).

Previously she was Bishop of Lund from 2007 to 2014.  Biography  Jackel√©n was born 4 June 1955 in Herdecke, West Germany. She studied Lutheran theology at the University of T√ºbingen and Uppsala University. Jackel√©n served as a priest in Tyres√∂ parish in the Diocese of Stockholm 1981‚Äì1988, in G√•rdst√•nga parish in the Diocese of Lund 1988‚Äì1994 and in the Cathedral parish of Lund 1995‚Äì1996. After finishing her doctorate, she worked at Lund University 1999‚Äì2001 and was assistant professor of Systematic Theology/Religion and Science at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago 2001‚Äì2003. From 2003 she was Associate Professor and Director of the Zygon Center for Religion and Science until 2007. Jackel√©n was elected Bishop of Lund in 2006, and succeeded Christina Odenberg in 2007. Unlike Odenberg Jackel√©n obliged clergy who did not recognize her ministry to attend a eucharist at which she presided. Odenberg had been the first woman to become a bishop in the Church of Sweden, and Jackel√©n became the third. Jackel√©n was the first woman to be appointed as bishop after a popular vote in the diocese, the two former (Odenberg in 1997, and Caroline Krook, Bishop of Stockholm, in 1998) having both been appointed by the Swedish government before the separation of the Church of Sweden from the state in 2000. Jackel√©n was ordained Bishop of Lund by Anders Wejryd, Archbishop of Uppsala, in Uppsala Cathedral on 15 April 2007, and was received in her diocese through a service in Lund Cathedral on 21 April. As her official motto, she chose Gud √§r st√∂rre (\\"God is greater\\"), referring to a passage in the First Epistle of John (1 John 3.18‚Äì20) and this also became the title of her pastoral letter, published in 2011. For her coat of arms, she chose an oval shield design by Jan Raneke displaying triple oak leaves from her home town Herdecke's coat of arms with triple mantuan pilgrim's crosses, quartered with the flag of Scania symbolising her episcopal see of Lund. The oak leaves are also featured on the coat of arms of Blekinge which constitutes the easternmost part of the Diocese of Lund. As Bishop of Lund, Jackel√©n was one of the assistant officiants during the state wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling, in 2010.

In March 2014, Johan Tyrberg was elected to succeed her as Bishop of Lund. On Monday, 4 May 2015, she had an official audience with Pope Francis in Rome. This made her the first woman and archbishop to be welcomed at the Vatican. Her and the Pope's churches, while having very important and major differences (the stances on the state of ordination and the clergy, Marian beliefs, and their stances on some contemporary social issues, for example), did publish a document on the push toward theological dialogue and communion regarding the anniversary of the Protestant Reformation. She has several points of agreement, notably on evolution and the climate, the need for dialogue between science and religion, and the need to care for the poor, and to support some continued role for the Churches in public life, even in secularized societies which tend to want to separate the two. She once again met Pope Francis when he visited Sweden during the turn of the 2016 October‚ÄìNovember month switch, beginning the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation.  Publications  Her doctoral dissertation Zeit und Ewigkeit: die Frage der Zeit in Kirche, Naturwissenschaft und Theologie (Lund 1999) was later republished on Neukirchener Verlag under the same title in 2002. A Swedish translation came in 2000 and an English translation Time & eternity: the question of time in church, science, and theology was published in 2005. She was the speaker at the 2003 Goshen Conference on Religion and Science, a conference that features noted academics in the field of religion and science. The proceedings were published by Pandora Press.  Private life  Antje and Heinz Jackel√©n during the royal wedding gala in 2010 Her husband, Heinz Jackel√©n, is a retired priest, also originally from Germany, and they have two daughters and several grandchildren. The couple met as undergraduate theology students at Uppsala University. The name Jackel√©n is believed to come from French-German Huguenot ancestors. The couple lives in the Archbishop's official residence (√Ñrkebiskopsg√•rden) in Uppsala.  Theological views  Jackel√©n has published several works which deal with the relationship between the natural sciences and religious faith, as well as the role of religion in modern society. She endorses the theory of evolution and sees no contradiction in believing both in God and in evolution.Antje Jackelen elected Sweden's first woman archbishop 15.10.2013 BBC NewsSweden elects first female archbishop 15.10.2013 The LocalAntje Jackelen is Sweden‚Äôs first female Archbishop 16.10.2013 CERF InstituteSweden Follows Suit, Elects Jackelen As First Female Archbishop 18.10.2013 World Religion NewsChurch of Sweden chooses first female archbishop 17.10.2013 Ecumenical News Her election to archbishop sparked controversy as she during the election made statements about the virgin birth and the validity of Islam. In an interview with Swedish Christian newspaper Dagen, she stated that the virgin birth of Jesus is a \\"mythological term to explain the unique. Those who interpret the virgin birth as a biological issue have completely missed the point.\\"Antje Jackel√©n becomes Sweden's first female archbishop after historic Church election 16.10.2013 Radio Sweden She later clarified her statement as being intended to emphasise that in her view, neither a strictly literal interpretation of the virgin birth, nor a rejection of the virgin birth on the grounds of scientific impossibility, can capture the theological tradition surrounding the virgin birth.Jackel√©n, A.

December 2, 2012. Together with the bishops' conference she has also addressed climate change in a Bishops' letter in 2014 and again 2019, calling for the members of the Church of Sweden as well as the Swedish state to set goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and for Sweden to enter binding international agreements on the issue. In the revised version 2019 she and the bishops stressed the importance of meeting the goals in the Paris AgreementChurch of Sweden: : A Bishops‚Äô letter about the climate (pdf) She sees a role for the Church in the existential and spiritual parts of the climate debate, such as eco-anxiety. She is a vocal supporter of Greta Thunberg and has called her prophetic.

Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including Geraldton) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Geraldton was laid down by Poole & Steel at Balmain, New South Wales on 20 November 1940. She was launched on 16 August 1941 by the wife of William McKell, then Premier of New South Wales, and was commissioned into the RAN on 6 April 1942. Operational history =RAN service= After entering active service, Geraldton spent a brief period acting as an anti-submarine patrol ship off the east coast of Australia, before being assigned to the British Eastern Fleet in July 1942. Arriving in Colombo during August, Geraldton was the third Bathurst class corvette to join the Eastern Fleet. From August 1942 to April 1943, Geraldton escorted convoys between Colombo and the Persian Gulf. In May 1943, Gerldton was assigned to the 22nd Minesweeping Flotilla and deployed to the Mediterranean. During this deployment, she served as a convoy escort, was involved in the Allied invasion of Sicily during July, and entered the Atlantic Ocean in August to meet a Mediterranean-bound convoy. The corvette returned to cross-Indian convoy duties in October, and continued this duty until she was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet in January 1945 and returned to Australian waters. Before joining the Pacific Fleet, Geraldton underwent an armament reconfiguration in Melbourne during February, then a general two-month refit in Fremantle from March until May. After refits, Geraldton was assigned to the east coast of Australia for four months, before moving north and serving as an escort for the Pacific Fleet's Fleet Train until the end of World War II. After the end of the war, the corvette was deployed to Hong Kong, where she was present for the surrender ceremony on 16 September. While in Hong Kong, Geraldton supported the recovery and transfer of prisoners-of-war and performed anti-piracy duties. The corvette returned to Australia at the end of 1945, and spent the first part of 1946 operating from Fremantle, before the corvette was ordered to Colombo. The corvette's wartime service was recognised with three battle honours: \\"Pacific 1942\\", \\"Indian Ocean 1942‚Äì45\\", and \\"Sicily 1943\\". =Turkish Navy service= After the end of World War II, Geraldton was marked for transfer to the Turkish Navy. After arriving in Colombo in late May, Geraldton was decommissioned on 14 June 1946. She was commissioned into the Turkish Navy as TCG Antalya on 24 August 1946. Following the decommissioning of sister ship TCG Ayvalik (formerly HMAS Gawler), Antalya was renamed Ayvalik. The corvette left service in 1975.

He played for the Florida Marlins, Cincinnati Reds, and Cleveland Indians. He also spent six highly successful seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball with the Nippon Ham Fighters and Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes. He now owns a sports training facility in Ajax, Ontario. Career Wilson signed with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1987 as an amateur free agent and was promoted as high as Double-A in the Toronto organization. Wilson was then drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 1992 MLB Expansion Draft as their first pick (second overall, behind David Nied by the Colorado Rockies). Wilson played a total of 22 major league games with the Marlins (1993), Cincinnati Reds (1995), and Cleveland Indians (1996), failing to get a hit as either a Marlin or a Red, going 0-for-23 in his time with these teams, with 15 strikeouts and no walks or HBPs. After an 0-for-2 start with the Indians (with 1 strikeout), Wilson recorded his first major league hit in his 26th at bat. His major league career ended shortly thereafter; Wilson retired with 3 MLB hits in total. In 1997, he joined the Nippon Ham Fighters of the Japanese Pacific League after being released from the Indians. On June 21, 1997, he hit home runs in 4 consecutive at bats, becoming only the second player in Japanese baseball history to ever attain this mark after Sadaharu Oh, ending that season with a league-leading 37 home runs. In 1998, he greatly improved his clutch hitting, leading the league with 33 home runs and 128 RBIs to win the Best Nine Award for designated hitter. In 1999, he played only 6 games due to a knee injury, but the team decided not to release him at the end of the season. The team's decision proved to be correct, as Wilson rebounded in 2000, hitting 37 home runs with 89 RBIs to win his second Best Nine Award. Wilson sustained another injury in 2001, and left the team after playing only 34 games that year then was picked up by the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes the following year, but could not repeat his earlier success. He left Japan at the end of 2002, and signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees organization, but did not make it into a major league roster. Wilson is remembered as one of the best non-Japanese players ever to play for the Nippon Ham Fighters, along with Tony Solaita and Sherman Obando.

Since the harmonisation was not done in that granted time-limit, that Court has, on January 27, 2007, adopted the Ruling on failure to enforce in which it established that the contested articles of the interpreted legal documents shall cease to be in force as of the date following the publishing date of the Ruling in Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\"Press release\\" , Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2007-03-31).

Launched on 11 May 1944. Acquired by the U.S. Navy from the Maritime Commission and converted to Internal Combustion Engine Repair Ship (ARG-9) at Maryland Drydock Co, Baltimore, Maryland, and commissioned USS Mona Island (ARG-9), on 17 October 1944, CDR K. F. Horne in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Following shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, USS Mona Island departed Norfolk, Virginia, 2 December en route to the Pacific. Six days out of Pearl Harbor, on 18 January 1945, she effected the rescue of survivors of a crashed Army C 47 transport, en route to Hawaii from the mainland. On the 24th, she arrived at Pearl Harbor, debarked her passengers, and reported to ComServForce, U.S. Pacific Fleet for duty and onward routing. Underway on the 27th, she steamed via the Marshalls to Ulithi, arriving 18 February to become the flagship for MinRon 10. Between 19 February and 4 April she remained at Ulithi making repairs on vessels in that harbor. On the 5th, she got underway for Kerama Retto, Okinawa, arriving the 10th to commence repairs on the craft which had entered the shallow waters off the prospective invasion beaches to render them safe for the landing forces.  Inconvenienced by typhoons and Japanese air attacks  Between 11 April and 7 July repair work on ships alongside and in the harbor was interrupted by 180 air attacks on the harbor. On the latter date Mona Island shifted to the island of Okinawa itself, anchoring in Buckner Bay. There, during the remainder of July, work was interrupted by the approach of one typhoon and 21 air attacks; while the last two weeks of the war brought only air raid alerts.  End-of-War operations  Mona Island continued her valuable repair services at Buckner Bay until grounded on a reef during a typhoon on 9 October. Ten days later she got underway, towed by the tug , for Guam where temporary repairs to her rudder and screw enabled her to steam, independently, to San Diego, California, 19 November to 11 December. Continuing on from California she transited the Panama Canal once again and headed for New York City where repairs were completed.  Decommissioning  On 19 March 1946 she steamed down the coast to Norfolk, Virginia, where she decommissioned in June 1947. She remained at Norfolk as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1962. She was transferred in 1962 to the Maritime Administration for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River, Fort Eustis, Virginia.

In its population was . History Prior to the establishment of Israel, the Negev Bedouins were a semi-nomadic society going through a process of sedentarisation since the Ottoman rule of the region. During the British Mandate period, the administration did not provide a legal framework to record land ownership in the region. Israel's property ownership policy was adapted to a large extent from the older Ottoman land regulations of 1858 as the only preceding legal frame. It enabled Israel to nationalize most of the Negev lands using the state‚Äôs land regulations from 1969. Israel has continued the policy of sedentarization of the Bedouin, which at first stipulated the regulation and re-location of the Negev's inhabitants; during the 1950s Israel has re-located two-thirds of the Negev Bedouin into an area that was under a martial law. In 1978 Bir Hadaj was declared a closed military area, forcing its inhabitants to relocate to Wadi al-Na'am, near Beersheba. According to the NGO Arab Association for Human Rights, the inhabitants of Bir Hadaj remained there until 1994, when they learned that land where they previously settled was no longer used for military purposes, but was converted into a farm. The group states that they were only able to re-build their village two kilometers north of its original location.Submission to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Arab Association for Human Rights. 2003-05-23. (Archived) =State recognition and reorganization= In January 2004 as a part of a government Abu Basma plan to find a solution to the scattered unrecognized Bedouin communities in the Negev, Bir Hadaj was officially recognized by the government as a Bedouin town and along with 8 other villages, it became part of the now defunct Abu Basma Regional Council. It was planned as a rural-agricultural village so when created, each local family was offered a free land lot (5 dunam) in the newly recognized town. They were provided with municipal services, such as water, electricity, sewage, schooling and health services. According to Akiva Bigman of Mida magazine, as of 2012 (a decade after the approval of the outline plan), no family has purchased land and settled in accordance with Israeli law. Only about a quarter (1,200) of the 5,000 residents of Bir Hadaj are located within the outline plan, and none of them live in the plots allocated by the program. In addition, many of the residents live and build outside the village, in the Ramat Negev Regional Council, although the jurisdiction area of the village is entirely in the area of Neve Midbar regional council.Akiva Bigman, Bedouin and municipal democracy, Mida website, 10/04/2012 According to David Cohen, a member of the committee of settlement arrangement policy in the Negev, the rest of the residents that live outside the city limits are in its surroundings, in an area that spans about 20,000 dunams.[weblaw.haifa.ac.il/he/Faculty/Kedar/lecdb/bedouins/369.doc The Goldberg Committee Protocols on 21.02.2008] According to Nature and Parks Authority, the rapid spread of the settlement located along the northern boundary of the nature reserve Holot Mashavim, is threatening the existence of the reserve.Omri Gal, Permission to speak, a magazine, In The Roads Of The CountryNature and Parks Authority Not all Bedouins agree to move from tents and structures built on the state lands into apartments prepared for them.

The Treaty of Fontainebleau was a secret agreement signed on 27 October 1807 in Fontainebleau, France between King Charles IV of Spain and the French Emperor Napoleon. Under the treaty, the House of Braganza was to be driven from the Kingdom of Portugal with the country subsequently divided into three regions. Within seven months the government of Spain had collapsed and two Spanish kings abdicated; in August 1808 Napoleon imposed his brother Joseph as King of Spain. Negotiated and agreed between Don plenipotentiary of Charles IV and Marshal G√©raud Duroc as the representative of Napoleon, the accord contained 14 articles along with supplementary provisions relating to troop allocations for the planned invasion of Portugal. According to historian Charles Oman, it is probable that Napoleon never had any intention of carrying out the treaty's provisions. Aside from his desire to occupy Portugal, his real purpose may have been to surreptitiously introduce a large French force into Spain in order to facilitate its subsequent takeover. Background After his attempt to invade Great Britain in 1806 failed, Napoleon decreed a Continental Blockade, which prohibited trade of British products throughout the European continent. Portugal, a traditional ally of England, refused to obey him. In order to invade Portugal, Napoleon required a route for his ground troops through Spain, necessitating a treaty with that country. However, the army of Jean-Andoche Junot had already entered Spain well before the agreement was signed at Fontainebleau.  Articles  =Article 1= The province of Entre-Douro-e-Minho along with the city of Oporto to be ceded to the King of Etruria, with the title King of North Lusitania. =Article 2= Under this section the province of Alentejo, along with the Kingdom of the Algarves were to be given to Manuel Godoy, Prime Minister of Spain and confidante of Charles IV's wife, Maria Luisa of Parma. Godoy, who was known as the Pr√≠ncipe de la Paz (Prince of Peace), would also receive the title of Prince of the Algarves under the treaty. He was considered an \\"odious and disgraceful\\" man, casting doubt on whether Napoleon would have delivered such a prize to a man he described as \\"a horror of the nation\\". Instead, again in Napoleon's own words, \\"he [Godoy] is a rascal who will open the gates of Spain for me\\". =Article 3= Control of the provinces of Beira, Tras-os-Montes and Portuguese Estremadura would remain in abeyance until a general peace occurred, whereupon they would be disposed of according to a further agreement between the treaty parties. =Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 = The Kingdom of Northern Lusitania would pass to the country's king's descendants according to Spanish inheritance law as would the Principality of the Algarves. In the absence of legitimate heirs of either territory they would revert to the Spanish throne, without ever becoming united under one sovereign. Both entities would remain under the aegis of the Spanish king, and would be unable to make war or agree peace without his consent. =Article 8= In the event that the provinces of Beira, Tras-os-Montes, and Portuguese Extremadura were returned as part of a general peace to the House of Braganza in exchange for Gibraltar, Trinidad, and other colonies captured by the English, the new sovereign of these provinces would be bound to the king of Spain under the same terms as the King of the Northern Lusitania and the Prince of the Algarves detailed above. =Article 9= The King of Etruria would cede his kingdom and all his property to the French Emperor. =Article 10= Once the occupation of Portugal was complete, the different rulers would appoint commissioners to fix the actual borders between them. =Article 11= All Spanish territory south of the Pyrenees would be guaranteed by the French. =Article 12= The King of Spain would receive the title \\"King of the two Americas\\" within three years of the treaty. =Article 13= Islands, colonies and other overseas properties of Portugal would be divided between Spain and France. =Article 14= Confirmed that the treaty was secret and required ratification in the Spanish capital, Madrid, no more than 20 days after its signature. Supplementary terms The troops to be assembled for the invasion consisted of 25,000 French infantry and 3,000 cavalry. Spain would provide 24,000 infantry, 30 guns and 3,000 cavalry. The Spanish cavalry, artillery and 8,000 infantry would join the French at Alcantara then march to Lisbon. Entre Minho e Douro and Oporto would be occupied by 10,000 Spanish infantry while 6,000 invaded Portuguese Extramadura and the Algarves. To counter any English interference or Portuguese opposition, 40,000 men would assemble at Bayonne. Aftermath Junot's army entered Lisbon on the 30 November, whereupon the Portuguese royal family departed for Brazil where they would remain until 1821. In 1808, France would launch a takeover in Spain, triggering the Peninsular War.

Founded in 1954, the club is affiliated to the Ulster Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union. The first team currently plays Senior rugby union in All-Ireland League, Division 1A and the club also fields six Junior standard adult teams. Youth teams (male and female) compete at under-16, under-14, under-12 and the mini-rugby levels. History of Ballynahinch Rugby Club At a meeting in the local Royal British Legion Hall in April 1954, a dozen people attended and agreed that a club should be formed. An application was made to enter the Junior League for the 1954‚Äì55 season. The application was accepted by the Ulster Branch. Membership for the club grew quickly with players coming from all over County Down, Belfast and the Mournes region. It was at this point that the Club started to gather pace and a pitch was required due to the growing player base. A pitch was rented from a local farmer at Ballykine. Even though the grounds had no changing rooms or showers it did the job of providing Ballynahinch club with a home. In 1964 the club enjoyed success with the winning of the Ulster Towns Cup.Belfast Newsletter 31 March 1964 Page 3 & The Ulster Junior Cup was won consecutively in 1966Belfast Newsletter 31 January 1966 Page 11 and 1967. An increasing player and fan base meant that proper grounds were required. In August 1970, at the cost of ¬£6,500, the current playing facilities at Ballymacarn Park were purchased. The site soon had its own clubhouse in front of the 1st XV pitch. It was from this point that the club grew to field 7 teams. The 1st XV went on to be one of the top teams in Ulster Junior League rugby for the next 10 years. Senior status In the early 1990s, Irish rugby underwent changes with the introduction of professionalism. Ballynahinch for many years had campaigned for senior status. An open promotion-and-relegation system was introduced and in 1995 Ballynahinch achieved their goal. As a senior club, they won promotion from All Ireland League Division 4 to Division 3 in 1996‚Äì97 season. The following season a further promotion was gained to All Ireland Division 2. The 1998‚Äì99 season saw the successful run come to an end when they got relegated back to Division 3, only to go back up again after the 2000‚Äì01 season. Mid-table finishes were achieved in Division 2 until the 2005‚Äì06 when the club was once again relegated to Division 3. Ballynahinch played Division 2 rugby again in the 2007‚Äì08 season, with another mid-table finish after winning promotion in the 2006‚Äì07 campaign. In 2008‚Äì09 the club had its most successful season, winning the AIB All-Ireland Cup by beating Division 1 team Cork Constitution in the final, Ulster Senior League, Ulster Senior Cup and promotion to Division 1 of the AIB League.

They are found in South and Central America from Tierra del Fuego to Costa Rica, but are absent from the Amazon Basin. They inhabit dense vegetation at or near ground-level and are mainly found in mountainous regions, particularly the Andes. They can be very difficult to see as they run through the undergrowth in a mouse-like fashion. Description They are plump with short tails that often are held cocked. Depending on species, the total length is 10‚Äì14 cm (4-5¬Ω in). Their plumage is blackish or grey. Several species have brown bellies, rumps or flanks; often with some barring. A few have white crowns or eyebrows. Juveniles of most species are browner and have barred flanks. Many species are essentially impossible to separate by their plumage, but songs and calls are often distinctive and important for species identification. Behavior Their diet consists mainly of insects. Little is known about the breeding habits of most species but the eggs are usually white and the nest is usually ball-shaped and made of plant material such as root- fibres and mosses. It is built in a cavity in sites such as earth banks or among the roots or bark of trees. Taxonomy The species-limits within this genus is among the most complex matters in Neotropical ornithology. They are highly cryptic, and identification using visual features often is impossible. Vocal and biochemical data is typically needed to clarify the taxonomic status of the various populations. Several new species have been described in recent years (e.g. S. stilesi and S. rodriguezi from Colombia). The taxonomic status of many of the Andean species was resolved by Krabbe & Schulenberg (1997) who split a number of species and described three new ones. The confusing situation is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that only 10 species were recognized in this genus in 1970 (Krabbe & Schulenberg, 2003), while the figure now is more than four times as high. Additionally, still undescribed species are known to exist, while some species as currently defined actually may include several species (e.g. the southern population of the large-footed tapaculo may represent an undescribed species). Donegan & Avendano recently reviewed the Colombian and Venezuelan species, formally describing one new subspecies and providing details of a further three undescribed species or subspecies to be described in future publications. The Brazilian taxa are similarly complex with several recently described species and considerable confusion surrounding the use of the scientific name Scytalopus speluncae. Conservation Some species have highly localized distributions, and being poor fliers, they easily become isolated in small populations. BirdLife International currently (2007) consider one species vulnerable (Scytalopus panamensis) and three species endangered (S. iraiensis, S. rodriguezi and S. robbinsi). Species list Until recently, the white-breasted and Bahia tapaculos were placed in this genus, but these two species are now known to be closer to the bristlefronts (genus Merulaxis) and have therefore been moved to Eleoscytalopus. * Blackish tapaculo, Scytalopus latrans ** Leymebamba tapaculo, Scytalopus (latrans) intermedius * Unicolored tapaculo, Scytalopus unicolor * Trilling tapaculo, Scytalopus parvirostris * Mouse-coloured tapaculo, Scytalopus speluncae * Planalto tapaculo, Scytalopus pachecoi (described in 2005) * Rock tapaculo, Scytalopus petrophilus * Diamantina tapaculo, Scytalopus diamantinensis (described in 2007) * Bras√≠lia tapaculo, Scytalopus novacapitalis * Marsh tapaculo or wetland tapaculo, Scytalopus iraiensis * Large-footed tapaculo, Scytalopus macropus * Santa Marta tapaculo, Scytalopus sanctaemartae * Long-tailed tapaculo, Scytalopus micropterus * Rufous-vented tapaculo, Scytalopus femoralis * Northern white-crowned tapaculo or white-crowned tapaculo, Scytalopus atratus * Bolivian white-crowned tapaculo or Bolivian tapaculo, Scytalopus bolivianus * Tacarcuna tapaculo or pale-throated tapaculo, Scytalopus panamensis * Silvery-fronted tapaculo, Scytalopus argentifrons * Choc√≥ tapaculo, Scytalopus chocoensis * Upper Magdalena tapaculo, Scytalopus rodriguezi (described in 2005) * Stiles's tapaculo, Scytalopus stilesi (described in 2005) * El Oro tapaculo or Ecuadorian tapaculo, Scytalopus robbinsi * Tatama tapaculo, Scytalopus alvarezlopezi (described in 2017) * Nari√±o tapaculo, Scytalopus vicinior * Brown-rumped tapaculo, Scytalopus latebricola * M√©rida tapaculo, Scytalopus meridanus ** Lara tapaculo, Scytalopus meridanus fuscicauda ‚Äì was considered at best a subspecies by Donegan & Avendano 2008. * Perij√° tapaculo, Scytalopus perijanus (described in 2015) * Caracas tapaculo, Scytalopus caracae * Spillmann's tapaculo, Scytalopus spillmanni * Chusquea tapaculo, Scytalopus parkeri * Magellanic tapaculo, Scytalopus magellanicus *White-winged tapaculo, Scytalopus krabbei (described in 2020) *Jalca tapaculo, Scytalopus frankeae (described in 2020) *Ampay tapaculo, Scytalopus whitneyi (described in 2020) * Pale-bellied tapaculo, Scytalopus griseicollis ** Colombian tapaculo or Cundinamarca tapaculo, Scytalopus (griseicollis) infasciatus ‚Äì considered synonymous with S. g. griseicollis by Donegan & Avendano 2008. ** Yariguies? tapaculo Scytalopus griseicollis gilesi (described in 2008) * Neblina tapaculo, Scytalopus altirostris * Ancash tapaculo, Scytalopus affinis * Tschudi's tapaculo, Scytalopus acutirostris * Vilcabamba tapaculo, Scytalopus urubambae * Puna tapaculo, Scytalopus simonsi * Zimmer's tapaculo, Scytalopus zimmeri * White-browed tapaculo, Scytalopus superciliaris * Dusky tapaculo, Scytalopus fuscus * Paramillo tapaculo, Scytalopus canus ‚Äì see S. opacus. * Paramo tapaculo, Scytalopus opacus ‚Äì formerly a subspecies of S. canus, but under the common name paramo tapaculo. *Scytalopus androstictus, ‚Äì formerly a subspecies of S. opacus, but elevated to a distinct species by Krabbe et al. 2020 * Diademed tapaculo, Scytalopus schulenbergi * Junin tapaculo, Scytalopus gettyae (described in 2013) * Bahian mouse-colored tapaculo or Boa Nova tapaculo, Scytalopus gonzagai (described in 2014) References * Donegan, Thomas & Avendano, Jorge E.

Its headquarters are located in the San Miguel District, Lima. History In 1947 Jos√© Panizo Vargas, a successful entrepreneur in Ica Peru, gained a franchise to bottle Coca-Cola for the Department of Ica. For 26 years, under the management of his son Jorge Panizo Mariategui, Coca-Cola was the market leader in the area.Don Jorge S.A.C. History In 1973 the military government threatened to ban the Coca-Cola brand from the Peruvian market. Under these circumstances Jorge Panizo Mariategui negotiated with Don Isaac Lindley, at the request of the latter, the franchise of Inca Kola in the Department of Ica. For 27 years the company bottled and distributed Inca Kola in the area, once again managing to obtain market leadership. In 2000 Inca Kola was absorbed by The Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola negotiated for several months with its bottlers, and Embotelladora Don Jorge decided the conditions that Coca-Cola sought to impose on bottlers to continue with the franchise were unacceptable. With 53 years experience in the sector, Jorge Panizo Mariategui decided that the company would launch its own brands from its plant in Ica to supply the large domestic market. In 2002 Embotelladora Don Jorge S.A.C. operations began in Lima with a large investment in locale, machinery and infrastructure. The company produces Peru Cola and Isaac Kola among other brands. In 2003, Embotelladora Don Jorge S.A.C. decided to take the lead in creating more nutritional and functional products through the addition of soluble fiber in its soft drinks.

It serves a mostly urban customer base. History = Gristede Brothers: 1891-1987 = Charles Gristede and his brother Diedrich came to the United States from Germany in 1888, found work in grocery stores, and in 1891 opened a tiny gaslit store at 42nd Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan. This site was then far uptown from the central shopping area, but close to housewives who walked or rode in private carriages to the store. A second store opened in Harlem‚Äîthen a middle-class white neighborhood‚Äîin 1896. The business flourished and expanded, reaching suburban Westchester County in 1920 and Connecticut in 1926. Gristede Brothers also opened a wine and liquor store in Manhattan in 1933. When Charles Gristede died in 1948, the chain consisted of 141 stores in Manhattan, the Bronx, Westchester, and Connecticut. In 1956 it opened its first Long Island store, in Garden City. In Manhattan, Gristede Brothers remained concentrated on the more affluent East Side, where it specialized in personal service and gourmet items and charged premium prices. It shipped items to customers around the world, including, for example, a Greek who wanted melons sent to him in Paris by air freight. The company had annual sales of about $60 million and 115 stores in all‚Äîincluding six liquor stores in Connecticut‚Äîwhen it was sold in 1968 to The Southland Corporation, owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, for Southland stock valued at $11.5 million. Southland retained the prior Gristede Brothers management and for more than a decade left the chain to its own devices. In 1977 Gristede's consisted of 120 stores, mostly ranging in size from 6,000 to 11,000 square feet and carrying 7,000 to 8,000 gourmet items, including size 23 grapefruit (about the size of a large cantaloupe), strawberries picked in California only 36 hours earlier, large Idaho potatoes already wrapped in tin foil, quiche Lorraine, and Beluga caviar. By the early 1980s, however, Gristede's, as well as other supermarket chains with outlets in New York City, was reeling from a number of adverse conditions, including the small size of the stores, the high cost of delivery in the city, escalating rents, and competition from gourmet shops and specialty food stores. In 1980 the chain still consisted of 100 outlets, including 24 Charles & Co. sandwich shops, but by 1983, when Gristede's fell into the red, there were only 84. During 1983-84 Gristede's concentrated its operations in Manhattan, closing 36 stores and its warehouse. In 1985 there were 18 conventional supermarkets; 17 generally smaller service stores featuring telephone ordering, home delivery, and charge accounts; ten Charles & Co. sandwich shops and one gourmet shop; and one liquor store. Sales came to about $105 million in 1985. Southland sold the Gristede's and Charles & Co. stores to Red Apple Co. in 1986 for an estimated $50 million. Red Apple, owned by John A. Catsimatidis and operating in the Bronx as well as Manhattan, now became the largest supermarket chain in New York City. Gristede's and Red Apple remained distinct, however. Red Apple had completed 14 Gristede's remodels by the fall of 1987, including adding in-store delicatessens, bakeries, salad bars, hot takeout foods, and upscale cheese, prime-meat, and seafood sections. The Charles & Co. stores were closed. = Sloan's Supermarkets: 1956-97 = Born in the Bronx and reared by foster families after his mother died, Max Sloan left school after the eighth grade to sell fruit and vegetables from a pushcart. A small vegetable and fruit store he opened in 1940 with $500 grew into the Orange Grove chain. Sloan and his partner, Lou Meyer, also ran a wholesale produce operation supplying fruits and vegetables to many grocery stores in Manhattan and the Bronx. They entered the supermarket business in 1956 with two Manhattan stores. There were 25 Sloan Supermarket Stores, mostly on Manhattan's West Side, in 1973, when the chain purchased seven more from Bohack Corporation. By this time Sloan had annual sales of $42 million. Meyer died in 1969, and Sloan retired in 1977. His successor was a son-in-law, Jules Rose. By 1982 the 42-store Sloan's Supermarkets Inc. chain had estimated sales of $150 million a year. Its viability, Rose said, rested on seeking to market items with the greatest profit margin, such as meat, frozen items, produce, and gourmet foods. The city's consumer affairs agency had consistently listed Sloan's as one of the most expensive food chains in Manhattan. Sloan's success also rested on careful monitoring of the borough's ethnically diverse clientele. A store on the Lower East Side, for example, had a large line of Goya-brand products for Hispanics and kosher products for Orthodox Jews. Another, close to the United Nations, had full international foods sections. Located in a high-income area, it also had a higher proportion of frozen food and dairy products sales and included health and natural foods sections. Sloan's Supermarkets had 38 stores in early 1990, when it was first reported on the auction block. Cynthia Rigg of Crain's New York Business wrote, \\"Over the past decade Sloan's reputation for quality has fallen dramatically. The privately held chain has done little to upgrade its stores while [its competitors] have undertaken extensive expansion and modernization programs.\\" She also reported that industry sources said the four principals of Sloan's were \\"often at loggerheads, which stymies decision making.\\" Despite its problems, Sloan's was said to hold a 20 percent share of Manhattan's grocery business. After selling three stores to various companies in 1990, Sloan's Supermarkets sold 21 more to Red Apple during 1991‚Äì92. The acquisition had its hazards, however, because three of Sloan's owners were, in 1993, being charged with fraudulently redeeming at least $3.5 million of discount coupons clipped from newspapers, an action that threatened 15 of the acquired units with forfeiture to the federal government. The three Sloan's partners‚ÄîRose, Max Sloan's other son-in-law, and Meyer's son‚Äîeventually went to jail. Despite these problems, Red Apple bought the remaining 11 Sloan's supermarkets‚Äîten in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn‚Äîin 1993 for $8.8 million plus certain accounts payable. This purchase was not assigned to Red Apple itself but to Designcraft, Inc., a publicly owned shell corporation whose main stockholder was Catsimatidis. Following the sale the federal government agreed to withdraw all claims against Sloan's Supermarkets. Designcraft then took the Sloan's Supermarkets name and continued operations under Red Apple Group management. This transaction raised the number of supermarket stores in the New York area controlled by Red Apple to 75. In 1994 the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint, seeking the sale of ten Red Apple-controlled stores in four Manhattan neighborhoods because of possible anticompetitive effects, such as higher food prices and lower quality and selection. Supermarkets under the Red Apple, Gristede's, and Sloan's names were serving 37 percent of Manhattan's food shoppers on a regular basis, according to a survey. Catsimatidis agreed later in 1994 to divest six stores in order to settle the complaint. In 1997, however, he and three of his firms agreed to pay a $600,000 penalty for failing to comply with the FTC order. Only one of the stores had been divested, according to the agency. The Red Apple name virtually disappeared during this period, its outlets sold to Rite Aid Corporation or converted to Gristede's or Sloan's supermarkets. Sloan's acquired three more supermarkets from a subsidiary of Red Apple Group in 1995 for $5 million plus the cost of inventory. It also opened an additional supermarket and a Brooklyn health and beauty aids store in 1996. = Gristede's Sloan's: 1997-99 = In 1997 Sloan's Supermarkets acquired 19 Gristede's and ten Sloan's supermarkets, plus a produce distribution center, from Red Apple for $36 million worth of stock plus the assumption of $4 million in debt. The company was then renamed Gristede's Sloan's, Inc. During fiscal 1998 (the year ended November 30, 1998), Gristede's Sloan's acquired another supermarket from an affiliate of Catsimatidis and remodeled ten stores at a cost of $10 million. The company also closed four stores and combined two adjacent ones into a single store. Company sales came to $157.5 million, with a net loss of $288,339. Gristede's Sloan's had a long-term debt of $21.6 million at the end of the fiscal year. Catsimatidis, the chief executive officer, owned or controlled 91 percent of the company in February 1999. Of the 40 Gristede's Sloan's stores in 1998, 35 were in Manhattan, one was in Brooklyn, three were in Westchester County, and one was on Long Island. They ranged from 3,200 to 23,000 square feet in selling space, with an average of 9,000, and were all leased. City Produce Operating Corp., on leased premises in the Bronx, was a warehouse operation supplying the company's supermarkets with groceries and fresh produce and selling fresh produce wholesale to third parties. Gristede's Sloan's supermarkets were offering broad lines of merchandise, including nationally and regionally advertised brands and private-label and generic brands. Their food items included fresh meats, produce, dry groceries, dairy products, baked goods, poultry and fish, fresh fruits and vegetables, frozen foods, delicatessen items, and gourmet foods. Nonfood items included cigarettes, soaps, paper products, and health and beauty aids. The company also was operating an in-store pharmacy in one of its supermarkets. Check-cashing services were available to qualified customers, and groceries were being delivered to apartments for a small fee. The stores were open 16 hours a day, seven days a week, and on holidays. At least one was open around the clock. Gristede's Sloan's was planning to remodel 12 more stores in fiscal 1999 and to open two new stores and four in-store pharmacies. Of the 11 stores operating under the Sloan's name, four had been converted to Gristede's by May 1999, when the company announced that the remaining seven would also take the Gristede's name by the end of the year. Catsimatidis told Supermarket News that the Gristede's banner \\"is a better name, with better marketing potential.\\" = Expanding for the New Millennium = In the late 1990s, Gristede's began experimenting with a lunch counter called The Caf√© at two of its Manhattan stores. Fare included hot dogs and sandwiches, as well as more prepared entr√©es. In 1999 one of the Caf√©s began testing a sushi bar concept through a joint venture with HMC Sushi of Plainfield, New Jersey (the sushi was prepared on the premises). The first pharmacies were installed in two Gristede's stores in 1999. They were operated under license from Legend Pharmacies, Inc., a cooperative based in Melville, New York. The company celebrated openings of new and renovated stores through a special promotion with the New York Daily News. Gristede's gave shoppers free copies (as many as 5,000 in all) of a specially printed version of the paper, which had a full- page ad for the store on the front and back. Gristede's had about 1,500 employees in 2000. Sales were $216.3 million. Losses were narrowed from $2.9 million to $191,000. Sales rose to $230 million in 2001 as the company managed a net profit of $275,000. In 2002, A&P; (The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company) sold Gristede's three Food Emporium stores for $5.5 million. These were soon reopened under the Gristede's banner. The company was developing some of its own locations as \\"Mega Stores\\" which, at 20,000 square feet, were almost twice the size of the company's traditional buildings. After a 20-year absence, Gristede's reentered the New Jersey market by opening more than ten supermarkets there, beginning in 2002. According to The Record, Catsimatidis was attracted to the market after researching a potential acquisition, Kings Super Markets Inc. Both chains had a similar customer base and similar approach. Gristede's was bidding against rival D'Agostino Supermarkets, Inc. to acquire Parsippany, New Jersey-based Kings Super Markets from Marks & Spencer PLC (M&S;). Neither company was able to secure the necessary financing to buy the 28-unit chain, and in August 2003, M&S; pulled Kings off the market. Gristede's also opened its first store in the Bronx in November 2002. According to the New York Times, Catsimatidis was encouraged to open a supermarket in a Latino neighborhood there following the success of a store in the Washington Heights area. To keep up with the evolving e-commerce side of the grocery business, the company launched its XpressGrocer.com site in December 2003. Gristede's also began filling orders taken through Amazon.com in November 2004. The Amazon orders were available to be shipped anywhere in the United States, not just New York. After losing nearly $1 million in fiscal 2002, the company posted a net loss of $11.6 million on sales of $279.69 million in fiscal 2003. The loss was attributed in part to opening seven new stores during the year. The blackout on August 14‚Äì15, 2003 resulted in the loss of some perishables. In 2004, Chairman John Catsimatidis, who owned more than 90 percent of Gristede's, took the company private. According to Catsimatidis, intense new regulations and the difficulty of creating investor interest for a small company (valued at $16 million) were behind the move. Stores A typical Gristedes location in Manhattan. Most Gristedes are in the borough of Manhattan, including Roosevelt Island. There is also one in Brooklyn. At one time, there was a Gristedes in the hamlet of Somers, New York; it was the farthest-north store in the chain. There was also a store in Tenafly, New Jersey, that closed in the 1980s and was replaced by a CVS Pharmacy. On Long Island, a Gristedes in Southampton closed in the late 1990s. Port Jefferson had one until the mid-1990s; Locust Valley had one until the new owner of its shopping plaza closed it in 2008.

Gladstone initially operated as a convoy escort between Queensland and New Guinea. On 18 December 1943, the ship was part of a convoy that ran aground on Bougainville Reef; the corvette was able to refloat herself and sail back to Brisbane, but remained in port for repairs until January 1944. She resumed convoy duties, first back in Queensland waters, then she was relocated to Milne Bay in April 1944. In January 1945,she was redeployed to Morotai. After World War II, Gladstone was involved in the Japanese surrender of Timor at Koepang, performed surveillance in the Lesser Sunda Islands, and transported Netherlands East Indies soldiers from Darwin to Timor, then spent the next ten years attached to Flinders Naval Depot as a training ship. The corvette was paid off in 1946, then purchased by the Port Phillip Sea Pilots Association for use as a relief and accommodation ship. She was renamed Akuna (sometimes referred to as Akuna II) and registered in Melbourne. Akuna began operations in mid-1958, but was made redundant in the 1970s by the move to high-powered launches, and was sold to a private owner in 1973 or 1974. Conflicting reports mark the next few years of the ship's operation, until she was sold in 1978 to a new owner, who used her to rescue Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand under the auspices of Food for the Hungry International. The ship was re-registered as a Panamian-flagged private yacht under the name Akuna II in 1980, around the time a former United States Air Force pilot began scamming families of personnel missing-in-action after the Vietnam War with claims that he would use the ship to rescue US prisoners-of-war that may still have been interred in Vietnam. Akuna II was not used for that purpose and actually spent the time moored in Songkhla, before she was towed to Bangkok and scrapped in 1983. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Gladstone) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 As constructed, Gladstone had a displacement of 650 tons, a length of , a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by two Yarrow water-tube boilers feeding steam to two triple expansion steam engine, which provided 1,000 indicated horsepower each to the corvette's two propeller shafts.Carolin, HMAS Gladstone/Port Phillip Sea Pilots' Akuna II, p. 208 The ship's maximum speed was , while its armament consisted of one 4-inch HA gun, three 20 mm Oerlikons (later supplemented by a 40 mm Bofors), machine guns, and depth charges, chutes and throwers. The designated ship's company was 85 strong. Gladstone was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 4 August 1942. She was launched on 26 November 1942 by Mrs. Watson, wife of a dockyard employee, and was commissioned into the RAN on 22 March 1943. RAN operational history After entering active service in April 1943, Gladstone was assigned as a convoy escort between Queensland ports and New Guinea. On 18 December 1943, Gladstone and sister ships and were escorting the eight troopships of convoy TN 192 when the convoy ran aground at 21:30 on Bougainville Reef (part of the Great Barrier Reef). Glenelg and seven of the merchant vessels grounded on the reef: the corvette was able to refloat without assistance despite damaging her starboard propeller, and at 07:00 the next morning escorted three merchantman that had also been refloated back to Brisbane, where she underwent repairs until January 1944. At that time, the corvette resumed convoy escort duties until March 1944, when she was sent to Adelaide for refit. After the refit, Gladstone sailed to Milne Bay, arriving on 29 April 1944. Excluding a short deployment to Australian waters in October 1944, she served as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship in the waters around Milne Bay until January 1945, when she was redeployed to Morotai for similar duties. In May, Gladstone and a group of United States Navy PT boats bombarded Japanese barges off Halmahera. The corvette's wartime service was recognised with two battle honours: \\"Pacific 1943‚Äì49\\" and \\"New Guinea 1943‚Äì44\\". HMAS Gladstone in 1949 After the end of World War II, Gladstone was involved in the Japanese surrender of Timor at Koepang, performed surveillance in the Lesser Sunda Islands, and transported Netherlands East Indies soldiers from Darwin to Timor. In early December 1945, Gladstone sailed for Sydney, visiting her namesake city en route. After a refit, the corvette arrived at Flinders Naval Depot on 23 February 1946, where she was reclassified as a training ship attached to the depot. Decommissioning and post-military career Gladstone paid off from military service on 16 July 1956, having sailed since commissioning. The ship was sold to the Port Phillip Sea Pilots Association for use as a relief and accommodation ship.Carolin, HMAS Gladstone/Port Phillip Sea Pilots' Akuna II, p. 211 In this role, she was renamed Akuna (sometimes referred to as Akuna II, as the association had previously operated the former under this name from 1925 to 1957) and registered with Melbourne as her home port.Carolin, HMAS Gladstone/Port Phillip Sea Pilots' Akuna II, pgs. 208, 211 Each of the over 40 maritime pilots in the association owned shares in the vessel, and they took weekly turns as Master and Pilot in Charge. A raised poop deck was installed to add accommodation space. Akuna began operations in mid-1958. By the 1970s, the Port Phillip Sea Pilots Association had made the decision to use high-powered launches and Akuna was no longer needed. The ship was sold into private ownership for use as a motor yacht, either in November 1973 or March 1974. Reports of the ship's operations in the next few years are conflicting: Akuna may have been used for charter cruises in Port Phillip, or sailed to Brisbane via Sydney for an aborted youth training scheme.Carolin, HMAS Gladstone/Port Phillip Sea Pilots' Akuna II, pp. 211‚Äì2 In September 1978, the ship was sold to a Canadian man for use by Food for the Hungry International.Carolin, HMAS Gladstone/Port Phillip Sea Pilots' Akuna II, p. 212 Despite being sold to a Canadian owner, British Commonwealth agreements allowed the ship to retain Australian registry. After a boiler refit, the ship relocated to Singapore and began operating in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand, rescuing Vietnamese refugees from boats and transporting them to shore. Several countries in the region refused the ship entry, and the Australian government persuaded the owner to change the ship's registry, as they did not want to be held responsible for any refugees rescued by an Australian-flagged vessel not under their control. The ship was re-registered as a Panamian-flagged private yacht under the name Akuna II on 4 February 1980. Around this time, a former United States Air Force pilot claimed to have purchased the ship from Food for the Hungry, and that he was using it to rescue US prisoners-of-war that were still interred in Vietnam.Carolin, HMAS Gladstone/Port Phillip Sea Pilots' Akuna II, p. 213 The pilot mass-mailed letters to families of missing-in- action soldiers asking for money to fund the rescue operations, but was later determined to be a money-making scam. Around the same time as the mass- mailing, the US government was informed that Akuna II was moored in Songkhla, having been there for about two years, with a two-man skeleton crew who lived aboard but knew nothing about how to operate or maintain the ship. The ship was towed to Bangkok in 1983 and broken up for scrap.

During his stay he falls in love with Martina (Leonor Watling), the daughter of his landlord. Sierra (Eduard Fern√°ndez), a rich businessman, also falls in love with her and fruitlessly tries to win her heart. Plot Ulises arrives in a coastal town near Valencia to teach literature. He rents a room at a local hostel and immediately falls in love with Martina, the landlord's daughter as he sees her hanging up her clothes on the clothesline. A local businessman by the name of Sierra is also in love with her but she resists his advances. Martina invites Ulises to see the Son de Mar, a yacht on which a film had been made years before, when she was 13 years old. Her dream is to purchase it when she becomes rich. They soon become friends and Ulises recites the Aeneid for her, and she is enthralled by the story of Dido and Aeneas.

Life Brucioli was born in Florence at an unknown date. In his youth, Brucioli was a frequent attendee and contributor to the circle of humanists and scholars who met in the Orto Oricellari, a large garden in Florence. Among the distinguished thinkers with whom Brucioli developed relationships there, the names of Francesco Cattani da Diacceto, Luigi Alamanni, and Niccol√≤ Machiavelli stand out. In 1522 Brucioli, along with several other of the members of the Orto Oricellari, was implicated in a plot to assassinate Cardinal Giulio Medici. Fleeing the city, Brucioli took refuge in Lyon, where he began work on a collection of tracts on moral philosophy, a collection published in Venice in 1526. This body of works formed the core of his Dialogi, which he would expand over the course of the next two decades. During his stay in Lyons, he seems to have absorbed many of the religious ideas of the German reformers, adopting moderately Lutheran theology in his translation of the Bible, a work which some said relied heavily on Martin Bucer. After the Sack of Rome and the flight of the Medici from Florence in 1527, Brucioli returned to his native city to take part in establishing the Republic of Florence. However, as a political moderate and strict believer that the Dominican friars of San Marco should keep out of state affairs, he quickly fell afoul of the dominant Savonarolan faction, being exiled from the city in 1528. Brucioli spent much of the rest of his life in Venice, where he was twice tried for heresy. Having been first denounced in 1548 and found guilty of disseminating heretical materials (but not of heresy), he fled to the tolerant court of Ferrara and the protection of the duchess, Ren√©e of France. From this point to the rest of his life, strictures on his ability to publish caused him great poverty. In 1549, we find him directing overtures to Cosimo I de Medici hoping to be granted a stipend in exchange for regular reports on political activities. In 1555 his Italian translation of the Bible was placed on the Index of Forbidden Books by Pope Paul IV. While in Venice he was again tried for heresy, convicted, and forced to recant. He spent most of the remainder of his life under house arrest and in extreme poverty.  References  *Spini, Giorgio. Tra Rinascimento e Riforma. Florence, 1940.

It is also a popular fish for display at public aquaria.Seriously Fish It is sometimes referred to by the common names polleni cichlid and black diamond cichlid, while the name marakely (black fish) is used among locals in Madagascar. This species is probably the only known member of its genus, as its current congener, P. toddi, from the African mainland, is unlikely to belong to this genus. Its specific name honours Fran√ßois Pollen (1842-1888), a Dutch naturalist and merchant, who collected the type when visiting Madagascar with fellow Dutch naturalist and explorer Douwe Casparus van Dam (1827-1898).  Morphology  P. polleni is a laterally compressed, full-bodied fish. Like most cichlids, it resembles a perch-type fish in shape, hence the taxonomic designation perciformes - 'perch-like'. Males in captivity develop a nuchal hump, a layer of fat above the eyes, though not to the same degree as other similar African cichlids, such as Cyphotilapia frontosa, and tilapias of Africa. Adult and subadult dominant P. polleni individuals are jet black in color, covered with brilliant iridescent spots which shift from golden to blue depending on the movement of the fish and the angle of the light; the eye is a bright yellow. The male can reach almost in total length; females are usually half that length. Sexing individuals thus becomes easier as they mature. In addition, males tend to have longer and sharper pelvic fins, a more rounded head shape, and the edges of the dorsal and anal fins are often straighter in males, and more rounded in females. Among aquarists, females, though smaller, are said to be more beautiful in their coloration patterning. In the USA a few years ago, a tropical fish wholesaler from New Jersey was maintaining both 'spot' variations, which gave him an opportunity to observe them side by side. He noticed a distinct difference in behavior, size, and fright coloration, which made him certain that rather than being the same species, the fishes might well be two different ones. As a result of following scientific investigation to determine anatomical differences, the small-spot variant was established as the species originally described as Paratilapia polleni Bleeker, 1898, and that the large-spot variant was a distinct species. The name Paratilapia bleekeri Sauvage, 1882, (honoring Bleeker, who described P. polleni), was revived and applied to the latter form. P. bleekeri is a larger fish than P. polleni, and can reach 30 cm when fully mature, with males larger than females.  Habitat and behavior  In the wild, P. polleni is a very adaptable cichlid. It can be found at altitudes up to 1500 m with water temperatures of 12¬∞C and in hot springs which can reach 40¬∞C. It inhabits a number of rivers and associated streams in northern Madagascar, including the environs of the town of Andapa, where most individuals exported for the aquarium trade in recent years were collected. It is an omnivorous fish and occasional opportunistic piscivore, approaching smaller unsuspecting fish by stealth, with their dark coloration giving them an advantage. P. polleni observed hunting in the aquarium environment will sneak up on smaller fish from below during the predawn hours and suck the smaller fish into its mouth using the typical cichlid 'suction effect' caused by quickly opening its mouth. Thus, using stealth and crypsis, it is able to prey on fish it would otherwise not be able to catch. In Madagascar, P. polleni is a food fish, and like many cichlid fishes in many regions, is reputed to have a good flavor. Adult of Paratilapia polleni References Further reading * Nourissat, J.

The commercial helicopter pilot and two medical crew members were killed and the helicopter was destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire. On July 30, 2008, the National Transportation Safety Board released its probable cause report on the accident. According to the NTSB, the probable cause of the crash was \\"the pilot's inadvertent encounter with instrument meteorological conditions and subsequent failure to maintain terrain clearance.\\" The dark night conditions, fog, and mountainous terrain were ruled to be contributing factors. Accident details The Bell 412SP helicopter took off on a cross- country repositioning flight from Loma Linda University Medical Center (94CL), Loma Linda, California, at 1742, with a planned destination of Southern California Logistics Airport (VCV), Victorville, California. Mercy Air 2 had transported a woman injured in a horse-riding accident in Phelan, California, to Loma Linda, and was returning to its assigned base at the time of the accident with only the pilot and two medical crew members on board. LifeNet, Inc., d.b.a. Mercy Air Service, Inc., was operating the helicopter under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91. An FAA representative stated the helicopter was being operated under visual flight rules and was not being handled by air traffic control, a practice he called \\"perfectly normal.\\" At 1800, the San Bernardino County Fire Department dispatch center started to receive numerous calls of an object falling from the sky, an explosion and fire northeast of Interstate 15 in the area of Oak Hills. The first fire department responders to the accident site reported that the area was covered by intermittent waves of fog, which made it difficult to locate the wreckage. The accident site was located on mountainous terrain on a 45-degree slope at an elevation of to above mean sea level (msl), below a large electrical transmission tower, a little more than a mile east of I-15, and north of Highway 138. It is in a rural area with dirt roads, and no streetlights. The approximate global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of the primary wreckage were: . First Responders reported that upon their arrival the scene was fully engulfed in fire. The post impact fire consumed approximately of mountainside, and made any reconstruction of the wreckage impossible. The first identified point of impact, a ground scar located next to the separated tail boom and the left skid, was near the base of the mountainous terrain with the debris path emanating upslope. The debris path consisted of the tail boom, both skids, both engines, the main rotor assembly, and various other fuselage panels. The energy path was measured on a 155-degree bearing from the first identified impact point. No distress call was received from the aircraft. Initial speculation that the aircraft went down after hitting electrical wires was quickly eliminated as a cause. Examination of the maintenance and flight department records revealed no unresolved maintenance discrepancies against the helicopter prior to departure. The helicopter was built in 1987 and refurbished in May 2004, and had no previous accident history. =Weather information= Cajon Pass Visual meteorological conditions predominantly prevailed along the route of flight, and a company visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan had been filed. The Cajon Pass area is known for high wind, turbulence and fog. Fog was heavy due to a marine layer that rolled in at and winds were said to be erratic. Reported weather conditions from VCV, northeast of the accident site, were visibility ; a broken cloud layer at , and an overcast cloud layer at ; temperature 11 degrees Celsius; dew point 3 degrees Celsius; altimeter . Weather conditions at Ontario International Airport, Ontario, California, southwest of the accident site, were visibility ; a broken cloud layer at , and an overcast cloud layer at ; temperature 13 degrees Celsius; dew point 6 degrees Celsius; altimeter . =GPS data= Mercy Air 2 was equipped with the OuterLink Automatic Flight Following System, a satellite-based tracking system that reports the helicopter's location to the ground base while it is in operation. The unit installed in the accident helicopter reported the following parameters every 30 seconds: date, time, latitude, and longitude. The installed system was capable of recording the altitude and airspeed, but Mercy Air had not yet installed the software upgrade required to make those parameters functional. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) reviewed the data from the Outerlink system. The satellite data indicated that the helicopter departed from 94CL and flew towards the Cajon Pass in a northwest direction. The flight path then followed the northbound Interstate 15 until it had almost reached the summit of the Cajon Pass. The global positioning system (GPS) tracked the helicopter as it continued toward the northeast while the Interstate turned toward the north. The last known position of Mercy Air 2 was recorded at 1755, and was northwest of the first identified impact point. Accident histories =Company= Air Methods, Corp., the Colorado-based parent company of Mercy Air, is the largest emergency medical services helicopter operator in the United States, with a fleet of 208 medical transport helicopters at the time of this accident. Air Methods had, after this accident, a total of 19 accidents leading to the deaths of 21 people nationwide according to the National Transportation Safety Board's records. Air Methods companies have had three other fatal accidents, in the last 10 years. On September 7, 2002, three crew members died when a Mercy Air helicopter based in Nevada crashed in Nipton, California after the main rotor blades separated while maneuvering in flight after dark. In January 2005, an Air Methods helicopter crashed in Washington, D.C. with two dead and one injured, and another crashed in Mississippi killing one. Craig Yale, the vice president of corporate development for Air Methods, stated in a news conference shortly after the accident that, \\"We fly over 100,000 hours a year, 85,000 missions a year, and in doing so have had very few fatal accidents over a 10-year period.\\" =Industry= The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration estimates there are 650 emergency medical helicopters in operation in the United States. In a 2006 NTSB special investigation report on the industry, the board reported emergency medical helicopter flight hours increased by 54 percent since 1991, but the rate of accidents per 100,000 flight hours increased 77 percent. FAA reports show that these accidents frequently involve controlled flight into terrain, spatial disorientation, and weather. \\"On the accident reports I have reviewed, there doesn't appear to be a common thread linking these accidents,\\" according to independent safety expert Barry Schiff. But three out of four of those accidents occurred when no patient was on board the aircraft ‚Äî a fact aviation lawyer and helicopter-pilot Justin Green said is attributed to lax regulations by the FAA. When no patient or organ is aboard, the helicopters can be operated VFR under less restrictive Part 91 regulations, as the accident flight was. The NTSB had previously recommended that the FAA require all operations to be conducted under the more restrictive Part 135 regulations whenever medical personnel are on board. Related information =San Bernardino County medevac controversy= At the time of this accident, Mercy Air was San Bernardino County's only private, permitted helicopter ambulance service provider. A November 2005 Grand Jury report indicated that campaign contributions by Mercy Air were a factor in the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors decisions making Mercy Air the sole air ambulance provider authorized to operate in the county, which is the largest by land area in the Continental United States, larger than some states. Both the company and board officials denied this. =Post accident information= The company grounded most of its fleet following the Sunday evening crash, and began resuming normal operations two days later on Tuesday December 12, 2006. An estimated 3,000 people, mostly uniformed nurses, medics and firefighters, attended a three-hour memorial for the flight crew a week after the accident. This accident also lead to increased efforts to establish a trauma center in the high desert region of San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties.

From there she sailed 18 April 1945 towing for Pearl Harbor. After delivering her tow 24 May, the fleet tug sailed for Guam, where she took a string of pontoon barges in tow for Okinawa. From 26 July to 6 August, she served to escort convoys and as rescue tug for the ships passing through the dangerous waters off Okinawa, subject to the desperate suicide attacks of Japanese aircraft. = End-of-War operations = The end of the war found USS Cahuilla at sea, bound for salvage operations at Eniwetok, from which she returned to take part in the occupation of Nagasaki, Japan, until 16 October.

Roman women also favoured a pale complexion. Wealthy Romans favoured white lead paste, which could lead to disfigurements and death. Men also wore makeup to lighten their skin tone; using white lead powder, chalk, and creams. The cream was made from animal fat, starch, and tin oxide. The fat was rendered from animal carcasses and heated to remove the color. The tin oxide was made out of heating tin metal in the open air. The animal fat provided a smooth texture, while the tin oxide provided colour to the cream. Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, it was considered fashionable for women to have pale skin, due to the association of tanned skin with outdoors work, and therefore the association of pale skin with affluence. In the 6th century, women would often bleed themselves to achieve a pale complexion. During the Italian Renaissance, many women applied water-soluble lead paint to their faces. Throughout the 17th century and the Elizabethan era, women wore ceruse, a lethal mixture of vinegar and white lead. They also applied egg whites to their faces to create a shiny complexion. Many men and women died from wearing lead-based make-up. In the 18th century, Louis XV made it fashionable for men to wear lead-based makeup. Theatrical actors wore heavy white base. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Victorian women wore little or no makeup. Queen Victoria abhorred make-up and deemed that it was only appropriate for prostitutes and loose women to wear it. It was only acceptable for actors or actresses to wear make-up. In the late 19th century, women would apply a whitening mixture made out of zinc oxide, mercury, lead, nitrate of silver, and acids. Some women stayed out of the sun, ate chalk, and drank iodine to achieve whiteness. In the Edwardian era, women wore a base and did not bleach their skin as much as they did in previous centuries. Modern foundation can trace its roots to Carl Baudin of the Leipziger Stadt theatre in Germany. He is the inventor of greasepaint. He wanted to conceal the joint between his wig and forehead, so he developed a flesh-coloured paste made of zinc white, ochre, and vermillion in lard. This formulation was so popular with other actors that Baudin began producing it commercially, and, as such, gave birth to the first theatrical makeup. This would be the standard for theatrical make-up until 1914 when makeup artist Max Factor created Flexible Greasepaint that was more reflective of the lighting on movie sets. Although make-up would evolve dramatically from Baudin's invention, theatrical make-up is, to this day, not too far removed from the original blend of fats and pigment. = Pan- Cake = The first commercially available foundation was Max Factor's Pan- Cake. Originally developed for use in film, actresses were so taken with the results that Max Factor was overwhelmed with demand for the product for their personal use. The breakthrough in his formula was the first \\"foundation and powder in one\\"; traditionally, an actor was made up with an oil/emollient- based make-up, which was then set with powder to reduce the reflection and ensure it would not fade or smudge. Pan-Cake used talc‚Äîrather than oil or wax‚Äîas the base, and, applied directly to the skin with a wet sponge, it offered enough coverage (it could be layered without caking on the skin) to eliminate the need for a foundation underneath. This was considered significantly more lightweight and natural-looking on the skin than the standard method, hence people's eagerness to wear the item in public. Although foundation make-up was widely available and used within the film industry, the use of cosmetics, in general, was still somewhat disreputable, and no one had tried to market foundation (although lipstick, blush and nail polish were popular for daily use) as an everyday item. Factor had the product patented in 1937, and, despite the economic turmoil of the era, Pan-Cake became one of the most successful cosmetic launches of all time. By 1940, it was estimated that one in three North American women-owned and wore Pan-Cake. As of February 2009, Procter and Gamble, the brand's current owner, confirmed that the original formula that Factor developed and used himself, is still sold today.  Modern formulations  = Color = Colour may be identified by a name, number, letter, or any combination of the three. However, unlike the Pantone or Munsell systems used in the art and fashion industries, commercial cosmetic product names are not standardized. If a make-up artist requests a \\"Medium Beige\\" foundation, the result can vary drastically from brand to brand, and sometimes, within one brand across different formulas. Cosmetic companies can also edit and adjust their formulations at any time, resulting in the 'Medium Beige' foundation a consumer has been wearing for years becoming a slightly different shade or colour without prior notice. Color classification Cosmetic companies classify their foundations Warm, Neutral, Olive, or Cool based on matching the skin tone of the wearer. A handful of professional lines, such as William Tuttle, Ben Nye, Visiora, M.A.C., and even Max Factor, do the opposite, naming their shades based on 'cancelling out' the wearer's natural skin tone so they do not become excessively warm/cool-toned in the applied areas. In other words, with some professional lines, warm skin would choose a cool foundation, and cool skin would wear a warm foundation. The difference in naming is not attributed to different definitions of warm and cool on the colour wheel.  Selection  Although most artists differ over the significance of selecting an exact match to the wearer's skin tone, intentionally using a mismatch can achieve the desired result. An excessively red complexion can be minimized by using a neutral (meaning neither yellow nor pink) beige toned foundation. A sallow or pallid complexion can be brightened with a rose to red tint, mature skin that has lost its color and appears pale and dull can be brightened with a tint of clear pink, and olive or \\"ashy\\" skin can be brightened with a shot of peach. A crucial point in selecting a foundation shade is to recognize that the appearance of the shade in the container may not accurately gauge the colour impact on the skin ‚Äì a foundation that appears very yellow in the bottle may apply much less yellow, or not appear yellow at all. Trying the colour on in stores like Ulta or Sephora is usually the best way to find an accurate match.  Shade range  Another issue that can arise when searching for a foundation shade is an inability to find a shade that suits the wearer. This may be because the prospective user cannot tell the undertone of their skin, but it can also be from available products not being light or dark enough to properly match the user's skin tone. Some examples of brands that have wide shade ranges are Fenty Beauty, Bobbi Brown, Hourglass, Maybelline, Nars, and Makeup Forever. When switching from brand to brand, consumers must be mindful of similar shade names for different colours since the cosmetic industry does not use the Munsell colour system. It has been noted that cosmetics brands like Tarte, Beauty Blender, Yves Saint Laurent, and It Cosmetics have limited shade ranges ‚Äì often making it difficult for individuals with dark skin tones to find a proper match. Time magazine recognized Fenty Beauty's foundation range \\"made for women of all skin colors and undertones\\", featuring 40 shades, for addressing these issues by putting it on their 25 Best Inventions of 2017 list. The use of color corrector products can also help to reduce discoloration. = Coverage = Coverage refers to the opacity of the makeup, or how much it will conceal on the skin. * Sheer is the most transparent and contains the least amount of pigment. It will not hide discolourations on the skin but it can minimize the contrast between the discolouration and the rest of the skin tone. Although pigment technology has evolved dramatically since 2004, the traditional protocol for sheer foundations called for the pigment to comprise 8‚Äì13% of the finished formula. * Light can cover unevenness and slight blotchiness but is not opaque enough to cover freckles. It contains 13‚Äì18% pigment. * Medium coverage can when setting with a tinted (instead of translucent) powder, cover freckles, discolourations, blotchiness, and red marks left by pimples. It contains 18‚Äì23% pigment. * Full coverage is very opaque and used to cover birthmarks, vitiligo, hyperpigmentation, and scars. It is sometimes referred to as \\"corrective\\" or \\"camouflage\\" make-up. In general, it contains up to 35% pigment, though professional brands, designed for use on stage, can contain up to 50% pigment. = Application tools= There are various tools that can be used to apply foundation including your fingers, a sponge, and several varieties of foundation brushes, each providing a different finish. Before applying foundation always start with clean and moisturized skin. Dry and flaky skin patches will often be highlighted when base makeup is applied so users should exfoliate their skin first if necessary. * Fingers: Using your fingers is great for creating a natural look. The natural body heat in your fingers helps the foundation to melt into your skin and makes it easy to blend in a sheer layer of makeup. However, using your fingers isn't recommended for applying a full coverage foundation as it will create a streaky and uneven appearance. * Sponge: Using a sponge to apply foundation is best for creating a look with sheer to medium coverage. A triangular sponge is good for blending in liquid foundation and concealer, whilst a rounded sponge is best for powder foundations, though either can be used for these purposes. To use, wet a clean sponge with water first. The moisture will prevent the sponge from absorbing the makeup and will help to more evenly distribute the product over the skin- but make sure to squeeze out excess water. Sponges with pointed tips are best utilized for a seamless blending of the under-eye area and wide, round sponges are best for blending foundation over large flat areas of skin like the cheeks or forehead. Also, note that reusing sponges can be unhygienic, so sponges should be washed and dried thoroughly after every use. * Brush: For liquid foundation, a brush with a synthetic bristle is recommended as the brush won't soak up too much of the liquid. Alternatively, a natural bristle which is more porous works best for powder foundations and other powder face products. A densely bristled brush is best for applying foundation as it is less likely to leave streaky brush marks. As with all tools used to apply makeup to the face, brushes should be soft and gentle, as anything too stiff will scratch and irritate the skin. * Airbrush: Liquid foundation is applied with an air stream. The airbrush mixes the foundation with a controllable stream of compressed air. It adheres to the skin as millions of tiny droplets of foundation. This technique can create an even, sheer appearance to the skin that, if applied properly, can appear natural and non-heavy or \\"cakey.\\" Airbrush makeup application is also frequently used in special effects makeup. Note that if the liquid foundation is applied via airbrush too heavily, additional blending with a brush or sponge may be required. =Formulation= The formula refers to the ingredients blended together, and how the makeup is formulated. *Oil and emollient-based are the oldest types of make-up. An oil (usually mineral oil) or emollient (such as petrolatum, beeswax, or lanolin) is used as the main ingredient, with pigment added to it. The texture and application are extremely thick and dense, most closely resembling modern lip balms or lipsticks. The extremely emollient nature stays moist and will not cake, is moderately waterproof, and provides the most opaque coverage; but it can smudge, fade, and change colour (darkening or oxidising) during wear. Since the 1970s, synthetic wax has also been used, which is less greasy and more reliable than other emollients. Used professionally, it is sometimes referred to as Greasepaint. Examples: Pan-Stik (Max Factor's follow-up to his Pan-Cake make-up), Elizabeth Arden Sponge-On Cream, Mehron, Dermablend. *Oil-based shakers are different from traditional oil-and-emollient-based makeup in that they were liquid foundations developed before an emulsifier and the binding agent was available, and thus separate in the bottle, like the alcohol-based formulas mentioned below. Once shaken, this is akin to applying coloured oil to the skin, with a smooth texture that can provide medium coverage with a moist finish. Liquid foundation is applied using a damp makeup sponge and is especially effective around the eye. It was a marked improvement in application, stability, and finish over the traditional oil bases, but improvements since then have rendered these nearly extinct. Examples: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn, Frances Denney Incandescent. *Alcohol- based uses a blend of water and denatured alcohol as the base, with pigment added to it. Developed by Erno Laszlo for acne-prone skin, it eliminated emollient and binding agent that could clog pores and needs to be shaken before use. Alcohol-based foundations have the most lightweight, \\"nothing on my face\\" feel, and nearly impossible to clog pores, but provide only the sheerest coverage and can be tricky to apply and blend. They work better with cotton balls or pads, instead of latex or sea sponges. Examples: Erno Laszlo Normalizer Shake-It, Clinique Pore Minimizer. *Powder-based began with Max Factor's Pan Cake, using powder ‚Äì usually talc ‚Äì as the main ingredient. The pigment is added, along with emollients, skin adhesion agents and binding agents to the formula before it is pressed into pans. The difference between this type of foundation and pressed powder is that this provides more coverage (due to more pigment), and contains more skin adhesion agents (to help it stick to the skin ‚Äì because the pressed powder is lighter weight, it requires less). Some formulas ‚Äì such as Pan Cake ‚Äì also contain wax, and can only be applied with a wet sponge; others, such as M.A.C. StudioFix contains no emollient, and can only be used dry; the last group, such as Lan√ßome Dual Finish, contain a smaller amount of oil and can be used either way. This provides a \\"finished\\" look and can blend from sheer to nearly full coverage, but can look too floury and dry, especially around the eyes, or on drier/mature skin. They can also flake and trickle down as they are applied and blended. *Mineral makeup most commonly refers to a foundation in loose powder format. The most common minerals used as the base are mica, bismuth oxychloride, titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide. However, talc is also a mineral, so a talc-based powder could be considered a \\"mineral makeup\\" ‚Äî although most mineral makeup sold makes a point of being talc-free. A \\"mineral make-up\\" may be all mineral, part mineral ‚Äì or contain less than 1% mineral as part of the finished formula. Using this logic, practically all make-up could be considered a mineral. *Water-based makeup appeared after the end of World War II, with an emulsifiers that could successfully keep a water-and-oil blended emulsion stable being the key to their development. This creamy liquid provided medium coverage with a far more natural feel and appearance than oil, powder, or emollient bases of the time, and became popular with women since then. Examples include Cover Girl Clean Makeup, Estee Lauder Country Mist. Since then, variations on the formula have expanded the category significantly: **Water-based cream make-up has a rich, creamy texture that can be sheer to full coverage with a moist, satiny finish. It usually comes in a jar or tube and is much more comfortable and realistic looking on the skin than the oil or emollient-based predecessors. Examples: Elizabeth Arden Hydro- Light, Guerlain Issa. **Water-based oil-free eliminates oil altogether, but substitutes an emollient ester or fatty alcohol in the base, and adds a mattifying agent ‚Äì usually clay ‚Äî to dry to a flat, non-reflective (\\"matte\\") finish. Oil-free liquids are quite thick and heavy, and the earliest versions took time to pour out of the bottle. They provide solid medium coverage but dry quickly, and can thus set before blended is complete. The result is streaking, which is then difficult to smooth out without starting over from scratch. The usual recommendation is to divide the face into quarter sections and to apply and blend the makeup over one section (rather than the entire face) at a time. Blending over moisturised skin with a wet sponge can also help compensate for the lack of slip. However, they will last a long time and resist smudging, even on very oily skin. Examples: Estee Lauder Fresh Air. **Water-based transfer-resistant follows the same formulation as oil-free but uses a film former or polymer instead of (or in addition to) the clay to achieve a matte finish that resists being rubbed off. Transfer-resistant make- up was launched in 1993 by Revlon-owned Ultima II with Lipsexxxy,Article from WWD 26 February 1993. Kagan, Cara the first lip-colour that included film former to prevent rubbing off. By 1996, WonderWear foundation and Revlon Colorstay had been launched, using the same technology as the lipsticks. Transfer-resistant (sometimes called transfer-proof) makeup will last on very oily skin, skin that perspires heavily, or in humid climates longer than any other type of foundation, though it is even more difficult to apply than oil- free makeup. The thick texture dries almost instantly and requires a fair amount of experimentation to master. The most modern versions (such as Revlon Colorstay SoftFlex) have made marked improvementsMake-up compositions containing phenylated silicone oils, which are resistant to transfer and migration ‚Äì L'oreal. Freepatentsonline.com. Retrieved on 8 December 2011. over predecessors in that regard. *Silicone-based make-up uses a silicone ‚Äî or a blend of water and silicone ‚Äì as the main ingredient. The most typical silicones used are dimethicone, polysiloxane, and volatile silicones such as cyclomethicone and phenyl trimethicone. The silicone provides lubrication and viscosity (what some artists refer to as \\"slip\\") at a level equal to, or often, even better than oil, allowing a product to apply and blend over the skin smoothly and evenly. Silicones have lighter weight and are thus more comfortable on the skin, as well as resisting filling in lines or large pores on the face. Conventional silicones stay supple and smooth, even in dry climates, whereas volatile silicones last long enough to blend over the face, then evaporate (like alcohol), leaving little to no feel behind. Silicone- based makeups are less likely to oxidise or to change colour during wear. One of the biggest challenges facing silicone bases is the tendency for the product to break and/or ball up on the skin, something unique to silicones and out of control of the user.

The game was released in Brazil in 1996, and eventually in North America via the Sega Channel in December 1996. Plot The story begins with a circus that was held out in the desert of Arizona. On opening night, the circus was burned completely to the ground by its shady and villainous operator, the Jester, who intended to cash in on an insurance policy. Afterwards, the Jester was convicted for the deaths of the fire victims. However, before he was executed, the Jester warned that the souls of his victims would be forever tormented. Many years later, a Native American named Raven, who had lost relatives in the fire, goes to investigate the location where the circus was held, and where supernatural events have been reported. Night comes, and suddenly there appears, via the psi-energy of the Jester, a ghostly apparition of the destroyed circus. Gameplay Players can stick to the wall via centripetal force, but only when the room is spinning sufficiently fast. In the game, Raven must go through multiple levels of the circus environment using various fighting moves to destroy enemies. The game has a normal one-player mode, but it also features a cooperative two-player mode, a one-on-one duel mode where a player can fight against a second player or an enemy character, and a mode where one player controls Raven and the second player controls the generation of the enemies in the game. The game has a \\"Tweak\\" mode which allows a player to adjust numerous game variables such as the gravity, the speed of objects, and the appearance of enemies. The soundtrack was composed by Jim Hedges, Kurt Harland Larsen, and Andy Armer. Reception USA magazine Next Generation commented that the game had a lot more detail than many other platform games, but that its potential significance was reduced since the Sega Genesis was starting to be supplanted by other consoles. The game's intended North American release in late 1995 was indeed cancelled, though it later appeared in that region for the Sega Channel.

Of French-Canadian descent, Manor was a fur trader in northwest Ohio starting in the late 18th century. Native Americans in the area, primarily Odawa, considered him a friend, which helped his business. He continued to trade with Native Americans and opened up a trading post that operated until approximately the early 19th century. Development of Providence The defeat in 1794 of Indians in the Northwest Indian War, followed by the waging and conclusion of the War of 1812 with a preservation of US borders, resulted in increased pressure on the federal government by settlers to open up these lands to European-American settlement. The government made treaties with area tribes by which they ceded large blocks of land. In the 1830s, many were encouraged to agree to removal in the 1830s to areas of Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River, in future Kansas and Oklahoma. For instance, the last of the Odawa bands from northwestern Ohio left this area by 1839 (Rozick, 10-11). In 1822, Manor had constructed a sawmill and gristmill on the Maumee River in what became Providence, Ohio to encourage settlement and ensure he would have a business (Rozick, 12). He wanted to prepare for the influx of settlers he expected as the Northwest was being developed. In 1835, Manor began developing the town of Providence. In this same period, the state of Ohio began development of what was to be the Wabash and Erie Canal through the town. Later, this section would be referred to as being a part of the Miami and Erie Canal. Specifically, the state decided that the canal should run through the site of Manor's Mill on the river. In 1838, the state of Ohio took possession of Manor's mill through eminent domain and demolished it to construct the canal (Rozick, 12). Manor rebuilt the mill in another location. As a result of a deal made with Ohio, Manor obtained perpetual water rights at his new mill (Emmons). Eventually, Manor sold the mill.(Rozick, 13) He continued to be active in the community of Providence until his death in September 1847 (Rozick, 13). It managed to preserve a higher quality of life and was nearly free of the problems of drinking, gambling, and prostitution which typically plagued canal towns. The construction of railroads through Ohio bypassed Providence and drew off traffic from the canal. The town's economy suffered a steep decline in the late 19th century. Eventually residents abandoned this location for ones with railroad access.  Sources  *Emmons, Michael J. Grinding through Time: The Historic Isaac Ludwig Mill, Metroparks of Toledo.

It typically builds ground level nests for shelter requiring dry leaf litter often at the base of trees. Like most elephant shrews, it lives in monogamous pairs, defending hectare-sized territories. Distribution of Rhynchocyon petersi in Tanzania. The species is typically limited to small, fragmented forest patches (darker blue) within the Eastern Arc Mountains (blue).

He attended Chaminade High School in Hollywood, Florida along with David Shula, and was invited by Shula's father, Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula, to attend Dolphin practices and work out with placekicker Garo Yepremian. It was Yepremian who provided Capece with the encouragement to consider a career in professional football. Capece attended Florida State University, where he graduated as the holder of FSU's records for single-season scoring (104 points), most field goals in a game (five, against Pittsburgh), and field goal percentage (100%). His 104 points in 1980 were the most by a kicker in national collegiate history. He was signed to a professional contract with the Buccaneers in 1981, during a week in which the Buccaneers cut both their placekicker and their punter. Ironically, Capece's signing marked the end of his former mentor's career, as Yepremian was the player he was signed to replace.Zier, Patrick. \\"Bucs' new, young kickers know of the pro pitfalls\\".

He helped out Def Leppard in August 1986 and played alongside Rick Allen who had lost his left arm in a car accident in December 1984. However, during Def Leppard's warm-up mini tour of Ireland, Rich missed a gig, and the rest of the band realised Allen could drum alone. Rich played with Stretch, Judie Tzuke and the Climax Blues Band prior to joining Status Quo, where in late 1985 he replaced Pete Kircher on drums. In April 2000, Rich announced his intention to leave Status Quo after 15 years in the group, due to exhaustion and family commitments. He was replaced on drums by Matt Letley. During his time with Status Quo, Rich used Paiste cymbals and Premier drums, with a 22\\" Tama bass drum. Up until the Under the Influence tour in 1999, Rich had his cymbals free floating from a steel frame, which fans noted as making him look like he was 'drumming in a cage'.

Background  Reverend Stanislaus of Raipur challenged the Madhya Pradesh Dharma Swatantrya Act by refusing to register conversions. The Madhya Pradesh High Court upheld the Act by stating that the freedom of religion must be guaranteed to all, even those who are subject to conversions by \\"force, fraud, or allurement.\\" When the Orissa Freedom of Religion Act was challenged in the Orissa High Court, the decision went in the opposite direction on grounds that the definition of \\"inducement\\" was too broad and that only the parliament had the power to enact such legislation and the state legislature did not have the power to legislate on this matter. The Supreme Court of India heard both these cases together and ruled in favour of both the Acts.  Ruling  The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had five judges and was headed by Chief Justice A.N. Ray. The Bench interpreted the word \`propagate' used in Article 25(1) of the Constitution as \`defined' in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary - \\"to spread from person to person, or from place to place, to disseminate, diffuse (a statement, belief, practice etc.)\\" and in the Century Dictionary (which is an Encyclopaedic Lexicon of the English Language) Vol. VI - \\"to transmit or spread from person to person or from place to place; carry forward or onward; diffuse; extend; as \`propagate' a report; \`propagate' the Christian religion.\\" The Bench observed: \\"We have no doubt that it is in this sense that the word \`propagate' has been used in Article 25(1), for what the Article grants is not the right to convert another person to one's own religion, but to transmit or spread one's religion by an exposition of its tenets.\\" A distinction was made between the right to propagate and the right to convert. The former was allowed while the latter was seen as not a part of the fundamental rights. Referring to Article 25(1), Chief Justice Ray, writing for the Court, held: What the Article grants is not the right to convert another person to one's own religion, but to transmit or spread one's religion by an exposition of its tenets. It has to be remembered that Article 25(1) guarantees Afreedom of conscious to every citizen, and not merely to the followers of one particular religion and that, in turn, postulates that there is no fundamental right to convert another person to one's own religion because if a person purposely undertakes the conversion of another person to his religion, as distinguished from his effort to transmit or spread the tenets of his religion, that would impinge on the \\"freedom of conscience\\" guaranteed to all the citizens of the country alike. This distinction between conversion and propagation simply for \\"the edification of others\\" was previously stated in Ratilal v. State of Bombay, [FN61] which was appealed to as a precedent.  Reaction  M Rama Jois, former chief justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, says, \\"Organised conversion, whether by force or fraud or by providing help or allurement to persons, taking undue advantage of their poverty and ignorance, is anti-secular. Respect for all religions is the essence of our secularism, whereas religious intolerance constitutes the basis of planned conversion. Therefore, conversion cannot be a secular activity.\\" External links * * Rev.

Plot summary This module expanded significantly upon the plot of the original Tomb of Horrors, revealing that the tomb of the first adventure was merely an antechamber to the lich Acererak's true resting place, and the demilich \\"slain\\" in the first adventure was both decoy and key to proceeding further. The dust from the destroyed skull opened a way to the cursed city of Moil in a pocket universe of eternal darkness and ice, and beyond that to Acererak's fortress hovering at the edge of the Negative Energy Plane itself. Acererak is revealed in this publication to be near the completion of a multi-thousand- year project to achieve godhood, powered by souls consumed over the years. He now needs only three additional souls to complete the process, but they must be of exceptional purity and strength; to this end he constructed his tomb to serve as an ultimate challenge for heroes, hoping to winnow out all but the very best. He would then consume them when they reached the center of his fortress, where his own undead essence resides in his phylactery. If the player characters fail to defeat Acererak in the course of the adventure they themselves could wind up serving in this role. Publication history Return to the Tomb of Horrors is set in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting and is a sequel to Gary Gygax's 1978 module Tomb of Horrors. Part of TSR's \\"Tomes\\" series for AD&D;, the boxed set included a reproduction of the monochrome version of Tomb of Horrors, along with an introductory note by Gygax. The new materials for the boxed set were authored by Bruce R. Cordell. Illustrations for the main adventure book were by Arnie Swekel and Glen Michael Angus, with illustrations by Swekel and Phillip Robb in the \\"Maps & Monsters Book\\". Reception Gary Gygax contributed a preface to the adventure, and although he was initially apprehensive that he wouldn't be able to offer \\"much in the way of a rave,\\" he was pleased after he read the sequel: \\"The new material is really excellent. Return is a whole mini-campaign, not some rehash of previous work ... It offers more by far than the old Tomb of Horrors, and it is more deadly too.\\" Return to the Tomb of Horrors was ranked as the tenth greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game.. Return to the Tomb of Horrors won the 1998 Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Adventure.

It is based on the play Gangstress, or Women in Prison by Dorothy Mackaye and Carlton Miles. Mackaye had spent 10 months of a one- to three-year sentence in San Quentin State Prison. The film is about an attractive woman who is a member of a bank-robbery gang. Plot Nan Taylor is a member of a gang of bank robbers, posing as a regular customer to distract the security guard while her accomplices take the money. Her cover is blown by a policeman who had arrested her before, and she is arrested again. Reform-minded radio star David Slade falls in love with her, and gets her released as a favor from District Attorney Simpson. When she confesses that she is guilty, though, Simpson has her imprisoned. At San Quentin State Prison, Nan meets fellow inmates Linda, \\"Sister Susie\\", and Aunt Maggie, as well as prison matron Noonan. Slade continues to send Nan letters, but she refuses his entreaties. Meanwhile, Susie has a fancy for Slade, and resents Nan for spurning him. Her bank accomplice, Lefty, visits her, and tells her that Don is now imprisoned in the men's section on the other side of the wall. Lefty tells her to make a map of the women's section and a copy of the matron's key, so the men can escape via the women's section of the prison. Nan believes Slade told the prison officials about the escape plot and Don is shot dead as he gets to Nan's cell to break her out. Nan is given another year, and is not allowed visitors, but vows to seek revenge on Slade. When she is released, Nan goes to a revival group meeting hosted by Slade. He is glad to see her, and she is escorted to a back room, where he professes his love for her. She scoffs and accuses him of turning in her bank robber accomplices. She shoots at him, but only hits him in the arm. Sister Susie sees this from outside from a keyhole, but Slade denies that he has been shot, and Slade and Nan announce their intention to marry.  Cast  * Barbara Stanwyck as Nan Taylor * Preston Foster as David Slade * Lyle Talbot as Gangster Don * Dorothy Burgess as 'Sister' Susie * Lillian Roth as Prisoner Linda * Maude Eburne as Aunt Maggie * Ruth Donnelly as Prison Matron * Harold Huber as Lefty Simons * Robert McWade as District Attorney Simpson * Grace Cunard as Prisoner Marie (uncredited) Production Unlike many other films of the women-in-prison genre, Taylor's fellow inmates are genuine criminals, rather than innocents in prison by mistake.  Reception  The New York Times said, \\"When a reformer and a dashing female bank bandit fall in love, their home life may be somewhat as illustrated in the lingering finale of Ladies They Talk About, [...] After a torrid argument in which Nan, the gun-girl, accuses her beloved of frustrating a jail-break in which two of her pals were killed, she loses her temper, draws a gun from her handbag, and shoots him. 'I didn't mean to do that,' Nan remarks a moment later as David Slade falls to the floor with a bullet in his shoulder. 'Why, that's all right, Nan,' responds her husband-to- be. 'It's nothing.'\\" [...] \\"It is in the prison scenes that the film provides some interesting drama. Ladies They Talk About is effective when it is describing the behavior of the prisoners, the variety of their misdemeanors, their positions in the social whirl outside, their ingenuity in giving an intimate domestic touch to the prison, and their frequently picturesque way of exhibiting pride, jealousy, vanity, and other untrammeled feminine emotions.\\"\\"Ladies They Talk About (1933) - A Woman Bandit.\\", New York Times, February 25, 1933.

Formed in 1776, the Guard was with Washington in all of his battles. It was disbanded in 1783 at the end of the war. Creation and organization The Second Continental Congress, the de facto governing body of the United Colonies (soon to be the United States) during the American Revolution, created the Continental Army on June 14, 1775, and appointed George Washington as General and Commander-in-Chief the next day. The army was organized in Massachusetts during the siege of Boston. Enlistments in the army expired at the end of 1775, and in 1776 a newly organized army was created by George Washington and the Congress. The Commander-in-Chief's Guard was authorized on 11 March 1776 and organized the next day at Cambridge, Massachusetts. The purpose of the unit was to protect General Washington as well as the money and official papers of the Continental Army. General Washington directed the formation of a \\"corps of sober, intelligent, and reliable men\\". \\"Despite its impressive unit designation and its important mission,\\" wrote military historian Mark Boatner, the Guard \\"appears to have been nothing more than what today would be called a headquarters security detachment.\\" The unit was initially created by selecting four men from each Continental Army regiment present at the siege of Boston. Washington's general order on 11 March outlined the type of men he hoped to recruit: > The General being desirous of selecting a particular number of men, as a > Guard for himself, and baggage, The Colonel, or commanding Officer, of each > of the established Regiments, (the Artillery and Rifflemen excepted) will > furnish him with four, that the number wanted may be chosen out of them. His > Excellency depends upon the Colonels for good Men, such as they can > recommend for their sobriety, honesty, and good behaviour; he wishes them to > be from five feet, eight Inches high, to five feet, ten Inches; handsomely > and well made, and as there is nothing in his eyes more desirable, than > Cleanliness in a Soldier, he desires that particular attention may be made, > in the choice of such men, as are neat, and spruce. They are all to be at > Head Quarters to morrow precisely at twelve, at noon, when the Number wanted > will be fixed upon. The General neither wants men with uniforms, or arms, > nor does he desire any man to be sent to him, that is not perfectly willing, > and desirous, of being of this guard. They should be drill'd men. The strength of the unit was usually 180 men, although this was temporarily increased to 250 during the winter of 1779‚Äì80, when the army was encamped at Morristown, New Jersey, in close proximity to the British Army. Because it was an honor to belong to the unit, care was taken to ensure that soldiers from each of the 13 states were represented in the Guard. Major Caleb Gibbs of Rhode Island was the first commander of the Guard, and was given the title of captain commandant. Gibbs was succeeded in 1779 by William Colfax. The flag and uniform of the Commander-in-Chief's Guards was described by historian Benson John Lossing: > The flag is white silk, on which the device is neatly painted. One of the > Guard is seen holding a horse, and is in the act of receiving a flag from > the Genius of Liberty, who is personified as a woman leaning upon the Union > shield, near which is the American eagle. The motto of the corps, \\"CONQUER > OR DIE,\\" is upon a ribbon. The uniform of the Guard consisted of a blue coat > with white facings, white waistcoat and breeches, black half gaiters, a > cocked hat with a blue and white feather. In Godfrey's 1904 history of The Commander-in-Chief's Guard he provided \\"detailed sketches of its members\\", including six drummers, six fifers and a drum-major. In the final days of the war, the unit consisted of only 64 men. It was furloughed 6 June 1783, at Newburgh, New York, and disbanded on 15 November 1783. Hickey mutiny Several members of the Commander-in-Chief's Guard were involved in a shadowy conspiracy early in the war. After the conclusion of the Boston campaign in 1776, General Washington and the Continental Army marched to New York City and prepared for an anticipated attempt by the British to occupy the city. The Royal Governor of New York, William Tryon, had been driven out of the city by American Patriots and was compelled to seek refuge on a ship in New York Harbor. Nevertheless, the city had many residents, known as Loyalists, who favored the British side. In the spring of 1776, Sergeant Thomas Hickey, a member of the Guard, was arrested with another soldier in New York for passing counterfeit money. While incarcerated, Hickey revealed to another prisoner, Isaac Ketcham, that he was part of a wider conspiracy of soldiers who were prepared to defect to the British once the expected invasion came. Hickey claimed that eight members of the Guard were involved in the plot. William Greene, a drummer in the Guard, was one of the conspirators, and David Mathews, the Mayor of New York City, was accused of funding the operation to bribe soldiers to join the British. The suspected men of the Guard were taken into custody by the provost marshal of the Continental Army. The conspiracy became greatly exaggerated in rumor, and was alleged to include plans to kidnap Washington, assassinate him and his officers, and blow up the Continental Army's ammunition magazines. Hickey, the only conspirator put on trial, was court-martialed and found guilty of mutiny and sedition. He was executed in New York on 28 June 1776 before a crowd of 20,000 spectators. False claims of service in the Life Guards Decades after the Revolution it was not uncommon for aged veterans to claim to have served in General Washington's Life Guard. One of the more famous of the false claims was made by Alexander Milliner of New York. When interviewed in 1864 by the Reverend Elias B. Hillard for his famous book The Last Men of the Revolution, Milliner claimed to be 104 and spun several stories of his (imagined) encounters with the general and \\"Lady Washington\\" during the last years of the Revolution. Later investigations determined that Milliner was only 94 (b. 1770) when he reminisced for Hillard, and that while he had served for several years as a drummer boy, he did so in a New York regiment and there was no record of a \\"Milliner\\" in the Life Guard.Hillard, Elias B.

It has long been the center of African American culture in Boston, prior to which the area was primarily Jewish. For most of the twentieth century, the square was a multi-mode transportation hub, centered at Dudley station, now Nubian station of the Washington Street Elevated, which closed in 1987. Several streetcar lines radiated to surrounding neighborhoods from the elevated station. It is now a substantial bus terminal and terminus for the MBTA's bus rapid transit Silver Line.  History  In the colonial and post-revolutionary periods, Washington Street was the only connection between Shawmut Peninsula, on which Old Boston was located, and the mainland. Nubian Square is located on the mainland side of what was the Washington Street isthmus, an area known as The Neck. At the time, it was known as Dudley Square. Notable development began in Roxbury in the 19th century, and Nubian Square served as a commercial center in this period. As Boston introduced streetcar service through the Boston Elevated Railway, Dudley Square station was opened in 1901, leading to another boom in Nubian Square's importance and reinforcing its status as a community hub. After the Boston Elevated Railway's reorganization into the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in 1947, streetcar service to Nubian Square was curtailed and replaced with bus service through the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, the Southwest Expressway was planned to run through Roxbury, and attempts to relocate the Nubian Square community to make way for the project led to the displacement of many residents, the destruction of much of Nubian Square's community, and tensions with Boston City authorities. The process of replacing streetcar service with bus service was completed in 1987, with the closure of the Washington Street Elevated. Around this time, Nubian Square entered a period of reinvestment, as key community buildings, such as the post office, were rebuilt and others, such as the Roxbury Boys and Girls Club and Palladio Hall, were restored. =Name change= The square was originally named after Thomas Dudley, a colonial magistrate who served several terms as governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. An effort to rename the square was led by a local community group, the Nubian Square Coalition. Proponents noted that Dudley was \\"a leading politician in 1641\\", when the colony became the first to legally sanction slavery. Other reasons included resisting gentrification and rebuilding a sense of community ethnic identity around the square. The proposed name came from a region that is now Egypt and Sudan and refers to the seat of one of the earliest civilizations of ancient Africa. Roxbury-based newspaper the Bay State Banner had supported a name change, although \\"pushed back against the square becoming 'Nubian', as Nubians owned slaves\\". Byron Rushing, former president of the Museum of African American History in Boston, noted, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve really searched, and I‚Äôve found no evidence that Dudley ever owned slaves.\\" A non-binding advisory question was added to the November 5, 2019, municipal election ballot for all Boston residents asking, \\"Do you support the renaming/changing of the name of Dudley Square to Nubian Square?\\" Approximately 54% of votes cast on the question were in opposition, while approximately 46% were in favor. Although the question was defeated, it \\"passed in the surrounding areas\\" near the square, and Mayor of Boston Marty Walsh subsequently announced that the proposal would be considered further by the city's Public Improvement Commission. On December 19, 2019, the Public Improvement Commission unanimously approved changing the name of Dudley Square to Nubian Square. The name change is recorded in Boston's street register, but there is no physical city signage displaying either the old or the new name of the square. The Nubian Square Coalition stated that they would next pursue a name change of Dudley Square station, a bus station in the square. In mid-February 2020, it was announced that the station would be renamed to Nubian Station.

Bradshaw after their deaths, having been formerly known in English as the Silver Mountain Range. History The first known settlements in the Bradshaws were a group of Yavapai people, called the Kwevkapaya who built forts and mined copper from around AD 1100 to 1600. The Walker party found gold, and within a few years, the Bradshaws were filling up with settlers mining for gold, silver, and copper. In the early part of the 20th century, most of the towns that had sprung up were little more than ghost towns. Geography Spruce Mountain seen behind Mount Davis, from the peak of Mount Union View looking South from the Summit of Mount Union the highest peak in the Bradshaw Mountains Located approximately 5 miles (8 km) south of Prescott, Arizona, between the Agua Fria River on the east, and the Hassayampa River on the west, the range is 40 miles (64 km) long, and almost 25 miles (40 km) wide. =Peaks= *Mount Union, named during the Civil War, is the highest, at . *Mount Davis ‚Äì second highest at , named for Jefferson Davis. *Spruce Mountain ‚Äì , misnamed for Douglas firs mistaken for Spruces. *Mount Tritle ‚Äì , named for Frederick Augustus Tritle Governor of Arizona Territory (1882‚Äì1885). *Towers Mountain ‚Äì . *Maverick Mountain ‚Äì . *Mount Wasson ‚Äì . Geology The Bradshaw Mountains consist primarily of Precambrian granite, gneiss and schist. Ecology The biotic community of the Bradshaws ranges from interior chaparral and montane conifer forest, to plains and desert grassland, and Sonoran desert scrub. Many species of trees are found in the Bradshaws, including Pi√±on, Alligator Juniper, Ponderosa pine, Blue Spruce, Quaking Aspen, White fir, and Douglas fir. As well, much wildlife is present, including javelina, mountain lion, bobcat, black bear, mule deer, porcupine, fox, skunk, rock squirrel, wild turkey, many species of reptiles and amphibians, and many species of birds. Several creeks have been dammed to form reservoirs, including Lynx Lake, Goldwater Lake, Lake Marapai, Hassayampa Lake, Horsethief Lake, and Cedar Tank. Human use An abandoned charcoal kiln, near Walker, Arizona Gold was first discovered in the Bradshaws in 1863, over $2,000,000 worth being taken from just the Crown King Mine. Copper and silver were also mined in the early part of the 20th century. Within Mount Union lies the Poland Junction silver mine. Its adit, now sealed, may be accessed from Poland Junction, near Walker. =Ghost towns and other settlements= There are over 40 ghost towns in the Bradshaw Mountains, including Crown King, Bumble Bee, Goodwin, Bradshaw City, Alexandra and Cleator. Protected areas Much of the Bradshaw Mountains are on Prescott National Forest land. Other parks include Horsethief Basin Recreational Area, Lynx Lake Recreational Area, and the Castle Creek Wilderness.

His writings focus on praising the Soviet Union and its political and economic system from a Russian nationalist perspective, criticizing the Russian government, and discussing the perceived NATO (particularly American) threat to Russia and the likelihood that this antagonism will result in a nuclear war between Russia and NATO. Kucherenko was born in Ashgabat on December 21, 1966, but spent much of his childhood in Odessa, Ukrainian SSR (now Ukraine). He served in the Soviet Army from 1985 to 1987, and graduated from Moscow State University in 1991 with a degree in history. Kucherenko is the father of three daughters, and published his first book in 1993. Ideology and criticism Maxim Kalashnikov is a Russian nationalistic agitator. As an expert in Russian history, economics, and military, he criticizes modern Russia and praises the Soviet system, or more precisely what it was under Joseph Stalin and what it could have become without Leonid Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev. He is an advocate of \\"a federated Russian Empire\\" consisting of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, parts of Belarus, Moldova's breakaway Transnistria, and Georgia's Abkhazia and South Ossetia. He has described himself as a supporter of \\"dismemberment\\" of Georgia and creation of Russian-allied enclaves in its territory. Kalashnikov has often been criticized for lack of objectivity and abuse of sentimentalism in his writings. Kalashnikov targets primarily younger Russian. He has also been criticized for making numerous contradictions. For example, in some of his writing, Kalashnikov praises Stalin and the Soviet system, yet in other writings, he espouses sharp anti-communist arguments.Maxim Kalashnikov - The Battle for Skies In September 2009 President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev urged the government to study Kalashnikov's ideas for speeding the development of the country‚Äôs innovative economy posted at LiveJournal.

From 2007 through 2013, he played for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in Nippon Professional Baseball's (NPB) Pacific League. Tanaka was posted by the Eagles after the 2013 season to be signed by an American team; he agreed to terms with the New York Yankees and signed a seven-year, $155 million contract, the fifth-largest deal ever given to a pitcher at the time. He made his major league debut in 2014. Tanaka was the Eagles' first-round pick in the NPB amateur player draft. From 2012 to 2013, he won 26 consecutive decisions, which set a new NPB record. In the MLB, Tanaka has earned selections to two Major League Baseball All-Star Games. Early life Tanaka was born in Itami, a city in Hy≈çgo, Japan. He began playing baseball in the first grade as a catcher for the Koyanosato Tigers (a Little League team) alongside current Yomiuri Giants shortstop Hayato Sakamoto, who was then the team's ace pitcher and Tanaka's batterymate. Tanaka and Sakamoto hit third and fourth in the lineup, respectively. He went on to play for the Takarazuka Boys while attending Itami Municipal Matsuzaki Junior High School, being used at both pitcher and catcher because of his strong throwing arm. He was chosen to the Junior All-South Kansai team in his third year of junior high‚Äîthe equivalent of ninth grade in the United States. High school career =2004 ‚Äì spring 2006= Tanaka moved on to Komazawa University Tomakomai High School in Hokkaid≈ç, now playing solely as a pitcher for the team. Armed with a fastball that sat in high-80s and a hard slider, he led his team all the way to a championship in the 87th National High School Baseball tournament held at Koshien Stadium in the summer of his second year (eleventh grade). His very last pitch of the tournament was clocked at , the first time a pitcher had ever clocked that speed as a junior in the history of the tournament. Tanaka, already a highly coveted talent by NPB scouts, was chosen to the Japanese team that would play in the IBAF AAA World Junior Championships following the tournament and contributed to the team's title. Now given the uniform number 1 and officially appointed the team's ace pitcher, Tanaka led Tomakomai High to a regional title as well as a championship in the Meiji Jingu Tournament that fall, hitting home runs in four straight games in the latter himself. While his team was viewed as the favorite going into the 78th National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament to be held the following spring, Tomakomai High was forced to withdraw from the tournament because of allegations of misconduct of some of the players. =Summer 2006= Scoreboard at Koshien Stadium in finals rematch Tomakomai High earned a berth in the 88th National High School Baseball Championship that summer. Tanaka managed to lead them to their third consecutive appearance in the tournament finals despite being ill prior to the tournament. The team's coach did not start Tanaka in the finals against Waseda Jitsugyo High School (an affiliate school of Waseda University), opting to rest him due to the number of innings he had thrown in the last few games, but he ended up sending Tanaka to the mound in relief midway through the third inning. Tanaka held Waseda Jitsugyo to just one run and struck out 10, but the opponent's ace, Yuki Saito, held Tomakomai High to one run himself on seven hits. The game remained tied 1‚Äì1 after 15 innings, forcing a rematch as per tournament regulations. It was the first time in 37 years (since Matsuyama Commercial High School and Misawa High School met in the finals in 1969) that the tournament finals had resulted in a rematch. Tanaka as a pitcher for Tomakomai High (taken August 17, 2006, at Koshien Stadium) In the rematch that ensued the next day, Tanaka again came on in relief in the bottom of the first, but Tomakomai High lost to Waseda Jitsugyo despite his pitching the remaining 7 innings of the game. (Tanaka was the last batter, striking out to end the game.) The pitchers' duel between Tanaka and Saito in the finals and the rematch that followed became on the most defining moments in all of sports in Japan that year. Tanaka, dealing with intestinal inflammation, threw 742 pitches in 52 innings (six appearances) in the tournament, striking out 54 and walking 20 with a 2.22 earned run average (ERA). Both pitchers were chosen to play for Japan in the United States-Japan High School Baseball Tournament (organized by the Japanese Educational Resource Center in conjunction with the Major League Baseball Urban Youth Academy). Tomakomai High and Waseda Jitsugyo High met one last time in the finals of the Nojigiku Hy≈çgo National Sports Festival, the last tournament of Tanaka's high school career, but Tomakomai High was shut out by Saito and lost (1‚Äì0) to Waseda Jitsugyo, finishing second yet again. =Aftermath= Tanaka struck out 458 batters over the course of his high school career (2004‚Äì2006), surpassing Daisuke Matsuzaka's previous national high school record of 423 with Yokohama Senior High School. He also hit 13 home runs during those three years. After rival Yuki Saito announced that he would not be declaring for the upcoming draft, opting to go on to Waseda University instead, Tanaka became the single most highly touted high school player eligible to be picked. On September 25, in the 2006 NPB high school draft, the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, Orix Buffaloes, Yokohama BayStars and Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles all selected Tanaka with their first-round picks. The Golden Eagles drew the winning straw, signing him to a base salary of 15 million yen, a signing bonus of 100 million yen and additional performance-based incentives, the equivalent of what a first-round college or industrial league-player would normally receive, on November 2. He was also given the uniform number 18, which typically denotes a team's staff ace in Japanese professional baseball. Professional career =Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles= Tanaka pitching for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in 2007 2007 Tanaka was named to the Eagles' ichigun (Japanese equivalent of \\"major league\\") roster during Spring training of his rookie year, and made his professional debut on March 29, , against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks as the starting pitcher, but gave up six runs on six hits and a walk in 1 innings. Though he was not charged with a loss, as the Eagles made a furious comeback to tie the game up in the fourth, he was seen sitting in the dugout in tears after being taken out of the game. On April 18, in a home game against the Hawks, he held the team to two runs and struck out 13 in a complete game win, the first win of his professional career. He became the first pitcher since Yu Darvish to throw a complete game shutout as a rookie out of high school on June 13 in an interleague game against the Chunichi Dragons.\\"Tanaka throws shutout\\" The Japan Times. He also became the first pitcher since Daisuke Matsuzaka in 1999 to be voted the starter of the NPB All-Star Game (representing the Pacific League) as a rookie out of high school, starting in Game 2 on July 22 and clocking a personal-high (though he gave up six runs in two innings in that start). On July 10, Tanaka recorded his 100th strikeout of the season in just 96 innings, tying the record for the fastest to reach 100 career strikeouts (in innings) held by former Hanshin Tigers pitcher Yutaka Enatsu. He became the first pitcher to record double- digit wins in Eagles franchise history (and the first to do so as a rookie out of high school in Japanese professional baseball since Matsuzaka) in a win against the Saitama Seibu Lions on August 31. Tanaka finished the year with an 11‚Äì7 record and a 3.82 ERA, faring particularly well against the Hawks (5‚Äì0 in six starts). His 196 strikeouts were the second-most by any pitcher in either league (Pacific or Central) and the fourth-most as a rookie out of high school in Japanese professional baseball history. He was named the Pacific League Most Valuable Rookie, the first player out of high school to win the award since Matsuzaka. 2008 In , Tanaka was penciled into the front end of the Eagles' starting rotation for the second straight season.\\"2008 Pacific League Preview: Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles\\" The Japan Times. He earned his first career win at Sapporo Dome, located in his former home of Hokkaido, in a win against the Fighters on May 4, drawing cheers from the crowd despite pitching for the away team. He came on in relief for the first time in his career in an interleague game against the Hiroshima Carp on June 22, recording his first career save. Tanaka was able to make only 24 starts (as opposed to 28 in his rookie season), missing playing time because of both a brief rehab stint in the minors due to inflammation in his shoulder and his participation in the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a member of the Japanese national team. He entered the last game of the regular season against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks with nine wins, looking to both earn his tenth win of the season and prevent the Eagles from finishing in last place. While he held the Hawks to no runs over nine innings, Hawks starter Toshiya Sugiuchi equaled his performance and Tanaka fell short of his goal of reaching double-digit wins. The Eagles eventually won in walk-off fashion in the twelfth inning, finishing one game ahead of the Hawks for fifth place in the regular season standings. 2009 Tanaka got off to an utterly dominant start to the season, pitching a four-hit complete game shutout against the Hawks in his first start on April 7, a one-run complete game win against the Chiba Lotte Marines on April 14 (his first career win against the Marines, the only other Pacific League team he had yet to record a win against), a three-hit complete game shutout against the Marines on April 22, and an 11-strikeout, one-run complete game win against the Fighters on April 29. The fourth win marked the 1500th of Eagles manager Katsuya Nomura's career\\"Tanaka tosses another gem as Nomura reaches 1,500 wins\\" The Japan Times. and made Tanaka the first pitcher to start the season with four consecutive complete game wins since Satoru Komiyama (then with the Marines) and Shigetoshi Hasegawa (Orix BlueWave) both accomplished the feat in 1993. However, though he went 4‚Äì0 with a 0.50 ERA for the month of April, striking out 37 and allowing just 24 baserunners in 36 innings and winning Pacific League monthly Most Valuable Player honors for the first time in his career, he was removed from the active roster on April 30 with a minor shoulder strain as a result of fatigue. He returned to the team on May 13, pitching seven innings of three run-ball against the Fighters for his fifth straight win to start the season.Tanaka pitches Eagles into share of first place, Kyodo News (May 14, 2009). 2013 On September 13, 2013, Tanaka set a new NPB record with his 21st consecutive win in the 2013 season in a 6‚Äì2 complete game victory over the Orix Buffaloes at home in Sendai at Kleenex Stadium. This victory was Tanaka's 25th consecutive win, including his final four starts in 2012. It also eclipsed the longest consecutive winning streak for MLB pitchers, set at 24 by Carl Hubbell in the 1936 and 1937 seasons. On September 26, 2013, Tanaka relieved to close the last inning. With a one run lead, he sealed the victory and the Eagles' first Pacific League title. It was his first appearance as a closer in the 2013 season. He ended the regular season with a 24‚Äì0 record and 1.27 ERA, tops in both leagues. He also became the second post-war starting pitcher with an undefeated season with minimum innings required for an ERA title since Shigekuni Mashiba. Tanaka went on to win his second Sawamura Award as the Golden Eagles competed for their first Japan Series title. Taking postseason games into account, his 2013 record was 30‚Äì1. The lone loss came in Game 6 of the 2013 Japan Series, a 160-pitch complete game, and he avenged that loss as he picked up the save in the decisive Game 7. =New York Yankees= Tanaka was repeatedly scouted by MLB representatives during the 2013 season. Through the revised posting system, Rakuten posted Tanaka to MLB during the 2013‚Äì14 offseason at a fee of $20 million. On December 26, 2013, all 30 MLB teams were notified that the 30-day period to sign the 25-year-old right-hander began at 8 a.m. EST. Clubs had until 5 p.m. EST on January 24, 2014, to reach an agreement with Tanaka, who was represented by agent Casey Close. During the month-long period following Tanaka's posting, teams reported to be serious suitors included the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Houston Astros. On January 22, 2014, Tanaka signed a seven-year contract worth $155 million with the Yankees. The contract contained an opt-out clause after the fourth year and a full no-trade clause. 2014 Tanaka in 2014 Tanaka made his Major League debut on April 4, 2014, against the Toronto Blue Jays and gave up a home run to the first batter he faced, ex-Yankee Melky Cabrera. Tanaka would receive his first MLB win in the game, pitching seven innings with eight strikeouts in the Yankees 7‚Äì3 win against the Blue Jays. Tanaka made his first Yankees home start on April 9, against the Baltimore Orioles where he struck out ten batters in seven innings but received a no-decision as the Yankees lost the game 4‚Äì5. During an interleague game against the New York Mets on May 14, Tanaka recorded his first major league hit off of Jos√© Valverde and pitched his first complete game in the majors as the Yankees shut out the Mets 4‚Äì0. Tanaka began his American career with a 6‚Äì0 record before he received his first loss in the MLB on May 20, as the Yankees lost to the Chicago Cubs 6‚Äì1; it was his first loss in any professional baseball league since August 19, 2012. In June, Tanaka recorded his 100th strikeout of the season in a complete game against the Seattle Mariners; his bid for a shutout was ended when former Yankee Robinson Can√≥ hit a two-run home run in the ninth inning. Tanaka began the year with an 11‚Äì1 record and a 1.99 ERA in his first 14 starts while striking out 113 batters in 99 innings. He became the first Yankees rookie to win 12 games by the All-Star break and was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game as a reserve for the American League. He and teammate Dellin Betances were the first Yankees rookie pitchers to earn an All-Star Game nod since Spec Shea in 1947. Following a loss to the Cleveland Indians on July 8, 2014, in which he gave up five runs in innings, Tanaka began to experience discomfort in his right arm. The next day, Tanaka was placed on the disabled list due to right elbow inflammation. He had compiled a 12‚Äì4 record with a 2.51 ERA in 18 starts and was forced to withdraw from the All-Star Game as a result of the injury. An MRI revealed that his elbow had a partially torn UCL. At the behest of several doctors, Tanaka received a PRP shot from Yankees' head team physician Dr. Christopher Ahmad and rested his elbow for 6 weeks instead of having Tommy John surgery to repair his UCL. Tanaka returned on September 21 against the Blue Jays, receiving his 13th win of the season in the Yankees' 5‚Äì2 victory over the Blue Jays. He would only pitch one more time during the 2014 season, a loss to the Boston Red Sox in which he gave up seven runs (five earned) in innings. In the 20 starts of his first major league season in 2014, Tanaka posted a 2.77 ERA with 141 strikeouts in 136‚Öì innings and a 13‚Äì5 record. After his 2014 season, there was much speculation by sports media and fans that Tanaka should have undergone surgery rather than follow his doctors' suggestions and rehab the injury. This was mostly due to the belief that he would need to get the surgery despite the rehab program.http://www.newsday.com/sports/columnists/david-lennon/don-t-risk-it- masahiro-tanaka-should-have-tommy-john-surgery-1.8765529 2015 Tanaka pitching against the New York Mets at Citi Field, September 18, 2015 Tanaka was chosen by Joe Girardi to be the Opening Day starter for the Yankees. He made the Opening Day start on April 6, 2015, against the Blue Jays, surrendering five runs in the third inning, including a home run by Edwin Encarnaci√≥n, as the Yankees lost. On April 28, Tanaka was placed on the disabled list with forearm and wrist soreness; he had gone 2‚Äì1 with a 3.22 ERA in four starts. The injury combined with his poor first outing led many in the sports media to speculate that Tanaka should undergo Tommy John surgery against the wishes of his doctors. After missing a month, he returned on June 3 against the Seattle Mariners, where he pitched seven innings with nine strikeouts as the Yankees won 3‚Äì1. In a June 27 start against the Houston Astros, Tanaka gave up a career-high six earned runs. Tanaka was diagnosed with a Grade 1 hamstring strain on September 20, sustaining the injury during an interleague game against the New York Mets when running to first base after a bunt attempt. He would miss his next start. Tanaka's season ended with a 3‚Äì0 loss to the Houston Astros in the American League Wild Card game, in which he pitched five innings and allowed two earned runs.Yahoo! Sports In 24 starts, Tanaka went 12‚Äì7 with a 3.51 ERA in 154 innings, posting a WHIP of only 0.994, the lowest amongst all American League starters with at least 150 innings pitched. One area of struggle for Tanaka in 2015 was the home run: he gave up 25 of them. 2016 Tanaka was named the Yankees' Opening Day starter in 2016 for the second consecutive season. He received a no-decision against the Houston Astros, giving up two runs in innings. On April 17, Tanaka faced his former Rakuten teammate Hisashi Iwakuma of the Seattle Mariners for the first time in the United States, the first time in MLB history that two former Japanese teammates pitched against each other. Tanaka earned the win, allowing two earned runs in seven innings and striking out six, while Iwakuma took the loss. In his first eight starts, Tanaka compiled a 1‚Äì0 record, receiving seven no-decisions, including eight shutout innings against the Baltimore Orioles on May 5. Tanaka tied his career high by giving up six earned runs in six innings in a June 29 start against the Texas Rangers. On July 10, Tanaka pitched his shortest start of the season, lasting only 4‚Öî innings in a no-decision against the Cleveland Indians. Prior to the All-Star Break, Tanaka went 6‚Äì2 with a 3.23 ERA in 18 starts, pitching 117 innings and striking out 93. Tanaka started in the Subway Series for the third straight season, losing to the Mets on August 2 by giving up seven runs (six earned) in 6‚Öì innings. It would be his final loss of 2016, as Tanaka would finish the season strong and end the year by winning seven consecutive decisions in his last ten starts. Tanaka faced Iwakuma again on August 24, throwing seven shutout innings as Tanaka received the win and Iwakuma received the loss again in their second meeting. On September 10, Tanaka struck out a season-high 10 batters in 7‚Öì innings against the Tampa Bay Rays. In his next start, Tanaka pitched seven innings of one-run baseball against the Boston Red Sox, lowering his ERA to 2.97, the best in the American League. After a win against the Rays on September 21 in which he allowed four home runs, Tanaka was diagnosed with a flexor mass strain and was shut down for five days. After the strain healed, it was announced that Tanaka would not pitch in his final scheduled start of the season as the Yankees were already eliminated from postseason contention and the team felt it was not necessary to risk Tanaka's health in a meaningless game. In the second half of 2016, Tanaka pitched to an 8‚Äì2 record and a 2.83 ERA in 13 games, throwing 82‚Öî innings and striking out 72. In 2016, Tanaka made a career-high 31 starts and avoided a disabled list stint for the first time in his MLB career. He finished the year pitching 199‚Öî innings with a 14‚Äì4 record, 165 strikeouts and a 3.07 ERA, the third-best in the American League. Tanaka set career-highs in innings pitched, wins, strikeouts and WAR (Wins Above Replacement) (he finished the year with 5.4 WAR, the third most of any pitcher in the league). He finished tied for seventh in the voting for the American League Cy Young with Aaron Sanchez. 2017 Tanaka pitching in April, 2017 On February 14, 2017, Girardi named Tanaka the Opening Day starter for the third season in a row. Tanaka was dominant in Spring Training, allowing only one earned run in innings for a 0.38 ERA. Making the Opening Day start against the Tampa Bay Rays on April 2, Tanaka lasted only innings, allowing a career-high seven earned runs as the Yankees lost by a score of 7‚Äì3. Tanaka's season started slowly until pitching a complete game shutout against the Red Sox on April 27, the second of his career. Tanaka's shutout was notable in that he only threw 97 pitches, pitching what is colloquially referred to as a \\"Maddux\\" (a complete-game shutout with fewer than 100 pitches), the first by any pitcher in the 2017 season. Tanaka allowed more than three earned runs only once in the six starts after his Opening Day debacle, lowering his ERA to 4.36 by May 8. Tanaka pitching for the Yankees in 2015 Tanaka was scheduled to start in Game 2 of the May 14 doubleheader against the Houston Astros, notable for being the same game in which Derek Jeter would have his number retired in a pregame ceremony. Tanaka would give up a career-high eight earned runs in innings, allowing four home runs. Critics blasted Tanaka for \\"ruining\\" what was supposed to be a special night for Jeter and the Yankees. In his next start, he allowed six runs in three innings against the Tampa Bay Rays, giving up three home runs in the process. Tanaka appeared to improve in a May 25 start against the Oakland Athletics, as he struck out a career-high 13 batters. However, he would allow seven runs to the Baltimore Orioles and five runs to the Boston Red Sox in his next two starts, both losses, leaving his record at 5‚Äì7 and his ERA at 6.55 by June 6. Tanaka rebounded against the Los Angeles Angels in a no-decision but then faltered again versus the Oakland Athletics, as he gave up three more home runs en route to his sixth consecutive loss. Baseball analysts attempted to uncover the root cause of Tanaka's sudden struggles, which were surprising given his excellent 2016 and his reputation as the Yankees' ace since 2014. Critics pointed to a \\"flat\\" slider, missing badly on several pitches and getting buried in favorable hitters' counts. Some raised concerns that he was playing injured and needed Tommy John surgery; however, the Yankees (and Tanaka himself) insisted that Tanaka was at full health. Key to Tanaka's struggles was the home run ball, as he allowed 21 home runs in the first innings of the season, compared to allowing only 22 home runs in the entire 2016 season. On June 23, Tanaka started against fellow Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish for the first time in the United States, outdueling him by throwing eight shutout innings and striking out nine in a no-decision. Against the Rays on July 28, Tanaka set a new career-high by striking out 14 batters. Tanaka took a perfect game into the sixth inning and allowed only one run on two hits in eight innings pitched. On August 12, Tanaka was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to right shoulder inflammation. He missed only one start. On August 27, Tanaka earned his tenth win of the season against the Seattle Mariners, making him the first Japanese pitcher in MLB history to have double- digit wins in all of his first four seasons. On September 29 against the Blue Jays, his final start of the regular season, Tanaka again set a new career- high by striking out 15 batters, tied with Stephen Strasburg for the most single-game strikeouts in 2017. In 30 starts of 2017, he finished the year with a 13‚Äì12 record, a 4.74 ERA, 194 strikeouts, and 35 home runs allowed in innings pitched. In the postseason, Tanaka earned the win in Game 3 of the 2017 American League Division Series against the Indians after throwing seven shutout innings. He started Game 1 of the 2017 American League Championship Series against Dallas Keuchel and the Astros in a rematch of the 2015 AL Wild Card Game, taking the loss after allowing two runs in six innings. However, he faced Keuchel again in Game 5, this time earning the win as he pitched seven shutout innings, striking out eight to help the Yankees take a 3‚Äì2 series lead. On November 3, Tanaka announced that he would not exercise the opt-out clause in his contract, instead staying with the Yankees for the remaining three years and $67 million left on his original deal. 2018 Tanaka's first start of 2018 went smoothly as he retired 13 batters in a row, struck out eight, and allowed one run, which was a solo homer by Randal Grichuk in 6+ innings as the Yankees won 4‚Äì2. While playing at Citi Field against the Mets on June 8, Tanaka scored his first career run after a sacrifice fly from Aaron Judge, but shortly after, he left the game after his hamstrings grew stiff. The next day, on June 9, Tanaka wound up on the 10-day disabled list due to mild strains in both hamstrings. In a short time after his return from the DL, he pitched a complete game shutout in a 4‚Äì0 win over the Rays. 2019 Due to Luis Severino's rotator cuff injury, the Yankees tapped Tanaka for his fourth Opening Day start on March 9, 2019. The start gave him the record for most Opening Day starts by a Japanese pitcher with four, passing Hideo Nomo. Tanaka would pitch innings, allowing 6 hits and 2 runs while striking out 5 in the Yankees 7‚Äì2 win vs the Orioles. This was Tanaka's first opening day victory. On 17 June Tanaka threw a complete game two-hit shutout and made 10 strikeouts in the Yankees‚Äô 3-0 victory against Rays on Monday evening at Yankee Stadium. On June 29, against the Red Sox at London Stadium, Takana allowed 6 runs in the first inning, and was lifted after 2 outs. It was the first time in his career that he could not complete an inning while starting, but nevertheless, the Yankees won 17-13. On July 6, Tanaka was named to the 2019 Major League Baseball All-Star Game as an injury replacement for Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Marcus Stroman.http://web.yesnetwork.com/media/video.jsp?content_id=33500000209 July 25 against the Red Sox turned out to be Tanaka's worst outing in professional baseball, as he allowed 7 runs in the first inning and 5 more in the third inning, bringing his total to 12 runs, the most he allowed in a single start, while only retiring 10 hitters (4 strikeouts). It was also the most earned runs allowed by a Yankees pitcher since 1923.Maybe The Yankees Should Not Allow Masahiro Tanaka To Face The Red Sox Tanaka allowed one run over five innings in the 2019 ALDS.

Eagles manager Katsuya Nomura also often refers to Tanaka as \\"MƒÅ-kun\\" in interviews.

Personal life Tanaka's practice gloves reflect five signature colors of Momoiro Clover Z members. Tanaka has stated that he is an avid fan of Momoiro Clover Z, a popular female idol group in Japan. He has attended the group's concerts multiple times. When practicing he wears custom- made multicolored gloves in the five Momoiro Clover Z member colors (pictured) and he plays official games in gloves embroidered with a clover leaf. When his baseball team presented its fan club members with \\"cheering goods\\", the towel saying \\"Tanaka\\" used the same five colors. During the game in which he set a new Japanese professional baseball record of 16 consecutive victories in one season, cheer banners of the same color scheme were distributed among the spectators. He has used the group's songs as his \\"warm-up song\\" (music that is played at a baseball game when a pitcher appears on the field and does his warm-up routine). After he joined Yankees, his warm-up song at home games is \\"My Dear Fellow\\" by Momoiro Clover Z.

The trail ends at the Hance Rapids on the Colorado River. It is approximately 6.5 hiking miles and a 4400' descent from the South Rim main road at ~7040' to the Colorado River at ~2600' elevation. This trail has become used more in recent years. It is no longer only marked by the occasional cairn. While it remains a very rugged trail, the New Hance is now a real single track trail that is very distinct and relatively straightforward to follow the entire way from the South Rim Drive down to the river. Well-engineered switchbacks and other trail maintenance indicate that significant work, however irregularly, has been done on the trail over the years since John Hance first created the trail in the 1890s. The top one mile is the steepest and most rugged part of the trail, featuring hard switchbacks down a steep slope and numerous big step downs, two to four feet high, that must be carefully negotiated. Below the top one mile, the big steps become fewer in number and farther apart, and the trail becomes progressively less steep. However, occasional steep stretches and big steps may still be found along the entire length of the trail. There are a couple of isolated spots in the bottom wider areas of Red Canyon where the trail splits into multiple paths but they eventually converge again after a relatively short distance. While rugged and somewhat challenging to navigate, the New Hance Trail does not require specialized technical skills or equipment. It has graduated to a full-fledged \\"hiking trail\\". The trail's ruggedness and remote location has placed it out of reach of most tourists, so the New Hance Trail is almost exclusively used by overnight hikers and the occasional day hiker, typically well trained and properly prepared. There is no reliable source of water between the TH and the Colorado River. The small creeks and springs in the lower portions of Red Canyon may be flowing early in the year. However, the GCNP issues a warning on back country permits noting that the spring water may exceed municipal water standards for arsenic.

Magomadova has been awarded the Order of Lenin for her efforts in spreading secondary education, particularly for young women, in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. Biography Magomadova was born in 1925 in Chechnya. She graduated from High School No. 2 in Grozny, and attended college in Tashkent. After graduation, she worked as a mathematics and physics teacher at a secondary school and served as deputy director of High School No. 31 in Grozny. On 15 August 1959, she opened School No. 15, a boarding school for girls, on Revolution Prospekt in Grozny. At a time when parents were reluctant to allow their daughters to be educated, Magomadova fought to allow parents to send their daughters to her new boarding school. Her first class consisted of 120 girls, mostly daughters of transit workers, and they ranged from grades four through ten. To ensure that her students would receive the best education of the day, Magomadova aggressively recruited the best teachers throughout the Chechen-Ingush ASSR to work at her new boarding school. The fledgling boarding school proved very successful, as within six years education had been expanded from first through tenth grades, and in 1976 classes were set up in a separate boarding school for boys. The educational model of Magomadova's boarding school gained wide acceptance throughout the republic, and more and more parents allowed their children to attend boarding school. Magomadova left her post as boarding school director, to return to teaching - she would again teach math from 1983 to 1996. On July 9, 1960, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet bestowed upon Magomadova the title of \\"Honoured Teacher\\", and two days later awarded her the Order of Lenin for her efforts. Magomadova has also been awarded the Veteran Labour award, and was awarded a pension by the Russian government on 23 August 1998. On 9 October 2003, the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that arsonists had burned down Magomadova's home in Urus-Martan; her husband Yunus, also a recipient of the Veteran Labor award, subsequently died of cardiac arrest because he could not survive the loss. The article also mentioned that Magomadova had trouble getting reconstruction aid from the authorities to build a new home.Profile, novayagazeta.ru; accessed 18 April 2015.

Several locations in the British Isles have been associated with the phrase, including Beggar's Bush Yard in Gravel Lane in London, a place and pub at New Oscott, and a neighborhood and military barracks in Dublin. A Beggar's Bush Fair was held biannually on Enfield Chase for many years; and there have been various other associations.The original 17th-century editions left the title unpunctuated: The Beggars Bush. Beginning in the 18th century, editors added an apostrophe: Beggar's Bush. Modern editors and scholars prefer a more accurate plural form: Beggars' Bush. For a similar case, see The Lovers' Progress. is a Jacobean era stage play, a comedy in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators that is a focus of dispute among scholars and critics. Authorship The authorship and the date of the play have long been debated by commentators.Oliphant, p. 256-65. Critics generally agree that the hands of Fletcher and Philip Massinger are manifest in the text; but they dispute the presence of Francis Beaumont. Cyrus Hoy, in his wide-ranging survey of authorship problems in Fletcher's canon, judged all three dramatists to have contributed to the play, and produced this breakdown among them: :Beaumont -- Act II; Act V, scenes 1 and 2b (from Hubert's entrance to end); :Fletcher -- Acts III and IV; :Massinger -- Act I; Act V, scene 2a (to Hubert's entrance). Yet John H. Dorenkamp, in his 1967 edition of the play, rejects Beaumont's presence and attributes Acts I, II, and V to Massinger. (Dorenkamp agrees with Hoy and earlier critics in assigning Acts III and IV to Fletcher; Fletcher's distinctive pattern of stylistic and textual preferences makes his contribution easy to recognize.)Logan and Smith, pp. 34, 75. The question of Beaumont's possible authorial contribution complicates the question of the play's date. Beggars' Bush enters the historical record when it was performed for the Court at Whitehall Palace by the King's Men in the Christmas season of 1622 (on the evening of 27 December, \\"St. John's Day at night\\"). Some commentators argue that the play was probably new and current in that year, and was likely written shortly before -- which would eliminate Beaumont, who had died in 1616. Scholars who favor Beaumont's presence must date the play prior to 1616, though evidence for such an early date is lacking. The picture is also clouded by the question of the nature of Massinger's contribution; some critics have seen him as a direct collaborator with Fletcher, others merely as the reviser of an earlier Beaumont and Fletcher play.Logan and Smith, pp. 75-6. The text does show some of the discontinuities that can frequently be found in revised plays.For examples, see The Queen of Corinth and The Night Walker. (In the opening scene, for example, the usurper Woolfort calls Florez by his pseudonym Goswin, something he should not know.) Publication Beggars' Bush received its initial publication in the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647. The play was published in an individual quarto edition by Humphrey Robinson and Anne MoseleyAnne Moseley was the widow of Humphrey Moseley, who died that year, 1661; Moseley and Robinson were the publishers of the 1647 folio. in 1661; the play was included in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679 and subsequent editions of their works. It also exists in a 17th-century manuscript in the Lambarde MS. collection (Folger Shakespeare Library, MS. 1487.2), in the hand of Edward Knight, the \\"book-keeper\\" or prompter of the King's Men. After 1642 After the closure of the London theatres in 1642, at the start of the English Civil War, a droll known as The Lame Commonwealth was formed from material extracted from Beggars' Bush. The droll features additional dialogue strongly suggesting it was taken from a performance text. The Lame Commonwealth was printed in Francis Kirkman's The Wits, or Sport Upon Sport (1662), a collection of twenty-seven drolls. Beggars' Bush was revived and adapted during the Restoration era. Samuel Pepys saw an early production at Gibbon's Tennis Court on 20 November 1660. In a 3 January 1661 performance of the play, Pepys, for the first time in his life, saw women appear onstage. One popular adaptation titled The Royal Merchant was published, probably in 1706 (the quarto is undated). This was later adapted into an opera, which was published in 1768. Another adaptation, called The Merchant of Bruges, was printed in 1816, 1824, and 1834.Potter, p. 5. And John Dryden modeled the main plot of his Marriage √† la mode (1672) on Beggars' Bush. Plot The play is one of several works of English Renaissance drama that present a lighthearted, romanticized, Robin-Hood-like view of the world of beggars, thieves, and gypsies; in this respect it can be classed with plays of its own era like The Spanish Gypsy, Massinger's The Guardian, Suckling's The Goblins, and Brome's A Jovial Crew, as well as a group of earlier works, like the Robin Hood plays of Anthony Munday. Although the timeframe is inconsistent, Beggars' Bush is set seven years after a fictional war between Flanders and Brabant. The victorious Flemish general Woolfort has usurped the throne of Flanders. The rightful royal family, including Gerrard and his daughter Jaculin, have fled, their current whereabouts unknown. Gerrard has adopted a masquerade as Claus, who is elected king of the beggars. Other characters also maintain disguises and have hidden identities, including the missing daughter of the Duke of Brabant. The play's plot shows the working-out of these complexities and the restoration of the rightful rulers; true lovers are also re-united. Yet the play also contains serious aspects that have caused it to be classified as a tragicomedy by some commentators; \\"Through mixed modes Beggars Bush exhibits serious sociopolitical concerns to earn a classification that at first seems incongruous -- a political tragicomedy.\\"Clark, p. 116. (The character of Clause, the King of the Beggars, also appears as a character in later works, such as the memoirs of Bampfylde Moore Carew, the self-proclaimed King of the Beggars.)

Fauntleroy and produced by Steven Seagal, who also stars in the lead role. Eddie Griffin and Carmen Serano co-star. The film was released direct-to-DVD in the United States on November 13, 2007. Plot In Los Angeles, two rival gangs war with each other: the Hyde Park Gang, led by El Chivo, and the East Side Gangsters, led by Armand Tucker. Vice cop Max Ballister receives a call he assumes to be from his informant, Gary Morrison. Max leaves a romantic dinner with his wife and is gunned down. Max's angry father, Simon, a martial arts expert who is implied to be ex-CIA, moves to the neighborhood in which Max died and begins investigating. His landlady, Alice Park, who also runs a liquor store, aids him. The others do not know that the investigating cop, Frank Shaw, has formed a partnership with Tucker. As Simon investigates, he leaves a trail of beaten and dead gangsters. Gary gives Simon a lead on El Chivo, who runs most of the booking joints that Max went after. At his private club, El Chivo suggests that Tucker ordered the hit on Max. A pair of East Side Gangsters chase Simon via car, and Simon causes them to crash. One gangster dies, and Simon interrogates the other, Gary's brother Isaiah Morrison, who says Tucker sent them. Isaiah talks to Tucker, and Tucker threatens to kill everyone Isaiah cares about unless he kills Simon. The next morning, Simon saves Gary from a group of racists. Simon asks him if Isaiah was Max's killer, but Gary does not respond. As Gary leaves, Simon plants a tracking device on him. Simon tracks Gary to a warehouse and uses electronic equipment to eavesdrop on his conversation, a meeting between the gangs. After Simon plants more tracking devices, he hears Shaw and a sudden burst of gunfire. When it is over, Chivo's gang is dead at the hands of dirty cops in the employ of Shaw; Tucker and Shaw take the drugs and money. Simon tracks them to another warehouse, breaks in, and finds their cocaine. Tucker's men follow Simon back to Park's liquor store, where Simon has an apartment. Using his tracking device, Simon notices they are outside and tells Alice to hide. When they break in, Simon kills them and escorts Alice outside past more gangsters, whom he kills. Tucker shoots Simon and escapes, and Alice takes Simon to her cousin, Winston, who works at USC Medical center. The next day, Simon goes to Isaiah's and Gary's house, beats Isaiah up, and finds the murder weapon. When Gary returns home, Simon forces him to admit that Shaw is behind everything, including Max's murder. Gary explains that he was afraid to talk and that Shaw killed Max because he witnessed a deal between Shaw and Tucker. Later that night, Shaw and Tucker meet with a drug dealer from New York at a warehouse. As Simon arrives and begins killing gangsters, Shaw kills the New York drug dealer. After killing all of Tucker's and Shaw's men, Simon confronts Shaw. As Simon chokes Shaw to death, Tucker walks in with a gun and watches despite Shaw's orders to open fire. Simon then disarms Tucker and turns the gun on him, but he lets Tucker go, saying that he has no beef with him. Simon hands back the gun and leaves, earning Tucker's respect with his cool demeanor.

It is a major tributary of the Pineios. The river begins at the western slopes of Mount Olympus and flows southwest, then south. It leaves the mountains near the village Sykia, and turns east near the village Vlachogianni. It passes along the town Tyrnavos and flows into the Pineios near the village Rodia. The confluence is at 65 m above sea level. Its total length is 70 km, and for most of its length it contains water throughout the year. The vegetation along the river is characterised by reeds, mainly the Phragmites australis, and by wetland forest with trees like plane trees, willows and poplars. According to the classification system of wetland types of the Ramsar Convention adopted in 1999, the Titarisios river falls into the category of inland wetlands. The river is currently primarily used for irrigation, although this has been declining recently. Major construction projects have caused drastic changes to the wetlands. The wetlands of the Titarisios are threatened by uncontrolled waste disposal, for instance near the villages Rodia, Vryotopos and Deleria. Around 3 km from Argyroupoli is Lake Mati Tyrnavou. Mati is today the only natural lake in Thessaly and although it has only a small area (25 ha) it is the core of an ecosystem with rich flora and fauna. Plants Several types of vegetation are found along the river Titarisios: *reed vegetation, e.g. Arundo donax (giant cane) and Phragmites australis (common reed) *halophytic and hemihalophytic vegetation, e.g. Juncus maritimus (sea rush), Salicornia herbacea (glasswort) and Chenopodium bonus-henricus (Good King Henry) *dune vegetation, e.g. Salsola kali (prickly saltwort), Amaranthus retroflexus (redroot pigweed) and Portulaca oleracea (purslane) *wetland forest vegetation, e.g. Populus nigra (black poplar), Platanus orientalis (oriental plane), Populus alba (silver poplar), Ulmus minor (elm) and Salix alba (white willow) *wet meadow vegetation, e.g. Mentha longifolia (horse mint) and various species of Trifolium (clover) *garrigue vegetation, represented by various species of Euphorbia (spurge) Fish Specific studies of the fish in the Titarisios river have not been done, but 37 species of fish have been reported, and another 11 species are presumed present. Due to its connection to sea via the Pineios, the Titarisios also contains migratory fish like the Acipenser sturio (European sea sturgeon) and Alosa fallax (twait shad). Also the Nemacheilus barbatulus (stone loach) and the Sabanejewia aurata balcanica (golden loach) have been found.

His best known book, Why Russia is not America, sets forth his climate-based theory of Russian economic problems. He also wrote Why America is Attacking, arguing that military control over oil-producing countries is essential for the survival of the American economy. Parshev graduated from the Bauman Moscow State Technical University in electrical engineering in 1978. He subsequently worked as engineer and lecturer in the border guards detachment of the KGB, now known as Border Guard Service of Russia and rose to the rank of colonel. Political and economic views Parshev is known for arguing that an economic system based on liberal capitalism is unsuited for Russia because, as he claims, the harsh Russian climate makes the Russian economy inherently uncompetitive with other nations (e.g. with low temperatures high heating costs requiring higher salaries for workers and more expensive construction methods). Parshev argues for the scaling down of Russian foreign trade, greater self-sufficiency and autarky, and for a return to more Soviet-style forms of management in economy and politics.

A Republican during Reconstruction, he was elected to the Louisiana State Senate, serving from 1874 to 1878. Biography Blackburn was born on the Fourche de Mau in Randolph County in northeastern Arkansas. He received his early education from his mother. In 1839, he moved to Batesville to learn his printing trade. He resided in Little Rock in 1845, in Fort Smith in western Arkansas in 1846, and moved to Minden, the seat of Webster Parish, in 1849. There he established the first of several subsequent newspapers to use the name Minden Herald, eventually known as the Minden Press-Herald in the 20th century. As a Democrat, Blackburn was elected mayor of Minden, then part of Claiborne Parish, and served a single twelve-month term from May 1855 to May 1856. Blackburn was opposed to slavery and supported the Union during the American Civil War. He left Minden in the late 1850s and settled in nearby Homer the seat of government of Claiborne Parish. There he published the Homer Iliad beginning in 1859. He rejected the growing strength of the Know Nothing Party in Louisiana and shifted to the regionally unpopular Republican Party during the war.John A. Agan, Minden Press-Herald, date missing, c. 2008 Blackburn worked openly against the Confederate States of America. He was tried in Confederate District Court in Shreveport on charges of having produced counterfeit Confederate currency. He narrowly escaped conviction by the jury, in a reported vote of 11-1. Had the verdict been unanimous of his guilt, Blackburn would have been executed. According to the official Minden city historian, John Agan, a faculty member at Bossier Parish Community College in Bossier City, Blackburn had made anti-Semitic remarks in print about a Jewish district judge. Apparently, the judge worked frantically to have Blackburn hanged. Some of Blackburn‚Äôs friends, however, intervened. He was spared conviction by one vote and thereafter granted a pardon. On his return to Homer, Blackburn continued publishing the Homer Iliad and dabbled in politics. In 1867, Blackburn was elected as a member of the Louisiana Constitutional Convention. He was appointed as the administrative judge of Claiborne Parish, a position which no longer exists. On the readmission of Louisiana to the Union, Blackburn was elected as a Republican to the Fortieth Congress, served less than one calendar year, and did not seek renomination in 1868. Instead he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. He lost to the African American Oscar Dunn, who was elected to the second position on the Henry Clay Warmoth ticket. After a four- year stint in the Louisiana Senate, Blackburn returned in 1880 to Little Rock, Arkansas, where he published the Arkansas Republican from 1881 to 1884 and The Free South from 1885 to 1892. He died in Little Rock and is interred there in Mount Holly Cemetery.

Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous, while the Saxon Army maintained a lesser degree of autonomy. The armies of the other German states were integrated into the Prussian Army with limited autonomy. The division was formed on November 27, 1815, as the Infantry Division of the Munich General Command (Infanterie-Division des Generalkommandos M√ºnchen.).G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939.

It was called the 1st Infantry Division from 1848 to 1851 (as well as during wartime) and was named the Munich General Command from 1859 to 1869. From April 1, 1872, until mobilization for World War I, it was the 1st Division. Within Bavaria, it was not generally referred to as a \\"Royal Bavarian\\" division, but outside Bavaria, this designation was used for it, and other Bavarian units, to distinguish them from similarly numbered Prussian units. The division was headquartered in Munich from 1815 to 1919. The division was part of the 1st Royal Bavarian Army Corps. The division fought against Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the division fought alongside the Prussians. It saw action in battles of W√∂rth, Beaumont, and Sedan, the 1st and 2nd battles of Orleans, the battle of Loigny- Poupry, and the siege of Paris.Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935) During World War I, the division served on the Western Front. It fought in the Battle of the Frontiers against French forces in the early stages, and then participated in the Race to the Sea. Thereafter, it remained on the northern part of the front facing the British Army through 1915 and early 1916. The Infantry Life Regiment was transferred from the division in 1915 to become part of a provisional German mountain division, the Alpenkorps, sent to the Italian Front. In 1916, the division went into the Battle of Verdun. After Verdun, it went to the Somme in that battle's later stages. 1917 was spent mainly occupying the trench lines. In 1918, the division participated in the Spring Offensive.

He then attended Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont. Start of career At age 21, Tupper joined the United States Border Patrol, completed training in El Paso, Texas, and carried out assignments on both the Mexican and Canadian borders. Tupper joined the United States Navy for World War II; he served from September 1944 to March 1946, and was discharged as a Petty Officer Third Class. He remained with the Border Patrol until resigning in 1948, when he returned to Maine and began to study law with his father while also taking law school courses through LaSalle Extension University of Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from LaSalle University in 1948, was admitted to the bar in 1949, and began to practice in Boothbay Harbor. Tupper also began to serve in local government; he was elected to the Boothbay Harbor board of selectmen in 1948, and was selected to serve as chairman in 1949. As a selectman, he took a lead role in creating the town's police department, and his other initiatives included adopting the secret ballot for election of town officials, competitive bidding for town equipment and services, and the town manager form of government. A Republican, Tupper served as member of the Maine House of Representatives from 1953 to 1954, as assistant state attorney general from 1959 to 1960, and as commissioner of the state Department of Sea and Shore Fisheries from 1953 to 1957. Congressman Tupper was elected as a Republican to the Eighty-seventh and the two succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1961 ‚Äì January 3, 1967). Tupper was one of two Republicans to co-sponsor Medicare, and his Congressional career was also notable for his support of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965. In 1966, along with three Republican Senators and four other Republican Representatives, Tupper signed a telegram sent to Georgia Governor Carl E. Sanders regarding the Georgia legislature's refusal to seat the recently elected Julian Bond in the Georgia House of Representatives. This refusal, said the telegram, was \\"a dangerous attack on representative government. None of us agree with Mr. Bond's views on the Vietnam War; in fact we strongly repudiate these views. But unless otherwise determined by a court of law, which the Georgia Legislature is not, he is entitled to express them.\\" Cited in African American Involvement in the Vietnam War Later career Tupper was not a candidate for reelection to the Ninetieth Congress in 1966. He was appointed United States Commissioner General to the Canadian World Exhibition of 1967. He resumed the practice of law in 1968. In 1969, Tupper was appointed president of the States‚Äô Urban Action Center, a non-profit entity created by Nelson Rockefeller to aid state governors with identifying problems unique to cities and crafting solutions. From 1969 to 1972, Tupper practiced law in Washington, DC as a partner in the firm now known as Rogers & Wells. In 1972, he returned to Boothbay Harbor and continued to practice law. In 1975, he declined a position as an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the administration of Gerald Ford. From 1975 to 1976, Tupper was United States Commissioner on the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. Career as author Tupper was the co-author of One Continent-Two Voices, a book on Canadian-American relations. He also authored a set of memoirs based on the notable individuals he met during his life, which was titled Recollections.

As colonel, he commanded the 11th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. After the war, he served as Maine Attorney General, a U.S. Congressman, and the 38th Governor of Maine. Plaisted was born and raised in Jefferson, New Hampshire. He graduated from Waterville College (1853) and Albany Law School (1855), and practiced law in Bangor. In 1861, he was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Union Army and named second in command of the 11th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. In 1862 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as the regimental commander. He took part in numerous engagements in South Carolina and Virginia, including the Siege of Petersburg. In February 1865 he was appointed brevet brigadier general of volunteers and in 1867 was appointed brevet major general of volunteers for gallant and meritorious services during the war. After the war, Plaisted resumed practicing law and became involved in politics as a Republican. He served as a member of the Maine House of Representatives in 1867-1868, and was a delegate to the 1868 Republican National Convention. In 1873 he was chosen by the state legislature to serve as Maine Attorney General, and he was reappointed in 1874 and 1875. In December 1875 he resigned as Attorney General in order to take the U.S. House seat for which he had been selected in a special election the previous September. He completed the term of his predecessor, which ended in March 1877, but was not a candidate for a full term. In 1878, Plaisted left the Republicans over dissatisfaction with their monetary policy, and became a member of the Greenback Party. In 1880, he was elected governor as the fusion candidate of the Greenbacks and the Democrats, and he served from 1881 to 1883. Plaisted died in Bangor in 1898, and was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor. Early life Plaisted was born and raised in Jefferson, New Hampshire, the son of Deacon William and Nancy (Merrill) Plaisted. He attended the local schools, and attended an academy in Lancaster, New Hampshire, St. Johnsbury Academy, and the New Hampton School. He graduated from Waterville College in 1853, and in 1855 Plaisted received his LL.B. degree from Albany Law School with several honors and awards, including a gold medal for an essay on the topic of equity jurisprudence. Plaisted spent a year teaching school while studying for the bar exam in the office of Bangor, Maine attorney Albert W. Paine, attained admission to the bar in 1856, and commenced practice in Bangor. From 1858 to 1860 he served on the military staff of Governor Lot M. Morrill as an aide-de-camp with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Civil War service Following the outbreak of the Civil War, Plaisted enlisted in the Union Army and was commissioned as the lieutenant colonel of the 11th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on October 30, 1861. He was promoted to colonel on May 12, 1862, and led the regiment in several campaigns in the Eastern Theater. He commanded during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign and participated in the Siege of Yorktown and the subsequent Battle of Williamsburg. Later in the campaign, he fought at the Battle of Seven Pines and in the Seven Days Battles. In 1863, he and his men were involved in the Siege of Charleston. Plaisted advanced to command of a brigade which included the 11th Maine, 10th Connecticut, 24th Massachusetts, 100th New York, and 206th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiments. In 1864, he participated in the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. On February 22, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Plaisted for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from February 21, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 3, 1865. On February 28, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Plaisted for appointment to the grade of brevet major general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 2, 1867.Eicher, 2001, p. 714. Continued career Following the war, Plaisted resumed practicing law in Bangor. He was elected to the Maine House of Representatives as a Republican, and served from 1867 to 1868. He was also a delegate to the 1868 Republican National Convention, and supported Ulysses S. Grant for the presidential nomination. In January 1873, Plaisted was chosen by the state legislature to serve as Maine Attorney General, and he was reappointed in 1874 and 1875. During his tenure, Plaisted tried 14 capital cases, all of which resulted in convictions, and all of which were sustained on appeal. In September 1875, Plaisted was chosen in a special election to serve in the Forty-fourth United States Congress, filling the vacancy caused by the death of Congressman Samuel F. Hersey. He served in the US House from September 13, 1875, to March 3, 1877, and resigned as Attorney General in December 1875 in order to attend the session of Congress that started later that month. He did not run for renomination in 1876, accepting the decision of a Republican district convention that voted to maintain an informal rotation system which mandated the selection of a nominee from Aroostook County. During Plaisted's tenure in the US House, his time and effort was concentrated on his service as a member of the committee that investigated the Whiskey Ring, a major scandal that came to light during the Grant administration. After concluding his Congressional term, Plaisted resumed practicing law in Bangor. In partnership with attorney Frederick H. Appleton, he compiled and published The Maine Digest, a collection of Maine Supreme Judicial Court decisions from 1820 to 1879. In addition, he published accounts of two cases he handled as Attorney General, The Lowell Trial and The Wagner Trial. He also researched and compiled a genealogical and biographical history of the Plaisted family. Governor In 1878, events including wage cuts that precipitated the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 caused Plaisted to leave the Republican Party because of dissatisfaction with their monetary policy. As did many farmers and laborers, Plaisted opposed currency backed by gold and silver, arguing that it caused the post-Panic of 1873 deflation that reduced wages and prices paid to farmers, laborers, and producers of raw materials. Instead, he favored federal government-issued currency not backed by gold and silver, believing that this would prevent deflation and make business easier to transact by holding costs and salaries steady. Both the national Republican and Democratic parties favored specie-backed currency issued by state-chartered banks. As a result of his unhappiness with the Republicans, Plaisted joined the new Greenback Party, and became their candidate for governor in 1880. He was also backed by pro- Greenback Democrats, and became the fusion candidate of both parties. Taking advantage of voter unhappiness caused by the lingering effects of the 1873 economic downturn, Plaisted prevailed over incumbent Republican Daniel F. Davis by fewer than 200 votes, becoming one of only four non-Republicans to hold the governorship between the founding of the party in the 1850s and the Great Depression in 1929. Plaisted served from 1881 to 1883, and was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1883. During Plaisted's term, the state legislature remained solidly Republican. As a result, legislators were able to block many of Plaisted's appointments, and he vetoed a much higher than normal number of bills, including 31 vetoes of measures to re-charter banks that issued specie-backed currency. By 1883, voter concern over the economic downturn that had begun in the 1870s had largely abated, and Plaisted was defeated for reelection by Republican Frederick Robie. Later life and death From 1884 to 1898 Plaisted was editor and publisher of the New Age, a newspaper in Augusta. He used its editorial pages to convey his political views, and engaged in long-running debates with Republicans over their monetary policy, primarily Maine party leader James G. Blaine. In his later years, Plaisted suffered from Bright's disease. He died in Bangor on January 31, 1898, and was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor. Family Plaisted was a member of a family long active in New Hampshire politics and government. His grandfather Samuel Plaisted was a judge during the early years of New Hampshire's statehood. Another ancestor, John Plaisted, was a member of the colonial legislature and a judge during the late 1600s and early 1700s. Harris Plaisted was one of nine brothers and sisters. Among his siblings was William, who served in the Maine State Senate, and Charles, who served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. In 1858, Plaisted married Sarah J. Mason. She died in 1875, and in 1881 he married Mabel True Hill. With his first wife, Plaisted was the father of three children, including Frederick W. Plaisted, who served as governor from 1911 to 1912.

Graduate program The School of Education and Social Policy offers five graduate degree options: =Master of Arts in Learning Sciences (LSMA)= The Master of Arts in Learning Sciences program is a full-time, 11-month course of study that prepares researchers, developers and practitioners to advance the scientific understanding and practice of teaching and learning.http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/learning-sciences/masters/index.html The masters' program focuses on learning from three interacting perspectives, namely, cognition, design and social context. While some aspects of the program are fixed (e.g., required courses), there is flexibility to allow students to tailor their courses and project work to suit their own particular interests. As the program progresses, students are given increasing options for electives, and they join research teams composed of faculty and PhD students, allowing for in-depth research experience. =Master of Science in Education (MSEd) Program= The Master of Science in Education program is a teacher preparation program. The MSEd program prepares professionals who are dedicated to and skilled at helping individuals of all ages improve themselves through education in the contexts of school, family, community and work. Students in the MSEd program pursue one of four concentrations:http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/msed/ * Elementary Teaching * Secondary Teaching * Advanced Teaching * Higher Education Administration and Policy There are 15 courses required to complete the program. Students can choose to take courses full- or part-time, and students typically finish the program in one to two years. Students are required to complete a Master's Project as part of the program. For the Master's Project, students explore personal questions of interest and concern. =Master of Science in Learning and Organizational Change (MSLOC)= The Master of Science in Learning and Organizational Change (MSLOC) program at Northwestern University is designed to strengthen the ability of working professionals to use people management and learning practices to lead strategic and sustainable organizational change.http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/msloc/ The program focuses on issues that traditionally fall into categories such as change management, organizational development, knowledge management, leadership development and organizational learning. =Doctor of Philosophy in Learning Sciences (LS PhD)= In 1991, Northwestern initiated the first learning sciences doctoral program in the world, designed by and launched by Roy Pea as its first director. The program began accepting students in 1992. The Learning Sciences PhD program is a research-focused program leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree. The program is designed to prepare researchers, developers and practitioners qualified to advance the scientific understanding and practice of teaching and learning. The goal of research and development efforts of the Learning Sciences is to develop pedagogical, technological and social policy innovations aimed at improving education. In addition to studying innovation, course work and research, both the PhD and MA Learning Sciences programs emphasize design as well as implementation of learning environments with a reform agenda.http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/learning- sciences/phd/index.html =Doctor of Philosophy in Human Development and Social Policy (HDSP PhD)= The Human Development and Social Policy (HDSP) doctoral program, founded in 1981 under the leadership of Dr. Bernice Neugarten, prepares students to conduct research to understand and to address human problems that pose challenges to society in the new century. The aim the program is to improve human lives by examining and understanding how policies affect the lives of people, and how people can analyze and affect policy. The program covers interdisciplinary understanding of how people develop, how various experiences and contexts affect human lives, the underlying logic of program design and evaluation, and the ways in which political agendas are set and how political forces distribute opportunities in a democracy.http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/hdsp/ Special programs In addition to the undergraduate and graduate programs, SESP also offers two specialized programs: =Alternative certification (NU-TEACH)= NU-TEACH is an alternative teacher certification program, provided in collaboration with the Inner-City Teaching Corps (ICTC), the Chicago Teaching Fellows, and Chicago Public Schools. Those who enroll in the program engage in a summer of course work at Northwestern as well as supervised student teaching in Chicago schools. After formal course work, students move to their own classrooms for a year under the mentorship of a master teacher. Successful completion of the year results in an initial alternative certificate, permitting participants to teach in Chicago for four years before applying for a standard certificate.http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/nuteach/ NU-TEACH started in summer 1998 with 30 interns, and the program has grown each year, placing dozens of teachers in Chicago elementary, middle and high schools. =Multidisciplinary Program in Education Sciences (MPES)= The Multidisciplinary Program in Education Sciences is an interdisciplinary doctoral training program that develops scholars trained to conduct relevant and reliable research on pressing policy and practice issues in education. The program integrates training in statistics, evaluation, cognition and learning, and education policy. Program hallmarks are interdisciplinary teaching and mentoring of fellows by core and affiliated Northwestern faculty engaged in education-focused research. Successful graduates of the program receive a Certificate in Education Sciences in addition to a doctorate in their discipline.http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/mpes/ Affiliated projects and centers * ABCD Institute * Center for Connected Learning * Center for Curriculum Materials in Science * Center for Learning and Organizational Change * Center for Talent Development * Foley Center * Institute for Policy Research Rankings The graduate school at SESP consistently ranks among the top graduate schools of education nationally.

Life and career Pinckney was born near Hempstead, Texas in what was then part of Grimes County (today Waller County), he was raised on his family's farm near Fields Store. His father, Thomas Shubrick Pinckney, was crippled in a farming accident, leaving the young John to take on most of the work on the farm. His mother, Carolene (n√©e Finney), died in 1861, leaving him the sole provider for his father and three siblings. None the less, Pinckney enlisted in Confederate States Army at age 16 and was attached with the 4th Texas Infantry in General John Bell Hood's Texas Brigade. After the end of the Civil War, he returned home and worked as a cotton weigher. After being elected a justice of the peace, Pinckney decided to study law and was admitted to the bar in 1875, starting a practice in Hempstead. He was appointed district attorney for the twenty-third judicial district in 1890 which he served as for ten years until he was elected county judge of Waller County in 1900. Pinckney was then elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat in a special election following the resignation of Thomas H. Ball in 1903. He was reelected to a full term in the House in 1904 and would serve in Congress until his death. Death On April 24, 1905, a crowd of concerned citizens gathered in front of Waller County Courthouse in Hempstead to discuss a petition by the Prohibition League to Governor S. W. T. Lanham. The petition requested that Governor Lanham dispatch the Texas Rangers to enforce local prohibition ordinances, allowed under the state's local option law, due to insufficient enforcement by police and sheriffs. Tensions were high between \\"wets\\" (against prohibition) and \\"drys\\" (for prohibition) and supporters of both sides turned out for the gathering. Pinckney, who favored the petition, was first to speak and was routinely shouted down by opponents. Then J. N. Brown, a local lawyer and \\"wet\\" who was one of the people shouting at the congressman, pulled a pistol and began firing, as did his son Roland, and \\"drys\\" who were armed began firing back. Pinckney attempted to intervene to end the fight, but was shot in the back and killed when his brother Tom attempted to pull John away and protect him. Also killed were Tom Pinckney, J. N. Brown, and John Mills, a leader of the Prohibition League who succumbed to his wounds the next day. Pinckney's private secretary \\"Doc\\" Tompkins and Roland Brown were also shot, but survived. The entire gunfight lasted about thirty seconds and more than 75 bullets were found in the wall of the courthouse. Both John and Tom Pinckney were buried at Hempstead City Cemetery. Roland Brown was tried as an accomplice to the murders, but was acquitted when it was concluded that he had only taken out his pistol to protect his father. * * See also *List of United States Congress members who died in office (1900‚Äì49) *United States members of Congress wounded or killed in office References Sources * John McPherson Pinckney, late a representative from Texas, Memorial addresses delivered in the House of Representatives and Senate frontispiece 1907 External links * Category:1845 births Category:1905 deaths Category:American justices of the peace Category:Assassinated American politicians Category:Confederate States Army officers Category:County district attorneys in Texas Category:County judges in Texas Category:Deaths by firearm in Texas Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Texas Category:Murdered American military personnel Category:Murdered lawyers Category:People from Grimes County, Texas Category:People from Waller County, Texas Category:People murdered in Texas Category:People of Texas in the American Civil War Category:Texas Brigade Category:Texas Democrats Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"John M.

Math problem Clock angle problems relate two different measurements: angles and time. The angle is typically measured in degrees from the mark of number 12 clockwise. The time is usually based on a 12-hour clock. A method to solve such problems is to consider the rate of change of the angle in degrees per minute.

Biography  G√ºnther Uecker, portrait by Lothar Wolleh Uecker was born in Wendorf, Mecklenburg.Biography at Deutscher Bundestag.de Uecker began his artistic education in 1949 when he took up studies at Wismar. He then went to the art school in Berlin-Wei√üensee and in 1955 to D√ºsseldorf, where he studied under Otto Pankok at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. In 1956 he began using nails in his art. Uecker met the group ZERO with Heinz Mack and Otto Piene in 1960, artists who propagated a new beginning of art in opposition to the German Informel. He occupied himself with the medium of light, studied optical phenomena, series of structures and the realms of oscillation that actively integrate the viewer and enable him to influence the visual process by kinetic or manual interference. Uecker, Mack and Piene began working together in joint studios at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 1962 and installed a 'Salon de Lumi√®re' at the Palais des Beaux- Arts in Paris. Other 'light salons' followed in Krefeld and in Frankfurt. Since 1966, after the group ZERO dissolved and a last joint exhibition, Uecker increasingly used nails as an artistic means of expression‚Äîa material that, until today, stands in the centre of his oeuvre. At the beginning of the 1960s he began hammering nails into pieces of furniture, musical instruments and household objects, and then he began combining nails with the theme of light, creating his series of light nails and kinetic nails and other works. a-x Zero Garden from 1966, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, demonstrates his use of nails to create the illusion of movement. Light and electricity continued to be one of the main subjects and natural materials such as sand and water were included in his installations, resulting in an interaction of the different elements to create a sensation of light, space, movement and time. Uecker's oeuvre includes painting, object art, installations as well as stage designs and films. His origins explain his interest in the eastern European avant-garde of the 1920s and 1930s, but he is likewise interested in Asian cultures and their ideas. His works can be seen in collections and large fairs in the West as well as the East. Uecker's artistic creativity reaches a climax in 2000 in the prayer room he designs for the rebuilt Reichstag building in Berlin. Uecker taught from 1974 until 1995 at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf and was promoted to professor in 1976. Halina Jaworski was his first master student (Meistersch√ºlerin). With Otto Piene, Heinz Mack and Mattijs Visser he founded in 2008 the international ZERO foundation. The foundation has the complete ZERO archives from three D√ºsseldorfer artists as well as documents and photos from other related artists. Exhibitions In addition to numerous Gruppo Zero exhibitions, Uecker has participated in many other exhibitions, including documenta 4, Kassel, Germany (1968), the Venice Biennale (1970), and numerous solos shows, including one at the Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf (1983), a retrospective at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, Munich (1990), and another solo show at the Ulmer Museum, Ulm, Germany (2010).G√ºnther Uecker Solomon R.

The fighting was between ISAF and Afghan forces on one side and Taliban forces on the other, for the control of the Chora District centre, regarded by the Taliban as a tactical target because it provides ground access from unsecured Gizab district in the north to the provincial capital of Tarin Kowt. According to some press reports, the fighting was the largest Taliban offensive of 2007 in Afghanistan, and resulted in the death of one American, two Dutch and 16 Afghan soldiers, as well as approximately 58 civilians and 71 Taliban fighters. Prelude Oruzgan province, along with neighboring Kandahar and Helmand provinces in southern Afghanistan, is part of the Taliban's traditional Pashtun tribal stronghold. In Oruzgan, NATO's ISAF mission took over authority for Afghanistan from the US-led coalition in August 2006, resulting in 1,400 Dutch soldiers replacing some 150 US troops at the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Oruzgan's provincial capital, Tarin Kowt, and other bases. In addition to co-located Afghan battalions, there was an Australian element under Dutch command and contributions from other NATO allies. Oruzgan is 2/3 the size of the Netherlands, but the Dutch presence has been challenged with providing security to areas it patrols regularly. When faced with the security challenge, the Dutch reverted to an \\"inkspot policy\\" whereby they focused their attention only on Oruzgan's three population centres, leaving other areas to Taliban control. Dutch activities included setting up checkpoints, some of which were near the town of Chora. At the time, there were 100 Afghan police in Chora. Dutch troops were working in Chora on projects such as a school, a mosque and a bridge, following up on civilian construction projects initiated by the US. 60 Dutch troops were deployed in Chora. Battle =June 15= On Friday evening June 15 there was some shooting near Chora. In the morning of that day, a Dutch convoy in Tarin Kowt was attacked by a suicide bomber, killing a Dutch soldier, Timo Smeehuijzen and several Afghan civilians. =June 16= A U.S. A-10 Thunderbolt II spotted a group of 60 persons moving toward Chora. Dutch troops at Chora were informed, but the A-10 did not engage the group, due to uncertainty over their identity and intentions. Shortly after, three Afghan police posts (Kala Kala, Nyazi and Sarab), on the road linking Chora to Tarin Kowt came under coordinated attack by a large number of Taliban fighters (the Dutch press claim \\"800\\" men, although this number seems impossibly large and cannot be verified). Dutch troops in Chora moved to support the Kala Kala and Nyazi Afghan police posts. The Taliban captured Sarab police post, killing two brothers of the commander of the post. They also cut off the hands of the wife of a captured policeman who was forced to watch her mutilation before being beheaded himself. That afternoon, the Dutch withdrew from the Kala Kala and Nyazi checkpoints, allowing the Taliban to capture these posts as well. The Dutch troops reassembled near the Chora district building and contacted their commander, Colonel Hans van Griensven in Camp Holland near Tarin Kowt, for instructions. Griensven ordered them to stay and fight. ISAF aircraft provided support and attacked the Taliban, scouts reported that 30 Taliban volunteers led by individuals nicknamed Kaka and Sadam, were gathered inside a farm at the village of Qual Eh-Ye-Ragh. An Apache helicopter fired two Hellfire-missiles at the farm, killing the Taliban and civilians inside. Rozi Khan, a local tribal militia leader with shifting loyalties (who was himself killed during October 2008 fighting in the area), offered 150-200 of his fighters to support the defense of Chora. The Dutch and Chora village leaders accepted Khan's offer reluctantly as the village leaders had to arm Khan's fighters (aware that Khan might later change sides again and turn the weapons on them). A group of Dutch and Australian troops at Camp Holland near Tarin Kowt moved to Chora, commanded by LTC Rob Querido. The Australian troops deployed in Baluchi valley, between Tarin Kowt and Chora, to secure the key road. Also on Saturday June 16 US Staff Sergeant Roy P. Lewsader was killed when his vehicle was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade in Tarin Kowt. =June 17‚Äì18= On Sunday June 17 and Monday June 18 Dutch reinforcements arrived from Kamp Holland and a second Dutch base in Deh Rahwod, increasing the number of Dutch troops at Chora to 500. 50 Afghan Army reinforcements also arrived in Chinook helicopters. Taliban fighters, who had gained control of most of the residential areas, forced civilians to fight with them or face execution. The Taliban also used civilian homes as shelter, but were still attacked by NATO aircraft, causing civilian casualties. As the fighting continued, many Taliban fighters were killed. At one time, six Dutch F-16s were in the air, engaging ground targets assigned by the infantry. On the night of Sunday, June 17 to the morning of Monday, June 18, during the loading of an 81-mm mortar, which was deployed in the courtyard of the Chora district government building, a round exploded inside the launch tube, killing Dutch Sergeant-Major Jos Leunissen and wounding three other Dutch soldiers. =June 19= At 9:30 am, NATO briefly withdrew the aircraft supporting the fighting at Chora, but air support was restored at 9:40 when Col. van Griensven reportedly threatened to withdraw the six Dutch F-16s from NATO command. At 10:00 Dutch and Afghan troops, together with Rozi Khan's militia, made a push called \\"Operation Troy\\", in which they recaptured the three lost checkpoints.

(2003) \\"Bioclasts\\", p. 66 in Encyclopedia of sediments and sedimentary rocks In geology bioclasts are used for such things relative dating purposes can be whole fossils or broken fragments of organisms. Their preponderance can give a rough guide to life diversity in the historic biosphere, but absolute counts much depend on water conditions such as the depth of the deposition, local currents, as well as wave strength in large body of water such as lakes. They can be used to study the age of the formation environment of the rocks that bioclasts finds itself in. one of the major contributions of bioclasts is that they form in regions where organisms lived and eventually died, over time. This is important because with the right conditions (pressure and temperature) there is a high possibility for hydrocarbon potential. This is due to the fact that hydrocarbons will eventually form due to the rich organic matter that has died and enriches the sediments. A vast chunk of the fossil records during the Metazoan era were all bioclasts of Cloudina shells. Cloudina The Cloudina shells make their shell beds when they are filled into depressions that occur between thermobolitic domes and occasionally form in troughs between low amplitude current ripples that occur in grainstone facies. These organisms have the best potential index fossil in the Late Ediacaran era. It has been determined that these organisms used to grow from a basally closed funnel. It would be also possible to see dichotomous branching off their vertical edges. They were once found in areas where the difference in water depths and transport in oceans is the major factors controlling the regions richness in a certain species. The areas of higher richness are found in medium to very fine sand and muddy bottoms with the bioclasts being at the shallowest stations. Studies of bioclasts in the fossil record revealed three main Cloudina morphology types: *In most scenarios, the organisms' basal end has a hemispherical shape but it shows no signs of attachment scars or anchoring and support structures. Basal end can range from 1 to 1.5 mm in diameter and 0.2 to 2 mm in length. *Tubes with a point, closed basal base. The length of this point can range from 0.05 to more than 1 mm. Its maximum diameter lies between 0.25 and 0.3 mm. *The basal element seems to be crushed or flattened. This is somewhat like the point morphology but it is blunter. The maximum diameter of the blunt basal varies from 0.15 to 0.35 mm, while its max length is 0.6 mm. There are some regions in the world where it is capable to actually see shells (bioclasts) of once living organisms within a geological structure called lenticular bedding. These beds are considerably thin, being only a few centimeters thick which are densely packed, poorly sorted. The shells are also randomly oriented and are recrystallized. By these characteristics it shows that the fragments have not been reworked long term, and have instead been reworked shortly after the death of the organism and was eventually deposited close to where they once lived. An area where you are able to see ancient sediments and rocks that have bioclast components dominating their matrix is a valley that once connected the Miocene Sommi√®res Basin in southern France to the Mediterranean Sea. At this location the sediments are made of carbonate grains that have formed in the temperate factories. These grains have a wide variety in composition; they can be barnacles, bryozoans, coralline algae and echinoids among others. When bioclasts are in its rock formation, meaning that they have gone through all the stages that sediments go through to reach its final phase, a whole rock unit, it is accompanied and mixed with variable amount of terrigenous material, glauconite particles and also phosphate grains. Studies done with the help of plane polarized light of several different rock formations showing the kinds of bioclastic mixtures that were found in this basin. In one rock unit there were barnacles, bryozoans, echinoid calcarentite, while in other rocks bryozoan-mollusk calcarenite and coralline algae were found. All of the rocks and bioclasts studied in this region are from the middle to upper Pliocene and have been exposed. These deposits allow the analysis of the architecture and internal complexities of a mixed bioclastic-silicicastic succession in a thrust-belt. Limestone rocks Ooids in thin-section, Carmel Formation, Jurassic of Utah In limestone rocks there are different types of possible bioclasts, depending on the region, time and the climate during the formation stage.Boggs Jr, S. (2012) Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy. New Jersey, Pearson Education, p. 138. . Skeletal fragments: this type of limestone texture can be found as whole micro-fossils, whole large fossils or broken up fragments of larger fossils. This is the most common texture. The kinds of skeletal particles present depend upon the age of the rock and the paleoenvironmental conditions from the time they were deposited. With these different types of fossils, certain ones will be more dominant in a certain rock compared to others. Trilobite skeletal fragments, for example, are a characteristic of early Paleozoic rock units but are not found in Cenozoic rocks, which is dominated by foraminifers. The climates and wave conditions play a role on the formation of skeletal fragments by that organisms like branching forms of bryozoan are fragile and are not found in high wave energy environments. Found in limestone units that have been deposited under quite less active water conditions. Ooids are coated carbonate grains that have some sort of a nucleus-a bioclast (shell fragment) in this case. They form where strong bottom currents and rough water conditions are present and where saturation levels of bicarbonates are high. Mont Saint-Michel sediment Sediments from Mont Saint-Michel region in France are a mixture of heterometric bioclastic debris and shell debris. This material has been reworked over time by the waves and ocean currents from the regions tidal flats. The shells are in the shape of a plate, curved and angular. With these characteristics it is easy for the bioclasts (shells) to be lifted and moved by the flow of the water currents. Joint density is when an object like a rock is being jointed by more matrix components rather than bioclasts, this is higher in rocks with a lower percent of figured grains and lower in rocks with higher amounts of figured grains (bioclasts). In other words, the ratio of bioclast grains influences the joint density. In all the regions that were under study, the joint density decreased while the number of bioclasts increased. This appears to inhibit the formation of joins in all carbonate rock formations.

He was the son of John William Wright Patman, the long-time U.S. Representative who chaired the House Banking Committee and was a self-proclaimed advocate of small business, having co- authored the Robinson-Patman Act. Patman was born in Texarkana, Texas. He attended public schools there and in Washington, D.C. He then attended the now closed Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri, graduating in 1944. He served in the United States Marine Corps as a private first class from 1945 to 1946. He subsequently served in the United States Air Force Reserve as a captain from 1953 to 1966. He was a diplomatic courier for the United States Foreign Service from 1949 to 1950. Patman graduated in 1953 from the University of Texas at Austin. Later that year he was admitted to the Texas bar and served as a legal examiner for the Texas Railroad Commission until 1955. In 1955, Patman commenced the private practice of law. He also served as the city attorney for Ganado, Texas from 1955 to 1960. Political career In 1960, Patman successfully sought the now District 18 seat in the Texas State Senate. He took office the following year and served until 1981. He was a delegate to state Democratic Party conventions during this senatorial tenure. When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Patman was in the fifteenth vehicle of the motorcade.Presidential Motorcade Schematic Listing, November 22, 1963, Dallas, Texas, by Todd Wayne Vaughn, 2003 In 1979, Patman was a member of the Killer Bees,Legislative Reference Library of Texas https://lrl.texas.gov/whatsNew/client/index.cfm/2016/5/26/The-Texas-Killer- Bees the group of twelve quorum-busting Democratic senators that hid out in an Austin garage apartment for 4¬Ω days. In 1980, he was elected to the District 14 seat in the United States House of Representatives, when the short-term incumbent Joseph P. Wyatt, Jr. (born 1941), a former member of Patman's state senatorial staff, did not seek reelection. Patman was re- elected in 1982, when U.S. Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., of Houston led the entire Democratic ticket to its last ever full sweep of Texas statewide offices. In 1984, however, Patman was unseated by Republican Mac Sweeney of Wharton, when Ronald W. Reagan swept Texas in his presidential reelection bid. Though Sweeney was defeated after two terms by a Democrat, the district returned to Republican representation in 1995, with the defection of Representative Greg Laughlin (who defeated Sweeney in 1988) and then the election in 1996 of former Representative Ron Paul, who defeated Laughlin in the Republican primary. After his defeat by Sweeney, Patman did not seek further office and retired to Ganado, located some ninety miles southwest of Houston, where he lived on his ranch called Ganadom. Patman spent his last years in Ganado and at a second house in Austin. He died of stomach cancer at the age of eighty-one at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.Former Congressman and state Sen.

Early life Robert ‚ÄùBob‚Äù Heathcote was born May 27, 1964. He grew up in Westchester, California. His main bass guitar influences were Geddy Lee of Rush and Chris Squire of Yes. One of his first bands was with Suicidal Tendencies drummer Amery Smith and guitarist Rick Battson. In 1984 he traveled with Suicidal Tendencies as their sound engineer. On May 12 he landed his first professional engineering gig at the Grand Olympic Auditorium with Suicidal Tendencies, Red Hot Chili Peppers, SS Decontrol, Minutemen and The Abandoned. That show was Heathcote‚Äôs introduction to the punk scene and sparked his interest in playing in a band again. That concert was to be one of the last Suicidal Tendencies shows before they were banned from playing L.A. (for fan violence) and the beginning of their four year recording hiatus. Frontman singer songwriter Mike Muir invited Heathcote to play bass in Los Cycos a side project he was forming alongside New Regime guitarist Anthony‚ÄúBob‚ÄùGallo which at the time also included longtime friend Amery Smith on drums. After only a few rehearsals drummer Amery Smith and Bob Heathcote left Los Cycos to start a band with ex Suicidal Tendencies guitarist Jon Nelson and Todd Moyer called The Brood which later changed their name to Uncle Slam, resulting in a few demos in 1987. Los Cycos Replaced Heathcote with bassist Louiche Mayorga and Smith with drummer Sal Troy from No Mercy. They added lead guitarist Grant Estes for the Welcome to Venice recording of \\"It's Not Easy\\". Eventually Heathcote started playing in a cover band with future Suicidal guitarist Rocky George and drummer Sterling Roberts and frontman singer Norman Peggie, playing songs by The Scorpions, Judas Priest and Mot√∂rhead. When Heathcote heard Suicidal Tendencies was looking for a guitarist he suggested that Rocky audition for them and a few days later Rocky got the gig. Lucky for Heathcote when Muir was thinking of replacing bassist Louiche Mayorga Rocky returned the favor and suggested Heathcote for the job. Suicidal Tendencies Bob Heathcote joined Suicidal Tendencies in 1988 a year after the release of Suicidal‚Äôs second studio album Join The Army on Frontier Records. Heathcote was in the band from March 1988 to February 1989, he recorded the bass on their third studio album and first Epic Records release How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today, and toured around Europe and the US. Just when the band was getting ready to record their fourth studio album, Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...D√©j√† Vu which was certified Gold by the RIAA. he was unexpectedly asked to leave and was subsequently replaced by future Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo. Leaving behind the music industry in 1992, it was ten years later in 2002 he moved to the San Francisco bay area with his wife and kids and continued to study photography. After leaving Suicidal Tendencies Heathcote seemed to just disappear and some even questioned if he was still alive. Life after Suicidal Tendencies Heathcote played bass in the local Los Angeles hard rock band LongHornz for approximately two years. They played shows in mostly the Los Angeles area, and released some demo tapes during the early 1990s, but never recorded a proper album. Around 1992, the band broke up. Heathcote ceased his professional career after the demise of LongHornz, and has been raising a family of five children, three daughters and two sons, and is a professional photographer. He shoots mostly motor sports and is a track photographer at Laguna Seca Raceway, in Monterey, California. In 2014, after more than 20 years away from the music industry, Heathcote joined the trio Kevin Moan and the Reptiles, who played shows mostly in Northern California, and went on hiatus several months later when their singer and guitarist Kevin Mohn joined The Atom Age. Heathcote's oldest son Chris was The Reptiles' roadie.

Though only high, it dominates the landscape of northeast Wexford. It provides extensive views of the Wexford coast line, from Courtown harbour to Castletown.  Location  Tara Hill is situated at a particularly high point along the south east coast of Ireland and is surrounded by flat residential and agricultural land. There is a small village located at the heart of the hill. Tara Hill is located approximately 7.1km from Gorey Town Centre and 107.5km from Dublin.  Contemporary village  Tara Hill has many facilities including a church, a primary school (St Kevins), the local shop selling general groceries shut her doors in 2018 and a drumming school is using the building now. Businesses in the area include Sound Out Rhythm Music School, Tara Hill Honey and Ballinglen Stud. The closest villages to Tara Hill are Castletown, Ballymoney and Courtown. Nearby Gorey serves as a market town for the area, with a range of grocery stores, fashion boutiques, and restaurants including, Katie Daly's,The Kitchen, and The Duck Restaurant at nearby Marlfield House. Tara Hill has two main walking trails around the Marilyn starting close to the village centre [see Tourism]. The village is closely linked to Dublin by the M11/N11 National Primary Route, and the national rail network from gorey connects it to Rosslare Europort.  Geography  Due to its height relative to the surrounding landscape this hill qualifies as a Marilyn. It should not be confused with the much better known but much less prominent Royal Hill of Tara in County Meath, which is only 159m high. The summit is marked by a cairn from where one can see nearby Gorey, Courtown and other villages and town-lands and views of the North Wexford coast. Though only 253 metres high, it dominates the landscape of northeast Wexford and can be seen from Gorey Town Centre.  History  Saint Caemhan or Kevin or Cavan, as the name is variously spelt is the Patron Saint of Tara Hill and the site of the old church founded by him is situated at Kilcavan at the north side of the hill under a cliff by the road. The community in Tara Hill and Ballymoney announced in 2009 that they were making efforts to preserve the past, with plans to produce a new book on the social history of the area. A 'Minding Memories' night was held in Tara Hill to offer locals a chance to record their memories of the area back as far as the war years, and even earlier. It is said that several locals recalled Spencer's Hall on the bank of the North Beach, where dances were held in the 1940s and 1950s. Its foundations can still be seen. Others recalled Clince's Hall at the bottom of the Sea Road, where there was also a guest house. The hall is now a private dwelling. It too was used for dances and also for a table tennis club. Other people recalled the farming enterprises which were used to make money but also provided for the families themselves. Accounts have been given how Tara Hill Church also doubled as a school until the 'new school' was built in 1939. Other people recalled going to Gorey for the cattle fair day on a Friday, and how there were four different grocery stores in the town, each one patronised by people from different villages. The people of Tara Hill used to shop in Dwyers close to where the Loch Garman Arms is now.https://www.independent.ie/regionals/goreyguardian/localnotes/book-being- compiled-on-social-history-of-tara-hill-27323188.html  Tourism  B&B;'s in the area include Tara Hill Lodge, Hillside House Bed & Breakfast, Daru House B&B;, and Tara Haven. Seafield Hotel & Spa Resort in nearby Ballymoney, serves as a hotel for tourists staying in the local area. The area also has a number of beaches, including Clone Strand and nearby Ballymoney Beach. There are two trails on Tara Hill, starting from two different trailheads (Crab Tree ‚Äì Blue and Cemetery ‚Äì Red). The Red Sl√≠ an tSuaimhnais trail begins from Tara Hill cemetery just beyond the village itself. The Blue Sl√≠ na n-√ìg trail, beginning from the Ballinacarrig parking place (known locally as the Crab Tree) goes to the higher slopes of Tara Hill itself.  Schools  St. Kevin's National School is located in Tara Hill Village. The school caters for junior infants to 6th class pupils. The school regularly organises outings to nearby Tara Hill and Glendalough, and has a vegetable garden on its premises.  Sports  The local GAA club (Castletown Liam Mellows) is located just meters down the road on the Castletown, Tara Hill border.  Religion  St. Kevins Catholic church is located at Kilcavan Lower in Tara Hill.

It is also known as yerba santa (sacred herb), mountain balm, bear's weed, gum bush, gum plant, and consumptive weed.Patricia Kaminski and Richard Katz. Yerba Santa Eriodictyon californicum. Flower Essence Society. Less common names include Herbe des Montagnes, Herbe √† Ourse, Herbe Sacr√©e, Herbe Sainte, Hierba Santa, Holy Herb, and Tarweed. Distribution It is native to California and Oregon, where it grows in several types of habitats, including chaparral and coast redwood forests. Description Eriodictyon californicum is an evergreen aromatic shrub with woody rhizomes, typically found in clonal stands growing to a height of 3 to 4 feet (1+ meter). The dark green, leathery leaves are narrow, oblong to lanceolate, and up to 15 centimeters in length. Foliage and twigs are covered with shiny resin and are often dusted with black fungi, Heterosporium californicum. It is similar to its Southern California sibling E. crassofolium. The shrub is known to be an occasional source of nutrition for wildlife and livestock.Forest Service Fire Ecology Their bitterness makes them unpalatable to most animals, although it does have multiple insect herbivores, including butterflies.Murphy, Dennis D., Marian S. Menninger, and Paul R. Ehrlich. \\"Nectar Source Distribution as a Determinant of Oviposition Host Species in Euphydryas Chalcedona.\\" Oecologia 62.2 (1984): 269-71. The inflorescence is a cluster of bell-shaped white to purplish flowers, each between one and two centimeters in length. Taxonomy When first described, it was placed in genus Wigandia, so its basionym is Wigandia californica. Traditional medicine The leaves have historically been used to treat asthma, upper respiratory infections and allergic rhinitis. The Concow tribe calls the plant w√§-s√§-got‚Äô-≈ç (Konkow language) The Chumash used it as a poultice for wounds, insect bites, broken bones, and sores. It was also used in a steam bath to treat hemorrhoids. Medical research The flavonoid sterubin is the main active component of Yerba santa and is neuroprotective against multiple toxicities of the aging brain, including possibly Alzheimer's disease. Food use Eriodictyol is one of the 4 flavanones identified in this plant by the Symrise Corporation as having taste-modifying properties, the other three being: homoeriodictyol, its sodium salt and sterubin. These compounds have potential uses in food and pharmaceutical industry to mask bitter taste. Environmental use This species of shrub is used for revegetating damaged or disturbed lands, such as overgrazed rangeland. It is strongly fire-adapted, sprouting from rhizomes after wildfire and developing a waxy film of flammable resins on its foliage. Butterflies E. californicum is a specific food and habitat plant for the butterfly Papilio eurymedon. It is the primary nectar source for variable checkerspot butterflies in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in California..

It was released as the first single from the album but did not chart. Nonetheless, it is one of his best-known and most popular tunes. Taylor considers it his best song. History The song was written by Taylor for the son of his older brother Alex, who was also named James (and indeed was named after him). Deliberately a cross between a cowboy song and a lullaby, it was first thought up by Taylor as he was driving through Carolina to meet his infant nephew for the first time. Taylor spent considerable effort on the lyrics, whose verses he later said used the most intricate rhyming pattern of his career. One of the most famous parts of the lyric is: :Now the First of December was covered with snow :And so was the Turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston :Lord, the Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frostin' :With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go The song is composed as a waltz, in 3/4 time. The chorus echoes the lullaby sentiment, with a reference to \\"Rock-a-bye Baby\\". According to Allmusic critic Bill Janovitz, the two verses contrast the new baby James, as a lonely cowboy, in the first verse with the lonely grown-up James singing in the second verse. On the other hand, author James Perrone suggests that the young cowboy James in the first verse as well as the James traveling the Massachusetts Turnpike in the second verse are both the adult James who is singing the song. Perrone notes that the two are linked near the end of the song when Taylor sings that the nighttime dreams of the first stanza cowboy and the dreams of the second stanza traveller \\"still inspire all who 'take to the highway.'\\" \\"Sweet Baby James\\" was included on Taylor's diamond-selling Greatest Hits 1976 compilation. Live performance history The Massachusetts Turnpike and signs from Stockbridge to Boston. \\"Sweet Baby James\\" has been played at almost every Taylor concert since its release. It is often saved for near or at the end of shows, where it serves as the emotional climax with Taylor performing it as the last encore coming back on stage without his band, or perhaps with just a keyboard player accompanying his guitar. Invariably, the second verse mentions of the Massachusetts Turnpike, Stockbridge, The Berkshires, and Boston bring cheers from people in the audience who had lived in Massachusetts. And if the concert is in Tanglewood or Great Woods, the commotion is enough to pause the song. Taylor was born in Boston, and although he moved to North Carolina when very young, he spent summers in Massachusetts and went to boarding school there. This association has made Taylor a regional favorite in New England, including sell-outs at Tanglewood and a record-setting concert stand at Great Woods. Taylor, who underwent treatment at the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge in his younger years and later became a resident of the Berkshires, has spoken of the song's geographical reference points: \\"I really did drive the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston. I have a real connection to this place.\\" He performed the song as part of his set on the first episode of Saturday Night Lives second season, which aired September 18, 1976. 15 years later, Taylor performed the song again on the Christmas episode of Saturday Night Lives on December 14, 1991. In the \\"Four Together\\" benefit concert arranged by Harry Chapin in 1977, John Denver sang the harmony part of the chorus on this song. A concert performance from 1992 was included on his 1993 album Live. Jay Leno requested Taylor's live performance of the song on his final The Tonight Show (first stint) on May 29, 2009. He said he had listened to it on the car radio as he left Boston for Los Angeles in the early 1970s and that the \\"ten miles behind, ten thousand more to go\\" line resonated deeply with him. Taylor performed the song when campaigning for Deval Patrick's re- election during the Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2010, and the \\"Stockbridge to Boston\\" line drew a huge reaction in that context as well. Other versions Tom Rush, who made a practice of recording material from the best new singer songwriters of the era, put it on his October 1970 album Wrong End of the Rainbow. The Seldom Scene added harmony on their bluegrass version, released on their debut album Act 1 in 1972. Highway 101 closed their 1989 album Paint the Town with it. Daniel Greaves of The Watchmen often performs it a cappella during concerts.  In popular culture  Taylor is often referred to in the press by the nickname \\"Sweet Baby James\\". On ABC's Good Morning America on September 15, 2008, Taylor acknowledged \\"there was that element\\" of being a \\"self lullaby\\" given the song's title and the \\"singing works just fine for me\\" lyric. The song is sung by Hank Heywood (Thomas F. Wilson) in the season four episode \\"Tender Is the Nate\\" of Legends of Tomorrow, to lull a minotaur to sleep. It is later reprised in the season finale \\"Hey, World!\\" as \\"Sweet Baby Nate\\" to inspire enough love to revive the deceased Nate Heywood.

KYFI is owned and operated by Bible Broadcasting Network, Inc.BBN Stations ‚Äì KYFI BBN Radio. Accessed October 28, 2013 KYFI's transmitters are located near Gateway Motorsports Park in Madison, Illinois. The 630 frequency had previously been KXOK, which in the 1960s was one of the leading radio stations in St. Louis, and religious station KJSL from 1994 to 2013. History =Construction of KXOK= In 1935, Elzey Roberts, publisher of the St. Louis Star-Times, applied for a license to put a new radio station on the air. He already owned station KFRU in Columbia, and wanted a station in the larger St. Louis market. But his license request was challenged by two other stations in the market, KSD and WIL; the legal battle dragged on until late 1937, when the court granted Roberts' request and the FCC assigned the KXOK call letters. WIL attempted to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, but in late March 1938, they lost when the court refused to review the case, affirming the FCC's grant; KXOK was given permission to begin building the new station. General manager Ray V. Hamilton announced the station would be dedicated in mid-August 1938, but there were further delays in building it. KXOK finally made its debut on September 19, 1938. Allen Franklin was the first program director; he came from station WLW in Cincinnati. Among the air staff was Paul Aurandt, who came there from KOMA in Oklahoma City and would later become famous as Paul Harvey. KXOK began its life at 1250 kHz and was affiliated with the Mutual Broadcasting System; however, on October 26, 1940, it moved to the 630 location on the AM dial and became affiliated with NBC Blue (later called the Blue Network). The KXOK shift to 630, which also saw the station move from Venice, Illinois to its site at Madison, also benefited Roberts's station in Columbia, which went full-time on 1270 kHz, and WGBF of Evansville, Indiana, which ceased sharing time with KFRU and went full-time on 1250. Elzey Robert continued to own the station until 1954, when his son, Elzey Roberts, Jr., and an associate, Chester L. Thomas, took it over, doing business as KXOK Broadcasting, Inc. =Change of ownership= In early November 1960, the station changed hands, when Roberts and Thomas sold the station to Robert and Todd Storz, for the sum of $1.5 million. The station changed format not long after to a new Top 40 sound. Nicknamed \\"The Sound and the Spirit of St. Louis\\" and \\"The Fun Spot,\\" KXOK became part of the Storz family of stations (other stations in the group included WHB across the state in Kansas City, WQAM in Miami, WTIX in New Orleans, KOMA in Oklahoma City, and WDGY in Minneapolis-St. Paul). During the mid-60s, KXOK was one of the two dominant radio stations in the St. Louis market, along with KMOX. KXOK was so successful during this period, that its Top 40 competitor, WIL (AM 1430) dropped pop music in 1967, and switched to country music; it helped that WIL refused to play The Beatles. =Top 40 DJs= A number of legendary air personalities graced the KXOK airwaves during the station's glory years, including Ed Bonner, Ray Otis, Bill Addison, Mort Crowley, Danny Dark, Ron Elz aka Johnny Rabbitt, British DJ Paul Martin, Shad O'Shea, William A. Hopkins, Don Pietromonaco aka Johnny Rabbitt, Don Shafer, Delcia Devon, Louise Harrison Caldwell (George Harrison's sister), Lou Cooley, Davey O'Donnell, Peter Martin, Keith Morris, Richard Ward Fatherley and Bob Shannon. Other outstanding personalities of the 1970s included Jerry Butler, Mason Lee Dixon, Jack Mindy, Craig Roberts and Scott Sherwood. The news staff included veteran reporters Bob Shea, Robert R. Lynn and Steven B. Stevens. It was under the leadership of Station Operations Manager Bud Connell and program directors Ray Otis and Mort Crowley that KXOK became one of the highest-rated stations in the country. It was quite common for the DJs such as Rabbitt and Otis to travel to various teen venues with their specially selected escort bands to gage their audiences' interest in music and to make personal contact with their fans. The KXOK Sound Waves of Centralia, Illinois, were a fan favorite featuring members Ron Bousman, Mike Atchison, Greg Flanigan, Tommy Lee, and Joey Rhodes. Rhodes went on to become a Nashville recording artist and songwriter. Many of the station's DJ's over the years went on to successful careers as national talk show hosts, television news anchors, actors and nationally known freelance talent. Danny Dark became the voice of NBC-TV, a post he held for an entire generation. Craig Roberts continues to work as a national television voice actor and announcer, still heard locally in St. Louis as the \\"voice\\" of ABC 30. =Talk and news= With the departure of key air talents and the advent of Top 40 music on FM‚Äîmost notably from KSLQ (now known as KYKY)‚ÄîKXOK went through several format changes toward the end of the 1970s The music format ended in April 1983, when KXOK flipped to talk. and oldies. After being sold along with KHTK to Legends Broadcasting for $6.5 million in 1989, KXOK went to an all-news format, calling itself \\"All News 630\\". =Religion as KJSL= Former station logo KXOK was sold in 1994 to Crawford Broadcasting, which changed it to a religious station as KJSL.Call Sign History fcc.gov. Accessed October 28, 2013. The longest-running daily program, The Bob Wells Show, hosted by Bob Wells, aired on KJSL from April 1999 until May 28, 2010 with a format of news of the day: social, theological, and political. Bob Wells Show in the KJSL studio Mornings with Tim & Al aired from 1994 to 2005 in morning drive. Hosted by Al Gross and Tim Berends, the show was often pre-recorded and mixed in as a live broadcast. The hosts were on-air teachers of evangelism, frequently interviewing celebrities and sharing the Gospel with them. The station attempted to promote the show to non- Christian listeners with a 1998 billboard that read \\"Hell Hates Tim & Al\\", trimmed in flames. Debra Peppers hosted one of the longest-running live radio programs on KJSL from 1996 through May 2006 titled Talk from the Heart, a two- hour call-in interactive radio program with uplifting Christian topics. The station's emphasis shifted briefly towards Contemporary Christian music in April 2006 in morning and evening drive time as well as morning commute in an effort to draw in a broad audience. =Sale to BBN= Crawford opted to spin off the stronger of its two St. Louis stations, KXOK, to the Bible Broadcasting Network in 2013. BBN paid $2 million and shuttered the station's local operations to carry the network feed from its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The team is based in Sandusky, Ohio. Owned by Duke Thorson and his wife Rhonda, it currently fields four full-time Ford F-150 teams: the No. 13 for Johnny Sauter, the No. 88 for Matt Crafton, the No. 98 for Grant Enfinger, and the No. 99 for Ben Rhodes. The team has won three Truck Series championships (2013, 2014, and 2019) with Crafton. Nationwide Series =Car No. 13 history= In 2008, ThorSport Racing made their Nationwide Series debut with Shelby Howard driving the No. 13 Chevrolet Monte Carlo for 2 races starting at Lucas Oil Park and Bristol. He then finished 20th and 23rd both of the races. Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series =Truck No. 13 history= Johnny Sauter in the No. 13 at Dover International Speedway in 2019 The No. 13 truck began racing in 2004, with Tina Gordon driving with sponsorship from Vassarette and Microtel. After five races, she left the team due to injuries she suffered at Atlanta, and Lance Hooper and Paul White shared the ride for the next several races. After several lackluster results, Jimmy Spencer drove at Loudon, finishing eighteenth, before Jason Small and Andy Houston finished out the season in the truck. For 2005, Tracy Hines drove the truck and had a fifth- place finish at Richmond International Raceway with sponsorship from David Zoriki Motorsports. He was released with two races to go, and Chad Chaffin and Johnny Sauter filled out the schedule in his place. Kerry Earnhardt drove for ThorSport Racing during the 2006 season, his best finish being 11th which he recorded twice, at Nashville and Las Vegas. He was not retained for 2007 and rookie Willie Allen was signed to replace him. He had two top-tens and won Rookie of the Year, but was replaced at the end of the year by USAR Hooters Pro Cup driver Shelby Howard. Howard had two top-tens as well in the BobCat Company/FarmPaint.com Chevy, but finished seventeenth in points, and was released. Sauter returned to the team for the 2009 season full-time with sponsorship from Fun Sand. The team now runs through a partnership with Mike Curb. Sauter took ThorSport's third win as a team at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and giving ThorSport its first ever 1‚Äì2 finish, with Crafton in second. Sauter would finish 6th in points at the end of the year. In 2010, Sauter took home his second win at Kansas after late contact with Ron Hornaday. Sauter would eventually finish 3rd in points to Todd Bodine. For 2011 the team gained sponsorship from Safe Auto Insurance Company. Sauter would score wins at Martinsville and Homestead, finishing second in points to Austin Dillon. Safe Auto left the team, being replaced by The Peanut Roaster in 2012. Sauter's season was beset by bad luck, but improved performance late in the season, as well as sweeping the races at Texas, lifted Sauter to 9th in points. Todd Bodine took over as the driver for the 2013 season placing 11th at Daytona International Speedway, with Mattei Air Compressors as the truck's new primary sponsor. However, the team was unable to find additional sponsorship and was forced to release Bodine after the seventh race, with Brett Moffitt, Frank Kimmel and Tracy Hines each running a race before the team shut down. Kimmel returned to the No. 13 at the season-ending race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. In 2014, Jeb Burton was hired to drive the No. 13. Initially running on a race-by-race basis pending sponsorship, Burton's ride was upgraded to the full season when Estes Express Lines signed a deal with the team. However, the deal would not be extended to 2015, causing the team to release Burton, who subsequently signed with BK Racing in the Sprint Cup Series. Meanwhile, the No. 13 was taken over by Cameron Hayley, with Cabinets by Hayley signing to sponsor the ride. Hayley returned to the ride in 2016. Hayley would have a dismal season, with not making it to the Chase and worse point standings finish than last year. Hayley did not return for 2017. He would be replaced by Cody Coughlin for 2017. After the 2017 season Coughlin was released and replaced by Myatt Snider for the 2018 season. Snider would go on to record 3 top 5s and 8 top 10s that would be good enough for a 9th-place points finish for the rookie driver. Only a few days before the truck series season opener at Daytona, it was announced that Johnny Sauter would once again make a return to the team for the 2019 season. At Iowa, Sauter was parked by NASCAR for wrecking Austin Hill during the caution lap. As a result of the incident, he was suspended for the following week's race at Gateway. Snider was announced to substitute for Sauter at Gateway. Sauter was eliminated from the playoffs at Las Vegas when he finished 29th after experiencing an engine failure that also plagued three other trucks. Ilmor, the manufacturer of the engines, took responsibility for the NT1 engines that suffered from severe detonation due to the combination of the high engine load condition combined with the extreme weather conditions in Las Vegas. Despite Ilmor's announcement, NASCAR denied ThorSport's request to reinstate Sauter and Grant Enfinger into the playoffs. On February 21, 2020, the No. 13 team was docked 10 owner and driver points prior to the Las Vegas race after an illegal engine oil reservoir tank was discovered during pre-race inspection. =Truck No. 27 history= On July 16, 2018 Chase Briscoe joined forces with ThorSport Racing and won the 2018 Eldora Dirt Derby in his first race in a NASCAR truck since 2017. For the 2019 NextEra Energy 250, Myatt Snider drove the No. 27 Ford F-150 for Daytona. Chase Briscoe returned to the No. 27 for the 2019 Eldora Dirt Derby. After leading majority of the race and winning the first two stages, a late crash lead to a seventh place finish. =Truck No. 41 history= Ben Rhodes drove this truck full-time in 2016 and 2018. =Truck No. 88 history= The No. 88 truck in 2018 The No. 88 truck was the first out of the ThorSport stable. Debuting in the 1996 season at the Milwaukee Mile, Terry Cook finished 12th in the race for the team, which was then known as Sealmaster Racing. He ran two additional races in the truck that season, but did not finish better than 21st. Cook drove a limited schedule with the team in 1997 in the PBA Tour Chevy. Despite not finishing in the top-ten, Cook won his first career pole at Flemington Speedway, and finished 24th in the final standings. The team received enough funding to compete full-time in 1998, and Cook won his first career race at Flemington, but only improved to a twentieth-place points finish. ThorSport began the 1999 without primary sponsorship before Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce joined the operation late in the season, allowing Cook to finish 15th in points. In 2000, PickupTruck.com became the team's new sponsor, and Cook had a total of eight top-ten finishes, but was replaced in the final event of the season by Matt Crafton, who finished ninth. Fast Master Driveway Sealer and XE Sighting System shared sponsorship duties for Crafton, who picked up eleven top-tens and finished 12th in points in his rookie season. Despite Menards becoming a full-time sponsor in 2002, Crafton only had six top-tens and dropped to fifteenth in the standings, but improved to eleventh the following year. For the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, Buddy Rice was placed in the 88 truck 20th. In 2004, rookie Tracy Hines became the team's new driver, and he posted three top-ten finishes and finished eighteenth in points. Crafton returned to the 88 for 2005, winning his first career pole at New Hampshire International Speedway and finishing ninth in points, a team-best. He slipped to fourteenth in points in 2006 despite ten top-tens, and repeated his top-ten total in 2007, moving up to eighth in points. 2008 was the team's best year to that point, with Crafton scoring his first win at Charlotte and finishing fifth in points. Despite not winning the next year, the No. 88 team finished runner-up in points to Ron Hornaday. Crafton had another strong season in 2010, earning one pole at Texas Motor Speedway, 10 top-five and 20 top-10 finishes, resulting in a season-ending rank of fourth. 2011 saw the second win of Crafton's career at Iowa Speedway, in addition to poles at Michigan International Speedway and Martinsville Speedway, where he broke the track qualifying record. However, four DNFs (Did Not Finish) due to engine failures, mechanical issues and accidents caused by other competitors led to only five top fives and 13 top 10s, ultimately relegating Crafton to eighth in the final standings. In 2012, he had a decent season, finishing 6th in points. 2013 was Crafton's best season in his career to date. He won his third career race at Kansas in April. After this win, Crafton picked up the points lead and held it for the rest of the season. He finished in the top ten in the first sixteen races of the season, and 19 overall, with a worst finish of 21st in the season finale at Homestead. He clinched his first Truck Series championship with his start in that race, and was able to stay on the lead lap despite late crash damage to become the first driver to complete every lap of the season in the Truck Series. On March 30, 2014, Crafton scored his fourth career Truck win at Martinsville. On June 6, he won on fuel strategy at Texas Motor Speedway to win two races in a season for the first time in his career. It was also the first time he led more than 100 laps in a race. Despite crashing out at Dover and Gateway, his first DNFs in over two years, and dropping to 17 top tens, Crafton would ultimately go on to become the first back-to-back champion in the Truck Series. Crafton would score his sixth career victory on February 28, 2015, in the Hyundai Construction Equipment 200, the revived Atlanta race. In May, he played fuel strategy to the win at Kansas, winning a second race at one track for the first time in his career. This also marked the first repeat win by any driver in the Truck Series at Kansas. In June, Crafton won at Texas to defend his victory from the previous season, another career first. In July, he picked up his fourth win of the season at Kentucky after the race was cut short due to Ben Kennedy's crash into the catchfence. He scored two additional wins at Martinsville and the season finale at Homestead, but finished third in the points due to a few crashes. Crafton went on to conclude 2016 & 2017 with a runner-up and fourth-place showings in the final point standings respectively under the new \\"Playoffs\\" system. Crafton finished 6th in the 2018 standings despite being winless for the time since 2012. Despite also concluding 2019 without winning a race, Crafton made his third-ever Championship 4 appearance and beat out Ross Chastain by two spots to claim his third career Truck Series Championship. On February 21, 2020, the No. 88 team was docked 10 owner and driver points prior to the Las Vegas race after an illegal engine oil reservoir tank was discovered during pre-race inspection. =Truck No. 89 history= This truck entered in the 2017 Eldora Dirt Derby, with Rico Abreu driving. =Truck No. 98 history= Grant Enfinger in the No. 98 at Pocono Raceway in 2017 ThorSport first fielded the 98 truck at the 2002 Chevy Silverado 150 for Cory Kruseman with Agromin sponsoring. He finished 31st after suffering engine failure. The next race came a year later at the season- ending Ford 200 with Crafton driving, with sponsorship from Enzyme Magic as a sister truck to the 88 that he normally drove, finishing fifteenth. The 98 did not appear for six years until the 2009 Heluva Good! 200 at New Hampshire with Michael McDowell driving. He finished fourteenth in the Perkins Police truck. It ran another race later in the season at Texas with David Gilliland, but finished 35th after suffering rear end problems early into the race. In 2010, the 98 ran at Daytona with Landon Cassill and EasytoInstall.com, but wrecked early in the race. The 98 returned in 2011 with Penske development driver Dakoda Armstrong behind the wheel with sponsorship from Ferrellgas and Argisure for 7 races. Armstrong later joined ThorSport for the 2012 season to make a run at Rookie of the Year. However, the team's EverFi sponsorship would only last for the first 14 races, forcing the team to release Armstrong before the fall race at Iowa and shut the team down. The 98 returned for 2013 with Johnny Sauter swapping numbers. The team took back to back wins at Daytona and Martinsville, but suffered a setback when crew chief Joe Shear, Jr. was handed a suspension from NASCAR due to a fuel cell issue. Despite Shear's return at Iowa, he would later resign from ThorSport after the Eldora race, citing disagreements over the team being based in Ohio rather than North Carolina. Sauter would nonetheless win his third race of 2013 at Talladega, sweeping the restrictor plate events in the Truck Series. He would finish fourth in final points. Sauter returned to the 98 in 2014. He dropped to just one win, at Michigan, but was a championship contender throughout much of the season before fading back to equal his fourth-place points finish from 2013. Sauter ran the Truck again in 2015, but announced late in the season that he would be leaving for GMS Racing in 2016. He would later be replaced by Rico Abreu. Abreu lost his ride after the 2016 season due to a lack of sponsorship. He would be replaced by Grant Enfinger for 2017. Enfinger missed the playoffs and finished 11th in points. 2018 saw a more successful year for Enfinger, as he made the playoffs with his strength throughout the regular season and won the fall Las Vegas race, advancing to the Round of 6. He missed the Championship 4 but finished 5th in points. On February 21, 2020, the No. 98 team was docked 10 owner and driver points prior to the Las Vegas race after an illegal engine oil reservoir tank was discovered during pre-race inspection. On September 10, Enfinger won at Richmond Raceway and teammates Ben Rhodes and Matt Crafton completed the top three finishers; it was the first 1-2-3 finish in the history of the NASCAR Trucks Series =Truck No. 99 history= On December 15, 2015, Ben Rhodes joined the team in a new fourth truck with sponsorship from Alpha Energy Solutions, the truck being numbered 41. He recorded two top-fives and five top-tens. He had a shot to win at Kansas Speedway until he tangled with Johnny Sauter on the last lap, leading to a William Byron win. Rhodes returned in 2017 to the renumbered 27 truck. Rhodes won his first Truck race at Las Vegas holding off Christopher Bell. The truck returned to using the 41 for 2018, scoring a win at Kentucky Speedway in the summer. The truck would once again be renumbered for the 2019 season with the number 99. Rhodes won the Trucks' return to Darlington in 2020. ARCA Racing Series =Car No. 13 history= In 2014, Jeb Burton made his debut with ThorSport Racing after being released from Turner Scott Motorsports due to sponsorship, driving the No. 13 Toyota Camry at the season opener at Daytona in the ARCA Racing Series. Burton started 21st and finished 29th after being involved in the early crash. =Car No. 18 history= ThorSport fielded the No. 18 Toyota Camry for Matt Crafton in 2012 at Lucas Oil Raceway where he started on the pole, but finished 31st after being involved in a crash. =Car No. 44 history= Kimmel's 2013 No. 44 ARCA championship car at Road America In 2012, nine-time ARCA Racing Series champion Frank Kimmel joined the team in the No. 44 Toyota Camry. In 2013, Kimmel became the leader in all-time wins in ARCA history with 80, en route to his tenth championship. Kimmel left the team for Win-Tron Racing after the season.

He was the son of anatomist Exup√®re Joseph Bertin (1712-1781). Early life and education Bertin was born in Gohard, France on April 10, 1757. His father was Exup√®re-Joseph Bertin, who was a prominent physician remembered for his description on invaginated renal cortical tissue columns of Bertin. After studying in Paris, Bertin graduated from medical school at the University of Montpellier in 1791. Career Trait√© des maladies du coeur et des gros vaisseaux Bertin was a military physician during the French Revolution and in the Napoleonic wars. After his military service, Bertin then returned to Paris and became the physician-in-chief at H√¥pital Cochin. He specialized in disorders of the cardiovascular system with his assistant Jean Baptiste Bouillaud. Bertin was an early advocate of auscultation for elucidating the pathologies of cardiovascular disorders. He developed insight into the physical principles responsible for heart murmurs associated with valvular stenosis. Bertin was especially interested in cardiac hypertrophy and originated the idea of having three designations of cardiac hypertrophy, which he called \\"eccentric\\", \\"concentric\\" and \\"simple\\" hypertrophy of the heart. He was the author of Trait√© des Maladies du Coeur et des Gros Vaisseaux (Treatise of Diseases of the Heart and Major Vessels), an important work on the pathological anatomy of the heart. In this book, he discusses topics such as auscultation, valvular deformities, and hypertrophy of the heart. His student Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud assisted him with this edition.

Its primary focus is development of projects that use Mono and .NET frameworks. MonoDevelop integrates features similar to those of NetBeans and Microsoft Visual Studio, such as automatic code completion, source control, a graphical user interface (GUI) and Web designer. MonoDevelop integrates a Gtk# GUI designer called Stetic. It supports Boo, C, C++, C#, CIL, D, F#, Java, Oxygene, Vala, JavaScript, TypeScript and Visual Basic.NET. MonoDevelop can be used on Windows, macOS and Linux. Officially supported Linux distributions include CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu, with many other distributions providing their own unofficial builds of MonoDevelop in their repositories. macOS and Windows have been officially supported since version 2.2. MonoDevelop has included a C# compiler (an alternative to MSBuild and CSC) since its earliest versions. It currently includes a compiler that supports C# 1.0, C# 2.0, C# 3.0, C# 4.0, C# 5.0 and C# 6.0.C# Compiler, Mono Docs A customized version of MonoDevelop formerly shipped with Windows and Mac versions of Unity, the game engine by Unity Technologies. It enabled advanced C# scripting, which was used to compile cross-platform video games by the Unity compiler. It has since been replaced by Visual Studio Community, except on Linux versions.  History  In late 2003, a group of developers from the Mono community began migrating SharpDevelop, a successful .NET open source IDE from Windows Forms on Windows to the GNOME toolkit (Gtk#) on Linux. The fork was also to target the Mono framework instead of the Microsoft .NET Framework implementation. Being an early fork of SharpDevelop, MonoDevelop architecturally differs from recent SharpDevelop releases. Over time, the MonoDevelop project was absorbed into the rest of the Mono project and as of 2016, is actively maintained by Xamarin and the Mono community. Since Mono 1.0 Beta 2, MonoDevelop is bundled with Mono releases. Starting with version 4.x, Xamarin rebranded MonoDevelop as Xamarin Studio, but only for the Windows version of the IDE. As of 2016, Xamarin Studio also runs on macOS.https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross- platform/getting_started/requirements/  Features  MonoDevelop is an IDE for the .NET platform with features comparable to Microsoft Visual Studio. Highlights include:MonoDevelop FeaturesMonoDevelop Feature List *Multi- platform IDE and user projects (Linux, Windows and macOS) *Multi-language (C#, F#, Visual Basic .NET, C/C++, Vala, JavaScript, TypeScript) *Project templates for C#, Visual Basic, Boo, Java (IKVM) and C/C++ *Code completion support for C#, code templates, code folding *Customizable window layouts, user defined key bindings, external tools *Integrated Debugger for debugging Mono and native applications *Integrated Compiler (supports up to C# 6.0) *GTK# Visual Designer to graphically build GTK# user interfaces *ASP.NET web projects with code completion support and testing on XSP (Mono web server). *Source control, makefile integration, unit testing, packaging and deployment, localization = UI Builder = MonoDevelop has included a GTK# GUI designer called Stetic since version 0.1.MonoDeveloper Project: Release notes for MonoDevelop 0.10.MonoDevelop Project: Feature List. to develop GTK+ user interfaces in C#. Stetic is very similar to Glade Interface Designer but is integrated into MonoDevelop with features such as drag and drop. It has been criticized for being more difficult to work with than the likes of Qt Designer and the Microsoft Visual Studio Windows Forms Editor when the programmer does not yet have a concrete layout in mind.\\"First info about Mono's Stetic, the new RAD tool\\", OSNews, 16 March 2005. = Xamarin Studio = Xamarin offers a rebranded version of MonoDevelop 4.0 as Xamarin Studio which now uses platform-specific code in various places to enhance the look and feel. While Mono provides a package for Solaris 10 running on SPARC, MonoDevelop packages for OpenSolaris are only provided by groups from the OpenSolaris community. MonoDevelop on FreeBSD is likewise supported only by the FreeBSD community. = Visual Studio for Mac = Another rebranded version of MonoDevelop is Visual Studio for Mac. Visual Studio for Mac employs many of the same tools as its Windows counterpart: for example, the Roslyn .NET Compiler Platform is used for refactoring and IntelliSense. Its project system and build engine use MSBuild; and its source editor supports TextMate bundles. It uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android.

Following the outbreak of World War II in Europe, she sailed to the United States where she operated under charter from the Maritime Commission as Rita Maersk and later as Larwin. After completing two cruises, she was laid up at Boston, Massachusetts, until 18 September 1941 when she was acquired by the United States Navy from the Maritime Commission. Renamed USS Pegasus on 15 October 1941, the cargo ship was converted for U.S. Navy use by Sullivan Drydock and Repair Corporation, New York City, and commissioned at New York on 3 December 1941, Lt. Comdr. William Fly in command.  World War II North Atlantic operations Following an abbreviated shakedown, Pegasus loaded military cargo including 600 depth charges and sailed in convoy for Iceland on 27 December. Despite fierce seas and the menace of German U-boats, she reached Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, early in January 1942. There, raging winter storms driven by winds in excess of imperiled the ship and her cargo, and she did not return to the U.S. East Coast until late February. On 24 March Pegasus joined her second Iceland-bound convoy, and during the spring and summer months of 1942 she completed three round trips to Iceland and back. Her holds and decks carried supplies for the Allied effort in the North Atlantic. Although she escaped the German submarines, she saw several merchantmen, including two on 31 August, fall prey to torpedo attacks.  Central America operations Pegasus returned to Boston, Massachusetts, on 11 October; and, after completing repairs to her main engine, she sailed on 16 November to begin extended operations in the Caribbean. Laden with dynamite and Seabee construction material, she arrived St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, on 11 December. She continued to New Orleans, Louisiana, a week later and loaded construction supplies for Puerto Rico. Between 18 January 1943 and mid-May she made four runs to Puerto Rico and back; thence, during June and July she hauled U.S. Navy cargo to Cristobal, Panama Canal Zone. Ordered to New York, she loaded ammunition and military stores and transported them to Cuba early in September. The busy cargo ship resumed her cargo shuttle runs between the Gulf Coast and ports in the Caribbean and the Panama Canal Zone in October. During the next ten months she hauled thousands of tons of war material to American bases in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. While en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in mid- May 1944, she sustained extensive damage to her cargo after a fire broke out in her fire room. She discharged cargo at Key West, Florida, and quickly resumed duty.  Engine failure, rough seas, and return to stateside  Pegasus returned to the Panama Canal Zone in July, and on the 22nd, she transited the Canal with a cargo of Navy supplies for bases at Balboa, Panama. Yet another assignment sent her to the Panama Canal Zone on 17 August; thence, she sailed for Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, on 23 August. On the 25th her engine failed. She drifted for almost two days until taken in tow by the tug . Following temporary repairs in Cuba, she reached Norfolk, Virginia, on 17 September for a three-month overhaul. She resumed duty on 30 December with a run to Puerto Rico where she encountered a severe tropical storm. While returning to Norfolk, Virginia, via the Florida coast, she encountered another storm off Cape Hatteras early in February 1945. She sustained further damage to her engine, but reached Norfolk at reduced speed on 3 February.  Pacific Theatre operations  During the next two months Pegasus underwent extensive overhaul. On 5 April she was assigned to Service Squadron 10 for duty in the western Pacific Ocean as a dry cargo station ship. She departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 18 April, transited the Panama Canal on 27 April, and steamed via San Diego, California, to Pearl Harbor. She was reclassified IX‚Äì222 on 15 May. Between 7 and 20 June, she was towed to Eniwetok by ; thence she sailed 25 June for the Philippines. Steaming via Ulithi, she arrived Leyte Gulf on 18 July.  End-of-War operations Pegasus supplied ships of the Pacific Fleet during the closing weeks of the war as well as after the Japanese surrender. She operated in Leyte Gulf for the rest of the year and into 1946 and discharged thousands of tons of ships‚Äô stores. She departed the Philippines in February and sailed for the U.S. West Coast, arriving San Francisco, California, on 4 March.  End-of-War Decommissioning  Pegasus decommissioned at San Francisco, California, on 19 April 1946 and was returned to the War Shipping Administration the same day. Her name was struck from the Naval Register on 1 May 1946.

History While the Best Nine Award was first presented to players following the season, it was not until (after World War II) that it became an annual award. After the Japanese Baseball League was divided into Central and Pacific leagues in 1950, the award was presented to nine players from each league. Following the Pacific League's adoption of the DH rule in , ten players (including the best designated hitter) have been chosen for the Best Nine Award in the Pacific League alone each year. Selection process Journalists vote on the best pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, third baseman, shortstop, and three outfielders (typically chosen on merit of best offensive numbers, with the exception of pitchers) in each of the two leagues. As is the case with the Silver Slugger Award, said to be the Major League equivalent of the award, left fielders, center fielders, and right fielders are not chosen separately. Voters for the award are chosen from journalists employed by national newspaper, broadcast, or communication outlets with five or more years of experience in covering professional baseball. Each voter selects one player at each position in each league; the player with the most votes at each position receives the Best Nine Award. Until 2004, the winning players of the award were announced two days after the final game of the Japan Series; from 2005 onwards, the winners have been announced at the Professional Baseball Convention, the NPB's annual awards ceremony. Because of the nature of the voting process, it is possible, although exceedingly rare, that two or more players may end up with the same number of votes at any given position. In 2004, Masahiro Araki of the Chunichi Dragons and Greg LaRocca, then of the Hiroshima Carp, were tied for most votes for the Central League second baseman, the first time a tie had occurred since the current two-league system was adopted. In addition, it is also possible that a players ends up with the most votes at more than one position in the same season. In , then-Nankai Hawks infielder Yasuhiro Kunisada ended up with the most votes at both second base and third base in the Pacific League. He only received the award at second base, and the award for best third baseman went to Tony Roig of the Nishitetsu Lions. In , Shohei Otani of Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters received the awards at pitcher and DH. Other notes In the Central League, the pitcher that receives the Best Nine Award is also named the league's Most Valuable Pitcher. This is not the case in the Pacific League, where the pitcher with the highest winning percentage (among those that have thrown the required number of innings) is named the Most Valuable Pitcher.

Numbers in area code 587 started being allocated in late 2008. The new area codes overlay 403 and 780 simultaneously, covering the entire province, and make 10-digit dialing necessary throughout Alberta. Prior to 1997, area code 403 encompassed Alberta, Yukon and the region that currently defines the Northwest Territories as well as a very small western portion of what is today Nunavut (which split off from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999). However, in 1997, 403 began exclusively serving Alberta, with all other portions of 403 (as well as the portion of area code 819 that had served the region which is today's Nunavut but which, at the time, was still a part of the Northwest Territories) splitting off into a new area code 867. In January 1999, the northern two- thirds of Alberta, including Edmonton, split off as 780, leaving 403 to serve Calgary and southern Alberta. The projected exhaust date for area codes 403 and 780 was March and October 2009, respectively. In 1997, two area codes, 587 and 825, were reserved for Alberta's use by Bellcore. The first of the new area codes, 587, entered service in 2008 as an overlay for the entire province. As a preliminary step, optional ten-digit dialling was introduced across the province on 23 June 2008 and became mandatory on 12 September 2008. On 20 September 2008, Telus Mobility began allocating numbers starting with area code 587 in the Calgary area. The alternative would have been splitting either 403 or 780‚Äîa step that would have resulted in portions of Alberta having to change their numbers for the second time in a decade. A similar step had been taken a year earlier in British Columbia, when area code 778 was converted into a province-wide overlay. Since April 9, 2016, the province has been overlaid with an additional area code, 825. Effective May 15, 2021, the province will be overlaid with an additional area code, 368. This will have the effect of allocating 31.9 million numbers to a province of 4.3 million people.

Originally Morocco leather was imported to Europe from Morocco, and from the late 16th century it was valued in luxury bookbindings in Western countries because of its strength and because it showed off the gilding. It was also used in the Islamic world from an earlier date. However Morocco was often not the original source of the leather. Some of the highest quality Morocco leather, usually goat skin, used in book binding was sourced from Northern Nigeria.Cambridge University Press The leather tends to be more famous than the breed of goat that originally produced it. The leather is sourced from the Sokoto Red breed, which is indigenous to Guinea and Sudan Savannah of Nigeria and Maradi Region in Republic of Niger. The finest grades of Morocco leather are goatskin, but by the late 19th century other skins often were substituted in practice, particularly sheepskin and split calfskin. For example, French Morocco is a variety made of sheepskin.Ure, Andrew. A Dictionary of Arts, Manufactures, and Mines. 1853. Little, Brown. The tanning process varied widely, but the traditional tanning material was sumac. The traditional tanning process was skilled and elaborate; according to the application, the preparation either would aim for a carefully smoothed finish, or would bring up the grain in various patterns such as straight-grained, pebble-grained, or in particular, in a bird's-eye pattern. Morocco leather is practically always dyed, traditionally most often red or black, but green, brown or other colors also were available, and in modern times there is no special constraint on color.Davis, Charles T.

In brief, the Plan divides the states and territories into four groups, and has the territories and smallest states voting first and the largest states voting last. The plan The Delaware Plan is an attempt to provide states with meaningful input into the electoral process. The states and territories are divided into four groups, by population. The smallest 12 states and all the territories by population would be the first group, or \\"pod\\". The smallest thirteen of the remaining states would be the second group, the next thirteen the third group, and the largest twelve states would form the final group. The first group, consisting of the smallest states, would vote on one day in March. Though small, they would clearly play a major role in providing momentum to successful candidates. And, as small states, a candidate with limited resources might well find it easier to run the type of door-to-door campaign traditionally run in New Hampshire. However, unlike the current system, it would be difficult for a campaign without large resources to run in all states, as these small states are as widely spread (from Delaware to Alaska) as any in the nation. The second and third groups would vote on a single day in April and May, respectively. The meaningfulness of their role in the process is secured by the fact that no candidate will be able to achieve a majority of delegates even by the end of the third group's vote in May. Every delegate won will be attached to a candidate that is guaranteed to still be \\"in the running\\". The fourth group, that of the largest states, vote on a single day in June. These twelve states, though needing to wait to vote last, will nonetheless determine the winner, as between them they control more than 50% of the delegates to the national conventions. (Thus, even a last minute entry into the campaign could theoretically win the nomination even if he only ran at the end.) By voting together as a bloc, none of the large states is rendered irrelevant (as was the case for California from 1976 to 2000, after which California moved its voting up to an earlier date). Origins Since 1952, New Hampshire has held the first state primary election in the presidential process, and since 1972, Iowa has held the first caucuses in the presidential nominating process. Other states followed in nearly random order, as determined by the individual state legislatures. Originally, the New Hampshire primary was held in mid-March of the election year, and the Iowa caucuses a week or two earlier. The final primary elections would typically be held the first or second Tuesday in June, completing the initial stage of the election process about five weeks before the first presidential nominating convention. For decades, this was considered a desirable system. Having two small states \\"lead off\\" the campaign made it easier for candidates‚Äîparticularly those with limited resources‚Äîto get their campaigns started. It was common for candidates to spend many months in New Hampshire in the year prior to the primary, in the hopes of building momentum by winning the first primary. But many states, particularly larger states, began to desire to play a bigger role in the nominating process, and states began to move their primaries earlier and earlier. By the time of the 2000 campaign, despite the wide open field involving many serious candidates, George W. Bush had secured the nomination by mid-March, many months before the convention. Worse yet, in the eyes of many observers, many voters in large states which would not vote until April (or later) would have no say in the nominating process. Opposition and criticism =Boomerang effect= The plan was originally proposed by the Republican National Committee in the spring of 2000, to take effect in the 2004 campaign. However, it was voted down by the general convention that summer. There was some opposition from Iowa delegates, as Iowa would not have been in the first group. More significantly, Republican leaders worried that, if they acted unilaterally, that they would be handing a huge advantage to the Democrats. If the Republicans did indeed use this plan, it would be almost impossible to know who the GOP nominee would be until early or mid-June. But if the Democrats maintained their primary schedule unchanged, then the identity of the Democratic nominee might well be clear in March. This, said some Republican strategists, would provide the Democrats with a three-month \\"head start\\" on the general election. =Conservative bias= Also, there is criticism that the Delaware Plan may be biased against more liberal candidates from either party. Although the first round of the primaries is pretty evenly split between Blue States and Red States, the second round has 2 Blue States to 10 Red, and the third round has 4 Blue States to 9 Red. This could bias both parties toward more conservative candidates within their ranks. For this reason, the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee rejected the plan in 2000. =Other alternatives= Others do not so much oppose the Delaware Plan as support other alternatives to the status quo. For example, many favor a system of regional primaries or a lottery system that allows a mix of large and small population states while preserving the possibility of retail politicking in the early phases of the campaign.

Beginning in 1870, they were developed using several different breeds of horses. The Campolina is one of the larger Brazilian breeds, and may be found in most colors. They are a gaited breed, with an ambling gait. They are used mainly for leisure riding and driving and are increasingly used for dressage within Brazil.  History  The Campolina breed dates back to 1870, when it was formed in Entre Rios de Minas, Minas Gerais in Brazil. It was developed by a farmer named Cassiano Campolina, on his farm Fazenda Tanque, beginning when he received a black mare named \\"Med√©ia\\" from his friend, Antonio Cruz.L.S. de Andrade,(2000)Campolina O Grande Marchador, Um Seculo de selecao, Historic Album, Revista Brasileira do Cavalo de Marcha The mare was Brazilian, of Barb ancestry, and Campolina bred her to a pure Andalusian stallion. The stallion belonged to Mariano Proc√≥pio, to whom it had been presented as a gift by Dom Pedro II. Note the squared profile of the torso and nasal bones. This conformation is ideal for the traditional, stereotyped, even paced, gait called the \\"marcha\\". The resulting foal from the breeding was a gray colt named \\"Monarca\\", who lived until 1898 and served for 25 years in Campolina's herd; he is considered the foundation stallion of the Campolina breed. Other breeds that Campolina used in his herd were Anglo-Norman, Clydesdale, Holsteiner, and American Saddle Horse. Bloodlines from the Mangalarga Marchador, were also added to refine the Campolina. The herdbook was closed in 1934 and the breed standard first defined. In 1938, the Professional Consortium of Campolina Horse Breeders was formed to formally organize the breed, and in 1951 the organization was renamed to the Campolina Breeders Association, the breed standards were formally adopted, with the organization based in Belo Horizonte. There were further updates to the breed standard in 1975 and 1993. There are currently around 85,000 registered Campolina horses, with slightly over 7,300 registered breeders. Around 4,300 mares were bred in 2003. Breed characteristics A pampa (pinto-patterned) filly. The height at the withers of the Campolina averages for stallions and for mares. A common view is that the most beautiful Campolinas are silver-grey, a position that may reflect a sentimental tradition for the first Campolina. Other popular colours for this breed include dun, bay, buckskin, and \\"Pampa\\" or pinto. The appearance of markings such as white socks or a star on the forehead neither adds nor detracts to the horse in terms of official judging. Dun-colored Campolinas generally display pronounced primitive markings including dorsal stripe, pale guard hairs on either side of the mane, transverse shoulder strip, and leg striping, called \\"zippers\\" by Campolina breeders. Leg bands or \\"zippers\\" on an adult female Campolina =Head= The desired head shape of a Campolina Hyperconvex nose, exaggerated beyond breed ideal The head of the Campolina is described as trapezoidal in shape, but the silhouette of this horse is smoothly rounded. Between the ears, the poll is to be visible and raised by a few centimeters above the temples. The forehead is to be flat, and the nasal bones apparent near the midpoint of the face in the rostro caudal plane. The head in profile is convex. Campolinas are not, however, described to have a true Roman nose, as the convex profile begins approximately two finger widths below the base of the orbit. The muzzle should be soft and rounded, usually dark in colour, as are the hairs of the inner ear, mane and tail relative to the coat over the body. The nostrils are equal in size and should have a fine layer of flesh around the dorsal surface allowing for approximately one centimeter of separation between the thumb and pointer of the evaluator when the thumb in inserted into the nostril at a depth of around one inch. The outer edge of the nostril should be slightly thicker. The lips should be full and taut about the teeth. The ears are evenly placed when viewed from the front of the horse and not extend vertically more than three times the width of the eye when measured across the inner pinnae. The pinnae should close to a clean tip at the top of each ear. Eyes should be expressive. =Neck and body= In addition to the prominent curvature of the profile, the shape of the crest is also an important feature of the Campolina silhouette. In the relaxed forward pose, the ventral line of the neck from the caudal most point of the cheek to the top of the chest is quite straight. However, the dorsal surface of the neck should have a clear arch. This prominent crest accentuates the arch formed between the head and neck when the horse is flexed during riding. In a relaxed state, the balance of the face and neck from the side view can be evaluated by drawing a tangent from the points of maximal curvature. In the case of balanced conformation, the tangents should intersect roughly one inch in front of the ears (in the forward alert position). The weight range for Campolina stallions and geldings is and for mares. In well-bred, well-conditioned animals, the chest is well developed. One symptom of poor breeding is a narrow chest with inadequate musculature between the front legs. This is a particular concern with the crossbred \\"Mangolina\\" (Mangalarga Marchador x Campolina) Visually, however, the breeding practice frequently results in animals that are heavy in the rear end and look weak and unbalanced in rostro-caudal plane when viewed for the animal‚Äôs full length. The underline of the Campolina should appear well fleshed but not overly rounded. There should be a good inverse symmetry in silhouette or side profile between the curvature of the underline and the fully outstretched neck and head. This conformation has been difficult to achieve in many animals, with many horses having the appearance of a short neck due to the curvature of the crest. The back of the Campolina should be a bit \\"long\\". When evaluating the animal's side profile, special attention should be paid to overall anatomical balance, which in this breed can err in overdevelopment of either the withers or the croup. Unbalanced horses tend to produce a rough ride and are referred to as having a \\"hard\\" gait. Specifically, the withers should be well-developed but not appear exaggerated or considerably higher than the highest point of the croup. In evaluating the hindquarters of the Campolina, the croup should be quite full, though not overly muscular except in stallions. In those animals used for Dressage however, the preferred build goes against the breed standard. Dressage horses are preferred to have an \\"uphill build\\" where the croup slightly lower than the withers. The tail of this breed should exit the rump at around the 1 o‚Äôclock position. Tails are typically mid to mid-low set. Very low tail sets often indicate mixed bloodlines with a likely influence of the Mangalarga Paulista in the genetic make-up of the animal under observation, but can be accounted for by a number of other breeds. =Gait and movement= The Campolina is a gaited horse breed with a smooth, four-beat ambling gait. It is the largest of the three gaited Brazilian breeds, due to the influence of heavier breeds from Northern Europe. The gait is called the true marcha or marcha verdadeira. As one of the newer breeds, the standards for this animal have changed in recent generations. The provided images show the successive removal of the squaredness around the torso and shoulders and the nasal bones when viewed in profile. Historically, breeding schemes emphasized structure idealized for stereotyped, smooth and even paced gait. The newer examples of this breed display refinement in the torso, the nasal bones and around the mouth. These morphological changes confer increased degrees of freedom in joint movement and by extension, increased versatility generally in range and types of motion. Uses The Campolina is used for pleasure and trail riding including dressage, and also driving. Projected evolution of breed standard The Campolina breed is a young breed relative to other established horse lines (Akhal Teke, Arabian, Lippizan) and breed standards are still evolving. Current trends have suggested a move away from the square mouth and retilineo or straight region of the nasal bones as in image presented below. In the new ideal, male nasal bones are prominent, retain the height of the earlier ideals but are now expected to generate a smooth 'curved and continuous' appearance (see The desired head shape of a Campolina). The ideal for the profile of the female head is more dynamic with a narrowing between the nasal bones to refine the lower face. The curvature of the nasal bones should appear to extend naturally from the intersection of the orbit and maxillary and lead gently into the muzzle. Both male and female head profile ideals are moving towards refined, narrow curvature in the lips, especially the upper lip. In the case of the female Campolina, certain breeders now seek to develop the curvature of the croup and buttocks to balance the nasal profile (i.e. an \\"egua\\" (female horse) with a strongly curved profile must present a full, developed curvature of the rear). Former ideal for the head, note the squared profile of the nasal bones References External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20100620104819/http://www.comunidadecampolina.com.br/ (In Portuguese) Category:Horse breeds Category:Horse breeds originating in Brazil ","title":"Campolina"},{"id":"11844043","text":"John N.

Commencing on the 7th day of the month of Poush, the fair officially lasts for three days, although vendors may stay until the month-end as per the university regulations. From 2017 onwards the fair lasted for six days. The key characteristic of this fair include live performances of Bengali folk music, such as baul, kirtan and Kobigan. Background Devendranath Tagore with twenty followers accepted the Brahmo creed from Ram Chandra Vidyabagish on 21 December 1843 (7 Poush 1250 according to the Bengali calendar). This was the basis of Poush Utsav (the Festival of Poush) at SantiniketanBasak, Tapan Kumar, Rabindranath- Santiniketan-Sriniketan (An Introduction), p. 36, B.B.Publication A Brahma mandir was established at Santiniketan on 21 December 1891 (7 Poush 1298 according to the Bengali calendar). A small fair was organised in 1894 in connection with the establishment anniversary of the Brahma mandir, in the ground opposite the mandir. What started as a small homely Poush Mela now attracts attention of not only the people of Birbhum district but tourists from all around.Ghosh, Swapan Kumar, Santiniketan-Visva Bharati ‚Äì Birbhumer Srestha Tirtha, Paschim Banga, February 2006, (in Bengali), Birbhum special issue, p. 250, Information and Culture department, Govt. of West Bengal In earlier days the mela (fair) was held in the ground on the north side of Brahma mandir (also referred to as glass temple). On that day, a firework display was held in earlier days after evening prayers. As the mela increased in size, it was shifted to the field in Purbapalli. Inauguration Poush Utsav is inaugurated on 7 Poush (around 23 December). At dawn, Santiniketan wakes up to the soft music of shehnai. The first to enter the scenario is the Vaitalik group, who go round the ashrama (hermitage) singing songs. It is followed by a prayer-meeting at Chhatimtala. Then the entire congregation moves on to Uttarayan singing songs. Other days Poush Mela is characterized by the live performances of Bengali folk music, especially the baul music. It includes folk songs, dances and tribal sports. This fair offers a perfect insight of the true heritage of the state. The students of Santiniketan present their magnificent performance and make this festival more enjoyable and glamorous. Each day of this festival is filled with different activities. The last day of this fair is devoted to those who are related to Santiniketan. The fair Some 1,500 stalls take part in the fair. The number of tourists pouring in for the three-day fair is around 10,000. Government statistics put the daily inflow of tourists in to Santiniketan at around 3,500 per day; but during major festival such as Pous Utsav, Basanta Utsav, Rabindra Paksha, and Naba Barsha it goes up to an average 40,000 per day or more.

Biography He studied medicine at Perugia, Bologna and Florence, and in 1894 was appointed head of the Physiology Institute at the University of Genoa. In 1900 he was relieved of his position at Genoa because of narcotics usage and fiscal improprieties. Later, he sought employment as a doctor with the Belgian colonial medical service, and spent some time working in the Belgian Congo. Oddi died on March 22, 1913 in Tunis, Tunisia. While still a student, in 1887, 23-year-old Oddi described a small group of circular and longitudinal muscle fibers that wrapped around the end of the bile and pancreatic ducts in 1887. This structure was later to be known as the eponymous \\"sphincter of Oddi\\". Oddi was not the original discoverer of the sphincter; English physician Francis Glisson initially identified it two centuries earlier, however it was Oddi who was first able to characterize its physiological properties.

It was operated by the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps. Only a small number were produced and only seven were mounted; in 1922 and 1940 the US Navy surplussed a number of their own 16-inch/50 guns, which were mated to modified M1919 carriages and filled the need for additional weapons.  History  The first US 16-inch (406 mm) gun started construction in 1895 at Watervliet Arsenal.1901 German article on the 16-inch gun M1895 It was known as the M1895 and completed in 1902; only one was built. It was mounted on a disappearing carriage in Fort Grant on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal Zone in 1914, where it served until scrapped in 1943.Berhow, pp. 168-169, 221 The weapon's muzzle section was displayed at the Watervliet Arsenal museum, which closed in 2013.Article on closure of Watervliet museum 16 in Mark III coastal defense gun on a proof mount at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. The second 16-inch (406 mm) gun was the United States Army 50 caliber Model 1919 (M1919). The first of these was deployed to Fort Michie, Great Gull Island, New York on a unique all-around-fire M1917 disappearing carriage, with elevation increased from 15¬∞ to 30¬∞. An additional six of the Army-designed M1919 guns were built and deployed by 1927 in two-gun batteries on barbette carriages in the harbor defenses of Boston (Fort Duvall), New York City (Fort Tilden), and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (Fort Weaver).Berhow, pp. 170-173, 224 The 16-inch gun M1919 was built using the wire-wound method, common in Europe but rare in the United States.DiGiulian, Tony, Navweaps.com 16-inch Mk 2 and Mk 3 page Based on the Coast Artillery's experience operating heavy weapons in World War I, especially the French-made 400 mm (15.75 inch) Mod√®le 1916 railway howitzer, the M1919 barbette carriage was designed with an elevation of 65¬∞ to allow plunging fire as enemy ships approached.Miller, Vol. II, p. 109Ordnance, pp. 147-149 In 1922, the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty caused the US Navy to cancel the battleships and the s, surplusing 16-inch/50 caliber Mark II and Mark III barrels. Initially, 20 guns were transferred to the Army, which built a new version of the M1919 mount for the naval guns. With funding lacking until 1940, five batteries of two guns each were built 1924-40 in the harbor defenses of Pearl Harbor, Panama (Pacific side), and San Francisco.Berhow, p. 224 In 1940 a near-fiasco was experienced in designing the Iowa-class battleships, and a new gun, the 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun, had to be designed for them, as they could not accommodate the Mark 2 and Mark 3 guns.Friedman Battleships, pp. 311-313 With war on the horizon, the Navy released the approximately 50 remaining guns, and on 27 July 1940 the Army's Harbor Defense Board recommended the construction of 27 16-inch two-gun batteries to protect strategic points along the US coastline, all to be casemated against air attack, as were almost all of the older 16-inch batteries by this time. A casemated 16-inch gun. Almost all batteries were casemated by 1940, including the M1919 gun batteries in New York and near Boston. Typical of this plan were the guns placed to protect Narragansett Bay; two 16-inch guns in Battery Gray, Fort Church, Little Compton, Rhode Island, with two more in Battery Hamilton, Fort Greene, Point Judith, Narragansett, Rhode Island. A second battery of 16-inch guns at Fort Greene, Battery 109, had construction suspended in 1943 and never received guns. These batteries were placed such that they not only protected Narraganset Bay, but interdicted the main channels into Buzzards Bay and the east end of Long Island Sound. By late 1943, the threat of a naval attack on the United States had diminished, and with two or four 16-inch guns in most harbor defenses, construction and arming of further batteries was suspended. As 16-inch guns and a companion improved 6-inch gun were emplaced, older weapons were scrapped. About 21 16-inch gun batteries were completed 1941-44, but not all of these were armed.Berhow, p. 225 With the war over in 1945, most of the remaining coast defense guns, including the recently emplaced 16-inch weapons, were scrapped by 1948.

The Seventeen Rules 1) Each person should follow the path designated by Heaven (Buddha, the Gods). 2) You should always be kind to people. You should always be devoted to loving people. 3) The teaching of Medicine should be restricted to selected persons. 4) You should not tell others what you are taught, regarding treatments without permission. 5) You should not establish association with doctors who do not belong to this school. 6) All the successors and descendants of the disciples of this school shall follow the teachers' ways. 7) If any disciples cease the practice of Medicine, or, if successors are not found at the death of the disciple, all the medical books of this school should be returned to the School of Enjuin. 8) You should not kill living creatures, nor should you admire hunting or fishing. 9) In our school, teaching about poisons is prohibited, nor should you receive instructions about poisons from other physicians. Moreover, you should not give abortives to the people. 10) You should rescue even such patients as you dislike or hate. You should do virtuous acts, but in such a way that they do not become known to people. To do good deeds secretly is a mark of virtue. 11) You should not exhibit avarice and you must not strain to become famous. You should not rebuke or reprove a patient, even if he does not present you with money or goods in gratitude. 12) You should be delighted if, after treating a patient without success, the patient receives medicine from another physician, and is cured. 13) You should not speak ill of other physicians. 14) You should not tell what you have learned from the time you enter a woman's room, and, moreover, you should not have obscene or immoral feelings when examining a woman. 15) Proper or not, you should not tell others what you have learned in lectures, or what you have learned about prescribing medicine. 16) You should not like undue extravagance. If you like such living, your avarice will increase, and you will lose the ability to be kind to others. 17) If you do not keep the rules and regulations of this school, then you will be cancelled as a disciple.

The 75th Ohio was initially led by Col. Nathaniel C. McLean, Lt. Col. Robert A. Constable and Maj. Robert Reily. The regiment began its service with 984 officers and men. Among the enlistees was future U.S. Congressman Henry Lee Morey. The 75th was initially sent to augment the Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia. It soon participated in defending what became known as Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign. On May 8, 1862, at the Battle of McDowell, the regiment lost 87 men. It fought again at Cross Keys before being sent eastward to reinforce the Union troops after the Peninsula Campaign. The 75th OVI then participated in the subsequent Northern Virginia Campaign and fought in the Second Battle of Bull Run, where it lost 113 men. Within a month, it saw action at the Battle of South Mountain in Central Maryland. =1863 - Chancellorsville= During the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, the 75th Ohio was part of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division of the XI Corps in the Army of the Potomac. During the battle, the XI Corps was far from the Confederate army, so their commander, Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard did not have them dig defenses in case of an attack despite being ordered to do so by Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. On May 2, Confederate General Robert E. Lee decided on a daring and very risky plan. Knowing the XI Corps was not prepared for an attack, he sent General Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson and his Second Corps of 28,000 men on a 12-mile march around the Union right flank with the hope of catching the XI Corps by surprise. At 4:30 in the afternoon, the 75th's commander, Col. Robert Reily, had heard reports of a Confederate movement in his direction. Unlike many other commanders, including General Howard, Reily did not dismiss them. He prepared the 75th Ohio for an attack he knew was coming. He had his men lie down and rest by their guns and wait for the attack. Within a half-hour, Jackson's Corps rushed out of the thick underbrush. When Jackson's corps struck at about 5 p.m., the XI Corps was completely unprepared, many of the men engaged in eating supper. Most of the XI Corps was taken by surprise and broke for the rear without firing a shot. As other men of the XI Corps ran by in a panic, the 75th Ohio stood and fired back at the Confederates. They kept up the fire for ten minutes until the Confederates had overwhelmed their lines forcing them to retreat. In those ten minutes, Colonel Reily was killed, while 150 other men of the 75th Ohio were killed or wounded. =1863 - Gettysburg= At the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1‚Äì3, 1863, the 75th Ohio, now under the command of Colonel Andrew L. Harris (future 44th Governor of Ohio), arrived with the rest of the XI Corps on the battlefield mid-day on July 1, 1863, the first day of the battle. The fighting had been going on since morning. As part of Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow's division, the 75th Ohio took a defensive position on Blocher's Knoll (now known as Barlow's Knoll), north of the town. Unfortunately, this slight rise in the terrain was too far forward in comparison to the other XI Corps divisions, and Barlow's position formed a salient that could be attacked from multiple sides. Confederate Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell sent two brigades, those of Brig. Gen. George P. Doles and Brig. Gen. John B. Gordon, in a frontal assault on the knoll. Barlow's division was overwhelmed, suffering serious losses, and Barlow was wounded and left on the field for dead. Harris led his men in a successful withdrawal through the hotly contested streets to Cemetery Hill, where they entrenched on the northeastern slope. Harris took command of the 2nd Brigade after its commander, Brig. Gen. Adelbert Ames, took Barlow's place as commander of the 1st Division. At around 7:30 at night on July 2, the 75th Ohio, positioned between the 25th Ohio Infantry and the 17th Connecticut Infantry regiments, now on a brickyard lane at the base of East Cemetery Hill, held off attacks by regiments of Brig. Gen. Harry T. Hays' \\"Louisiana Tigers\\" brigade. Overall, the Buckeyes lost 186 officers and men (16 killed, 74 wounded and 96 missing) at Gettysburg.Busey & Martin. =Actions later in the war= In August, the 75th OVI was transferred to Charleston Harbor, remaining in the trenches in South Carolina until September. The 75th then moved to Folly Island, and then to Florida, where the men were mounted and designated as mounted infantry. The regiment served in Florida until the close of the war, participating in the Battle of Gainesville on August 17. Six companies were mustered out in October and November 1864, while the veterans remained in the service until August 1865. Monuments Wainwright Avenue. There are two combined monuments to the 25th and the 75th Ohio Regiments in the Gettysburg National Military Park. One is north of Gettysburg on East Howard Avenue on Barlow's Knoll (their position on the First Day).

A t-path is defined as a path through the graph with weight at most t times the spatial distance between its endpoints. The parameter t is called the stretch factor or dilation factor of the spanner.. In computational geometry, the concept was first discussed by L.P. Chew in 1986,. although the term \\"spanner\\" was not used in the original paper. The notion of graph spanners has been known in graph theory: t-spanners are spanning subgraphs of graphs with similar dilation property, where distances between graph vertices are defined in graph-theoretical terms. Therefore geometric spanners are graph spanners of complete graphs embedded in the plane with edge weights equal to the distances between the embedded vertices in the corresponding metric. Spanners may be used in computational geometry for solving some proximity problems. They have also found applications in other areas, such as in motion planning, in telecommunication networks: network reliability, optimization of roaming in mobile networks, etc. Different spanners and quality measures There are different measures which can be used to analyze the quality of a spanner. The most common measures are edge count, total weight and maximum vertex degree. Asymptotically optimal values for these measures are O(n) edges, O(MST) weight and O(1) maximum degree (here MST denotes the weight of the minimum spanning tree). Finding a spanner in the Euclidean plane with minimal dilation over n points with at most m edges is known to be NP-hard.. Many spanner algorithms exist which excel in different quality measures. Fast algorithms include the WSPD spanner and the Theta graph which both construct spanners with a linear number of edges in O(n \\\\log n) time. If better weight and vertex degree is required the Greedy spanner can be computed in near quadratic time. The Theta graph The Theta graph or \\\\Theta-graph belongs to the family of cone- based spanners. The basic method of construction involves partitioning the space around each vertex into a set of cones, which themselves partition the remaining vertices of the graph. Like Yao Graphs, a \\\\Theta-graph contains at most one edge per cone; where they differ is how that edge is selected. Whereas Yao Graphs will select the nearest vertex according to the metric space of the graph, the \\\\Theta-graph defines a fixed ray contained within each cone (conventionally the bisector of the cone) and selects the nearest neighbour with respect to orthogonal projections to that ray. The greedy spanner The greedy spanner or greedy graph is defined as the graph resulting from repeatedly adding an edge between the closest pair of points without a t-path. Algorithms which compute this graph are referred to as greedy spanner algorithms. From the construction it trivially follows that the greedy graph is a t-spanner. The greedy spanner was first discovered in 1989 independently by Alth√∂fer and Bern (unpublished). The greedy spanner achieves asymptotically optimal edge count, total weight and maximum vertex degree and also performs best on these measures in practice. It can be constructed in O(n^2 \\\\log n) time using O(n^2) space. The Delaunay triangulation Chew's main result was that for a set of points in the plane there is a triangulation of this pointset such that for any two points there is a path along the edges of the triangulation with length at most \\\\scriptstyle\\\\sqrt 10 the Euclidean distance between the two points. The result was applied in motion planning for finding reasonable approximations of shortest paths among obstacles. The best upper bound known for the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation is that it is a \\\\scriptstyle{(4\\\\sqrt{3}/9)\\\\pi} \\\\approx 2.418-spanner for its vertices.. The lower bound has been increased from \\\\scriptstyle{{\\\\pi}/2} to just over that, to 1.5846 .  Well-separated pair decomposition  A spanner may be constructed from a well-separated pair decomposition in the following way. Construct the graph with the point set S as vertex set and for each pair \\\\\\\\{A, B\\\\\\\\} in a WSPD, add an edge from an arbitrary point a \\\\in A to an arbitrary point b \\\\in B. Note that the resulting graph has a linear number of edges because a WSPD has a linear number of pairs. We need these two properties of the WSPD: Lemma 1: Let \\\\\\\\{A, B\\\\\\\\} be a well-separated pair with respect to s. Let p, p' \\\\in A and q \\\\in B. Then, pp' \\\\leq (2/s)pq. Lemma 2: Let \\\\\\\\{A, B\\\\\\\\} be a well-separated pair with respect to s. Let p, p' \\\\in A and q, q' \\\\in B. Then, p'q' \\\\leq (1+ 4/s)pq. Let \\\\\\\\{A, B\\\\\\\\} be a well-separated pair with respect to s in a WSPD. Let [a, b] be the edge connecting A to B. Let any point p \\\\in A and q \\\\in B. Because of the definition of the WSPD, it is only necessary to prove that there is a t-spanner path, or t-path for short, between p and q noted P_{pq}. Let the length of the path P_{pq} be noted P_{pq}. Suppose there is a t-path between any pair of points which distance is less than or equal to pq and that s > 2. From the triangle inequality, the assumptions and the fact that pa \\\\leq (2/s)pq \\\\Rightarrow pa < pq and bq \\\\leq (2/s)pq \\\\Rightarrow bq < pq according to Lemma 1, we have: P_{pq} \\\\leq tpa + ab + tbq From Lemma 1 and 2, we obtain: \\\\begin{align} P_{pq} & \\\\leq t(2/s)pq + (1+4/s)pq + t(2/s)pq  & = t(4/s)pq + (1+4/s)pq  & = \\\\left(\\\\frac{4t+4}{s}\\\\right)pq + pq  & = \\\\left(\\\\frac{4(t+1)}{s}+1\\\\right)pq \\\\end{align} So what we want is: \\\\begin{align} t & = \\\\frac{4(t+1)}{s}+1  t-1 & = \\\\frac{4(t+1)}{s}  s(t-1) & = 4(t+1)  s(t-1) - 4(t+1) & = 0  st - s - 4t - 4 & = 0  t(s-4) - s - 4 & = 0  t(s-4) & = s+4  t & = \\\\frac{s+4}{s-4} \\\\end{align} So, if t = (s+4)/(s-4) and s > 4, then we have a t-spanner for the point set S. According to the proof, it is then possible to have an arbitrary value for t by isolating s from t = (s+4)/(s-4) which gives s = 4(t+1)/(t-1).

Multiple tree hollows in a plane tree in Baden, Austria A tree hollow or tree hole is a semi-enclosed cavity which has naturally formed in the trunk or branch of a tree. They are found mainly in old trees, whether living or not. Hollows form in many species of trees, and are a prominent feature of natural forests and woodlands, and act as a resource or habitat for a number of vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Hollows may form as the result of physiological stress from natural forces causing the excavating and exposure of the heartwood. Forces including wind, fire, heat, lightning, rain, attack from insects (such as ants or beetles), bacteria, or fungi. Also, trees may self-prune, dropping lower branches as they reach maturity, exposing the area where the branch was attached. Many animals further develop the hollows using instruments such as their beak, teeth or claws. The size of hollows may depend on the age of the tree. For example, eucalypts develop hollows at all ages, but only from when the trees are 120 years old do they form hollows suitable for vertebrates, and it may take 220 years for hollows suitable for larger species to form. Hollows in fallen timber are also very important for animals such as echidnas, numbats, chuditch and many reptiles. In streams, hollow logs may be important to aquatic animals for shelter and egg attachment. Hollows are an important habitat for many wildlife species, especially where the use of hollows is obligate, as this means no other resource would be a feasible substitute. Animals may use hollows as diurnal or nocturnal shelter sites, as well as for rearing young, feeding, thermoregulation, and to facilitate ranging behaviour and dispersal. While use may also be opportunistic, rather than obligate, it may be difficult to determine the nature of a species' relationship to hollows‚Äîit may vary across a species' range, or depend on climatic conditions. Animals will select a hollow based on factors including entrance size and shape, depth, and degree of insulation. Such factors greatly affect the frequency and seasonality of hollow use. Includes a list of Victorian hollow-using animals. Especially in Europe, entomologists are interested in the use of hollows by invertebrates. One beetle associated with hollow trees, Osmoderma eremita, has been given the highest priority according to the European Union's Habitat Directive.  Description  Indian spotted owlet in tree hollow A tree hollow is a cavity in a living tree. Tree holes can be caused when an injury to the tree, such as breakage of a limb, creates an opening through the bark and exposes the sapwood. The sapwood is attacked by fungi and bacteria, which form a cavity in the bole of the tree. The resulting cavity can fill with water, thus becoming a type of phytotelma. Therefore, there are wet and dry tree holes. Tree holes are important habitats for many animals, such as Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae, the common merganser, toucans, woodpeckers, and bluebirds. Tree holes can be important in the maintenance and spread of some diseases, for example La Crosse encephalitis.Derraik, J.G.B. & A.C.G. Heath. 2005.

Cambridge University Press, New York. xiii + 431 pp. . Hollows may be an adaptive trait for trees as animals provide the host tree with fertilizer.  Artificial hollows  Animals have been found to use artificial structures as substitutes for hollows. For example, pygmy possums in the chute of a grain silo; or pardalotes in the top, horizontal pipe of a children's swing. Purpose built nest boxes, such as birdhouses and bat tubes,, Vol. 5, No. 2, July/August 2002 are also constructed for conservation and for wildlife observation. The size of the nest box, entry hole and placement height may be chosen in consideration of certain species. Natural hollows are still generally preferred for habitat conservation.  Around the world  Conservation of hollow-using fauna is an issue in many parts of the world. In North America, recovery of the eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) has required nest boxes due to the loss of natural hollows. The scarcity of dead, hollow-bearing trees in Scandinavian forests is a key threatening process to native bird life. In Sweden, almost half of red- listed species are dependent on dead hollow-bearing trees or logs. = Australia = In Australia, 304 vertebrate species are known to use tree hollows in Australia: 29 amphibians, 78 reptiles, 111 birds, 86 mammals. Includes table of animal groups. Approximately 100 of these are now rare, threatened or near-threatened on Australian State or Commonwealth legislation, in part because of the removal of hollow-bearing trees. Threats to hollows include: native forest silviculture, firewood collection, rural dieback (such as from inundation and salinity), grazing by cattle, and land clearing. Additionally, pest and introduced species such as the common myna and western honey bee (Apis mellifera) compete with native species for hollows; domestic and feral cats and black rats prey on hollow-using animals and have been damaging especially to island populations; and some native hollow-using species have increased population densities or expanded their ranges since European settlement, such as the galah, common brushtail possum and the little corella and compete with less common native species. = Russia, China, Korea = Asian black bears, also known as Himalayan bears (Lat.: Ursus thibetanus), in northern parts of their range, such as Russian province Primorye, China, and both Koreas, prefer spend winter periods in large tree hollows, where females also give birth to cubs. Threats include massive deforestation in these countries, combined with direct poaching of wintering bears‚Äîwith selective destruction of the best hollow trees.https://web.archive.org/web/20091027160301/http://www.geocities.com/new_jalsomino/dens_engl.html (dead link) In Russia, attempts (sometimes successful) are made to restore such broken trees.Denning trees of Himalayan bears are being restored in Primorye. (in Russian; Cyrillic Windows-1251) Unfortunately, only a small portion of all damaged trees can be restored in Primorye, where forests are basically logged without taking to account needs of large fauna.

It was eventually superseded by an iron tower on the same foundation. History This light was built in 1868 as part of a project to mark the Brewerton Channel, which had been excavated in the 1850s to provide a fixed deepwater channel into Baltimore Harbor. It served as the front of a pair of range lights, with the Leading Point Light serving as the rear. Like most lights constructed on the bay in this period, Hawkins Point was a screw-pile structure, but of a unique configuration. The square foundation had an outrigger on each side, so that the rectangular house, viewed from above, appeared to sit diagonally on its base. As originally built, it housed two lights. The range light itself shone from a window in the second story of the house, while a second beacon was mounted in a tower on the roof. This tower was removed in the early 1900s, leaving a curiously truncated roofline. In 1924 the house was removed, and a skeletal tower erected on the iron foundation. This light continues to serve as the front light of the Brewerton Channel Range, but it no longer is given a name in navigational charts.

It also houses the Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital School of Midwifery, one of the best performing institutions recognized by the Professional Regulation Commission in the Midwife Licensure Examinations. In 2015, the World Health Organization recognized the hospital \\"as a role model of the World Health Organization-Western Pacific Region Office for its essential newborn care programs, which have been proven to reduce infant morbidity and mortality\\". History The Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital started as a six-bed capacity clinic called the \\"Maternity House\\" on November 9, 1920. This clinic, which was founded by then Chairman of Public Welfare Board, Dr. Jose F. Fabella, was originally located at Sampaloc, Manila. In 1922, the clinic added a pediatric section and a school of midwifery. In 1931, the control of the clinic was shifted to the Bureau of Health and again to the Bureau of Hospitals in 1947. It was in 1951 when the clinic was transferred to its present location in Santa Cruz, Manila. Unlike other Philippine government hospitals, there were no legislative act that permitted the creation of the hospital. Its present location was only legitimized by Administrative Order no. 140, which was issued by President Manuel L. Quezon on February 19, 1941. The Administrative Order recommended that the Bilibid Hospital will be used as a maternity hospital. On June 15, 1968 when the Maternity and Children's Hospital was renamed as Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital in honor of the hospital's founder. To date, it has an authorized bed capacity of 700. The Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital School of Midwifery is housed within the hospital. It is a government institution managed by the Department of Health. Modernization Plan A building of the same name located at the Lung Center of the Philippines compound was erected to serve as temporary office of the hospital. A new building will then be erected under the proposed tri-medical complex in the DOH headquarters, where San Lazaro Hospital and Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center are located. \\"Baby Factory\\" The hospital is considered as a \\"baby factory\\" and ground zero of the Philippines‚Äô overpopulation crisis. The reputation of the hospital as a baby factory is well justified as no other hospital in the country has a higher birth rate. The maternity ward at the Hospital continues to overflow with hundreds of new mothers. Not enough beds for everyone, so four or five mothers share one bed. The hospital suffers from extreme heat during the summer. Fabella caters to the greater Manila area, and even at the height of storms and typhoons, some women would brave the floods just to come to Fabella. This is because, compared to most hospitals (even in some provinces), Fabella is one of the most affordable places to give birth. If you can withstand the population, the heat and the rumors about baby exchanges in the ward or in the delivery room. This is a media fabrication as hospital staff know well that babies even before they are even seen by the doctor after coming out of their mothers are already attached 2 tags on the ankle and one the wrist which makes it nearly impossible to mistake a baby. Mothers are also given these ID tags just to make sure the child is being given to the right mother. So the baby factory term is true as also back in the early 2000s there were quite a few staff members working in each area. Nowadays, there are more staff members as there are more patients also but the RN Heals program give way for more staff to stay with the veteran staff as well as the hospital's way of helping a number of fresh nursing graduates to earn their experiences as a stepping stone in case they search for greener pastures. Areas of the hospital Since it is a mother and baby care hospital, all wards cater to mothers and babies only. Ward 1 is specifically for abortion, gynecology, and oncology cases. Ward 2 is for High-Risk mothers waiting to give birth, and are under observation due to some common pregnancy complications like hypertension, placenta-previa, abruptio placentae. Like Ward 1, Ward 2 is divided into several areas. There is the Kangaroo Mother care area. The mothers who stay here have babies who are born underweight and need to be in the NICU. This way, the mothers can nurture their children confined to the NICU until discharge. The Maternal High Risk area usually houses patients who are hypertensive, hypokalemic or diabetic. The ICU can only accommodate a much smaller number of patients. Caesarian patients who have fewer complications stay in Ward 3. It is the second most populous ward in the hospital, sometimes numbering more than 100 sets of mother-and-baby patients. Patients who have normal delivery are found in Ward 4. This is the most populous ward and patients have been known to reach more than 300 pairs most especially on the \\"ber\\" (September to December) months. The aforementioned wards are separate from the NICU, where most of the babies are taken care shortly after birth. This area alone is divided into several smaller areas, where babies are placed depending on the patient condition and/or complication. There is the pediatric ward located in a separate building, which is still a part of the hospital. This department caters to most pediatric cases. More specialized cases are sent to neighboring hospitals where they can be treated with better equipment and staff. The emergency area where expectant mothers are assessed and admitted before they are sent to either the MHR, Labor room or in the wards The OR Complex is made up of 4 operating rooms, 1 delivery room (which can accommodate 12-20 laboring patients at any given time), a Labor room with around 5-8 beds, a post- anesthesia Care Room (recovery room) which can accommodate around 5‚Äì8 patients. The operating room mostly operates on Caesarian sections and rare gynecology cases and even rarer Pediatric cases. Pediatric cases where done by a visiting pediatric surgeon before. Consultants with mixed specializations also visit the hospital to guide the residents as this hospital is mostly a resident-reliant hospital. Usually one consultant is present at any given time to guide a specific team he/she is assigned to. There is also an out-patient clinic in the hospital where expectant mothers undergo routine tests in order to assess fetal and mother well-being.

At the same time, the Cunard Line was moving into the cruise market because the increasing popularity of international flights meant that its transatlantic passenger services were no longer viable. Ship history Launch of Cunard Ambassador, March 16, 1972 Cunard Ambassador in Key West after an on-board fire, September 1974 Because of the cost of the eight-ship project, Overseas National Airways soon ran into financial troubles and was forced to abandon it. Cunard saw the opportunity and quickly took the project on, soon reducing the order to two ships, which it christened Cunard Adventurer (1971) and Cunard Ambassador (1972). Both ships were intended for seven-day cruises, including New York City to Bermuda, San Juan to other Caribbean ports, and Vancouver to Alaska during the summer seasons. The two ships were less successful than intended. Cunard Adventurer was soon sold and became Sunward II and later Triton; Cunard Ambassador was withdrawn from Cunard service on September 12, 1974 after a fire on a positioning trip. There were no passengers on board and no fatalities but, after being towed to Key West, the ship was declared a total loss. She was bought as a gutted hull and refitted to become the Danish sheep carrier, Linda Clausen later the same year. In 1980, she was sold again and became Procyon. In April 1981 she again caught fire, whilst bunkering in Singapore; the salvors Smit, SISEA and SELCO successfully fought the fire. The ship was again repaired and, in 1983, renamed Raslan. In 1983, only a year after being rechristened Raslan, she suffered another devastating fire in the Indian Ocean. The former Cunard Ambassador was beyond economic repair and, after only thirteen years of service, two of which were with Cunard, she was sold to Taiwanese ship breakers and scrapped. Influence Shortly after the sale of Cunard Adventurer and the first fire on Cunard Ambassador, Cunard planned two new ships, Cunard Countess and Cunard Conquest, later changed to Cunard Princess. The design incorporated many features of the failed Adventurer and Ambassador including a similar sleek profile and angular funnel and the white-painted hull.

He was employed as a court painter and worked for the local elite in Brussels. He is considered to be a member of the Sonian Forest school of landscape painters, which included landscape painters such as Jacques d'Arthois and Cornelis Huysmans. These painters working in Brussels had a preference for depicting scenes from the Sonian Forest near Brussels.Hans Devisscher. \\"Alsloot, Denijs van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 25 August 2017 Van Alsloot was also a specialist in depicting civil processions, local festivals and ceremonies.Jonathan Israel, Conflicts of Empires: Spain, the Low Countries and the Struggle for World Supremacy, 1585‚Äì1713, A&C; Black, 1 July 1997, p. 20 Life Tobias and the angel, with Hendrick de Clerck Van Alsloot was born in Mechelen or possibly Brussels. His father was a tapestry worker. It is not known who was his teacher. He is first recorded in official records when he joined the Brussels Guild of St Luke in 1599 as a tapestry designer. He also took his first pupil in 1599. He trained a further three apprentices between 1599 and 1625. Van Alsloot was exclusively working on the design of tapestries until 1606, the year in which he signed his first painting. Alsloot's career started to take off from the early 17th century after he was appointed court painter to Albert and Isabella, the governors of the Spanish Netherlands. He became a painter to the elite and served a clientele of princes, courtesans and influential state officials. He was still alive in 1626 as is testified by a painting dated in that year. He must have died in or before 1628 as two works he had left as inheritance to a niece were bought in 1628 by the Archduchess Isabella. Work Van Alsloot started out in the same profession as his father as a designer of cartoons for the local tapestry works in Brussels. Denys van Alsloot, Summer Landscape with a Lady and Gentleman and Seated and Sportsmen returning with Game, in: Dutch and Flemish Old Master, at Johnny Van Haeften In 1603 he designed a series of tapestries of Grotesques for the Archdukes.Thomas P. Campbell, Pascal-Fran√ßois Bertrand, Jeri Bapasola, 'Tapestry in the Baroque: Threads of Splendor', Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1 Jan 2007, p.68 Forest landscape with a distant castle His painting career seems to have started around 1606. He mainly painted landscapes and scenes of local festivals and ceremonies. His work can be regarded as transitory in the development of landscape art in the early 17th century. All his known dated works were made in Brussels between 1606 and 1626. He often signed his works with the addition of 'S.A.Pic.'. This is short for 'Serenissorum Archiducum Pictor', a reference to his official position as a court painter to Archduke Albert and Archduchess Isabella.Denis van Alsloot, Flight into Egypt at Sotheby's Van Alsloot painted topographically accurate as well as imaginary landscapes, including summer and winter landscapes. Like later landscape painters in Brussels such as Lucas Achtschellinck, Lodewijk de Vadder and Jacques d'Arthois, van Alsloot drew inspiration from the Sonian Forest near Brussels. His forested landscapes often incorporate views of castles and abbeys located in the Sonian Forest near Brussels. As van Alsloot's works are generally topographically accurate, it is possible to identify places that still survive, especially near the abbeys of Groenendael and Ter Kameren. His series of views of the abbeys in the Sonian Forest was presumably made on commission for the Archduke Albert. He painted several versions of the winter view of Groenendael, all with differences as well as a few summer views.Denis van Alsloot, A View of the Abbey of Groenendael Near Brussels in Winter at Sotheby‚Äôs Paradise with the Four Elements, with Hendrick de Clerck Some of his works have an archaic feeling and appear inspired by landscape painting of the 16th century. The style of his landscape paintings shows an affinity with the work of Gillis van Coninxloo. In comparison to van Coninxloo, van Alsloot‚Äôs work is calmer and more static, uses a softer palette and is more precise of touch and more realistic. As such his work appears to be a synthesis of the styles of van Coninxloo and Jan Brueghel the Elder. He also produced a number of landscape drawings that were likely intended as independent works of art. An example is the Forest Landscape with a Distant Castle of 1608 in the J. Paul Getty Museum, which is a fully developed and refined composition of a forest landscape with a view on buildings in the distance. The scenes in his landscape art often depict an actual site with topographical correctness and precision.Denis van Alsloot ‚Äì Forest Landscape with a Distant Castle in: George R. Goldner, Lee Hendrix, Kelly Pask, European Drawings 2: Catalogue of the Collections, Getty Publications, 8 October 1992 He was also commissioned by the court of Albert and Isabella to paint views of their estates at Mariemont and Tervuren and of the Abbey of Groenendael. He often collaborated with Hendrick de Clerck who painted the staffage in his landscape and mythological works. These landscapes contained mythological or biblical figures and were typically signed by both painters. There exist landscapes by van Alsloot not co-signed by the two painters in which the staffage was likely also made by de Clerck. The figures painted by de Clerck were draped in vividly coloured clothing, which clashed with the brown-green tonality of the landscape painted by Alsloot. The Ommegang in Brussels He received commissions to make paintings of local festivals and ceremonies. His most valuable commission by Archduchess Isabella was a series of eight paintings commemorating the Ommegang procession held in Brussels on 31 May 1615 for which he received 10,000 guilders. He received the commission before September 1615. It is likely that only six of the originally commissioned eight works were eventually executed. These were kept at the Archduchess' palace of Tervuren, located north-east of Brussels.The Ommeganck in Brussels on 31 May 1615: The Senior Guilds at the Victoria and Albert Museum Two of the six paintings of the Ommegang painted by van Alsloot are considered lost. Of the surviving works, two are in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and two in the Prado Museum in Madrid. One of the paintings held in the Victoria and Albert Museum was split in two at an unknown date. An undivided copy of it made around 1635 is in the collection of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, while a copy of one of the halves is held by the Prado Museum. Artistically the works are not very remarkable as they mainly served a documentary, rather than an artistic, purpose. The paintings offer historians an interesting insight into this type of festivity. That year's Ommegang procession was particularly festive since two weeks earlier, at the jay- shooting ceremony of the Crossbowmen‚Äôs guild, Isabella had successfully shot the jay that had been attached to the spire of the Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon. She was then crowned Queen of the guild. A View of the Abbey of Groenendael near Brussels in winter It is assumed that Isabella had a political motive in ordering the series of paintings of the Ommegang. As her husband was ailing and likely to die soon, she wanted to show the court in Spain that she was regarded by the inhabitants of the Spanish Netherlands as their 'natural princess' and should therefore by allowed to continue to rule the Spanish Netherlands after her husband‚Äôs death. For this reason, she sent some of the pictures of the Ommegang to the court in Spain. At the same time, the Brussels elites used the Ommegang for their own political purposes as it was a demonstration to the other sections of society in Brussels that they had the support of the Archduchess. The city of Brussels and the Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon, the church around which the Ommegang revolved, ordered copies of the paintings.Robert Stein, Judith Pollmann, Networks, Regions and Nations: Shaping Identities in the Low Countries, 1300‚Äì1650, Brill, 2010, pp. 145‚Äì146 References Further reading *Van Sprang, Sabine, Denijs Van Alsloot (Vers 1568? ‚Äì 1625/26): Peintre Paysagiste Au Service De La Cour Des Archiducs Albert Et Isabelle, Brepols Publishers, 31 Oct 2014 External links * Category:1570s births Category:1620s deaths Category:Flemish Renaissance painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:People from Mechelen Category:Flemish tapestry artists Category:Members of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Denis van Alsloot"},{"id":"11844487","text":"Lynn Colliar (born 22 November 1967) is a Canadian television anchor.

It takes its name from the town of Bazas in the d√©partement of the Gironde, in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of south-western France, and originates in the low- lying areas to the south of the River Garonne near that town. A festival, the F√™te des Boeufs Gras, is held each year in Bazas to present fattened Bazadaise stock.  History  The Bazadaise or Grise de Bazas is a traditional draught breed of the Pyr√©n√©es and the Gironde, in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of south-western France. It is thought to result from inter-breeding of local cattle of Aquitaine with others of Spanish origin. It is named for the town of Bazas in the Gironde, and is still strongly associated with it: an annual festival, the , is held each year in Bazas to celebrate and present the Bazadaise and its meat, which is heavily marbled and renowned for its tenderness and flavour. A herd-book for the Bazadaise was established on 31 July 1896. The breed was formerly numerous: there were about 60 000 head in 1940. In the years after the Second World War, the mechanisation of agriculture and more extensive cultivation of cereal crops in the region both contributed to a rapid decline in numbers. By 1970 only 700 cows remained, and efforts to recover and conserve the breed began. In 2013 there were about 3400 cows, in more than 140 farms. The Bazadaise has been exported to Australia, Chile, Spain and the United Kingdom. Exported stock has been both raised pure- bred, and used for cross-breeding.  Characteristics  The Bazadaise is uni- coloured grey, with some variations due to sex and age. The skin is black, the muzzle and mucous areas pale. The horns are incurved and often down-turned; they are waxy yellow at the base, black at the tips.  Use  The Bazadaise was traditionally a draught breed, used for tasks such as hauling cut wood from the forest. It is now raised for beef. The meat is heavily marbled and is renowned for its tenderness and flavour. It may be marketed under the Label Rouge denominations \\"Boeuf de Bazas\\" and \\"Boeuf de Chalosse\\".

He got his first religious education in Iraq. After returning to motherland he refused his spiritual dignity and opened a private school. Seyid Azim Shirvani continued Fuz√ªl√Æ‚Äôs traditions in his love-lyrical poems. In his satirical poems and fables Seyid Azim Shirvani ridiculed priesthood, opposed backwardness and ignorance, called to enlightenment and culture. Contemporary poets consider him their teacher. Education and Teaching Seyid Azim Shirvani was born in Shamakhi, in family of a clergyman. He lost his father early, and his grandfather undertook a care of him. For finishing the education he was sent to Baghdad and Egypt, where he got spiritual title of akhund. After returning to Shamakhi Seyid Azim Shirvani was interested in secular sciences, problems of education, and learnt Russian language. He didn‚Äôt limit himself to knowing only Persian and Arabic languages and creativity of the eastern authors, but he was also interested in European and Russian literature, acquainted with works of Pushkin, Nekrasov and other famous poets. Taking care of the nation‚Äôs progress, its spiritual emancipation, Seyid Azim opened a Russo-Azerbaijani school in Skamakhi, where was paid attention to studying of secular sciences, and also Azerbaijani and Russian languages. He read poems of Azerbaijani poets and translations of works of such poets as Saadi, Hafiz and Khayyam to his pupils instead of Quran and rules of Sharia. He taught at this school, refusing to be a clergyman. With the lapse of time his interest to social problems, to scientific knowledge changed his attitude to serving a religion. Seeing hypocrisy and sanctimony of clergymen, he was inspired by dream to dedicate himself to creativity and enlightenment of the nation, to propaganda of science and knowledge, which called dissatisfaction and hostile attitude of clergymen. Shirvani was reputed as politically disloyal person and soon he was discharged from teaching. Creativity Shirvani was in charge of literary society called ‚ÄúBeyt-us-safa‚Äù in Shamakhi. Grouping progressively aiming intelligentsia of the city around him, he communicated with analogical societies in Baku, Guba, Shusha and Ordubad. In a rich heritage of the poet was broadly represented the poems in genres of ghazal, rubai, gaside, marsiye, and also poetic stories, fables, parables, epistles, literary works. He also wrote a literature textbook. Selfless love, dream of meeting, burning boredom of lover, complaints about destiny are themes of Shirvani‚Äôs ghazals. But following of his great ancestors, especially Fuzuli‚Äôs traditions, the poet glorified not divine, but real love. Educational mind is the supreme measure of values in the creativity of Shirvani. Education should change a spiritual essence of a human, that is why communion with humanistic values means more than race and religion. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"  width=\\"50%\\" style=\\"background:#f6f6f6;\\"  Don‚Äôt say me that I‚Äôm a giaour, or a Muslim, He, who well-educated is human. } Shirvani called Caucasian Muslims to acquire knowledge of natural sciences, refuse superstition and fanaticism, follow the road of progress and cultural renaissance (‚ÄúAddress to Caucasian Muslims‚Äù poem). In connection with opening ceremony of Pushkin's monument in Moscow, in 1880, Shirvani wrote a poem to Pushkin, where he told about the great importance of poetical heritage of Russian poet for nations of East and the whole world. Decisive orientation of Shirvani to Russian culture was reflected in his creative and pedagogical activity. Satire takes an important place in Shirvani's literary heritage, which became a leading area in Azerbaijani literature in the second half of the 19th century due to the creativity of the poet. Shirvani could be called a ‚Äúfierce talent‚Äù. There is something gloomy and grotesque in his stories- parables and poems, though they are finished by optimistic and moralizing ending in traditional enlightening spirit: knowledge, strong mind, humanity, reasonable rules are called to save people from cruelty, unfairness, shabby passions and stupidity. But a light coloring, democratic atmosphere of faith in humanity of Akhundov were lost. Seyid Azim combined the best features of Akhundov's democratic government, Fuzuli and Vagif‚Äôs lyric, Zakir‚Äôs satire and followed their traditions. Seyid Azim‚Äôs poetry is notable for variety of themes and genres. His ghazals are graceful and lyric. His stories and fables are also heard sharply: ‚ÄúBribe to the God‚Äù, ‚ÄúBurial of a dog‚Äù, ‚ÄúSatan‚Äù, ‚ÄúKhan and a peasant‚Äù. Satirical poetry of Shirvani paved the way for the future development of this genre, which found implementation in M.A.Sabir‚Äôs creativity in the beginning of the 20th century.

The book is subtitled A Nicaraguan Journey and relates his travel experiences, the people he met as well as views on the political situation then facing the country. The book was written during a break the author took from writing his controversial novel, The Satanic Verses. Background After a period of political and economic turmoil under dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front (commonly known by the initial FSLN or as the Sandinistas) came to power in Nicaragua in 1979 supported by much of the populace and elements of the Catholic church. The government was initially backed by the U.S. under President Jimmy Carter, but the support evaporated under the presidency of Ronald Reagan in light of evidence that the Sandinistas were providing help to the FMLN rebels in El Salvador. The US imposed economic sanctions and a trade embargo instead which contributed to the collapse of the Nicaraguan economy in the early to mid-1980s. While the Soviet Union and Cuba funded the Nicaraguan army, the US financed the contras in neighboring Honduras with a view towards establishing a friendly government in Nicaragua. Nicaragua won a historic case against the U.S. at the International Court of Justice in 1986 (see Nicaragua v. United States), and the U.S. was ordered to pay Nicaragua some $12 billion in reparations for undermining the nation's sovereignty. It was during this period that Salman Rushdie visited Nicaragua on the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the Sandinistas rise to power. Rushdie's trip and observations Rushdie's three-week trip to Nicaragua in the summer of 1986 was at the invitation of Sandinista Association of Cultural Workers which was billed as, \\"the umbrella organisation that brought writers, artists, musicians, craftspeople, dancers and so on, together under the same roof\\". Reviews and reception In the review in Time, reviewer Pico Iyer, praised Rushdie's account that was \\"quickened by a novelist's eye\\". However Iyer felt that Rushdie was quick to overlook Sandinista totalitarianism and censorship due to his ideological sympathies with their cause. Predicting the readers' expected response, Iyer said, \\"Since his own views seem largely unchanged by what he encounters, the tourist is unlikely to change the views of his readers.

Biography Suleyman Rustam was born on March 12, 1906 in Novxanƒ± village in family of a blacksmith. He studied at Russo-Tatar school until revolution. Suleyman Rustam wrote that, Suleyman Sani Akhundov, who was the headmaster and pedagogue at the school evoked his interest to literature and such famous pedagogues as M.Vezirov, R.Tahirov and A.Israfilbeyli strengthened this interest. After he entered Baku Electric Technical School and then to the eastern faculty of Baku State University where his classmates were Jafar Jabbarly, A.Badalbeyli, V.Khuluflu and was taught by such pedagogue as the eminent writer Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev.

Creativity His first collection of poems, \\"From sadness to happiness\\", written in 1927, was dedicated to Komsomol, civil war, courage of soldiers struggling for the Soviet power, as other poems of the poet, written in the 1920s (\\"Partisan Ali\\", \\"Armless hero\\"). The main theme of his works, created in 1930s (\\"Romanticism of a night\\"), was the creation of romanticism of a collective work, attracting spiritual enrichment of people. \\"A good comrade\\" poem was dedicated to labor feats of cotton growers in Mugham steppes. In 1939-1940s, S.Rustam wrote \\"Qachaq Nebi\\" novel. The poet used folk proverbs about Qachaq Nebi, expanded and deepened them socially and historically, gave a social perception to the novel. Main heroes of the novel are Qachaq Nebi - a famous leader of the national movement of the 19th century and Hejer - his brave wife and fellow fighter. Nebi, the son of a poor peasant, working as a farm laborer at bey, didn't bear cruelty and rudeness of his master and run to mountains and became \\"qachaq\\" (fugitive). He assembled dissatisfied peasants around him, vengeance for outraged people, took away money and commodities from the rich and gave them to the poor. He was supported by the whole neighborhood and courageously opposed tsar officers and gendarme and kept day-laborers in awe for a long time. And \\"noble brigand\\" Nebi's revolt was also collapsed as every spontaneous peasant struggle. Patriotic poems (\\"A day will come\\", \\"To the sons of Azerbaijan\\", \\"Old man's answer\\") written during the Great Patriotic War were dedicated to bravery and selflessness of the Soviet people, their unshakeable belief and victory over the enemy. Suleyman Rustam's \\"Mother and a postman\\" poem had a great fame (1942). Mother waiting for news from his front-line soldier son for four months says the postman: \\"If there is not any letter for me‚Ä¶don't come here again!\\" Disappointed postman goes away, but he is not offended, he is distressed by sufferings of the old mother. In her turn mother also regrets for her action. Finally, the postman brings a long-awaited letter and the postman and the whole neighborhood rejoices at the mother's happiness. This poem, written with a great emotional strength, deeply excites a reader and evokes his heartwarming feelings. During the postwar times the poet wrote a collection of poems called \\"Two shores\\", dedicated to hard life of Azerbaijani paupers in Iran and postwar flourishing of the Soviet Azerbaijan. Image of hero Qafur Mammadov, who shielded his commander from enemies by his chest, was created in \\"Qafur's heart\\" poem.

It was classified as being in the sunshine pop genre. Music and lyrics In late 1966, when Dean Torrence of Jan & Dean needed some songs for a new album, he enlisted the help of Gary Zekley, a talented Los Angeles singer/songwriter/producer Torrence had worked with previously. One of the songs Zekley gave Torrence was called \\"Yellow Balloon\\" and Torrence went on to record it. In the Torrence version, The last two lines in the bridge section of the song did not exist until after the recording was done. Those two lines from the bridge section were used in the Yellow Balloon's version of the song. The added lyrics are: \\"I know the sky's gonna get lighter/The sun's gonna shine a little brighter\\". The song is noted for its key change from F to G. The song is also noted for its change of rhythm from 6/8 to 3/4 in the wordless verse with the \\"BA BAs\\", until it reverts to the 6/8 rhythm for the final repeated chorus, before the fade-out of the song. Zekley was proud of the song, but didn't like Torrence's recording, so Zekley shopped the song to different labels. Among those whom Zekley visited was Ken Handler of Canterbury Records, who was very excited about the song and immediately set about having it recorded. Handler brought in noteworthy studio vocalists and musicians to add circular keyboard lines and a slight tremolo effect on the guitar. Release and aftermath The single was released under the group name The Yellow Balloon, in direct competition with Torrence's version of the song. Torrence's single was released under the duo's name Jan & Dean, even though Jan Berry was not on the recording, having been in a recent near-fatal car accident. The week of May 20, 1967, the Yellow Balloon's version placed at #25 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, while Jan & Dean's version placed at #111. This was due largely to the fact that many disc jockeys around the United States played only the Yellow Balloon version of the song. The B-side was the song played backwards, entitled \\"Noollab Wolley\\". However, several radio stations banned the song in fear that the song was about yellow hallucinogenic pills for a drug trip, just like the Donovan song \\"Mellow Yellow\\". The single generated enough fan interest for the band to make an album and to perform at various shows. The problem was that there was no actual Yellow Balloon band. Quickly, Handler elicited the help of Canterbury recording artist Don Grady, a former Mouseketeer, better known at the time as the character Robbie Douglas of the TV series My Three Sons. Grady knew several other musicians, and enlisted Alex Valdez (lead vocals), Paul Kanella (lead guitar), Don Braucht (bass guitar), Alan DeBoer, studio only (drums), and Forrest \\"Frosty\\" Green (keyboards) to record the self-titled album. Zekley produced the album and co- wrote eight of the eleven tracks. The Yellow Balloon album has long been considered a sunshine pop classic, although \\"Yellow Balloon\\" is the only song that charted.Spectropop.com References  External links  * [ Billboard Magazine \\"Yellow Balloon\\" Discography] Category:1967 singles Category:Songs written by Gary Zekley Category:1967 songs Category:Jan and Dean songs ","title":"Yellow Balloon"},{"id":"11844628","text":"USS LST-821, renamed USS Harnett County (LST-821/AGP-281), was an built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for Harnett County, North Carolina and was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. She served the United States Navy in World War II and the Vietnam War. She was transferred to South Vietnam's Republic of Vietnam Navy, which named her RVNS My Tho (HQ-800). After the Vietnam War, Harnett County was transferred to the Philippine Navy, which named her BRP Sierra Madre (LT-57). In 1999 the Philippine government deliberately had her run aground on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands to serve as an outpost of the Philippine Marine Corps to assert Philippine sovereignty in the country's dispute with China over the ownership of the Spratly Islands. She still serves that function. US Service history USS LST-821 was laid down on 19 September 1944 at Evansville, Indiana by the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Company. The ship was launched on 27 October 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Hugh Robertson, Sr.. LST-821 was commissioned on 14 November 1944 with Lieutenant C. J. Rudine, USNR, in command. During World War II, LST-821 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific theater and participated in the assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunto from April through June 1945. Following the War, she performed occupation duty in the Far East until early December 1945. LST-821 returned to the United States and was decommissioned in March 1946 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. On 1 July 1955 all remaining LSTs were given names of U.S. counties; LST-821 was named USS Harnett County (LST-821). Recommissioned on 20 August 1966 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, Harnett County saw extensive service during the Vietnam War, operating as part of Operation Game Warden, a brown-water navy effort to keep the rivers free of Viet Cong infiltration. Four landing ship tanks were recommissioned to support river patrol operations with the intent of keeping three ships on-station at any one time supporting a River Division of 10 Patrol Boat River (PBR), a Detachment of two UH-1B helicopter gunships and a SEAL Platoon. The ship not on-station was undergoing ship repairs in the Western Pacific. USS Harnett County reported on-station to CTF 116 on 12 January 1967 and operated as a Patrol Craft Tender (AGP) for the next 43 months on the rivers of the Mekong Delta.CWO3 John Trolinger, Instructor NIOTC MI Harnett County participated in the following campaigns: * The Vietnamese Counteroffensive ‚Äì Phase II (12 January to 31 May 1967) * The Vietnamese Counteroffensive ‚Äì Phase III (1 June to 12 July 1967 and 17 August 1967 to 29 January 1968) * The Tet Counteroffensive (30 January to 27 February 1968) * The Vietnamese Counteroffensive ‚Äì Phase IV (9 April to 30 June 1968) * The Vietnamese Counteroffensive ‚Äì Phase V (1 July to 1 November 1968) * The Vietnamese Counteroffensive ‚Äì Phase VI (2 to 4 November 1968 and 8 December 1968 to 22 February 1969) * The Tet/69 Counteroffensive (23 February to 7 May 1969) * Vietnam Summer-Fall 1969 (4 August to 31 October 1969) * Vietnam Winter-Spring 1970 (1 November 1969 to 22 January 1970 and 17 February to 30 April 1970) * The Sanctuary Counteroffensive (1 May to 30 June 1970) * The Vietnamese Counteroffensive ‚Äì Phase VII (1 to 21 July 1970) She was redesignated a Patrol Craft Tender, USS Harnett County (AGP-821) in the spring of 1970, but then was decommissioned 12 October 1970 at Guam. LST-821 earned one battle star for World War II service. Additionally, Harnett County earned nine battle stars, two awards of the Presidential Unit Citation, and four awards of the Navy Unit Commendation for the Vietnam War. RVN and Philippine service history The US transferred Harnett County to the Republic of South Vietnam under the Security Assistance Program on 12 October 1970 and renamed RVNS My Tho (HQ-800). My Tho was one of the flotilla of thirty-five Republic of Vietnam Navy ships that sailed for Subic Bay after the fall of Saigon in April 1975. She was transferred to the Philippines on 5 April 1976, which named her BRP Sierra Madre (LT-57). Involvement in the Spratly Islands dispute In 1999, the Philippine Navy intentionally ran her aground on the Second Thomas Shoal in order to maintain the Philippine's territorial claim in the area. Since then a detachment of Filipino marines have been continuously stationed on board Sierra Madre to provide a military presence at the site. The Chinese coast guard frequently patrols the area and attempts to prevent the resupply of these Filipino marines. In 2013, The New York Times visited the site and reported on the life of the handful of marines stationed there, and the vessel's role in the geopolitics of the South China Sea. One may infer from the article that Sierra Madre will never sail again, however she has gained importance due to her role as an outpost in the Spratly Islands dispute. On 11 March 2014, the Philippine government protested to the Chinese charg√© d'affaires in Manilla that the Chinese Coast Guard had on 9 March prevented two civilian vessels hired by the Philippine Navy from exchanging personnel on, and delivering supplies to, Sierra Madre.\\"Philippines protests Ayungin Shoal incident\\", Inquirer, accessed 13 March 2014. This was the first time that Chinese forces had interfered with resupply.

In September 2014, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, reporting for the BBC, visited Sierra Madre which remained blockaded by the Chinese coastguard. At this time supplies for the garrison of 11 Filipino marines were dropped by air. The ship was described as in a poor condition: \\"The ship‚Äôs sides are peppered with massive holes. Waves slosh through them right into the ship‚Äôs hold.\\" In July 2015, Philippine Navy spokesman Colonel Edgardo Arevalo said that they are currently doing maintenance repair on the ship to ensure the vessel's minimum habitability.

It belongs to the Podolic group of grey cattle. Romagnola cattle were used principally as draught beasts in the past; since the mechanisation of agriculture in the middle of the twentieth century they have been bred primarily for beef production. History As with other European grey cattle, it has been suggested that the Romagnola breed derives from Podolian cattle from the steppes of eastern Europe, possibly brought to Italy by invading Goths in the fourth century AD or by the Lombard king Agilulf. This hypothesis is based on the zoological theories of the nineteenth century, going back to the Bos taurus podolicus of Johann Andreas Wagner. It is not supported by modern genetic, zoological or archaeological research. There were in the past a number of local sub-types of Romagnola cattle, including the Bolognese in the area of Bologna, the Ferrarese in the area of Ferrara, a mountain type (\\"di monte\\") and a lowland type (\\"gentile di pianura\\"). Selective breeding towards the modern type began in about 1850, and the resulting stock won prizes both in Italy and abroad. In Paris in 1900 the Romagnola was judged jointly with the Hereford to be the \\"best beef breed\\". The Romagnola was however principally a draught breed, and was bred for that purpose, with massive and powerful foreparts and short strong legs. Following the progressive mechanisation of agriculture in the years after the Second World War the breeding strategy changed completely, and was directed towards beef production. To this end, cross-breeding with Chianina cattle was attempted, but did not give the desired results. A herd book was established in 1963. More than 80% of the registered Italian population is in Emilia-Romagna; there are small populations in Abruzzo, Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, Lazio, Lombardy, the Marche, Puglia, Tuscany and the Veneto. Some animals were exported to Scotland in the early 1970s and the breed is present in small numbers in Great Britain, Ireland, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. Numbers in Italy have fallen sharply since the Second World War. In 1952 there were 450,000 head; this fell to 250,000 in 1965, to 120,000 in 1977 and to 45,000 in 1980. At the end of 2013 the total number recorded for the breed in Italy was 13,054. Characteristics Romagnola cattle are ivory-white, tending to grey on the foreparts, particularly in bulls; the skin and natural openings are black. The colour of the coat varies with the season, and is darker in winter. The horns are light, lyre-shaped in cows, half-moon-shaped in bulls; they are slate-grey in young animals, becoming pale at the base and dark at the tip with maturity. As with all Podolic cattle, the calves are born wheat-coloured but become white at about three months. Use The Romagnola was in the past primarily a draught breed, though raised also for meat; limited dairy use is also documented. In the years before and after the Second World War the progressive mechanisation of agriculture meant that demand for draught oxen disappeared. It is now raised only for meat. Calves weigh at birth, and are normally sent to slaughter at 16‚Äì18 months, at a weight of ; yield is 62‚Äì63%. The meat is considered to be of high quality and carries a registered mark of quality. With the Chianina and the Marchigiana, the Romagnola is one of three breeds whose meat may, if raised within a specific area of the Apennines of central Italy, have IGP status as Vitellone Bianco dell'Appennino Centrale.

Descended from the draught oxen long used on the Weald they were selectively bred from the late 18th century to form a modern beef breed which is now used in many countries around the world. They have a thin summer coat and many sweat glands, but grow a thick coat in winter, so they are suited to both hot summers and cold winters. They have a placid temperament but can be very stubborn. Description The Sussex has a rich red-brown coat, with a creamy white switch to the tail. It is a medium- sized, long-bodied animal, and traditionally it has white horns, although naturally polled strains have also been developed. History The Sussex is one of several similarly coloured breeds of southern England - the others include the North Devon, the Hereford, the Lincoln Red and the Red Poll. All these breeds derive originally from the traditional multi-purpose red landrace cattle of the region. Ox ploughing continued longer in the Weald and on the South Downs than in most parts of England, and so the Sussex remained until relatively recently as heavy boned, large shouldered, draught animals.J P Boxall, p18 The Sussex Breed of Cattle in the Nineteenth Century Arthur Young Junior wrote in the early 19th century that the cattle of the Weald \\"must be unquestionably ranked among the best of the kingdom\\".Rev. A. Young, General View of the Agriculture of the County of Sussex, 1813, P. 226. William Cobbett in his Rural Rides also expressed surprise at finding some of the finest cattle on some of the most impoverished subsistence farms on the High Weald. The breed was numerous in Kent and the Wealden parts of Surrey as well as in Sussex in the late 18th century when Arthur Young toured Sussex and praised the breed in his book Agriculture of Sussex of 1793. He stayed at Petworth House where the progressive 3rd Earl of Egremont established a Sussex herd in Petworth Park which is still there today. High corn prices during the Napoleonic Wars led to a lot of grassland on the Low Weald being ploughed up and cattle herds greatly declined. Later in the 19th century rail transport caused an increase in dairy farming to supply the London market with a consequent decline in beef cattle breeding. A herd book was established in 1874.

The dam forms Lake Kaweah for flood control and irrigation water supply. Completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1962, Terminus is an earthfill dam high and long. The reservoir has a maximum capacity of of water, although it usually sits at much lower levels. History Terminus Dam is one of four dams built on the rivers of the Tulare Lake basin, located at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. In the 1920s, the USACE and the State of California first surveyed the area for suitable reservoir sites to provide irrigation water.Brewer, p. 55 After devastating floods in the late 1930s, the Flood Control Act of 1944 authorized the USACE to build Terminus Dam as part of a system to provide flood protection for the Tulare basin.Garone, p. 193 In 1948, with plans for the dam on the Kaweah River nearly complete, an archaeological survey of the future reservoir site revealed an unusually rich selection of Native American artifacts. Many of these were removed by the U.S. National Park Service's Interagency Archaeological Salvage Program before the beginning of work on the dam. Construction of Terminus Dam started in the late 1950s and was completed in 1962. The dam was dedicated along with the Success Dam, further south on the Tule River, on May 18, 1962. The reservoir filled for the first time in 1964 to its initial capacity of . Sedimentation had reduced this to according to a study conducted in 1977. Together with the three other major dams in the Tulare basin, Terminus Dam contributed to the desiccation of Tulare Lake, once one of the largest wetland regions in the United States.Garone, p. 194 =Spillway expansion= The fusegates at Terminus Dam are tested by high water in 2005 In the 1990s the USACE began studies for a project to increase the capacity of the dam's spillway, which was considered inadequate to pass the probable maximum flood on the Kaweah River. In 2001 work began to enlarge the spillway channel and between 2003 and 2004 six fusegates were installed in the spillway channel, raising the maximum elevation of the reservoir by . The fusegates, invented and patented by Fran√ßois Lemp√©ri√®re for Hydroplus, subsidiary of GTM Entrepose, are the largest in the world, and are designed to open automatically by water pressure when Lake Kaweah reaches dangerously high levels. The design was chosen because it would provide cost savings over conventional options such as a concrete or gated spillway. The project increased the storage capacity of Lake Kaweah by more than , to its current capacity of , and ensured the capability of Terminus Dam to pass a flood of up to . The dam is now capable of completely controlling a 70-year flood, as compared to a 46-year flood before the fusegates were installed. Functions View of the reservoir area, drawn down for flood control in September Terminus Dam's primary purpose is flood control; consequently, the reservoir is usually maintained at a very low level, except in late spring and early summer when it is used to store snowmelt runoff from the Sierra Nevada. The dam provides flood protection for of farmland and 300,000 people along the lower Kaweah River. Shortly after its completion, the dam and reservoir were put to the test by record floods in December 1966, during which Terminus, Success and Isabella Dams prevented a collective $81.9 million of damages. Between 1962 and 2012, Terminus Dam has prevented $373,225,000 of flood-related damages. Water releases from Terminus Dam are made based on agricultural demand when flood control releases are not required. Snowmelt runoff stored in Lake Kaweah are released at high rates between May and late July-early August during the peak of the irrigation season. The water serves multiple local water districts such as the Tulare Irrigation District (TID) and Kaweah Delta Water Conservation District (KDWCD), as well as urban areas including Visalia and Tulare. The dam also generates hydroelectricity from a plant built in 1992 by the Kaweah River Power Authority (KRPA), which is jointly managed by TID and KDWCD. Electricity generated here is distributed by Southern California Edison. The power plant currently has a capacity of 20.09 megawatts (MW), upgraded from its original capacity of 17 MW, and generates roughly 40 million kilowatt hours (KWh) per year. The KRPA plans to expand this capacity by a further 9 MW, which would allow for the generation of an additional 9.2 million KWh.

He is the son of Rakel Dink and Hrant Dink, the former editor-in-chief of the same paper, who was murdered by Og√ºn Samast, a Turkish ultra-nationalist who was seventeen years old at the time.  Trial on Hrant Dink's assassination  Arat Dink was brought to trial as a co- defendant as the executive editor of Agos along with Serkis Seropyan, holder of the weekly's publishing license in the third and last case that was opened against Hrant Dink on charges of 'denigrating Turkishness' under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. The charge was pressed in September 2006 after Agos republished a July 14, 2006 interview of Hrant Dink by the Reuters news agency where Hrant Dink referred to the 1915 massacre of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide. The charges against Hrant Dink were dropped in the first hearing of the case, originally scheduled for 22 March 2007 and rescheduled to 14 June 2007 due to his death and continued for Serkis Seropyan and Arat Dink, with the second hearing scheduled for 18 July 2007. At the court hearing, Arat Dink accused judges of contributing to his father's death by making him a target thanks to their high-profile judicial proceedings. \\"I think it is primitive, absurd and dangerous to consider as an insult to Turkish identity the recognition of a historic event as a genocide,\\" he said, quoted by the Anatolia news agency.  Trial of Arat Dink for insulting Turkey's identity  On 11 October 2007 Arat Dink was convicted of insulting Turkey's identity for republishing his father's remarks.

Ginger, later a Professor of History at Brandeis, Wayne State University, and the University of Calgary and at the time a New York trade book editor, had written about Eugene Debs and the city of Chicago in the time of John Peter Altgeld before tackling the Scopes trial. In the conclusion of Six Days or Forever? Ginger wrote his book had two purposes: First, getting \\"the facts straight\\" in order to correct \\"many mistakes in previous accounts of the episodes,\\" believing his book \\"comes much closer than do those accounts to telling what actually occurred.\\" Second, Ginger \\"tried to view the Scopes trial in the broadest possible context\\" (242). Ginger's primary reference sources were the published stenographic transcript and Leslie H. Allen's edited 1925 version, Bryan and Darrow at Dayton: The Record and Documents of the 'Bible Evolution Trial', along with the scrapbook files on the case of the ACLU and Kirtley F. Mather, one of the scientists who went to Dayton to testify on behalf of the Scopes defense. Ginger made use of the available biographies of various participants as well as full-length studies of Fundamentalism and anti-evolution, histories of Tennessee, official records of the Scopes appeal, and books on various scientific and religious topics. Ginger also pointed out that \\"in the interest of factual accuracy,\\" John T. Scopes had read portions of the manuscript (242-48).

The Metropolis includes all of the U.S. states of Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, as well as the Connecticut towns of Danielson, New London and Norwich. The Metropolis, whose offices are located in Brookline, Massachusetts, consists of 63 parishes which minister to the needs of approximately 200,000 Greek Orthodox faithful. Methodios was enthroned as Bishop of Boston on April 8, 1984 and was elevated to a Metropolitan in 1997. During his tenure, he founded the Philoxenia House and also oversaw the purchase and building of the St. Methodios Faith and Heritage Center in Contoocook, New Hampshire. On May 11, 2019, he was appointed to serve as the acting Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America before the new Archbishop was enthroned on June 22, 2019.https://www.thenationalherald.com/243788/metropolitan-elpidophoros-new- archbishop-of-america/https://www.goarch.org/-/enthronement-address- archbishop-elpidophoros Early life and education Metropolitan Methodios was born George Tournas on November 19, 1946 in New York City, New York, and was the third child of Stavroula and Vasilios Tournas. He graduated from the Greek Orthodox Cathedral Parochial School in New York City and the McBurney School in Manhattan. Methodios received the Bachelor of Arts degree from Hellenic College in Brookline in 1968 and the Bachelor of Divinity Degree from Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology in 1971. In 1972 he earned the Master of Sacred Theology from Boston University and in 1975 the University of Thessaloniki, awarded him Theological Accreditation upon completion of further studies there. Boston University awarded Methodios the Honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree in May 1985. In June 1995 the American International College in Springfield, Massachusetts, awarded Methodios the Honorary Degree of Humane Letters. His Alma Mater, Hellenic College-Holy Cross, awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree on May 19, 2001. Episcopacy Metropolitan Methodios served as a member of the National Orthodox-Roman Catholic Consultations Board. As a member of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an Organization devoted to the cause of worldwide religious freedom for all denominations, Metropolitan Methodios traveled to Hungary in 1981, and, in the fall of 1982 he was a member of a three-man religious delegation that visited the Soviet Union. A second visit to the Soviet Union was made in September 1984. Metropolitan Methodios is a member of the Holy Synod of the Greek Orthodox Church in the United States, served on the Executive Board of the National Council of Churches and is a member of the Massachusetts Commission on Christian Unity and the New England Consultation of Church Leaders. He is listed in Who is Who in Religion, is a member of the Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas and serves on various other religious boards and organizations. Methodios was enthroned as the Bishop of Boston on April 8, 1984, following his election to that post by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Phanar, Constantinople, Turkey. In July 1989, Bishop Methodios assumed the presidency of Hellenic College and Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology in Brookline, Massachusetts, a position he held until 1995. In November 1997, the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate elevated Bishop Methodios to the office of Metropolitan along with the other bishops of the Archdiocese of America. His see, however, remained a diocese until December 2002. As Metropolitan, Methodios encouraged the Metropolis of Boston to support him in the construction of a community center and offices located at 162 Goddard Avenue in Brookline. Groundbreaking for the project took place on September 14, 1985. It was completed a year later, on September 14, 1986. From this Center, which serves as the headquarters of the Metropolis, many programs emanate which serve and enlighten the faithful and share Orthodoxy with the public-at-large. These programs include the Marriage Preparation Seminars, instituted by Metropolitan Methodios in 1987, for all couples who are getting married in the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston. In 1986 Metropolitan Methodios established the Philoxenia House which offers hospitality to patients and those who accompany them who come to Boston for medical reasons and cannot afford to stay in hotels. Guests to the Philoxenia House have come from Greece, Cyprus, South America, South Africa, Egypt, Russia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and from throughout the United States. Metropolitan Methodios is assisted by the Philoptochos Women and the faithful throughout the Metropolis in this ministry. Metropolitan Methodios (2012) In the summer of 1998, the Diocese of Boston acquired Camp Merrimac in Contoocook, New Hampshire, a large former summer camp which became the St. Methodios Faith and Heritage Center, offering programs for youth and families. The Bishop, who walks at the annual Walk for Hunger sponsored by Project Bread, is a frequent visitor to area soup kitchens where he serves food to those who are in need. For his \\"unique contribution in the crusade against hunger and homelessness,\\" Metropolitan Methodios has been honored by the Quincy Community Action Organization Inc, in Quincy, Massachusetts. He has also been awarded the \\"Good Neighbor\\" Award by the Brotherhood Mishkan Tefila in Chestnut Hill. In late July 2017, Methodios gained local media attention after firing longtime priest Father Nicholas Kastanas of the St Athanasius the Great Greek Orthodox Church in Arlington, Massachusetts. While no specific reasons were stated in his letter to the community, Methodios cited \\"turmoil\\" for which Kastanas \\"bears the greatest responsibility\\". Following the notice of firing, the community banded together, creating a petition in the hope of reversing Methodios's decision and packed the church for the priest's last service as a show of solidarity. It was later reported that the cause of the dismissal was Kastanas's failure to \\"preserve the orderly life and unity of the parish\\" as he was reportedly unable to control growing disputes between the Parish Council and a group of parishioners. On November 17, 2017 the Metropolis published \\"A Message from the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston Concerning St. Athanasius the Great of Arlington, MA\\" that included \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" and an accompanying \\"Timeline of Events,\\" documents which detailed the events leading up to Father Kastanas' removal from his pastoral duties in Arlington.http://boston.goarch.org/news/metropolis_news/2017/message- concerning-saint-athanasius-of-arlington-ma.html Following the resignation of Archbishop Demetrios, on May 19, 2019, Methodios was appointed to serve as the Archiepiscopal Vicar and served in this position until Archbishop Elpidophoros was enthroned on June 22, 2019. On October 8, 2020, the Ecumenical Patriarchate announced that Metropolitan Methodios was suspended from his duties until Christmas 2020 on account of \\"canonical transgressions\\". The announcement followed an extensive examination of issues concerning the Archdiocese of America and reports from Archbishop Elpidophoros. Related news articles reported that in September 2020, the Attorney General of New Hampshire had warned Methodios concerning protective measures for COVID-19. Similarly he was found to have not followed COVID-19-related instructions from Archbishop Elpidophoros.https://www.thenationalherald.com/community_church_united_states/arthro/tnh_exclusive_the_ecumenical_patriarchate_transfers_evangelos_suspends_methodios-977370/https://www.universalhub.com/2020/church- shakeup-greek-orthodox-leader-boston See also * Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston * Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America * Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople References External links *Metropolitan Methodios of Boston from the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston's website Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Hellenic College and Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology alumni Category:20th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops Category:21st-century Eastern Orthodox bishops Category:Greek Orthodox bishops of Boston ","title":"Methodios Tournas"},{"id":"11845029","text":"Mervyn Neville Austin (1 August 1913 ‚Äì 1991)Cricket Information England was an Australian headmaster and professor.

Assumption San Lorenzo is the successor of the Assumption Convent along Herran Street, Ermita, Manila. It provides education from pre- school, elementary, secondary, tertiary, to graduate level. The alumnae and present students of this school include daughters and granddaughters of Presidents, industrialists, politicians, actors/actresses and prominent figures in the Philippines. Assumption College is recognized by the Department of Education and the Commission on Higher Education and also a charter member of the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities. It has earned Level IV accreditation on all of its respective departments and schools. The school is a member of Strategic Educational Alliance of Southeast Asia. History =Early history= Sister Marie Eug√©nie Milleret de Brou (later canonised as Saint Marie-Eug√©nie de J√©sus; 1817‚Äì1898) established the Congregation of the Religious of the Assumption in Paris on 30 April 1839 as a means to make a Christian transformation of society through education. The order arrived in Spanish colonial Philippines in 1892, and at the request of Queen Mar√≠a Cristina, consort of King Alfonso XII of Spain, they established the Superior Normal School for Women Teachers in Intramuros in 1892 which pioneered women education in the Philippines. Among its first alumnae were Rosa Sevilla de Alvero, Foundress of the Instituto de Mujeres; Librada Avelino and Carmen de Luna, who founded Centro Escolar University. At the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the order ceased operation of the school and returned to Europe. =Herran-Dakota campus= At the request of Pope Pius X, a group of anglophone Assumption Sisters returned to Manila in 1904; the Philippine Islands were by then already under American control. With the group of Sisters were Mother Helen Margaret as Superior, and Mother Rosa Mar√≠a Pachoud, Mother Esperanza Maria A. CuUnjieng, Madame Angela Ansaldo, Sr. Lory Mapa, Sr. Luisa Locsin and Sr. Bianca Rosa Perez Rubio who subsequently spent most of her religious life in the Religious of the Assumption in Asia. Originally an elementary and secondary school, the College was added in 1940. Its successors are Assumption College San Lorenzo and Assumption Antipolo. Formerly found in the genteel enclave of Ermita, the school very much resembled the renowned girls‚Äô schools of France and the rest of Europe, becoming a favourite amongst Manila's pre- War √©lite. It was considered a school for the alta de sociedad and there was no other value more emphasised than the French term noblesse oblige: ‚ÄúTo whom much is given, much will be required.‚Äù The school was once at the corner of Calle Herran and Calle Dakota (now known as Pedro Gil and Adriatico, respectively), beside the old Padre Faura campus of the all-boys' Ateneo de Manila, where the brothers of Assumptionistas often studied. It was from this time when the so-called ‚ÄúAteneo-Assumption‚Äù families sprung up, with entire clans exclusively attending either school. It offered subjects such as Spanish, French, Language and Reading in English, Arithmetic, and Religion, as well as Manners and Penmanship. During the Second World War, the whole school and the rest of the city were destroyed by heavy aerial bombardment in the 1945 Liberation of Manila. As with many schools, Assumption College resumed classes in quonset huts and in a battered auditorium in the ruins of the Herran campus. Mother Superior Rosa Mar√≠a and Madame Esperanza Maria A. CuUnjieng brought the school back to its feet and relaunched it in 1947 when the Reconstruction began, reopening in 1948. The Herran campus officially closed its doors in 1973, and today Robinsons Place Manila currently stands where it stood with the Padre Faura campus of Ateneo also stood. Architecture and culture A vast and stately school with manicured gardens, the Assumption Convent had high-ceilinged and arcaded school buildings in the neo-Gothic style, with lush plants and numerous trees. Possessing a very French, feminine aura, the convent school sported arched windows and corridors, partly hidden floral medallions, (specifically the fleur-de-lys common to the other French girls' school, Saint Paul University Manila), and even a lagoon with boats. The Herran Assumption also featured one of the best school chapels in Manila. Neo-Gothic in design, the chapel featured arched, stained-glass windows and a comparatively small Gothic main altar. Students of the Herran campus still observed older practises of the Catholic Church, with students made to genuflect upon entering any place where the Blessed Sacrament was kept. In those days, students also signed for fifteen-minute shifts for the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament; they were thusly excused from any class. In the afternoons, the students with lacy white mantillas on their heads, filled the chapel for common adoration, ending the day with singing the Tantum Ergo. There were also the very distinct things done within the walls of the school that through the decades would have the virtual label of \\"Assumption\\". There were the Assumption tarts (triangular tarts topped with guava jelly), and the Assumption siomai, beloved by students because of how it tasted like those made by Ma Mon Luk, a famous noodle shop. There was also Assumption cottage pie, ground meat topped with mashed potatoes served at the refectory. Students wore the distinct Assumption uniform of a tartan skirt (the fabric of which was first imported from France), sailor- collared shirts and a pin with a gold-coloured school seal. The lace-filled immaculately white uniforms called \\"gala dress\\" were reserved for more formal occasions such as Mass and Graduation Rites. Visiting guests had to contend themselves of speaking with the students in a parlour. Girls played a ball game they called bataille and were taught to curtsey before nuns, specifically the Mother Superior whom they were taught to address as \\"Notre M√®re\\" (\\"our mother\\"). A lasting hallmark of an \\"Old Girl\\" is the school's conspicuous penmanship known as \\"Assumption Script\\". Letters are distinctly long with sharp elongated points, it is a precise cursive, with flourished majuscules and jagged tails. It was a source of pride, according to Gonzalez,Gonzalez, Gizela Maria. The Manila We Knew. Manila: Anvil Publishing, 2006. and a way of immediately identifying an Herran Assumptionista. =Herran closure and San Lorenzo-Antipolo transfers= The school then expanded to its San Lorenzo, Makati campus, welcoming 180 students into its preparatory and elementary levels in June 1958. The following year, Assumption College San Lorenzo opened its doors to college-bound young women, and the College moved there in 1959. After some time, the Herran campus was sold as the area was becoming a commercial and tourist centre not conducive to learning. In 1972‚Äì73, four San Lorenzo campus teachers were transferred to pave the way for merging elementary schools and secondary schools of Herran and San Lorenzo. In 1973‚Äì74, the Herran and San Lorenzo schools fused: the High School and the College were based in San Lorenzo while the Preschool and Grade School briefly occupied Herran, temporarily moving to San Lorenzo in June 1974. The Grade School finally resettled in Assumption Antipolo along Sumulong Highway on 11 September 1974, with the Preschool staying in San Lorenzo. However, the distance between Antipolo and Manila became a problem, driving alumnae and parents petition the College to re-open the elementary level in San Lorenzo. Grade 1 was re-opened in 1981 and starting school year 1988‚Äì89, grade levels were added until the San Lorenzo Grade School's first batch of seventh Grade students graduated in March 1993. =Response to the Church= In line with the spirit of Vatican II, and in response to the call of the Church in the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines and the needs of the country, the Assumption in the Philippines has moved towards the rural areas and the underprivileged sector, without abandoning the education of the upper/middle classes. Institution =Basic Education Division= *Pre-school and Kinder: The Preschool program of the Assumption gives a premium to character formation and instills in students a love for learning and a beginning sense of social responsibility. *Gradeschool (Grade 1 to Grade 6): In the Grade School program, a well-rounded curriculum is delivered using brain-based instructional strategies. Students acquire knowledge and skills in real-life contexts, particularly through Project-Based Learning, Singapore Math, Science, and Social Studies inquiry activities, and design tasks. They learn about mindfulness, reflection, and prayer to build the foundations of a strong relationship with God. They are also given regular opportunities to interact with different sectors of society through Concrete Acts for Social Transformation (C.A.S.T). *Junior High School (Grade 7 to Grade 10): The Junior High School program forms students of character who excel academically, exhibit a growing sense of social responsibility, and enjoy a personal relationship with God. As in Grade School, learning continues to occur in real-life contexts with Project-Based Learning, inquiry activities and investigations, and design tasks. Enrichment programs in Math, Science, Writing, and Filipinos are offered, and students are given opportunities for collaboration and leadership. *Senior High School (Grade 11 to Grade 12): The Senior High School program is anchored on the goal of ‚ÄúChristianization of the intelligence‚Äù so as to form women servant-leaders who love their times and work for the transformation of society. The curriculum aims to instill a love for learning and passion for undertaking research by providing real-life, relevant, interdisciplinary, and student-centered opportunities to develop Prime Life Abilities. Students engage in a variety of authentic projects and activities such as the Research Congress, Science Innovation, Business Implementation, and Arts Curation and Production, Work Immersion, Inter-Faith Youth Camp and Model ASEAN Summit in order to prepare them for college/university and the workplace. Assumption College Senior High School offers four strands: Accounting, Business & Management (ABM), Arts & Design (A&D;), Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). **Graduates from the AC-HS move on to pursue higher education at the following colleges in the Philippines such as De La Salle University, University of the Philippines, University of Santo Tomas, Ateneo de Manila University, and De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde and also abroad. =The Marie-Eug√©nie School of Innovative Learning (MESIL)= * Bachelor of Science in Interior Design * Bachelor of Arts in Psychology * Bachelor of Science in Psychology * Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education Major in Early Childhood Education * Bachelor of Secondary Education Major in English * Bachelor of Communication major in: ** Media Production ** Advertising ** Performing Arts ** Digital Content and Management = Milleret School of Business and Management for Women (MSBMW)= *Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in Corporate Business * Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in International Business * Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship * Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship with Specialization in Tourism Management * Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in Marketing Management * Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in Human Resources Management * Bachelor of Science in Accountancy * Bachelor of Science in Management Accounting =Academic linkages= The college is part of the Women's Consortium Colleges which includes Miriam College in Katipunan, St. Scholastica's College Manila in Malate, La Consolacion College Manila in Mendiola, St. Paul University Quezon City, and the College of the Holy Spirit Manila in Mendiola. =The Milleret School of Business and Management for Women (MSBMW)= The Milleret School of Business and Management for Women * Prof. Bradford Martinez, Associate Dean * Prof. Reuel Ruiz Jr. , Chairperson ‚Äì Entrepreneurship Notable alumnae *Coraz√≥n Aquino (1933‚Äì2009) ‚Äì eleventh President of the Philippines (1986‚Äì1992), figurehead of the 1986 People Power Revolution.

Illinois Central Gulf train 416, made up of newly purchased Highliners, overshot the 27th Street station on what is now the Metra Electric Line, and the engineer asked and received permission from the train's conductor to back the train to the platform. This move was then made without the flag protection required by the railroad's rules. However, his train had cleared automatic block signals which cleared express train 720, made up of more heavily constructed single level cars, to continue at full speed on the same track. The engineer of the express train did not see the bilevel train backing up until it was too late. When the trains collided, the front car of the express train telescoped the rear car of the bilevel train, killing 45 people and injuring 332.

After earning three battle stars for service in the Pacific during World War II, she was decommissioned in September 1946 and placed in reserve. While in reserve, Facility was reclassified as MSF-233 in February 1955 but never reactivated. In October 1962, she was sold to the Mexican Navy and renamed ARM DM-04.

After escorting the minelayer to Eniwetok early in March, Facility began sweeping under the command of Task Group TG 52.5 preliminary to the assault landings on Okinawa on 1 April. She continued to support the operation until damaged by a near miss during a heavy suicide attack and was forced to put into Ulithi on 22 April for repairs. She resumed sweeping operations, and, after replenishing supplies in Buckner Bay, joined Task Group TG 52.4 to participate with TG 52.3 in clearing the approaches to Nagasaki, Japan. Late in September she swept the Bungo Suido and other areas of the Inland Sea. The rest of the year was occupied in overhaul at Hiro Wan and in sweeping the Van Dieman Straits.

Carl resides in North Texas. She has been a friend of Lois McMaster Bujold since childhood; both authors credit Carl with getting Bujold started writing. This is described in the introduction to Bujold's collection Dreamweaver's Dilemma. Bujold's second novel, The Warrior's Apprentice, is dedicated to Carl. Both authors are friends with fantasy and sci-fi author Patricia Wrede. Lillian co-edited The Vorkosigan Companion, a retrospective on Lois McMaster Bujold's science fiction work, with John Helfers. It was published by Baen Books in December 2008 and nominated for a Hugo Award in the \\"Best Related\\" category at Anticipation, the 2009 Worldcon. Self description In her biographical statement on her website and in her publicity materials, Carl says: > Lillian has lived for many years in North Texas, in a book-lined cloister > cleverly disguised as a tract house.

Genre Carl originally wrote science fiction and fantasy, then branched out in later years to romantic suspense and mystery. Many of her books also cross genres, containing touches of what she calls her own genre mix of all the above with touches of the paranormal. Carl states that: \\"It was she [Bujold] who introduced me to science fiction and fantasy in general and Tolkien in particular.\\" and \\"Recently I re-read my first published fantasy novels.

The dragon was blue, as was the \\"pearl\\". The boss was blue and the band around the boss was red. The field was white. The Taifals or Tayfals ( or Theifali) were a people group of Germanic or Sarmatian origin, first documented north of the lower Danube in the mid third century AD. They experienced an unsettled and fragmented history, for the most part in association with various Gothic peoples, and alternately fighting against or for the Romans. In the late fourth century some Taifali were settled within the Roman Empire, notably in western Gaul in the modern province of Poitou. They subsequently supplied mounted units to the Roman army and continued to be a significant source of cavalry for early Merovingian armies. By the sixth century their region of western Gaul had acquired a distinct identity as Thifalia. Settlement in Oltenia Taifals in Oltenia and the political landscape in the 4th-century Balkans One of the earliest mentions of the Taifals puts them in the following of the Gothic king Cniva when he campaigned in Dacia and Moesia in 250 and the years following.Wolfram, 45. They are sometimes classified as a Germanic tribe closely related to the Goths, although some believe they were related to the (non-Germanic) Sarmatians with whom they might have emigrated from the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe.Maenchen-Helfen, 26 n50, says there is \\"no evidence they were Germans\\". Dalton, I, 172 n7, calls them \\"probably of Asiatic descent.\\" Wolfram, 92, mentions hypothesised Vandalic origin which equates the Taifals with the Lacringi and considers \\"Taifali\\" to be a Celtic \\"cult name\\". In the late third century they settled on the Danube on both sides of the Carpathians, dividing the territory with the Goths, who maintained political authority over all of it.Wolfram, 56. In Spring 291 they formed a special alliance with the Gothic Thervingi, forming a tribal confederation from this date until 376,Wolfram, 91. and fought the Vandals and Gepids: Tervingi, pars alia Gothorum, adiuncta manu Taifalorum, adversum Vandalos Gipedesque concurrunt.Panegyrici Latini, iii[xi].17, cited in Thompson, 9 n2.Wolfram, 57ff, mentions a panegyric delivered on 1 April 291 which refers to Thervings and Taiflas defeating a Vandal-Gepid coalition. Along with the Victufali, the Taifals and Thervingi were the tribes mentioned as having possessed the former Roman province of Dacia by 350 \\"at the very latest\\". Archaeological evidence suggests that the Gepids were contesting Transylvania, the region around the Some≈ü River, with the Thervingi and Taifals. The Taifals were subsequently made foederati of the Romans, from whom they obtained the right to settle in Oltenia.Thompson, 4. They were at that time independent of the Goths.Musset, 36. Buckle from the first hoard of Co≈üoveni, 5th century, possibly of Taifal origin,http://www.comunacosoveni.ro/cultura-locala/prezentare-locala from Co≈üoveni, Oltenia, Romania In 328 Constantine the Great conquered Oltenia and the Taifals, probably taking this opportunity to resettle a large number in Phrygia, in the diocese of Nicholas of Myra.Thompson, 11 and n3.Wolfram, 61 and n141. In 332 he sent his son Constantine II to attack the Thervingi, who were routed. According to Zosimus (ii.31.3), a 500-man Taifal cavalry regiment engaged the Romans in a \\"running fight\\", and there is no evidence that this campaign was a failure. Nonetheless, the Taifals largely fell into the hands of the Romans at this time. Around 336 they revolted against Constantine and were put down by the generals Herpylion, Virius Nepotianus, and Ursus.Barnes, \\"Forty\\", 226, and \\"Constans\\", 331‚Äì332. By 358 the Taifals were independent foederati of Rome and Oltenia lay outside Roman control.Thompson, 13. They launched campaigns as allies of the Romans from their own Oltenic bases, against the Limigantes (358 and 359) and the Sarmatians (358).Wolfram, 63. However, campaigns against the Thervingi by the emperor Valens in 367 and 368 were inhibited by the independence of Oltenia. It is possible, however, that the Taifals at this time were still fighting alongside the Goths.Wolfram, 67. In 365 the emperor ordered the construction of defensive towers in Dacia Ripensis, but whether this was Oltenia is unclear.Thompson, 14 n1. Archaeological evidence evidences no sedes Taifalorum (Taifal settlements) east of the Olt River. Crossing the Danube With the Iazyges and the Carpi, the Taifals were harassing the Roman province of Dacia in the mid fourth century. However, the arrival of a new threat--Huns--from Central Asia changed the political layout of Dacia: \\"the Huns threw themselves upon the Alans, the Alans upon the Goths, and the Goths upon the Taifali and Sarmatae.\\"Ambrose of Milan, Expositio evangelii secundum Lucam, X.10, quoted in Maenchen-Helfen, 20. Athanaric had refused to extend his defensive preparations to the Taifalian territory and the Huns forced the Taifals to abandon Oltenia and western Muntenia by 370.Maenchen-Helfen, 26 and n50.Wolfram, 408 n225. The Taifals allied with the Greuthungi of Farnobius against Rome; they crossed the Danube in 377, but were defeated in late autumn that year.Id. Ammianus wrote of their annihilation, but Zosimus placed them second to the Goths in importance. They were evidently numerous. The Taifals were prominent among the survivors of Farnobius' coalition. After the Gothic victory at Adrianople (378) under Fritigern, the Thervingian king Athanaric began to assail the Taifals. Athanaric had not included the Taifals in his defensive construction efforts against the Huns earlier (376).Wolfram, 71. The breaking of the alliance between Thervingia and Taifal may have had something to do with disagreements over tactics in light of the Huns and the crossing of the Danube, the Taifals being horsemen and the Thervingi infantry.Wolfram, 99. Sometime before their conversion to Christianity, Ammianus Marcellinus wrote: > It is said that this nation of the Taifali was so profligate, and so > immersed in the foulest obscenities of life, that they indulged in all kinds > of unnatural lusts, exhausting the vigour both of youth and manhood in the > most polluted defilements of debauchery.

Their conversion to the Orthodox Catholic faith probably occurred through Roman evangelism in the mid fifth century.Wolfram, 238. A page of the Insignia viri illustris magistri Equitum from manuscript Canon. Misc. 378 of Notitia Dignitatum, since 1817 in the Bodleian LibraryThis MS was bought by the Bodleian from the estate of the Venetian Jesuit Matteo Luigi Canonici (1727‚Äìc.1806). It was originally made in 1436 for Pietro Donato, Bishop of Padua. Coloni and laeti of the Empire Subsequent to their defeat and falling out with Athanaric, the Taifals were officially resettled as coloni to farm lands in northern Italy (Modena, Parma, Reggio, Emilia) and Aquitaine by the victorious general Frigeridus.Wolfram, 123. Abandoned Oltenia was settled by the Huns c. 400. Some Taifals allied with the Huns as early as 378, and some were later still allied with them at the Battle of Ch√¢lons (451). However, the victory of Adrianople in 378 meant that those Taifals who remained with the Visigoths fought against their cousins at Ch√¢lons. In 412, the Taifals entered Aquitaine in the train of the Visigoths. The Taifals were often teamed with the Sarmatians and the Citrati iuniores by the Romans and subsequently by Clovis I. According to the Notitia Dignitatum of the early fifth century, there was a unit called the Equites Taifali established by Honorius under the comes Britanniarum in Britannia.Wolfram, 478 n562. Possibly this unit may have been sent to the island by Stilicho in 399, and they may have been the same unit as the Equites Honoriani seniores mentioned around the same time. Thus, the Equites Honoriani Taifali seniores served in Britain while the Equites Honoriani Taifali iuniores served in Gaul under the magister Equitum. The Taifali iuniores used the dragon-and-pearl device on their shields.Nickel, 139. The Equites Taifali seniores had mirrored bears holding the shield boss, as illustrated in the Notitia Dignitatum. The Notitia also lists a unit called the Comites Taifali in the Eastern Empire, which was probably formed in the reign of Theodosius I.Nischer, 51. Some Taifals were settled in Phrygia in the late fourth century. Arethas of Caesarea, writing in the tenth century, mentions them alongside the Gothograeci, leading Gustav Anrich to suggest that these Phrygian Taifals were the ancestors of the Gothograeci of the 7th‚Äì10th centuries.Haldon, 369‚Äì370. The village of Tealby (originally Tavelesbi, Tauelesbi or Teflesbi) in the former kingdom of Lindsey may preserve the name of some Taifali who remained in Britain after the Roman withdrawal in 410. If so, it suggests the unattested Old English tribal name *TƒÅflas or *T«£flas.Green, passim. Presence in Merovingian Gaul Also according to the Notitia, there was a praefectus Sarmatarum et Taifalorum gentilium, Pictavis in Galia, that is, a Sarmatian and Taifal prefect in Poitiers in Gaul.Bachrach, Merovingian, 12 n30. The region of Poitou was even called Thifalia, Theiphalia or Theofalgicus pagus (all meaning \\"Taifal country\\") in the sixth century. The Taifals were instrumental in defeating the Visigothic cavalry hand to hand at the Battle of Vouill√© in 507.Bachrach, Merovingian, 17. Under the Merovingians, Theiphalia had its own dux (duke).Bachrach, Merovingian, 29 and 38. It is possible that the Taifal laeti who had served the Romans also served as garrisons for the Franks, but this is not referred to in primary records.Dalton, I, 226, who calls them foederati. The laeti were formally integrated into the Merovingian military establishment under Childebert I.Dalton, I, 44. Gregory of Tours, the principal source for the Taifals in the sixth century, says that a certain Frankish dux named Austrapius \\"oppressed\\" the Taifals (probably in the vicinity of Tiffauges); they revolted and killed him.Gregory, IV.18. The last mention of the Taifals as a distinct gens dates from year 565,In Gregory, Wolfram, 238. Gregory's generally friendly attitude towards the Taifals attests to their orthodoxy and to their relative lack of Gothicisation considering their many years spent in Gothic alliances. but their Oltenic remnants almost certainly took part in the Lombard migration and invasion of Italy in 568.Musset, 88. The most famous Taifal was Saint Senoch, who founded an abbey at the Roman ruins which are now called Saint-Senoch.Gregory, V.7. The Taifal influence extended into the ninth century and their fortresses, like Tiffauges and Lusignan, continued in use under the Carolingians.Bachrach, Aquitaine, 24. It has even been suggested that the Asiatic Taifals and Sarmatians influenced the Germanic arts.Dalton, I, 172 n7. They also left their mark in the municipal nomenclature of the region: asides from Tiffauges, mentioned above, Taphaleschat in Corr√®ze, Touffailles and Touffaillou in Aquitaine, and Chauffailles (formerly Ta√Øfailia) in Burgundy owe their names to Taifal settlement. Perhaps the town of Tafalla in the Navarre owes its name to these people, but if so, it is unknown if the Taifals were established in Hispania (probably to subdue the Basques) by the Romans before 412 or by the Visigoths after that. The town of Taivola in northern Italy was also a Taifal settlement.Wolfram, 92. Notes Sources *Bachrach, Bernard S. \\"Procopius, Agathias and the Frankish Military.\\" Speculum, Vol. 45, No. 3.

He was the only son of Lothair Udo I of the Udonids and Adelaide of Rheinfelden. The power base of his family lay around Harsefeld and Stade, but through advantageous marriages, they had control of almost the entire eastern third of the Duchy of Saxony in lands and rights. In 1044, William became Margrave of the Nordmark. In 1056, the Saxons were defeated by the Liutizi at the Battle of Pritzlawa (Havelm√ºndung), and William was killed. The Emperor Henry III and Lothair Udo I died the same year. Lothair Udo II came into a very strong position and became margrave the next year. Lothair initially placed himself in opposition to the Billung family and Adalbert of Bremen. Adalbert had won great influence over the young King Henry IV and he designed to extend the influence of the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen over the various small counties of Saxony, especially between the Elbe and the Weser in order to better evangelise the Slavs. In 1063, Adalbert annexed Stade from Lothair. Originally he had supported Lothair as a counterweight to Billung influence in Saxony, but military conflict soon broke out between the Udonids and the Billungs. After Henry IV came of age in 1065, Lothair recovered his lost territories from the Billung and Adalbert, whose took a serious setback (1066). In 1068, Lothair was granted the March of Zeitz. In that year, he and Henry attacked the Liutizi along the Elbe, but in 1069 they called the expedition off in failure. In 1071, Lothair was involved in the conspiracy of Bardowiek. In 1073, he was on the side of the king, but the policy of Adalbert and his successor Liemar put him at odds with the royal party again. In 1075, he fought under Otto of Nordheim at the Battle of Homburg against the king. They were defeated. Lothair immediately made peace with the king to allow his hostage son to go free. The rest of the Saxon nobles went through long negotiations. Lothair was succeeded by his son Henry in 1082. His widow was Oda (born c. 1050), daughter of Richenza (daughter of Otto II of Swabia) and Herman III, Count of Werl. Marriage and issue Lothair Udo married Oda of Werl, daughter of Herman III, Count of Werl, and his wife Richenza. (also Uda and Hilaria; b. ca. 1050), their children were: * Henry I the Long, Margrave of the Nordmark and Count of Stade (as Henry III) (ca. 1065‚Äì27 June 1087), married Eupraxia of Kiev * Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark and Count of Stade (as Lothair Udo IV) (ca. 1070‚Äì2 June 1106) * Rudolf I, Margrave of the Nordmark and Count of Stade (d. 7 December 1124), married Richardis,Rudolf II, Luitgard of Stade, Queen consort of Denmark, and Hartwig, Count of Stade, Archbishop of Bremen were their children. daughter of Hermann, Count of Sponheim-Lavanttal (d. 22 July 1118), since 1080 Burgrave of Magdeburg, brother of Archbishop Hartwig of Magdeburg. * Siegfried (d. ca. 1111), Provost at Magdeburg * Adelaide (Adelheid) (ca. 1065‚Äì18 October 1110), married (1) with Frederick III, Count of Goseck (ca. 1065‚Äì5 February 1085), also Count of Putelendorf and as Frederick III also Count Palatine of Saxony, and (2) with Louis the Jumper, Count of Schauenburg (near Friedrichroda, Thuringia; 1042‚Äì1123) also Count of Thuringia.

Born in Constantinople, Atumano was of Greco-Turkish origin, his surname deriving from the word \\"Ottoman.\\"Setton, Catalan Domination, 140. His father was a Turk and his mother Greek Orthodox according to a letter dated 11 September 1380. He was a humanist and an influential Greek scholar during the Italian Renaissance. Ecclesiastical and political career On 17 April 1366, Pope Urban VI transferred Atumano to the see of Thebes in reward for his \\"great integrity.\\"Setton, Catalan Domination, 140. Atumano did not begin well with the Catalan Company which ruled Thebes as part of the Duchy of Athens at the time. He was described later as \\"a very lukewarm Catalan.\\"Setton, Catalan Domination, 142, from Mercati. While the Catalans supported the Avignon Papacy during the Western Schism, Atumano remained faithful to Rome. In 1379, Atumano assisted the Navarrese Company under Juan de Urtubia to take Thebes.Setton, Catalan Domination, 143 and 144 n59. Perhaps Atumano trusted the Knights Hospitaller that were with the Navarrese. The details of the assistance he gave them are unknown, but it put him in further bad stead with the Catalans. However, Atumano got along no better with the Navarrese and sometime in 1380-1381 he fled to Italy, where he was at Rome in the winter of the latter year. He lost 1,500 florins of revenue from Thebes and lived thereafter in poverty \\"more acceptable in the sight of God,\\" though the Peter IV of Aragon assumed that Atumano would receive a higher dignity from the Roman Pope. From Italy he wrote to Demetrius Cydonius about his worries for his flock and about the blasphemy and lack of respect for law of the Ispanoi, that is, the Navarrese.Setton, Catalan Domination, 143 n57. Translation work Atumano undertook studies of Hebrew while in Thebes. In the mid-late 1370s, he began the composition of a Biblia Triglotta, a polyglot Latin-Greek-Hebrew bible written a century before the Complutensian Polyglot.Setton, Catalan Domination, 222. Whether or not Atumano's interest in Hebrew was ignited by the large Jewish presence in Thebes is unknown, since it appears that the Jewish population there had dwindled significantly by the late fourteenth century. The Biblia Triglotta, dedicated to Urban VI, was never finished. He did, however, complete a Hebrew translation of the New Testament and a Greek of the Old. In 1373, Atumano translated the De remediis irae of Plutarch into Latin from Greek.Setton, Catalan Domination, 141 n51.Jill Kraye, The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism (1996), p. 16. In 1381-2 he taught Greek to Raoul de Rivo.Kenneth Meyer Setton, The Papacy and the Levant, 1204-1571: The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries (1976), p. 470. Character Atumano was praised by his contemporary, Frederick III of Sicily, for his \\"innate goodness and praiseworthy character\\" and by his twentieth-century biographer as \\"no common scholar.\\" Coluccio Salutati, the famous Florentine humanist, praised him to Petrarch as a vir mult[a]e venerationis: most venerable man. He was made a citizen of the Republic of Venice. Even the Antipope Clement VII referred to him as of bon[a]e memori[a]e (good memory). However, some latter day historians, especially the Catalan Antonio Rubi√≥ y Lluch, have labelled him an untrustworthy scoundrel on the basis of four documents in the archives of the Crown of Aragon in Barcelona dated to 1381 and 1382. In one of the letters, Peter IV of Aragon requests that Urban VI remove Atumano from Thebes and replace him with John Boyl, the Bishop of Megara, exiled from his see since the Florentine occupation of 1374. According to the letter, Atumano fled to Italy when still a Greek monk on account of nefarious sins for which, Peter claims, he would have been burned alive. In Italy, he succeeded in \\"parading himself as a man of honour\\" and so obtaining the archdiocese from Pope Gregory XI. The letter, however, is probably mere calumny, as the \\"only verifiable information given\\" is readily falsified: Gregory was not Pope when Atumano received the archbishopric.Setton, Catalan Domination, 142.

When originally composed by Ren√© Moore and Angela Winbush, they had planned to produce it as a song for Janet Jackson's self-titled debut solo LP but Jackson reportedly turned it down. Undaunted, the duo recorded the song themselves as a song on their third LP together, Rise.

Avant's re-recording of the song helped to send the song back to the charts in 2000 reaching number four on the R&B; charts and number twenty-six on the pop charts making it Rene & Angela's most successful recording as songwriters and prompted a brief comeback for Winbush who would take Wyatt's place in singing the song with Avant during a taping of BET's 106 and Park to surprised audience members that year.

It was produced by the group. The album reached No. 172 on the American Billboard charts in 1991, with the single \\"Miss Freelove '69\\" (February 1991) reaching No. 19 on the ARIA Singles Chart, No. 3 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1991. Other singles were \\"1000 Miles Away\\" (June 1991, No. 37), \\"A Place in the Sun\\" (August 1991) and \\"Castles in the Air\\" (December 1991). EMI re-released the album on 7 February 2005EMI Records with four additional tracks, a fold out poster and liner notes by Dave Gray (Rocket Science). Background Hoodoo Gurus had formed in Sydney in 1981 with Dave Faulkner the mainstay as songwriter, lead singer and guitarist. He was later joined by Mark Kingsmill on drums, and Brad Shepherd on guitar, vocals, and harmonica. In 1988 Richard Grossman (ex Matt Finish, Divinyls) replaced Clyde Bramley on bass guitar. The most stable line- up of Faulkner, Grossman, Kingsmill, and Shepherd saw Hoodoo Gurus from 1988 to their hiatus in January 1998. After the first album under their new contract, Magnum Cum Louder they recorded 1991's Kinky, which peaked at No. 172 on the American Billboard 200 album charts. It provided the single \\"Miss Freelove '69\\" which reached No. 19 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and No. 3 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1991. Another single of the same year \\"1000 Miles Away\\" reached No. 37 in Australia. It was adopted by the crew of Royal Australian Navy frigate HMAS Canberra as their 'anthem' in 1993, playing it whenever they left port. Hoodoo Gurus played a concert, including \\"1000 Miles Away\\", on-board HMAS Canberra during its last voyage prior to decommissioning in 2005; coincidentally, Dave Faulkner's father is a World War II veteran who survived the sinking of the original Canberra. After releasing Kinky the band then released two compilations at once in 1992, Electric Soup, which contained the band's hits and Gorilla Biscuit, which was made up of B-sides and rarities. Faulkner had had long hair between 1985 and 1991; during the recording sessions for this album he switched to a buzzcut, retaining this look for the rest of his career.

Named after counties in Texas and Washington, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. USS LST-857 was laid down on 19 September 1944 at Seneca, Illinois by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company; launched on 6 December 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Beatrice S. Major; and commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 29 December 1944 with Lieutenant Roy C. Parlier in command. Service history =World War II, 1945= After shakedown off the Florida coast, LST-857 departed New Orleans for the Pacific on 1 February 1945. Steaming via the Panama Canal, she touched the Hawaiian and Marshall Islands and reached Guam on 30 March. There she loaded bombs and ammunition and departed on 21 April for Iwo Jima. Steaming via Saipan, she reached Iwo Jima on 1 May, unloaded her cargo, then sailed on 18 May. Carrying 334 enemy prisoners, she returned to Guam the 21st. Between 23 and 30 May, LST-857 carried a cargo of fog oil to Okinawa. She supplied ships at Hagushi until 24 June. Returning to Guam on 4 July, she loaded troops and Army construction equipment, then sailed for Okinawa on the 16th. She operated there from 28 July to 5 August; and, after returning to Saipan on 11 August, she loaded cargo and departed for the Philippines on 3 September. =Post-war activities, 1945-1948= LST-857 arrived San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 10 September and was assigned to support occupation operations in Japan. After embarking ordnance and construction troops and loading equipment at Iloilo, Panay, and Batangas, Luzon, she sailed in convoy for Japan on 20 September. She reached Tokyo Bay on the 29th and, until 25 October, operated along the coast of Honsh≈´ shuttling occupation troops and cargo. She returned to the Philippines early in November; and, after embarking additional troops, she returned to Japan on 18 November and resumed occupation operations. Departing Yokohama on 15 December, she steamed via Saipan and Pearl Harbor to the United States and arrived at San Francisco on 25 January 1946. During the next six months LST-857 operated along the California coast between San Francisco and San Diego. She departed San Diego on 31 July, reached Pearl Harbor on 11 August, and began supply runs under Service Force, Pacific Fleet. For more than three years she operated out of Pearl Harbor, carrying passengers and supplies to bases in the Hawaiian Islands and to Johnson and Canton Islands. Between 3 April and 6 August 1948 she deployed to the Marshall Islands where she conducted shuttle service among the atolls. =Korean War, 1950-1953= Departing Pearl Harbor on 3 January 1950, LST-857 returned to the West Coast on 14 January. After overhaul at Mare Island, she operated out of Astoria, Oregon, and San Diego until 1 July when she departed San Francisco for Hawaii. She arrived Pearl Harbor on 11 July; and, after serving briefly as inter- island transport, she departed on 18 August to support the effort to repel Communist aggression in South Korea. She arrived Yokosuka, Japan, on 4 September, then shifted to Kobe, Japan, the next day. After embarking men and equipment of the 1st Marine Engineer Battalion, she sortied on 10 September as part of an amphibious attack convoy bound for Inchon, South Korea. Assigned to Task Element 90.32, LST-857 arrived off Inchon on 15 September while a heavy air-sea bombardment pounded enemy shore positions. Late that afternoon, she closed \\"Red Beach\\" under heavy mortar and machine gun fire to take part in landings which were designed to spearhead an Allied offensive northward. Despite concentrated enemy fire, she debarked assault troops and unloaded vital supplies and equipment. In addition she provided counter-battery fire and embarked battle casualties for emergency treatment. For daring bravery and heroic performance of duty on \\"Red Beach\\", the aggressive and intrepid tank landing ships, including LST-857, received the Navy Unit Commendation. LST-857 completed unloading and departed the beach early on 16 September. She returned to Sasebo, Japan, on 19 September. She again returned to Inchon on 2 October and delivered a cargo of ammunition to the battleship . On 14 October she departed Sasebo for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 3 November. Following shipyard repairs, she departed on 1 December on a cargo run to the Marshall Islands. During the next ten months she conducted passenger and cargo service out of Pearl Harbor to the Marshall, Samoa, and Palmyra Islands, as well as to ports in the Hawaiian Islands. Departing Pearl Harbor on 28 September 1951, LST-857 sailed for the Far East and arrived at Yokohama on 18 October. On the 22nd she sailed for Sasebo where she arrived on 26 October to prepare for shuttle duty along the vital water supply line between Japan and Korea. Operating primarily out of Sasebo, she transported men and supplies to ports along the western coast of Korea. In addition she supplied fleet activities along the coast of Japan. She sailed for the United States on 23 September 1954, touched at Pearl Harbor on 9 October, and arrived at San Diego on 22 October. LST-857 returned to Pearl Harbor from San Diego on 27 November; and, after overhaul, she began passenger and cargo runs between Pearl Harbor and Midway Atoll on 2 February 1955. Named USS King County on 1 July 1955, she continued this duty until August 1956. Between 17 August and 12 September she made a supply run to the Marshalls; then she sailed for the West Coast on 1 October, arriving at Oakland, California, on the 11th. =Guided missile test ship, 1957-1960= The Regulus II missile launcher aboard YD-33 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, prior to installation aboard King County, 4 April 1957.

She entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 12 October 1957 and began conversion to an experimental guided missile test ship. Reclassified AG-157 on 17 May 1958, she completed conversion on 15 November, then departed for testing and evaluation operations out of San Diego and Port Hueneme. While undergoing conversion a mock-up submarine hull was installed on her deck for use in testing a prototype missile handling system. In addition she received launching, recording, and evaluation equipment for testing the launch and flight capabilities of Regulus II guided missiles. Capable of carrying four missiles in her hangar, she was designed as a mobile testing center for these surface-to-surface missiles. Assigned to Submarine Squadron 5, King County conducted her first missile engine firing on 8 December while operating in the Pacific Missile Range. She fired her first Regulus II missile two days later. During the next six months she performed simulated missile launchings and served on telemetry and recovery stations in the Pacific Missile Range. Moreover, she supported the development of America's space program and participated in tracking and recovering missile nose cones. Transferred to the 11th Naval District on 1 July 1959, she continued operating as a missile tracking and recovery ship. During the next year she cruised the missile range off Southern California and Baja California supporting missile firing and recovery operations. Operating out of Port Hueneme, she participated in tracking Temco ASM-N-8 Corvus missile firings in May and July 1960. She also supported the telemetering and recovery of the data capsule from Discovery XII. =Decommissioning and sale= After returning to Port Hueneme on 8 July 1960, she steamed to Long Beach on 19 July and decommissioned the same day. She was sold for scrapping to Zidell Explorations, Inc., on 25 April 1961. Awards LST-857 received one battle star for World War II service and seven battle stars for Korean service.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 24, 1974.  History  A portion of the stone structure dates to circa 1735, however, the land was purchased by the London Land Company prior to 1718, thus the name London Purchase. At some point between 1718 and 1733 John Chapman purchased the land. This is known from a tax list of 1733 upon which his name appeared. In 1736, his name appears on a road survey. After his death in 1743, the property was willed to his son of the same name. During the American Revolution, the property served as headquarters for General Henry Knox and Captain Alexander Hamilton. In 1781, the estate was cited on an Upper Makefield map as being about on \\"Road Over Great Hill\\". The second John Chapman was a doctor as well as a farmer. Little is known about what occurred there during the nineteenth century. From the 1930s to the 1950s the house was owned by Henry and Paula Chapin, and operated as a farm with the help of their children, Charlotte, Anthony and Penney. In the summer of 1948, the owners rented the house to the Percival family. In 1957, the Nelson and Nondas Case bought the house and maintained ownership for three or four years. Mr. Henry Welling and Mr. & Mrs. John H. Welling owned the property and resided here from 1962‚Äì1966. Theodore N. Luz, wife Edith K. Luz, and their five children, Dennis, Nancy, Linda, Kristin and Michael occupied the home from 1966‚Äì1968. The James J. O'Brien family lived there in 1971. In the 1980s, the Norman Flojo family owned the estate and continued to do so into the early 1990s. Since then the house has been sold twice. The current owners built or are building an addition onto the house. The property includes the main house, a barn, a carriage house, and a pond. The O'Brien family owned the estate from August 1969 to October 1973. During this time the estate was situated on of land plus an additional of surrounding property on which local farms planted soy bean and corn crops.

His career had encompassed military service in Egypt, South Africa, Ireland, British India and France and had been rewarded with membership in two chivalric orders. Early career Thesiger was born in October 1868 into the Thesiger family, the son of Lieutenant General Charles Wemyss Thesiger and Charlotte Elizabeth Handcock. He was the middle of three children, with one older sister, Ethel Mary, and one younger brother, Gerald. He was the grandson of the politician Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford and nephew of Major-General Frederic Thesiger and the judge Alfred Henry Thesiger. Thesiger was educated at Eton College before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst for training as an infantry officer.P.106‚Äì107, Bloody Red Tabs, Davies & Maddocks Aged 22, Thesiger was Gazetted into the Rifle Brigade as a second lieutenant on 19 March 1890, and served with his unit in England until 1898, when the regiment was dispatched to Egypt. During his service in England he was promoted to lieutenant on 10 February 1892, and to captain on 26 July 1897.Hart‚Ä≤s army list, 1903 In Egypt, the Rifle Brigade served on the Nile expedition under Horatio Kitchener during the Mahdist War and was present at the Battle of Omdurman which decided the campaign. Thesiger received a brevet appointment as major on 16 November 1898 for his service. The Rifle Brigade was then briefly stationed in Crete during operations to maintain peace between Turkish and Greek populations on the island. In October 1899, Thesiger and the second battalion were sent for service in South Africa in the aftermath of the outbreak of the Second Boer War. There Thesiger saw action and was badly wounded during the battle at Wagon Hill during the Siege of Ladysmith on 6 January 1900. He was mentioned in dispatches for his conduct during the engagement, and received a brevet appointment as lieutenant-colonel in the South African honours list on 29 November 1900. Evacuated to Britain to recover from his wounds, Thesiger attended the Staff College, from which he graduated in 1902. On 7 May 1902 he was appointed a deputy-assistant adjutant- general for Musketry, and until 1906 was in charge of musketry practice on Salisbury Plain, for the 2nd Army Corps. From there he moved to Ireland to work as Assistant Military Secretary to the GOC in Dublin until 1909. From there he was assigned to colonial service as the Inspector General of the King's African Rifles and in 1913 was dispatched to India as a Lieutenant Colonel to command the 4th Battalion of the Rifle Brigade. In 1913 in reward for his distinguished service he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, and the following year was also made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In 1902, Thesiger married Frances Fremantle, daughter of General Fitzroy William Fremantle, and the couple had two children, daughter Oona Thesiger (later Buckley) and son Gerald Thesiger, who became a notable High Court Judge and minor politician. First World War At the outbreak of the First World War, Thesiger and his men were still in India and so did not arrive in Europe until December 1914 when the campaign in France was already well advanced. In May 1915 he was promoted to (temporary) Brigadier-General and given command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade serving in the trenches during the spring of 1915, where he was again mentioned in dispatches. On 27 August 1915, due to the shortage of senior officers, Thesiger was again promoted to (temporary) Major-General and placed in charge of the 33rd Division, one of the new Kitchener Divisions. He was only in this position for just over a week when on 8 September 1915, he was again transferred to the 9th (Scottish) Division, another new division which he would command during the opening of the battle of Loos. Two days after the battle opened, Thesiger's division was suffering heavy casualties and reports were reaching divisional headquarters that the 73rd Infantry Brigade was on the verge of breaking. Thesiger immediately departed for the front line to investigate the situation with his divisional staff and was touring a trench at Fosse 8 opposite the Hohenzollern Redoubt when the German artillery opened fire on the British positions. One of the first shells fired exploded directly in the trench occupied by the 26th Brigade where the party was sheltering, instantly killing Major General Thesiger and his aides Major Le Mottee and Lieutenant Burney. None of their bodies were removed from the battlefield as fighting continued for another day and consequently only Burney's remains were recovered some time later. General Thesiger's name is amongst the 20,000 recorded on the Loos Memorial to the missing.

Administration Initially under Selangor jurisdiction, the district was split following the declaration of Kuala Lumpur as a Federal Territory in 1974. The township of Ampang is located in the Federal Territory side and is an eastern suburb of Kuala Lumpur. The district is now divided into two parts: * Ampang, Selangor, the Selangor segment of Ampang, also known as Ampang Jaya. * Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, the Kuala Lumpur segment of Ampang, alternately known as Ampang Hilir. The district was adjacent to Cheras, Kuala Lumpur and northeast of the Kuala Lumpur Central Business District. Demographics In 1880, the face of the settlement was drastically altered when the British decided to move their capital of the Federated Malay States inland from Klang, and declared the neighbouring city of Kuala Lumpur to be the new capital. Malays are the largest ethnicity in the Ampang area with 52% of the total population, followed by those of Chinese ancestry at 28%. The smallest racial group is Indian at 20%. The original \\"kampongs\\" (unimproved village structures) of the area were eventually replaced by brick buildings sporting tile roofs, of a standardized shop-house design. Plots were regulated with wider streets between them and \\"sanitary lanes\\" behind them. The streets and roads were surfaced with locally found laterite gravel. Salary Approximately 70% of the residents of Ampang have monthly salaries at or above RM3,000 (Ringgit Malaysia), 10% have monthly salaries in the range of RM1000 to RM2999, with the remaining 20% earning RM1000 or less per month.

Because adhesive dental restorative material will adhere to the walls of a cavity preparation made available to it during polymerization, competing forces can arise during restoration of the tooth that can have both short and long term effects that correlate to the configuration of the cavity preparation. Adhesive dental materials Adhesive dental materials are generally used in a semi-liquid or semi-solid state that is then changed into a solid state during or after placement of the material into the cavity preparation -- this process is known as polymerization. This modification of state can occur automatically after a given time period after the material is discharged from the cartridge (referred to as self-polymerization) or this change can be activated by certain wavelengths of light (referred to as light-cured or light-sensitive material) or the material can be activated in both ways (referred to as dual curing). Competing forces Because these materials are adhesive in nature, they bond to the walls of the cavity preparation during curing. Another feature of polymerization is called polymerization shrinkage -- the material shrinks a tiny bit during this change from semi-liquid / semi-solid to solid. Because the material both shrinks and adheres to the walls and floor of the cavity preparation, competing forces arise that can lead to strain in the material (weaknesses in the final restoration) and subsequent early failure of the restoration, and lack of marginal integrity (small gaps between the restoration and the tooth) resulting in post-operative pain and or sensitivity. The role of c-factor in polymerization The number of walls in a cavity preparation have been found to correlate with the number and magnitude of competing forces. For example, a class I cavity preparation exhibits 5 surfaces that will be bonded to by the future adhesive restorative dental material: mesial, distal, facial, lingual and the floor of the preparation; the c-factor would thus be 5. If the restorative material is added to the cavity preparation in one application, this high c-factor will put sufficient stress on the restorative material and increase the likelihood of post-operative pain and sensitivity and early failure.Feilzer, Albert J; de Gee, Anton J; Davidon, Carel L (Nov 1987), \\"Setting stress in composite resin in relation to configuration of the restoration.\\", J Dent Res, 66 (11): 1636‚Äì9 From a very technical perspective, it can be said that \\"the developing curing contraction in a bonded restoration generates stress on the bonded interfaces that are in competition with the developing bond strength of the setting restorative to the cavity surfaces, which may result in (partial) debonding, marginal leakage and post-operative pain.\\"Davidson, Carel L; de Gee, Anton J; Feilzer, Albert J (Dec 1984), \\"The competition between the composite-dentin bond strength and the polymerization contraction stress\\", J Dent Res, 63 (12): 1396‚Äì9 How to prevent polymerization-related deficits in high c-factor cavity preparations Internal stress can be reduced in an adhesive restoration by employing the following techniques: * \\"soft-start\\" polymerization instead of high-intensity light curing * incremental layering to reduce the effects of polymerization shrinkage; and * a stress-breaking liner, such as filled adhesive, flowable composite, or resin-modified glass ionomers * the application of non or low shrinking restorative materials References Further reading * Roberson, Theodore; Haymann, Harold; Swift, Edward (2002), Sturdevant's Art and science of Operative Dentistry, St. Louis, Missouri: Mosby * Davidson, Carel L (1986), \\"Resisting the curing contraction with adhesive composites\\", J Prosthet Dent, 55 (4): 446‚Äì44 Category:Dentistry ","title":"Configuration factor"},{"id":"11845512","text":"David Duncan may refer to: * David Duncan (diplomat) (1923‚Äì2007), British diplomat * David Duncan (ski cross) (born 1982), Canadian ski cross racer * Dave Duncan (baseball) (born 1945), former Major League Baseball player and pitching coach * Dave Duncan (writer) (1933‚Äì2018), Canadian writer * David Duncan (accountant) (born 1960), United States government's star witness in the Arthur Andersen trial * David Duncan (politician) (1830‚Äì1886), British merchant and Liberal politician * David Duncan (writer) (1913‚Äì1999), American screenwriter and novelist; wrote the screenplay for The Time Machine * David Douglas Duncan (1916‚Äì2018), American photographer * David Ewing Duncan (born 1958), American journalist * David F.

The Raxa river is identified with either the Recknitz or the Elde river. The German victory over the Slavs followed up on the August victory at the Lechfeld over the Magyars and marked the high point of Otto's reign. A thirty-year peace followed, only ending with the Slavic revolt in 983. Background While King Otto was distracted by his campaigns against the Magyars, his vassals Wichmann the Younger and his brother Egbert the One- Eyed instigated a Slav revolt in the Billung March. The Obotrites invaded Saxony and sacked the Cocarescemians' settlement, killing the men of arms- bearing age and carrying off the women and children into slavery. According to Widukind of Corvey, in the aftermath of Lechfeld, Otto pressed hard into Slav territory, where Wichmann and Egbert had sought refuge. Otto razed the Slav population centres and soon had encircled them; he offered to spare his enemies if they would surrender. A Slav embassy came to an assembly Otto held in Saxony and offered to pay annual tribute in return for being allowed self- government; \\"otherwise,\\" they said, they would \\"fight for their liberty.\\"Reuter (1991), pp. 161‚Äì62. Reuter argues that this is indicative of a change in German governing practice: a change from overlordship, which the Slavs were willing to accept, to lordship, which the Slavs protested. Dendrodates reveal that in the context of the Saxon-Obotrite conflict, the Slavs in present-day northeast Germany started to build many forts ‚Äì only few forts were built before. A second phase of extensive fort construction occurred in the 980s, in the context of the great uprising of 983.Henning (2011), p. 137.

Aderat et legatio barbarorum tributa socios ex more velle persolvere nuntians, caeterum dominationem regionis velle tenere; hoc pacto pacem velle, alioquin pro libertate armis certare. Imperator ad haec respondit: pacem quidem eis nequaquam negare, sed omnimodis dare non posse, nisi iniuriam perpetratam digno honore ac emendatione purgarent. Omniaque vastando et incendendo per illas regiones duxit exercitum, donec tandem castris positis super Raxam fluvium ad transmeandum paludibus difficillimum ab hostibus circumfunditur.

Igitur preses super paludem et flumen, cui palus adiacens erat, barbarum salutabat. Cui Sclavus aequalia respondit. Ad quem preses: 'Satis tibi esset, si bellum gereres contra unum nostrum de servis domini mei, et non etiam contra dominum meum regem. Quis tibi exercitus, quae arma, ut talia presumas? Si aliqua vobis virtus adsit, si artes, si audatia, date nobis locum ad vos transeundi, sive nos vobis huc veniendi, et aequato loco fortitudo appareat pugnatoris'. Sclavus barbarico more frendens et multa convicia evomens irrisit Geronem imperatoremque et omnem exercitum, sciens eum multis molestiis aggravatum.

Widukind of Corvey said the battlefield was the swampy valley of a river named Raxa, which has been identified as either the Recknitz or Elde river.Reimann et al. (2011), pp. 49, 52‚Äì53. Battle According to Timothy Reuter, Otto I's army of the day was drawn from every regnum (duchy) of the German kingdom, even Bohemia. According to Widukind of Corvey, who gave the only surviving detailed record of the battle, Otto I's campaign came to a halt at the bank of the Raxa river, where the Obotrites and their allies, led by Stoigniew (Stoinef), had taken a defensive position on the opposite embankment. Otto's margrave Gero, together with the allied tribe of the Ruani ‚Äì most probably the earliest mention of the RaniReimann et al. (2011), p. 49. ‚Äì secretly moved to a distinct part of the river to build three bridges, while a feint assault by the remaining forces distracted Stoigniew's army. Stoigniew realized too late that Otto's forces were already crossing the river on another side, and the ensuing encounter was won by the latter. The fate of Stoigniew is described by both Widukind of Corvey and Thietmar of Merseburg. While both agree that he was decapitated, their accounts on how that happened differ: Widukind says that during the battle, Stoigniew was chased into a wood, run down and killed by a soldier named Hosed, who was handsomely rewarded after presenting Otto with Stoigniew's severed head.Leyser (1968), p. 14, based on Widukind. Thietmar of Merseburg claims the captured Stoigniew, whom he calls Stoinneg, was decapitated by Otto. After the battle, according to Widukind, Stoinegin's head was raised on a pole and seven hundred captured Slavs were executed before sundown.Thompson (1928), p. 489. The annals of St. Gallen also report the violent death of Stoigniew, whom they name Ztoignav, but do not detail how he had died. They do however date the battle to the day of their patron, Saint Gall ‚Äì i.e. 16 October. Sources =References= =Bibliography= ;Primary sources *Annales Sangallenses maiores editit I. ab Arx.

He served in the heraldic office of Garter King of Arms, the senior member of the College of Arms in England, from 1842 until his death in 1869. Life Born on 6 April 1795, he was the son of Jonathan Young, a physician who practised in Lambeth. He was educated at Charterhouse School, where he was a contemporary of Connop Thirlwall, George Grote, and Henry and William Havelock. His mother, Mary Waring, was an illegitimate daughter of Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk, and so he was educated under the sponsorship of the Howard family. In 1813 he entered the College of Arms as Rouge Dragon Pursuivant, and became York Herald in 1820. Two years later he was appointed to the registrarship of the college. His appointment, on 6 August 1842, as Garter principal king-of-arms, in succession to Sir William Woods, and in conformity with custom he was knighted (28 August). His cousin Edward Howard Howard-Gibbon succeeded him in his old post. While still York Herald he was employed as secretary to the missions for investing the kings of Denmark, Portugal, and France with the blue riband of the Order of the Garter in 1822, 1823, and 1825. In his capacity as Garter King he was sent as joint- commissioner to invest the king of Saxony in 1842, the sultan of Turkey in 1856, the king of Portugal in 1858, the king of Denmark in 1865, and the king of the Belgians in 1866. His last public employment was that of joint- commissioner to Vienna in 1867 to confer the insignia of the Garter on the emperor of Austria. Young was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 21 March 1822, and was created D.C.L. by the University of Oxford on 28 June 1854. He died at his house in Prince's Terrace, Hyde Park, on 31 August 1869. He married Frances Susannah, youngest daughter of Samuel Lovick Cooper and widow of Frederick Tyrrell, but left no issue. By his will he appointed his brother Henry, barrister-at-law, and his nephew Francis, residuary legatees. Works Young wrote a number of books and pamphlets in the course of his service, including Catalogue of the Arundel Manuscripts in the College of Arms in 1829, and The Order of Precedence in 1851. His contributions to heraldic literature were all privately printed. They include: * ‚ÄòCatalogue of Works on the Peerage ‚Ä¶ of England, Scotland, and Ireland in the Library of C. G. Young, York Herald,‚Äô 1826. * ‚ÄòCatalogue of the Arundel MSS. in the Library of the College of Arms,‚Äô 1829. * ‚ÄòAn Account of the Controversy between Reginald, Lord Grey of Ruthyn, and Sir Edward Hastings in the Court of Chivalry in the Reign of Henry IV,‚Äô 1841. * ‚ÄòThe Order of Precedence, with Authorities and Remarks,‚Äô 1851. * ‚ÄòPrivy Councillors and their Precedence,‚Äô 1860. * ‚ÄòThe Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff and their Precedence,‚Äô 1860. * ‚ÄòOrnaments and Gifts consecrated by the Roman Pontiffs: the Golden Rose, the Cap and the Sword,‚Äô 1860. He shows that the rose was presented to Henry VI, Mary, and Henrietta Maria, the sword to Edward IV and to Henry VII, while Henry VIII was the recipient of both gifts on more occasions than one. In October 1835 Young drew up a report on grievances of the baronets: claims to the title of honourable, to supporters, and to dark-green apparel, with thumb-ring, SS collar, and a white hat and plume. This report was printed for private circulation; from its pages Benjamin Disraeli derived the colouring for his portrait of Sir Vavasour, who dilates on the wrongs of his order in Sybil (1845).

This battle was essentially a meeting engagement with Swedish troops arriving on the battlefield at different times. It is uncertain how many actually participated, and its actual date is disputed. Some sources, such as Polish-language Military Encyclopedia, claim it took place on February 18, while historian Leszek Podhorecki wrote that it was on February 19. The result was a Swedish victory.  Background  In mid-February 1656, Swedish army under King Charles X Gustav camped near a village of Golab, located in northern Lesser Poland, near the confluence of the Wieprz and Vistula rivers. The Swedes awaited Polish units of Stefan Czarniecki. The Poles were divided into two groups; one commanded by Czarniecki himself, another headed by Colonel Sebastian Machowski. Swedish units had a number of Polish soldiers, who had deserted to their side. Among the Poles that served the Swedish King in this battle, was Jan Sobieski. According to Polish historian Leszek Podhorecki, King Charles Gustav, after finding out about anti-Swedish insurrection in southern Lesser Poland, decided to move his army there. The Swedes crossed the Pilica river on February 12, forcing Czarniecki to withdraw behind the Vistula, and camp near Golab. The battle Swedish army crossed the frozen Vistula near Kazimierz Dolny, surprising a Polish regiment stationed there. The Swedes then moved along right bank of the river, reaching Golab, where they surprised the scattered Polish forces. Swedish front guard, under General Horn and Count Valdemar Christian of Schleswig-Holstein opened fire, moving forwards. This caused retreat of Polish forces, which was stopped by Czarniecki, who ordered a counter-attack. At the same time, additional Swedish units entered the fray, gaining numerical superiority over the Poles. Swedish regiments, commanded personally by the King, backed for a while, but soon Polish attacked was halted under Swedish fire. To prevent his forces from complete destruction, Czarniecki ordered them to retreat. A number of Polish soldiers drowned while crossing the Wieprz, when the ice broke. Total Polish loses, however, were estimated at less than 150, mainly due to Czarniecki‚Äôs order to give up the battle and flee.  Aftermath  Charles Gustav was confident that the battle ended in complete destruction of Czarniecki‚Äôs army. This was untrue, as the Poles used a maneouver, which they had observed while fighting Crimean Tatars. Their forces scattered across the area, to concentrate again after a few days. The Battle of Golab was described by Henryk Sienkiewicz, in his novel Deluge. Swedish units Swedish Regiments: *F√§ltm.

Iroquois and Seneca Nations  The Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy and the Seneca Nation occupied the lands now known as Erie. For a history of the Native Americans who occupied this land before Europeans, see Erie Indians.  Early French settlement  The French built Fort Presque Isle near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to garrison New France against the encroaching English. The French word \\"Presque- isle\\" means peninsula (literally \\"almost an island\\") and refers to that piece of land that juts into Lake Erie that is now called Presque Isle State Park. When the fort was abandoned by the French in 1760, it was their last post west of Niagara. The British occupied the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763.History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Vol I (1884:Warner, Beer's and Company, Chicago), pg 503  Erie Triangle  Present day Erie would have been situated in a disputed triangle of land that was claimed by the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut (as part of its Western Reserve), and Massachusetts. It officially became part of Pennsylvania on 3 March 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York released their claims to the federal government, which in turn sold the land to Pennsylvania for $151,600 in Continental certificates. The Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy released the land to Pennsylvania in January 1789 for payments of $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. The Seneca Nation separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800.Nelson's Biographical Dictionary and Historical Reference Book of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Vol I, pp 103-04  Surveying and settlement  The General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on 18 April 1795. Andrew Ellicott, who famously completed Pierre Charles L'Enfant's survey of Washington, D.C. and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey in June 1795. Initial settlement of the area began that year.History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Vol I (1884:Warner, Beer's and Company, Chicago), pg 505-06 In 1795, Colonel Seth Reed and his family, natives of Uxbridge, Massachusetts, moved here from Geneva, New York, to become the first European settlers of Erie. Reed erected a log cabin at the mouth of Mill Creek, becoming the first permanent building in Erie. Reed's other sons, Rufus S. Reed and George W. Reed, came to Erie later in the year. Erie was established as a borough by act of the General Assembly on 29 March 1805. This act created a Borough and Town Council headed by a burgess. This form of government stood until the City of Erie was incorporated on 14 April 1851, when a mayoralty and Select Council were established.History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Vol I (1884:Warner, Beer's and Company, Chicago), pg 535  War of 1812  brig Niagara played an important role in the War of 1812. During the War of 1812, President James Madison ordered the construction of a naval fleet at Erie in order to regain control of Lake Erie. Noted shipbuilders Daniel Dobbins of Erie and Noah Brown of New York led construction of four schooner-rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry arrived from Rhode Island to command the squadron. His fleet successfully fought the British in the historic Battle of Lake Erie, which was the decisive victory that solidified United States control of the Great Lakes.  Erie Gauge War  Erie was an important railroad hub in the mid-19th century. However, the railroad north to Buffalo, New York used 6' track up to the New York border, while the railroad west to Cleveland, Ohio and that from the New York border to Buffalo from was on the narrower 4' 10\\" gauge. What this meant was that there was no line through Erie; every passenger had to change trains, and every piece of cargo had to be moved by railroad stevedores and wagons between trains. While the trains were timed to connect, delays could cause passengers to miss their connection; they then needed a meal and a bed in Erie. The delays inconvenienced both passengers and cargo, adding to the time and therefore the expense of travel by rail between Buffalo to Cleveland. However, they provided much needed jobs in Erie. Travelers were patrons of Erie hotels, restaurants, and stores. Those shipping goods needed manpower, and some of this came from Erie itself; there were many self-employed \\"men with a horse\\" and a wagon moving goods. The two railroads themselves provided jobs. It was obvious to everone except those from Erie that this was a ridiculous situation. The 6' section needed to be changed 4'10\\", the national standard, so trains could go through Erie, and passengers and goods would not have to change trains twice between Buffalo and Cleveland. However, this would have a substantial negative effect on employment and the economy in Erie, which benefited from the unavoidable train change. The citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track, and in general did everything imaginable to prevent the change.  Prohibition era  State and 9th Street in downtown Erie during the early 1920s. Erie's congressional representative Milton W. Shreve supported the Volstead Act and the Eighteenth Amendment. Miles Nason, another Erie Prohibitionist, headed the Dry Block in the Pennsylvania State Senate.Carney, John G., Highlights of Erie Politics, 1960, pg 66 But Erie was primarily a \\"wet\\" city. Being a border town, Erie was an important transportation hub in the rum-running of illicit liquor across the lake from Canada during Prohibition in the United States. John G. Carney, in his \\"Highlights of Erie Politics\\", says that many \\"laid in a large supply of liquor before the law became effective. Cellars, book cases, and closets were packed....\\"Carney, pg 67 Speakeasies opened across the city, the more popular being the Pickwick Club, the Killarney Yacht Club, Laura's, and 1008. Carney noted that \\"... about the only dry thing in Erie was the inside of a light bulb.\\" Illicit liquor sales brought racketeering, violence, and houses of prostitution. Intervention by the state police was not welcomed by Mayor Miles B. Kitts, who went to Harrisburg and testified before well-publicized hearings conducted by Pennsylvania Governor William C. Sproul. But the actions of local and state law enforcement and the governor's hearings offered only a brief respite from all the excitement. As Carney concluded, \\"...and Erie 'roared' merrily on throughout the rest of the 'Roaring Twenties.' \\" Shreve fell from favor with the Republicans, who promoted attorney Robert Firman as their candidate in the April 1920 primaries. Shreve narrowly escaped removal from the United States Congress. State Senator Nason was also challenged by the Republicans in the primaries, but was defeated in the 2 November 1920 elections.Carney, pg 66 Depression era The Great Depression deflated Erie's enthusiasm for lawlessness and prompted a solid political movement towards repeal of Prohibition.Carney, pp 67-68 Democratic Party chairman for Erie County and future mayor James P. Rossiter was able to promise strong local voter support for Democratic-Liberal candidate for state governor John Hemphill when he visited Erie with a strong agenda for repeal in October 1930.Uniontown (Pennsylvania) Morning Herald, 21 October 1930  Recent developments  In 2007, the Erie Downtown Improvement District (DID) contracted a Philadelphia- based company (Kise, Straw, & Kolodner) to set up a \\"master plan\\" for the city of Erie's downtown.The Erie Times News, Downtown Reviatlization The DID plan includes building several mid-rise and high-rise structures which will be used primarily for housing and retail expansion in the city center.

J√∫lio Ximenes S√™nior (13 March 1901, Uberaba, Minas Gerais - April 11, 1975, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro) was a Brazilian scientist and medical doctor, in the research field of biochemistry, microbiology, and was also a career Brazilian Army officer. Military Career He attained the rank of brigadier-general during World War II. He had also served as a captain in S√£o Paulo during the Revolution of 1930, which ultimately brought twice- Brazilian president, Get√∫lio Vargas, into power for the first time. Dr. Ximenes sustained injuries in these conflicts, and was decorated for bravery under fire. During his military life, he and his family were relocated all over Brazil, including to very remote military outposts of the Amazon, and Mato Grosso do Sul. He was later permanently transferred to Rio de Janeiro, then capital of Brazil, where his family were amongst the first inhabitants of a burgeoning Copacabana, the legendary Carioca beach. He served as requisitioner-general of the Brazilian Army, a position requiring tact, as well as honesty, as pharmaceutical companies were insistent that their stock be chosen over the other. In fact, President Vargas once said of the General, \\"Ximenes is a rare Brazilian: a completely incorruptible man\\". B√©champ versus Pasteur In 1957, having combed the archives of several countries for almost a decade, he wrote B√©champ versus Pasteur, a Portuguese-language monograph on Antoine B√©champ's battles with arch-rival, Louis Pasteur on the topic of germ theory (specifically, pleomorphic theory). He later published in 1960 a French-language version, B√©champ contre Pasteur, which received numerous citations in France, including towards the end of his life, a Palmes Acad√©miques from the French government in recognition of his distinguished services in the field of scientific research. The English-language edition was published in 1963, entitled B√©champ against Pasteur (Their Ideas And Their Fights), and notably all 3 editions were written and translated by the author himself (he credited his daughter with help in the English version, though he was fluent in English). Death He is buried in famed Rio de Janeiro cemetery, Cemit√©rio S√£o Jo√£o Batista, which has been referred to as the Brazilian P√®re Lachaise. His grave is located a few yards away from his renowned contemporary, the Hollywood actress, Carmen Miranda, and where fellow Franco-Brazilian pioneer aviator, Alberto Santos-Dumont, is also buried.

Directed by Gil Kenan in his live-action directorial debut, the film stars Saoirse Ronan, Harry Treadaway, Bill Murray, Mackenzie Crook, Martin Landau, Mary Kay Place, Toby Jones and Tim Robbins. Produced by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman's Playtone and Walden Media, City of Ember was theatrically released on October 10, 2008 by 20th Century Fox, two months after the release of the final book in the series, The Diamond of Darkhold. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing only $17.9 million against a budget of $55 million. It became a cult film over time.https://www.cbr.com/end-of-the-world-movies- you-should-watch/ As of 2019, there are no plans for a sequel or reboot.https://screenrant.com/city-ember-2-updates-release-date-story/ Plot As an unspecified global catastrophe looms, an underground city known as Ember is constructed to shelter a large group of survivors. In addition, a small metal box intended for a future generation of Emberites is timed to open after 200 years. This box is entrusted to the Mayor of the City of Ember, and each Mayor passes it on to his or her successor. When the seventh Mayor dies suddenly, the succession is broken, and over time, the significance of the box is forgotten. The box opens by itself at the allotted time, but this goes unnoticed. Several decades later, Ember's generator begins to fail, and food, medicine and other necessities are in dangerously short supply. At a rite of passage for all graduating students of Ember City School, Mayor Cole stands before the students as their adult occupations are assigned by lottery. Doon Harrow, the son of inventor and repairman Loris Harrow, is assigned \\"Messenger\\" while his classmate Lina Mayfleet is assigned \\"Pipeworks\\" and apprenticed to the elderly technician Sul. Shortly afterwards, the two secretly exchange assignments. At home, Lina (a descendant of the seventh Mayor) finds the opened box and enlists Doon's help to decipher its contents. Gradually, they learn that it contains a set of instructions and directions for an exit from the city. Later, after evading a gigantic star-nosed mole, they also discover that Mayor Cole has been hoarding canned food in a secret vault for his own benefit while the people go hungry. When Lina attempts to report this, the Mayor captures her and tries to steal the box, but she escapes during a blackout. Now fugitives from the Mayor's police, Lina and Doon, accompanied by Lina's little sister Poppy, use the instructions and assistance from Sul to flee the city via a subterranean river. When the repercussions of their actions trigger a panic in Ember City, the Mayor locks himself in his vault, only to be devoured by the giant mole. Doon, Lina and Poppy eventually reach the Earth's surface where they, for the first time in their lives, witness a sunrise. They also locate Ember in a hole in the ground, too far for them call to anyone. So before they explore, they drop a letter with information on how to get out, tied to a rock, into Ember, where it is found by Loris.

Stephen Holden of The New York Times said that the \\"talents of Saoirse Ronan, the brilliant young actress from Atonement\\", were \\"wasted in the science-fiction juvenilia of City of Ember\\" though he added: \\"Most of the time, however, it's a whiz-bang kid's film with neat gadgets and sound effects and an extended chase and escape sequence through underground rivers and tunnels. At only 95 minutes, the movie feels as though it had been shredded in the editing room... The best things about this are scenes of the ominous grinding machinery of the kind found in railway yards, as well as several zany gadgets worthy of Rube Goldberg. The wittiest is a primitive telephone- answering machine that resembles the do-it-yourself hi-fi kits assembled by audiophiles in the early days of stereo... Tim Robbins is also on hand as Doon's earnest, secretly rebellious father, who spends his days tinkering with exotic inventions... But not to worry: the boundless resourcefulness of two curious, clean-cut adolescents full of gee-whiz enthusiasm may lead humanity back into the fresh air and sunlight.\\" Justin Chang of Variety also gave the film a mixed review, calling the film \\"A fabulously designed underground metropolis proves more involving than the teenagers running through its streets in City of Ember, a good-looking but no more than serviceable adaptation of Jeanne Duprau's 2003 novel. Director Gil Kenan's disappointing live-action follow-up to his enjoyable toon debut, Monster House, shows promising flickers of the visual invention throughout, but the dramatic sparks fail to ignite in this simple-minded exercise in juvenile dystopia.\\" Chang also observed that the characters represent \\"English-speaking, predominantly Caucasian humanity.\\" Irv Slifkin for Video Business wrote, \\"this lavishly designed adventure saga from director Gil Kenan... plays like Terry Gilliam's Brazil ‚Äî for beginners\\". He praised the \\"secret escape plan hidden by Ember's founders\\" and \\"impressive technical work,\\" concluding that there were \\"drama and sometimes lethargic pacing, but there's enough here for middle- and high- school kids to think about and marvel over.\\" Cinema Blend's editor-in-chief, Katey Rich gave the film 2.5 of 5 stars and said, \\"The City of Ember belongs to one of the best and most enduring genres of children's films, in which smart kids stand up against the ignorant and aloof adult world and have a big adventure in the process. It also throws in a fantastical city, replete with whiz-bang inventions and secret societies. It's a mystery, then, that all the happy elements only add up to a big mush, a dull adventure, and a contrived fantasy. Saoirse [sic] Ronan is a fantastic heroine, but the story and the rest of the cast can't keep up with her lively pace.\\" She added that \\"director Gil Kenan seems hellbent on just driving the narrative forward. The movie clocks in at an acceptably short time for a kid's movie, but so much gets lost or glossed over along the way. Ember itself is fascinating, an intricately detailed set that, like Diagon Alley or the Star Wars cantina, you'd like to take a few hours to wander around in. But so many questions about the city are left unanswered... You get the feeling that Jeanne Duprau's book got into this stuff, while the movie never seems to have the time.\\" TV Guide was more forgiving with 3.5 out of 4 stars, pointing out, \\"A fun and moving family film with a subtly dark feel rarely seen in kids' movies since the '80s, City of Ember succeeds despite its shortcomings, not only because of its fun and inspiring story, but because most of its flaws are things kids won't notice anyway... [T]he story spins into a classic fable; the ignorance that seemed so blissful shows it's just one half of a coin, where the other side holds apathy and hopelessness. The moral might well be lost on kids, but for adults, it's compelling ‚Äî all the more so because we like the good people of this dying city.\\" This reviewer praised the \\"series of exciting adventures\\" and argued that \\"Lina and Doon's vigilant sense of hope is, in the end, incredibly inspiring and extremely pertinent... It might be a staple theme in family films, but the City of Ember is a useful reminder about the power of the human spirit to triumph where our own hopelessly broken systems have failed. It's a message that the filmmakers didn't take for granted ‚Äî and that hopefully viewers won't either\\". =Box office= On its opening weekend, the film opened poorly at #11 at the US box office with US$3,129,473. As of February 20, 2010, the film has grossed US$17,929,684 worldwide, well below its US$55 million budget. =Accolades= Saoirse Ronan was nominated for 2009 Irish Film and Television Award as \\"Best Actress in a Lead Role in a Film\\".IMDB Awards Art director Jon Billington and production designer Martin Laing were nominated for Satellite Awards in 2008 for their design of the film, as was Ruth Myers for her costume design.

The game has been played since 1990 and shared online since 1996. Icar is a typical space opera with a race of killer robots, bionics, faster than light space travel and energy weapons. Icar can be downloaded as a PDF for free from the official website. The majority of Icar is written by Rob Lang, with contributions from Andrew O'Byrne.  Play overview  Icar is a traditional roleplaying game designed for sandbox play. Each player creates their own player characters to match the theme of a setting and directs the actions of their character during the course of player. Icar is intended for use over a number sessions in the form of a campaign. Icar departs traditional roleplaying games by creating a sandboxed world using timelines and events. A timeline is a story arc and events are pivotal moments in that story arc. The player characters interact with the events and by doing so affect future events. Icar uses different mechanics for different types of combat, using both 10 sided (D10) and percentile (D100) dice. Due to the speed and complexity of combat, Icar is not designed for use with miniatures, instead favouring paper and pencil maps. = Game Mechanics = Before the game begins, each player creates a player character (PC) on a number of character sheets. Character creation begins by the creation of a concept: a short description of who the character is and what their motivations are. Attributes represent the core physical and mental properties of the character and are determined with by rolling a die or by point assignment. The Attributes are 'Battle', 'Meat', 'Shift', 'Wit' and 'Soul'. Skills and starting equipment are provided by a role template called a 'Skeleton' and close combat combinations (combos) are built. Icar uses the 'Deviant Wheel' as a way of representing the personality of the character. The Deviant Wheel is a radial disc of personality traits, with opposing traits opposite each other on the disc. Players colour divisions on the wheel to represent the strength of that trait, 4 in Selfish would yield a 1 in generous. The Deviant Wheel is a guide (not a restriction) for play and acts as a way of charting a character's personal growth. Player can choose to have up to 3 random character benefits from the Psychotheatrics list. Psychotheatrics can severely handicap a character, which can make it more fun to play. Skills are learnt abilities that are measured with percentage. To perform a skill, the player must perform a skill check by rolling a percentile (D100) under the skill value. Each of the combat areas has its own ruleset, modeling that particular combat.  Close Combat  Close combat deals with close quarters combat, fist fights and sword fights. In a single combat round, player characters pick from a predefined sequence of moves called a \\"Combo\\". Each move is paired off and if there is a successful hit, damage (either physical or stun) is done.  Fire Fighting  Fire fighting is the most common form of combat in Icar. A player rolls a percentile to hit the target and damage is done depending on the weapon's penetration, the target's armour and rounds fired. Modifiers are used to account for the situation.  Dog Fighting  Dog fighting covers combat in vehicles. Each vehicle attempts to gain a firing position over the other by performing manoeuvres. Passengers in the vehicle can fire out of the vehicle using Fire Fighting rules.  Space Combat  In Space Combat the player characters form the crew of a space craft, each taking a role. Each turn, the team can choose to run or fight. Some crew members operate weapons, others perform repairs. At each turn, everyone in the team will be involved in the combat. = Game Background = Icar is set in the year 92030. A benevolent Imperium protects the human race from a race of killer robots called the Droids. The Droids, who are cunning but lack innovation are fighting an internal war as well as the humans across the length of the Galaxy, except in Human Occupied Space, which is safely held by the humans. Humanity is without race, religion or creed. Instead, it partitions along philosophical lines: those who believe that technology is the answer and those that believe humanity should remain pure. Energy, food, clean water and habitable planets are plentiful. Space travel, bionics, holistic medicine are common. Large corporations influence local policies and criminal syndicates evade capture with cunning. = Scavenger Setting = Included in the core rulebook is an example game Setting where player characters explore empty husks of abandoned human habitation. Dangerous work with the chance of great reward. The setting is designed for new players and GMs as a method of learning the system and giving the GM a starting point for designing their own campaign setting. = Player Handouts = Icar is designed with player handouts in mind. Every space craft, weapon and car has a handout that can be given to the players. Special rules and statistics are included on the sheets. These handouts are a physical representation of the item, when it is dropped or taken away then the handout is too.  Game History  Icar was conceived in 1990, inspired by viewing others playing RPGs at the Finchley Games Club (North London, UK). Typed on an 8086 PC and printed on a dot matrix, with weapons drawn in pencil. Version 1 had two statistics: Agility and Strength but the fire fighting and skills mechanics are much the same as they are today. As computing technology improved, so did the game and version 2 of the game appeared in 1993, more statistics and less definition in the rule. In 1996, version 3 was created, ready for a University audience. It introduced the modern game with Deviant Wheel, 5 Statistics, Close Combat, sandbox play and tightened rules for skill use and fire fights. The first Icar website went live in 1996, sharing the rules, equipment and game ideas. Version 3 split the core documents into Elements (core rules), Society (background), Scavenger Setting and Equipment Index. In 2009, a complete rewrite of the core rules began, building in the three main parts of Icar to make version 4. Version 4 was released as a Beta (meaning that it had not been proof read) in January 2012. Shortly after, a new website was created along with a blog and integration into the forum. Once Icar has completed proofreading, a print-on-demand service will be used to allow gamers to have a physical copy off the book.

Thy (, local dialect ) is a traditional district in northwestern Jutland, Denmark. It is situated north of the Limfjord, facing the North Sea and Skagerrak, and has a population of around 44,000. The capital is Thisted population of 14.000. Snedsted, Hanstholm and Hurup are minor towns in the area. Since the Danish municipal reform of 1 January 2007, Thy is roughly identical with Thisted Municipality which belongs to the North Denmark Region. The southernmost part of Thy, the Thyholm Peninsula, belongs to Struer Municipality in the Central Denmark Region. Before the merger, Thy consisted of four municipalities: Hanstholm, Thisted, Sydthy and Thyholm. Thy forms the western part of the North Jutlandic Island and borders Hanherred to the northeast with Vendsyssel even further northeast. In the Limfjord is the island of Mors, considered a twin district of Thy, and south of the fjord is Hardsyssel in western mainland Jutland. Thy is traditionally regarded part of northern and western Jutland alike. The dialect belongs to the West Jutlandic group.  Nature  View over part of the Thy National park. Thy has a very varied landscape. In the north it is marked by flat coastal plains which were covered by sea in Neolithic times, but fell dry because of the post-glacial rebound. These are interrupted with higher-lying plains that were islands in the Neolithic sea. In the slopes that formed the coast in these times, high- lying limestone is often visible - hence the name of the Limfjord. The eastern stretch, facing the Limfjord, has quite fertile soil, is slightly hilly and dotted with small villages and farms like the landscape in most of rural Denmark. The landscape is marked by strong western winds, most trees bending eastwards. The west coast has wide beaches and high dunes with Leymus grass and sea-buckthorn. Behind the dunes, there is heath with stretches of Calluna heather, Iceland moss, Cladonia, crowberry, bilberry, blueberry, cranberry and orchids including the unique Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. calcifugiens. This is the result of huge sand drifts in the 15th to 19th centuries which covered much formerly fertile land. The sand drifting affected the whole west coast of Jutland, and various other parts of Denmark as well like Tisvilde on Zealand for example. Since Thy is exposed to winds from both the north and the west, even from the North Atlantic, the sand drift went the furthest inland in this area, as far as . Parts of the sandy stretches have been turned into conifer woods. A line of lakes, believed to have been caused by the sand drifts blocking the outflow to the sea, mark the border between the western, sparsely populated sandy area and the eastern, fertile farmland. The wetlands Vejlerne in the northeast are the largest bird sanctuary in Northern Europe.Vejlerne Nearby is the bird cliff Bulbjerg. = The national park = On 22 August 2008, Thy National Park officially opened, as the first of three realized national parks out of seven planned. On 10 July 2007, a police officer from Hanstholm found a hermit in the state forest of Hjardem√•l Klit, one of the more deserted areas in the north of Thy. For three years, the middle-aged man from Zealand had been living in the primitive forest shelters of the district and made a living from collecting empty bottles. For the same period he had been missed by his parents, who thought he was dead, but he was now re-united with them on the initiative of the police officer. Forest workers told they were aware of the man's existence, particularly that he had left behind many eggshells at the shelters and seemingly was nourished on eggs, but since he didn't do any harm they had left him alone.Hermit re-united with parents, Thisted Dagblad/Nordjyske, 11 July 2007 (in Danish) On 19 November 2012, a dead wolf was found in the national park area. After thorough DNA-tests it was finally confirmed that there was a 100% match with a wolfpack in the Lausitz- region in Sachsen, Germany. The wolf was four years old and it is believed that it traversed the 850 km to Thy National Park. Wolves have been exterminated in Denmark for 200 years. In the beginning of 2013 a wolf-like creature was observed in Thy and a carcass bearing marks associated with a wolf-kill was found on 18 February. On 1 March 2013, the Minister of the Environment Ida Auken, initiated on this background the formulation of a Danish action plan concerning wolves.Yep, it was a wolf The Copenhagen Post (07.12.12)Breeding wolves in Jutland probable within 10 years DCE - Danish Centre For Environment And Energy (Aarhus University)  History  Thy is originally the same word as Old Norse √æj√≥√∞ (\\"thioth\\"), meaning people. The Danish Census Book of King Valdemar II of 1231 mentions Thiuth√¶sys√¶l, i.e. the syssel of Thy. Thy is by some scholars thought to be the origin of the Teutons;Nudansk Ordbog, Politikens Forlag, 1986, Ptolemy placed the Teutons and the Cimbri at the northern end of Jutland on his ancient map. =Antiquity= In the Stone Age, probably before it got its later name, Thy exported fine flint present in the limestone. A Neolithic flint quarry has been restored at Hov east of Thisted. Thy was densely populated in the Bronze Age and has a great number of burial mounds. =Middle Ages= In the Viking Age the area had vital trade links across the North Sea, being Christianised from England by Saint Theodgarus, a missionary originally from Thuringia and trained in England, unlike other parts of Denmark that were Christianised from the south. The former cathedral and monastery of Theodgarus in Vestervig is today the largest village church of Scandinavia. In 1085 Thy was the gatehead for King Canute the Holy's plans to retake England from William the Conqueror, with 1,000 ships gathered in the Limfjord until the expedition was cancelled and a peasant uprising broke out. =World War II= In the Second World War Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany. The German Wehrmacht built huge fortifications along the west coast of Jutland for fear that the allied invasion would take place here. The vast bunker complexes in Hanstholm have been restored and are open to the public. Economy Thy is still a mainly rural area, the traditional businesses of agriculture and fishery being more prevalent than in many other areas of Denmark. N√∏rre Vorup√∏r. =Tourism= Tourism is a major business in summer, the coastal villages receiving many German tourists and smaller numbers of Norwegians, Swedes, Dutch and others. Although the coastal resorts have areas with individual holiday houses, they maintain a native population as well. The only major hotel-like holiday complex is at Vigs√∏ Bugt east of Hanstholm. Thy has become a major destination for windsurfing. = Industry = There is some small and medium scale industry, with no single company exceeding 1,000 employees. These include wooden furniture ( NJA in Nors), prefab windows (Ideal Combi in Hurup) and Sj√∏rring Maskinfabrik in Sj√∏rring (subsupplier to Volvo and Scania). The harbour of Hanstholm with related ferries and fish processing industries employ about 2-3000 people. Most major employers are based in Thisted: Cimbria (combine harvesters and grain dryers), Coloplast (medical plastic products), Oticon (hearing aids), and HM Automatic/Thy El-Teknik (industrial electrical systems). Food industry includes Tican (meat processing/slaughterhouse), Dragsb√¶k Maltfabrik (malt), Dragsb√¶k Margarinefabrik (margarine), and Mejerigaarden/Polar Is (one of Denmark's largest ice cream manufacturers), all in Thisted. Thisted Bryghus was the first Danish brewery to introduce ecological beer and has a growing sale of its many speciality beer types.baja- thisted.dk (in Danish) = Education = Secondary education includes the gymnasium and EUC Nordvest of Thisted. The latter offers technical and mercantile secondary education in Thy Uddannelsescenter which consists of several higher educations. Many youths leave the area for major centres of higher education such as √Ölborg and √Örhus, and only a few of them return to Thy after finishing their education. The Nordic Folk Centre for Renewable Energy is internationally known for its research in wave energy and small- scale windmills for developing countries.  Infrastructure  With its position in the northwestern corner of Jutland, Thy is far from the greater traffic corridors. There is, however, some international transit traffic due to the ferry lines from Hanstholm harbour to Western Norway and the North Atlantic. = Roads = *National route 26, in part a 2+1 road, goes from the harbour of Hanstholm diagonally across Jutland to Viborg (route 13) and √Örhus (motorway and European route E45). *National route 11 passes through Thy from north to south on its way from Aalborg down to the German border at T√∏nder. *National route 29 goes from Hanstholm eastwards to the E45 motorway at Hobro. *Secondary national route 181 is part of the Green Coastal Road, a scenic route along the North Sea from Norway to Belgium. In Thy it offers some of the straightest road in Denmark, set in a vast dune and heath landscape along the coast. = Bridges = * Oddesund Bridge (southwards to western Jutland, carries national route 11 and railway) * Vilsund Bridge (eastwards to the island of Mors and from there onwards to central Jutland, national route 26) = Railways = * The Thy Line (Thisted-Struer), local trains operated by Arriva as well as two daily Intercity trains to Copenhagen. * A railway from Thisted to Aalborg via Fjerritslev existed from 1904 to 1/4-1969. = Ferries = To the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway: * Hanstholm - T√≥rshavn- Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur Smyril Line * Hanstholm - Kristiansand Thy ferries cargo as (in Norwegian) Small internal ferries on the Limfjord: * Agger-Thybor√∏n (connecting the two sand spits at the western mouth of the Limfjord, on route 181) * Neessund (to Mors) * Feggesund (strictly speaking from Hanherred to Mors) = Airports = * Thisted Airport, currently no scheduled traffic The closest airports with scheduled flights are Aalborg Airport and Karup Airport.

Recursive partitioning creates a decision tree that strives to correctly classify members of the population by splitting it into sub-populations based on several dichotomous independent variables. The process is termed recursive because each sub-population may in turn be split an indefinite number of times until the splitting process terminates after a particular stopping criterion is reached. thumb240x240px A recursive partitioning tree showing survival of passengers on the Titanic (\\"sibsp\\" is the number of spouses or siblings aboard). The figures under the leaves show the probability of survival and the percentage of observations in the leaf. Summarizing: Your chances of survival were good if you were (i) a female or (ii) a young boy without several family members. Recursive partitioning methods have been developed since the 1980s. Well known methods of recursive partitioning include Ross Quinlan's ID3 algorithm and its successors, C4.5 and C5.0 and Classification and Regression Trees. Ensemble learning methods such as Random Forests help to overcome a common criticism of these methods - their vulnerability to overfitting of the data - by employing different algorithms and combining their output in some way. This article focuses on recursive partitioning for medical diagnostic tests, but the technique has far wider applications. See decision tree. As compared to regression analysis, which creates a formula that health care providers can use to calculate the probability that a patient has a disease, recursive partition creates a rule such as 'If a patient has finding x, y, or z they probably have disease q'. A variation is 'Cox linear recursive partitioning'.  Advantages and disadvantages  Compared to other multivariable methods, recursive partitioning has advantages and disadvantages. *Advantages are: **Generates clinically more intuitive models that do not require the user to perform calculations. **Allows varying prioritizing of misclassifications in order to create a decision rule that has more sensitivity or specificity. **May be more accurate. *Disadvantages are: ** Does not work well for continuous variables ** May overfit data. Examples Examples are available of using recursive partitioning in research of diagnostic tests. Goldman used recursive partitioning to prioritize sensitivity in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction among patients with chest pain in the emergency room.

Homeland They were first described, during the reign of Emperor Ba'eda Maryam (r. 1468‚Äì1478), as inhabiting the region between Enderta and Lake Ashenge (in Tigray Province), neighboring the Afars of the vassal Dankali Sultanate on the east.Pankhurst, Richard. The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century (Asmara, Eritrea: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 106. The area was described by Francisco √Ålvares during his stay in Ethiopia as being five days' journey (ca. 100 km) in length, and extending far into Muslim Afar territory. One of their largest towns, Manadeley, situated on the edge of the Ethiopian Highlands and overlooking the Afar lowlands, was a market town of great size. √Ålvares describes it as a town of \\"very great trade, like a city or seaport\\", where any good could be found, and with merchants from a number of areas, such as Jeddah, Fez, elsewhere in Morocco, Tunis, Greece, Ormus, Cairo, and India, as well as an uncountable number of people from surrounding regions in Ethiopia.Pankhurst, Ethiopian Borderlands, p. 111. Culture The Dobe'a tended numerous high quality cows (the largest in the world, according to √Ålvares), and subsisted mainly on banditry and pastoralism prior to the 15th century, when they converted to an agropastoral system and many converted to Christianity as a result of Campaigns taken by Emperor Ba'eda Maryam. The Dobe'a were ruled by 24 leaders, 12 of whom were often at war and 12 at peace. People The Dobe'a are first mentioned in the 15th century as a \\"black\\" (tselim) people, as opposed to the \\"red\\" (qeyyih) Ethiopians. History =Attacks by Emperor Ba'eda Maryam= Emperor Baeda Maryam conducted a campaign against the Dobe'a early in his reign, but they had evacuated their cattle, camels, and his campaign was unable to track down any Dobe'a. He subsequently rode into the area himself, but the Dobe'as recognized him from a distance and were able to flee, their possessions already having been evacuated. At this point, the \\"Dankal√©,\\" the ruler of the Danakil (vassal Dankali Sultanate), offered to intervene and help in the Emperor's campaign. He sent the Emperor a horse, a mule laden with dates, a shield, and two spears to show his support, along with a message saying, \\"I have set up my camp, O my master, with the intention of stopping these people. If they are your enemies, I will not let them pass, and will seize them.\\"Pankhurst, Ethiopian Borderlands, pp.106-7, 110. Ba'eda Maryam sent his men against the Dobe'as again, but his campaign was defeated and suffered heavy casualties. Ba'eda Maryam was by this point infuriated, criticizing his soldiers for attacking without orders and stating his determination to remain in the Dobe'a country until he had subdued the country to the point where he could sow grain there and his horses could eats its crop. He then dispatched Jan Zeg, the Garad (governor) of Bale, in a campaign in the region of Gam, where the Garad was killed. Cholera (or some other pestilence) broke out among his men, depressing him further, resulting in his withdrawal to Tigray. There he called upon one of his best fighting regiments, Jan Amora (\\"Royal Eagle\\") after which the sub-province and woreda were named, who were eager to participate in the campaign. The twelve Dobe'a leaders learned of the new attack being prepared, and began to flee in various directions into the lowlands of Adal with their women, children, and cattle, with their property loaded on their camels and other beasts of burden. The Emperor heard of their plans, however, and mounted another campaign against Dobe'as, sending the governors of Tigray, Qeda and Damot to pursue them. This new campaign was successful, resulting in the capture of many cattle and the deaths of many Dobe'a, both in the main attack and the following pursuit.Pankhurst, Ethiopian Borderlands, p.110. After this defeat, many of the Dobe'a converted to Christianity and begged the Emperor for his pardon. The Emperor in turn returned their cattle, supplementing it with others from the southern provinces of Wej and Genz and stationed soldiers in their country. He further built a church in Dobe'a country dedicated to the Virgin Mary and planted orange trees, lemon trees, and vines in the area, in fulfillment of his earlier declaration. Ba'eda Maryam soon returned to the Dobe'a country and appointed governors and \\"regulated the social condition of the people,\\" as well as encouraging the celebration of the death of the Virgin Mary every January, upon which occasion he distributed bread, tella (beer), and tej (a type of honey wine/mead) to the people. He further ordered that the Dobe'as become cultivators, as opposed to bandits and left the country for the last time. Approximately half a century later, a report from √Ålvares noted that the Dobe'a country was suffering from a drought, and had therefore lost a lot of their cattle and were unable to sow any grain. There was also a complaint by the merchants of Manadeley at this time of excessive taxation, claiming that they were forced to pay 1000 ounces (waqet) of gold annually as interest of a loan of only 1000 ounces of gold from Emperor Lebna Dengel (r. 1508-1540).

After Charles X Gustav's entry into Poland, he made camp at Ko≈Ço. Here the Swedish king received representatives from John II Casimir of Poland in an attempt to sue for peace. The Polish attempts were in vain and the Swedish king marched towards Warsaw. John II Casimir put up a small army in order to hinder the Swedish advance while seeking assistance from other rulers.

Lavelle, originally from Beverly Hills, California is now based in Moscow. Prior to CrossTalk, Lavelle hosted RT's programs IMHO and In Context. Lavelle also hosted a monthly business program on RT called On the Money which ended in May 2014.On the Money webpage at RT.com. Biography Lavelle received a B.A. in International Economic Relations, an M.A. in European history, and completed Ph.D. courses in Studies in European Economic History from the University of California, Davis. He was a Fulbright Research Fellow at the Institute of Political Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, Poland. He has been living in Eastern Europe and Russia for over 30 years while working as a lecturer at the University of Warsaw, a market researcher for Colgate- Palmolive, and an investment analyst for brokerage firms, including Russia's Alfa-Bank. Lavelle has contributed articles to a number of publications including Asia Times Online, The Moscow Times, The National Interest, and Current History. The New York Times has reported that Lavelle was previously a stringer for United Press International‚Äôs Moscow bureau and has contributed to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Lavelle was also the author of Untimely Thoughts, an electronic newsletter. RT host Lavelle settled in Russia in 1997 and was hired by RT (then known as Russia Today) in 2005. \\"I am proud of my work\\", he told Julia Ioffe writing for Columbia Journalism Review in 2010 also commenting that he avoids western colleagues based in Moscow. He told Ioffe that they treat RT with contempt. In 2008, Stephen Heyman wrote in The New York Times that Lavelle was one of RT's journalists who \\"said they were earnestly trying to tell Russia's story\\", and that Lavelle said, \\"No one is telling me what to say.\\"Stephen Heyman, \\"A Voice of Mother Russia, in English\\", The New York Times, May 18, 2008. In an August 2010 online interview, Peter Lavelle characterized his journalism as \\"dissent\\" in the American tradition, which he claimed is being forsaken in the land of its birth. He denied allegations of Kremlin spin-doctoring, saying RT's main aim is to \\"ask our audience one basic thing: Question More\\". In 2010, the chairman of the U.S. government's Broadcasting Board of Governors, Walter Isaacson stated that his organization needs to fight its \\"enemies\\", defined as Iran's Press TV, China's CCTV, and RT. Peter Lavelle responded that Isaacson \\"doesn't have anything to do with journalism\\" but was a promoter of a \\"media war\\" designed to push \\"the US foreign policy agenda\\" onto a world that is increasingly skeptical about it. In 2012, regarding Julian Assange's World Tomorrow interview program for RT, Lavelle told the Christian Science Monitor that \\"we liked a lot of the WikiLeaks revelations. It was very much in sync with what RT has been reporting about the Arab Spring, and about the duplicitous policies of the US and its allies all along\\". He called it a \\"soft power coup for Russia\\". In July 2014, Lavelle was interviewed by Chris Cuomo of CNN who accused Lavelle of being obsessed with \\"clearing Russia from culpability\\" in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Mh17 and of behaving more like \\"a representative of Russia\\" than a journalist. Lavelle accused the U.S. State Department of relying on Twitter and YouTube for evidence, while Cuomo insisted the US had depended on its own released intelligence for its assertions. \\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I never allow conspiracy theorists on my program\\", he insisted on a July 23, 2014 edition of CrossTalk, but then speculated that the Ukrainian government had brought down the plane to gain worldwide sympathy. The PolitiFact website has pointed to multiple 9/11 conspiracy theorists being guests on CrossTalk. In October 2014, Lavelle was at a Valda Club meeting in Sochi between domestic and foreign journalists and Vladimir Putin. He was reported as telling the Russian President that he was \\"the most popular man in modern history\\" and \\"looked upon as a saviour of sorts\\" by much of the world's population. In June the previous year, Putin visited RT's headquarters in Moscow. \\"Opinion polls show that the opposition in Russia is very small\\", Lavelle told him. \\"What kind of opposition would you like to see?\\" References External links * Peter Lavelle's CrossTalk show on RT * Opinion editorials written by Lavelle * Peter Lavelle's The Gaggle Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriates in Russia Category:American television journalists Category:Russian television personalities Category:University of California, Davis alumni Category:American male journalists Category:RT (TV network) people ","title":"Peter Lavelle"},{"id":"11846084","title":"Chicago Handicap"},{"id":"11846102","title":"1999 Nigerien general election"},{"id":"11846108","text":"Mrs. Dash Original Blend Mrs. Dash is a brand name of seasoning that was introduced in 1983 and was marketed by B&G; Foods.

In his philosophical treatise Nyayamanjari and drama Agamadambara, Jayanta mentions the king Shankaravarman (883 ‚Äì 902 CE) as his contemporary. Also, his son Abhinanda in his Kadambari- kathasara, mentioned that the great grandfather of Jayanta was a minister of King Lalitaditya of 8th century CE. So most probably Jayanta belonged to the last quarter of 9th Century CE. Ancestry From Abhinanda's Kadambari- kathasara (5-12), we came to know about the genealogy of Jayanta. His ancestor Shakti was a Brahmin of Bharadvaja gotra from Gauda, who settled at Darvabhisara, a place at the border of Kashmir. His son was Mitra and grandson was Shaktisvamin. Shaktisvamin, great grandfather of Jayanta was a minister of Karkota dynasty king of Kashmir Lalitaditya Muktapida (c. 724 ‚Äì 761 CE). Jayanta in Nyayamanjari mentioned that his grandfather obtained a village named Gauramulaka (probably located north of Rajouri) from the king. The name of Jayanta's father was Chandra. Childhood Jayanta was born in a Brahmin family. He soon turned out to be a child prodigy. At a young age he composed a commentary to Panini‚Äôs Ashtadhyayi and earned the name Nava-Vrittikara (new commentator). Major philosophical works Jayanta wrote three known treatises on Nyaya philosophy, of which only two are extant, his magnum opus, the Nyayamanjari (A Cluster of Flowers of the Nyaya tree) and the Nyayakalika (A Bud of the Nyaya tree). His third work, Pallava (probably Nyayapallava, A Twig of the Nyaya tree) though quoted in Syadvadaratnakara is not yet found. Jayanta mentioned in his Nyayamanjari, that he wrote this treatise during his confinement in a forest by the king. This treatise is unique in the sense that this is an independent work, not a commentary of an earlier work, which was the common practice of the day. Secondly according to Jayanta, purpose of Nyaya is to protect the authority of the Vedas, whereas earlier Nyaya scholars considered Nyaya as an Anvikshiki (scientific study) for providing the true knowledge about the real nature of the objects of cognition. Major literary works His major literary work is ', a Sanskrit play in four acts. The hero of his quasi-philosophical drama was a young graduate of the Mimansa school, who wanted to defeat all opponents of Vedas with reasoning.

It is a important place to MƒÅori for the resource of pounamau, (greenstone) only found in a few places in the South Island of New Zealand. When the region was sold to the British Crown in 1860 by the chiefs of Poutini NgƒÅi Tahu the rights to pounamu on the Arahua River were meant to be retained, these rights were ignored in the deed. In 1990s NgƒÅi Tahu and the government negotiated for ownership of pounamau from the river to be restored and this was settled in the Ngai Tahu (Pounamu Vesting) Act 1997. The lower reaches of the Arahura River were a major producer of gold in the past - and extensively mined, but are now worked out. In 2009 the 120-year-old dual road/rail bridge across the river was replaced. Sections of the old bridge were reused elsewhere on the rail network and one complete span was retained for a local heritage park.

It first aired on HBO on June 17, 2007. In this episode, New Zealanders Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie of the band Flight of the Conchords have moved to New York City to try to make it in the United States. At a party, Jemaine falls for, and subsequently begins dating, Sally‚ÄîBret's former girlfriend. As Jemaine's attentions focus on Sally, a lonely Bret is forced to deal with the advances of Mel (Kristen Schaal), the band's obsessed‚Äîand only‚Äîfan. Meanwhile, Murray (Rhys Darby), the band's manager, helps the band film their first music video, although they cannot afford decent costumes or proper video equipment. \\"Sally\\" received largely positive reviews from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Sally\\" drew over 1.2 million viewers. Several of the songs from the episode, most notably \\"Robots\\", \\"Not Crying\\", and \\"Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room)\\" received critical acclaim. All three songs were released on the band's EP The Distant Future, although \\"Robots\\" appeared in a live form. \\"Robots\\" later was re- recorded and released on the band's debut album Flight of the Conchords, along with \\"Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room).\\" The latter was later nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music And Lyrics. Plot Jemaine (Jemaine Clement) and Bret (Bret McKenzie) attend a party thrown by their friend Dave (Arj Barker). In the crowd Jemaine spots a beautiful woman, Sally (Rachel Blanchard), inspiring him to sing \\"Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room)\\". Jemaine and Sally leave the party and eventually go back to the band's apartment, but just as they begin kissing, Bret disturbs them by turning on the light, and an embarrassed Sally leaves. The next morning, Jemaine blames her departure on \\"the whole situation with the light\\". However, Bret suggests it was because he used to date her himself. Bret and Jemaine go to a band meeting with their manager Murray (Rhys Darby) in his office in the New Zealand Consulate. Murray criticizes Jemaine for dating his bandmate's ex, and discusses the need to increase the group's fan base, which currently consists of only one person: the obsessive Mel (Kristen Schaal). Bret suggests they film a music video. However, unable to afford real video equipment and robot costumes like Daft Punk, they are forced to rely on a camera phone and disappointing cardboard costumes made by Murray. Regardless, they manage to film a video for \\"Robots\\". Over the following week, Jemaine spends more time with Sally, leaving Bret feeling lonely and neglected. When Bret suggests hanging out sometime, Jemaine invites him along on a dinner date with Sally, but they all feel a \\"bit weird\\" and Bret leaves early. On the way home, Mel tries to cheer him up but fails miserably. Immediately after dinner, Sally breaks up with Jemaine, leading him to sing \\"Not Crying\\" with Bret. Production Rachel Blanchard guest starred as the titular Sally \\"Sally\\" was written by series co-creators James Bobin, Jemaine Clement, and Bret McKenzie, the latter two starring as the titular Flight of the Conchords. Bobin directed the episode. The episode is the first of the series to feature Rachel Blanchard as Sally. The character returns to disrupt Bret and Jemaine's lives in the fifth episode, \\"Sally Returns\\". In \\"Sally\\", the character Mel shows Bret that she carries around a picture of Jemaine's lips in her wallet. This was inspired by an incident that happened to the band during the filming of their documentary A Texan Odyssey which covered their trip to the 2006 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. The incident was caught on camera and is included in the documentary. Judah Friedlander has a cameo appearance in this episode, playing the role of the man who tries to sell Dave a cake. The episode contains several cultural references. Murray is wearing a New Zealand All Blacks rugby shirt when the band is in Dave's pawn shop obtaining a camera. In the same scene, Murray and Bret have a conversation about the band Fleetwood Mac and their album \\"Rumours\\". Rhys Darby, who played Murray, later asked Mick Fleetwood, the drummer for the band, if he heard the joke and whether or not he enjoyed it. Fleetwood admitted that he \\"appreciate[d]\\" the joke. During the filming of the video for \\"Robots\\", Jemaine tells Murray that he wanted robot costumes \\"like Daft Punk\\" rather than the amateur versions hand-crafted by Murray. Murray replies with a characteristic lack of musical knowledge: \\"I don't know who he is.\\" =Songs= The first song featured in the episode is \\"The Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room).\\" The song, also known as \\"Part-Time Model\\", was based on the conceit of a man \\"who's not very good at compliments.\\" The song begins after Jemaine sees Sally from across the room at Dave's party. Jemaine details his seduction of Sally, describing her as being so beautiful she could be a \\"part- time model\\". This song was voted number 60 in the 2008 Triple J Hottest 100. Later, the song was nominated for an Emmy award for Outstanding Original Music And Lyrics. The second song featured in the episode is \\"Robots\\". The song, also known as \\"Humans Are Dead\\", is sung by both Bret and Jemaine. It is set in a post-apocalyptic \\"distant future\\", humorously stated to be the year 2000, where all humans are dead and robots have taken over the world. Within the context of the plot of the show, it is the band's first music video. Since the band has very limited funds, Murray constructs the robot costumes himself and films the video using a cell phone. The third and final song featured is \\"Not Crying\\". The song begins as Sally breaks up with Jemaine. Jemaine denies that he is crying by offering excuses such as \\"it's just been raining on my face\\". All three of the songs were released on The Distant Future EP in 2007, however, \\"The Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room)\\" and \\"Robots\\" appeared in live form. The two were subsequently re-recorded in studio form for the band's debut album, Flight of the Conchords in 2008.

TV, Movielink, Comcast.net and Roadrunner.com, allowed a promotional version of the episode to be streamed as part of an online marketing campaign to build up word-of- mouth for the series. On television, \\"Sally\\" debuted on the HBO in the United States at 10:30 PM on Sunday, June 17, 2007 in the time slot preceded by Entourage, and vacated by the last episode of the final season of The Sopranos. The episode received over 1.2 million viewers. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics. IGN, in an advanced review of the episode, awarded \\"Sally\\" an \\"amazing\\" 9.2 out of 10 rating and called the series \\"The funniest show you haven't seen yet.\\" The review noted that, \\"Flight of the Conchords deserves the buzz it is slowly building. This is a very funny show.\\" Blogcritics reviewer Daniel J. Stasiewski noted that the series was different for HBO, writing, \\"Flight of the Conchords isn‚Äôt Entourage or Sex in the City or even Extras. It‚Äôs different. And sometimes different is just good.\\" Stasiewski, however, did note that the availability of the band's music on video sites like YouTube meant that watching the series was not worth the cost of a cable subscription. Further more, Stasiweski noted that while \\"the fun, quirky music videos that pop-up can make this long half- hour worth watching [...] the 10 or so minutes in between numbers aren‚Äôt groundbreaking comedy.\\" Chris Schonberger from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a largely positive review. He called the new series \\"the funniest hour of comedy on television\\" and noted that the performance of Rhys Darby as Murray Hewitt was excellent, calling his character \\"scene-stealing\\". Finally, Schonberger positively compared the episode to the 2004 comedy film Napoleon Dynamite, writing, \\"Indeed, the whole pilot vaguely reminded me of Napoleon in the way that the characters just sort of lurk around and pour their limited energy into absurd activities\\".

They were designed to be carried in place of a police baton and also provide light. The eponymous company, founded by Donald Keller and Frank Patti in 1968, manufactured Kel-Lite flashlights in southern California until 1983, when the company was merged into Streamlight. History The Kel-Lite was a highly- durable, weather- and shock-resistant flashlight (UK: torch), made of heavy 6061-T6 aluminium. According to company founder Donald Keller, a Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff, he began working on the concept in 1964 as he was tired of the lack of durability of the generically available, cheap metal flashlights of the day; the prototype was largely designed by 1968. Keller's primary concern was to develop the flashlight as a defensive tool; the illumination provided an ancillary benefit. Keller contracted a machine shop in Covina owned by Frank Patti to produce a few prototypes to ensure costs were sufficiently low, making adjustments to the prototype designs based on input from law enforcement officers. By late 1968, Keller and Patti founded the Kel-Lite Corporation, with Patti handling manufacturing and Keller assembly and marketing. Initial prices ranged from $12.95 (for the 2-cell model) to $18.95 (for the 7-cell model). Keller paid a commission of $1 to each police officer that convinced another to purchase a light. As demand grew, prices increased to allow for dealer markup, with quantity discounts provided. The small head Kel-Lite (SKL) was introduced in 1970, and the company also began marketing law enforcement equipment such as speedloaders and traffic wand attachments. The business grew beyond Keller's ability to manage it, and Norm Nelson was hired as general manager in 1971; during a board meeting in January 1972, Keller was ousted and Nelson became company president. After Keller left in 1972, he continued designing lights for a new company (Pro-Light, 1973), later moving on to Maglite (1979), Brinkmann, and ASP. The second generation Kel-Lite was designed by Norm Nelson in 1973, featuring a battery charger, adjustable lens, baton lights, and a push button switch. It was marketed in three sizes (DKL (D-Cell Kel-Lite), MKL (Medium Head Kel-Lite), SKL (Small Head Kel-Lite)) and penlight versions. The company merged in 1983 with Streamlight. Kel-Lite had manufacturing capability and Streamlight a marketing team. The first Kel-Lites were made in San Dimas, California in 1968. Then the company moved to Covina, California in 1970 as demand increased, and on to Barstow, California in 1973 to a larger facility with a full service machine shop, plating, assembly line and shipping department. Surviving Kel-Lites are still in use worldwide, with the final design by Norm Nelson, marketed by Streamlight as the Excalibur, sold into the early 1990s. A similar model, also designed by Keller, was sold as the Brinkmann \\"Legend\\" series of flashlights. =Design progression= 1st generation Designed by Don Keller from 1969-1972; models included the Large Head (KL) D-cell model, the Small Head (SKL) D-cell, and the C cell (CPL) models. All flashlights used from 2 to 7 cells, and were available in black, blue, silver, and gold anodized finishes. A special 1-cell model was available using two -D cells. The first generation were produced in both San Dimas and Covina and featured plastic slide switches. Later models of the 1st generation lights were also produced for a short time in Barstow. If manufactured in San Dimas, that was stamped on the barrel behind the switch. Covina & Barstow-produced models had the location stamped in the tail cap. 2nd generation Switch design by Norm Nelson from 74-83, using the same head styles as above and added a medium head. Also included the Baton Light and Stud Light. Metal slide switches. Produced in Barstow, CA. 3rd generation Designed by Nelson & Streamlight, 1983 until approx. 1985. Medium head only with push button switch. Produced in Barstow and Norristown, Pennsylvania. Kel-Lite attempted to get into the rechargeable market with a tail cap charger, only a few were actually sold. Technology The Kel-Lite was intended as a replacement for the baton carried by police officers. The series of Baton Light models (available in various lengths from 18 to 26 inches) were designed by Norm Nelson in 1973 as a direct replacement, which would fit into a standard baton ring on the officer's belt. Kel-Lites were available in sizes ranging from a model using two \\"1/2 D\\" cells (together the length of one D) to those using 7 D cells, and any size in between, as well as C cell models. A total of 49 different models were made. Prior to the Kel- Lite, flashlights were relatively fragile and undependable, usually made either of molded plastic or stamped sheet metal. Dropping one would usually break the bulb, and dents would often lead to frequent replacement. Keller designed the Kel-Lite to be robust. Salesmen trained by Keller would demonstrate this for public safety customers by pounding large nails into a block of wood, while the light was operating. Other demonstrations included throwing the light as hard as possible across a concrete parking lot, or turning the light on and putting it into an aquarium and driving over it with a truck. In Wellington v. Daniels, testifying for the plaintiff, who had been permanently paralyzed after being struck with a Kel-Lite in 1981, a criminologist expert witness stated that several police departments had banned Kel-Lites because using it as a weapon could cause death or severe injury. Nelson also produced a flashlight targeted for the truck driver known as the Stud-Lite, which was a Kel-Lite flashlight with a different name, and anodized finish. This model was also very popular and sold in truck stops, truck dealerships and parts houses. The success of the Kel-Lite led to the rise of competition, primarily Maglite and Streamlight, who improved on Keller's basic concept. Streamlight opted for high-output models using rechargeable battery and halogen bulb technology. Maglite developed an improved switch and a variable-focus system, allowing a single light to be used for a high-intensity flashlight or wide-angle lantern. Mag-Lite later developed their own high- output rechargeable, as the police market converted entirely to that style of flashlight. A decade later a new company, Laser Products, miniaturized the tactical flashlight with their SureFire series. These more advanced and mass- produced products eventually took over the market. Kel-Lites were one of the more durable makes and large numbers are still in use today. They remain popular on the used market both as working flashlights and collectibles. A Kel-Lite torch was also mounted on the High Standard Model 10B bullpup shotgun.
