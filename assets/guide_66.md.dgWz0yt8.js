The sculpture consists of numerous longitudinal ribs slightly narrower than their intervals, and about 13 in number on the body whorl. These are crossed by spiral cords, narrower than their intervals, of which there are 6 on the body whorl, followed by a costate space, as though a cord had been omitted, and then 4 more beaded, oblique cords on the narrow, lower part of the whorl. The apex is broken off with 4¬Ω whorls remainingt The body whorl shows a thick varix behind the outer lip. The aperture is narrow with two low teeth within the outer lip.

It existed at the place where The Bharat Scouts and Guides office exists today at the market in Subhash Ghat of Har Ki Pauri which is verified by Municipal Corporation Haridwar records of 1935. Significance In 1504-1505, the first Guru of Sikhs Guru Nanak Dev visited Haridwar during his first Missionary travel (Udasi). He saw Brahmins (priests) in river Ganga offering water to rising Sun God towards east intended to reach the spirits of there deceased ancestors. He started throwing water in opposite direction which made brahmins curious and surprised. When questioned, Guru Nanak replied he is watering his crops in fields at Kartarpur. If water can reach can reach sun it sure can reach his far away fields in Kartarpur. Guru Nanak taught them lesson of living superstition free life.  History and Destruction of Gurudwara  A small building of Gurudwara Gyan Godri Sahib existed till 1975 at Landhaura House area in Har Ki Pauri of Haridwar where a tenant, Ram Piari, used to pray before a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib. After Kumbh Mela stampede of 1966, Haridwar administration acquired Landhora House to widen Har Ki Pauri in 1979 and demolished the Gurudwara. Sikhs were not allowed to reconstruct Gurudwara again. Also, An ancient Gurudwara Nanakwara was located 200 metres from the said spot. Currently the office The Bharat Scouts and Guides where Gurudwara Gyan Godri once existed.

Glasboken: historia, teknik och form : handbok (2. uppl.). Stockholm: Legenda. Libris l√§nk. (inb.) She owned and managed the glass works Henrikstorps glasbruk from 1713 onward. She personally managed Henrikstorps glasbruk during the majority of its existence, and it belonged to the most successful glass works in Sweden during her tenure in management. Life She was the daughter of Baron (died 1713) and Maria Ehrenberg (died 1713). She married the soldier and nobleman in 1715; the couple had no children. After the death of her parents in 1713, Christina Beata Dagstr√∂m inherited Gyllebo Manor alone, as well as G√§rsn√§s Castle and the Henrikstorps glass works jointly with her sisters. Henrisktorp glass works had bee established by her father in 1692 and was at the time one of the most notable in Sweden. While the sisters owned the glass works jointly, Christina Beata managed it alone; she invested great personal interest in it and developed it to one of the most successful glass works in Sweden during her lifetime, second only to Kungsholmen glass works. After her death however the business sharply declined and Henrikstorp glass works did not survive her death many years (it closed down in 1762, eight years after her death). She was a respected businesswoman in her time and her activity it mentioned by Carl von Linn√© in his description of contemporary Sweden. In accordance with marital law at the time, Christina Beata Dagstr√∂m became a minor under the guardianship of her husband when she married in 1715. In her case, however, this placed no restrictions on her activity, as she and her husband lived separate lives during most of their marriage. Her husband served in the army during the Great Northern War and she did not live with him until 1723, eight years after they married. When he finally returned from the war, he submerged himself in pietism and wrote religious texts preaching against the Swedish state Church as well as the king, supporting Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp claims on the throne against Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden and Frederick I of Sweden whom he accused of having murdered Charles XII of Sweden.Bolin, Sture: Olof J Dagstr√∂m i Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (1931) Because of this, he was imprisoned in 1728 for crimes against the church and the crown and was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1731. Christina Beata Dagstr√∂m was initially accused as his accomplice during the three year's long process, but was declared innocent by any involvement in the crime of her husband, who accused her of having betrayed him.Bolin, Sture: Olof J Dagstr√∂m i Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (1931) References Category:1691 births Category:1754 deaths Category:18th-century Swedish businesspeople Category:Age of Liberty people Category:18th-century businesswomen Category:Businesspeople in the glass industry Category:Swedish industrialists ","title":"Christina Beata Dagstr√∂m"},{"id":"62361506","text":"The third season of Dynasty originally aired in the United States on ABC from October 27, 1982 through April 20, 1983.

Season three stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Pamela Sue Martin as Blake and Alexis's headstrong daughter Fallon; Jack Coleman as Blake and Alexis's earnest son Steven; Gordon Thomson as Blake and Alexis's eldest son Adam; John James as Fallon's ex-husband Jeff Colby; Lloyd Bochner as Jeff's uncle, Cecil Colby; Pamela Bellwood as Claudia Blaisdel, the widow of Krystle's former lover; Heather Locklear as Krystle's niece and Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo; Geoffrey Scott as Krystle's ex-husband Mark Jennings; Lee Bergere as Carrington majordomo Joseph Anders; Kathleen Beller as Joseph's daughter Kirby; and Joan Collins as Alexis Colby, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Adam, Fallon, and Steven. Development In season three, Dynasty introduced Gordon Thomson in the role of Adam Carrington, Blake and Alexis's eldest child, who had been kidnapped as an infant ever never found. According to Thomson, \\"They had planned on Adam being an impostor but they liked him so much they decided to keep him on. They tested me for 13 shows, then extended that to 24.\\" Steven Carrington was recast with Jack Coleman in 1983, the change in appearance attributed to plastic surgery after an oil rig explosion.

In the meantime, Adam, the long- lost son of Alexis and Blake who had been kidnapped in infancy, reappears in Denver and almost starts an affair with Fallon before they discover they are siblings. Also introduced are Krystle's ex-husband, tennis pro Mark Jennings, and Kirby Anders, the daughter of longtime Carrington majordomo Joseph. Kirby catches Adam's eye but weds Jeff after his divorce from Fallon.

She worked with oils, watercolour, charcoal, pastel, pencil and India ink. The second of three children and an only daughter, Appleton did a five-year diploma course in drawing and illustration at the East Sydney Technical College (now the National Art School). She later moved to England and enrolled at the Westminster School of Art where she produced Australia's two earliest cubist paintings. After the Second World War broke out, Appleton returned to Australia in 1940 to teach art at three public schools to allow for the continuation of her work and assisted in the war effort by studying vocational therapy. Her work received a large amount of recognition from the art industry and she earned four prizes. Biography Appleton was born in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield in 13 September 1911. She was the second of three children and the only daughter of Charles Appleton and Elizabeth Appleton (n√©e Macredie). Her father encouraged her to read books and her elder brother Frederick instilled a sense of adventure into her. Appleton had a lifelong interest in the performing due to her great-aunt Agnes Blackwood. She was educated at the small Haberfield Private School, and was disciplined for drawing in her study books; she wanted to become an artist during her childhood. After she earned an intermediate certificate with an A in arts in 1928, Appleton enrolled at the East Sydney Technical College (now the National Art School) to commence a five-year diploma course in art. Appleton's parents supported her career choice; she believed her father had not taken her ambitions in art seriously for fear she would be married and find art as a hobby. She remembered her first teachers and the atmosphere as uninspiring, and ventured to the Archibald Prize exhibition to attempt to arouse her interest with no success. The arrival of the English painter Douglas Dundas in 1930 greatly influenced her. Appleton graduated with a diploma in drawing and illustration in 1933 and earned a college scholarship. After she observed impressionist prints lying in an Anthony Hordern & Sons department store, she became preoccupied about venturing to Europe and studying modern art to which her father objected. Appleton shared and worked in a studio in Quay with fellow painter Dorothy Thornhill, and earned capital by creating textile patterns. She made multiple unsuccessful attempts to obtain the New South Wales Government Travelling Scholarship. After her father died in 1935 her mother was persuaded by Appleton's aunt to allow her daughter to travel to England by cargo ship with a minor income allowance. Appleton found affordable accommodation and enrolled at the Westminster School of Art's morning and evening classes over the next three years from 1936. She was educated by the painters Bernard Meninsky and Mark Gertler. Appleton completed Australia's two earliest cubist paintings in London, Still Life 1937 and Painting IX 1937. She was part of a team of Australian artists (William Dobell, Donald Friend, Arthur Murch and Eric Wilson) that produced a mural and a gilded ram to erect it for the International Wool Secretariat at Glasgow's British Empire Exhibition in 1938. The impending Second World War caused Appleton's mother to become anxious and wanted her daughter to return to Australia. She went to the Centenary Cezanne Exhibition, galleries in Luxembourg, and art in Italy before doing so.\\\\- In that era, teaching was a venture that allowed artists to continue working; Appleton taught at the Canberra Girls Grammar School in 1940 and had her maiden solo exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries in Sydney that same year. She became interested in the war effort and did a course in vocational therapy because its director wanted volunteers to assist her. Appleton was granted a full-time position until 1945. She moved to teaching at the Julian Ashton Art School to assume Wilson's former teaching position in 1946 before switching to the East Sydney Technical College the following year. The money Appleton accumulated allowed her to construct and purchase a house in Pymble. She had a second venture to Europe in 1951 and went to the studio of Paul C√©zanne to renew interest in the formal structure of her work. Appleton's work received much recognition from the art industry; she won the Rockdale Art Prize in 1958, the D'Arcy Morris Memorial Prize two years later, the Bathurst Art Prize in 1961 and the Portia Geach Memorial Award in 1965. Her family spent time back in England during the 1960 before residing in Australia due to alienation of the decade's art styles. Appleton was represented on the Print Council of Australia Exhibition in 1968 after she had become interested in printmaking before ceasing the activity in 1980. She visited her daughter in Dharamshala, North India the following year and befriended several Tibetan refugees. Appleton exhibited with the Jim Alexander Gallery, Melbourne in 1985. She underwent a cataract operation in 1991 and created a large mural-size painting after her sight was corrected. A retrospective of her work was held at the Campbelltown City Bicentennial Art Gallery five years later. In 1998 the writers Christine France and Caroline Simpson produced an essay on Appleton called Jean Appleton: A Lifetime with Art. After an exhibition of her work to the conclusion of the Second World War at the Sturt Gallery in Mittagong in 2000, Appleton died in Australia in August 2003. Personal life and personality Appleton was married two times. In 1943, she married the painter Eric Wilson. He died from bladder cancer in 1946. Six years later, Appleton married the painter Tom Green after they had met on her trip to Europe in 1951. They have one daughter, Elisabeth Green von Krusenstiena, who would become a Buddhist nun in Canberra. Green died from cancer in 1981. She was described as an individual who was admired professionally; according to the painter Elizabeth Cummings, Appleton was not didactic and had an interest in exploration to enough of an extent that her \\"thinking was always moving.\\" The interviewer Willi Carney calls her \\"self reliant\\" and an \\"assured yet modest lady who deserves to be recognised as one of our most significant living artists.\\" Analysis Appleton preferred to work with oils and watercolour; she also exhibited works in charcoal, pastel, pencil and India ink. Describing painting as \\"a very personal thing\\" with \\"a poetry in painting\\" and \\"a love affair\\", one of her favourite subjects concerned bottles. In 1942, Appleton went away from rounded geometric forms that she learnt during her time in London to an increasingly decorative and schematic cubist style and experienced with a lighter colour scheme.

Situated next to Galle Face Green and Baladaksha Mawatha (Lower Lake Road), the complex bordered the Beira Lake and had its main entrance at the Slave Island end of Baladaksha Mawatha, Colombo 3. The complex also included the Ministry of Defence buildings, located close to the Galle Face terminus of Baladaksha Mawatha. Apart from operational and administrative offices, it contained the centers of several regiments and corps of the Sri Lanka Army, as well as the Colombo Military Hospital and the army sports grounds. With the plans to move the Ministry of Defence and Army Headquarters to the new Defence Headquarters Complex in Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte, many of the units based there started moving out in 2012, releasing the land for commercial redevelopment which included the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo and the larger One Galle Face development project. History The base was founded by the British during their colonial rule of Ceylon, undergoing expansion during World War II, defending Colombo during the Easter Sunday Raid. Upon the post-independence formation of the Ceylon Army in 1949, the base began use as its headquarters in the late 1980s with many of the offices moving from old Rifle Barracks. =Terrorist attacks= The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) carried out two suicide bombings targeting the complex, the first being on November 24, 1995, when two female suicide bombers carried out an attack outside the headquarters, killing 16 and wounding 52- mostly civilians. The second occurred on April 25, 2006 when a female LTTE suicide bomber- disguised as a pregnant woman arriving for clinical treatment at the Colombo Military Hospital- targeted the motorcade of then-army commander Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka. Although seriously wounded, Fonseka survived; the attack left 8 dead and 27 wounded. This prompted the decision to move the military hospital to a suburb of Colombo. =Demolition= The complex was demolished in 2012 to make way for two major real estate projects at its location- Shangri La/One Colombo and ITC Colombo. A combined tri-forces headquarters at Akuregoda, Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte had been commissioned to house, among others, the displaced army administrative offices.

This policy was to equip the students with knowledge which would be useful in their country of origin when they eventually returned. As of 2009, there were about 40,000 \\"Ghanaians with a migration background\\" in Germany; where \\"Ghanaians with a migration background\\" means \\"naturalised persons of Ghanaian origin\\" and \\"the second and third generation of Ghanaians naturalised in Germany and the children from binational partnerships who did not immigrate on their own,\\" according to Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ). According to GTZ, there is a sizeable number of undocumented migrants, most of whom arrive in Germany with a valid visa but remain without a residence permit after the allowed time has elapsed.  Causes and motives for migration  Economic hardships,wars,tribal conflicts and life struggles have been the reason a lot of people have left their country of origin. Refugee status in the world has hit an alarming rate and it increases each year. Economic reasons, the high rate of poverty and the high population rate are among other reasons that influence people to leave their homes or country of origin.  Types of Ghana to Germany migration  Three types of migration can be seen in the history of Ghanaians migrating to Germany. They include educational migration, asylum- seeking migration, and migration for family reunification. Ghanaian migrants are rarely granted employment visas. = Educational migration = Many education migrants migrate to third countries after they complete their studies in Germany. = Asylum-seeking migration = Migrants under this umbrella end up as those who permanently reside in Germany today. Since the 1970s, Economic hardships and political violence during military regimes in Ghana expanded the number of Ghanaian refugees who have asked asylum in European and African countries. The acceptance quotas for political refugees from Ghana have continuously been below one percent, as authorities classify most Ghanaian migrants as economic refugees. Only 112 persons between 1983 and 2007 have been accepted as political refugees. = Family reunification = Migrants under this umbrella end up as those who permanently reside in Germany today. Over one-quarter of the Ghanaian migrants come to Germany through family reunification.  Regular and irregular migration to Germany  Specimen of a German Schengen visa International Organization for Migration defines regular migration as migration that occurs in compliance with the laws of the country of origin, transit, and destination. IOM also defines irregular migration as the movement of persons that takes place outside the laws, regulations, or international agreements governing the entry into or exit from the State of origin, transit, or destination. There are pathways for migration for both regular and irregular movements. = Regular pathways = Federal Foreign Office of Germany suggests various methods for safe and legal migration depending on a migrants reason for movement. Regular means involve getting a visa.  Short stay visas  The German embassy prescribes the acquisition of a Schengen visa for short stays (up to 90 days within a period of 180 days) in Germany (and European countries within the Schengen area) for tourism, visit or business purposes. Applicants are required to fill a visa form and book an appointment. The embassy in Accra offers a checklist of documents needed for the visa interview.  Long term visas  The embassy also prescribes the long stay visas for students, family reunions, employment visas among others, and gives their requirements.  General visa requirements and cost  Applicants must have a passport with validity of exceeding the duration of intended stay in Germany by at least 3 months. This passport must contain at least 2 blank pages and must have been issued within the past 10 years. The applicant also needs their original birth certificate and 1 recent passport picture with white background. A EuroTravel health insurance, covering entire duration of stay and valid for all Schengen States is required. Lastly, proof of sufficient financial means for intended stay will also be inspected.The applicant will sign the declaration according to Sec. 54 Par. 2 No. 8 of the German Residence Act. The visa processing costs 60.00 Euros.  Additional requirements depending on the purpose of the trip  For visitor visas, proof of family relation is needed. The host must sign an invitation letter and give a copy of his or her passport and residence permit to the applicant. For medical treatment, applicants must prove they have sufficient financial means for treatment and costs of living plus a letter from a local doctor stating the diagnosis. Applicants also need a statement from the German hospital or doctor agreeing to treat the patient. For business, applicants must have an invitation letter from the company in Germany and a letter from the company in the country of residence stating the purpose of the trip. The German company must be in the national commercial register. For training/internship or language courses, applicants must have a letter from the German institution confirming their registration and documents that prove payment of the course and information on duration. For visas for culture, sports, film crew, or religious purposes, applicants must hold a letter from the authorities with details on the activities and team involved. = Irregular migration = A boat with migrants, off the Libyan coast Immigration from Africa to Europe through illegal means is significant. Most migrants who go on such journeys are from underdeveloped African countries looking for greener pastures in Europe. Migrants usually go to North Africa, especially Libya, which has become the primary departure point for making illegal entry into Europe. From Libya, they go by boat via the Mediterranean Sea. Some migrants also go by land through the Spanish Enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, risking severe injury and even death. Human traffickers and human smugglers have taken advantage of the situation to cash in, often lying to migrants about opportunities in Europe. By June 2019 IOM statistics indicated that deaths recorded on the three main Mediterranean Sea routes to Italy, Malta and Cyprus by June 2019 are at 555 people. By December 2019, the number rose to 738 with drowning, physical abuse, sexual abuse, starvation, sickness and lack of access to healthcare and dehydration are top causes of death. Ghanaians are reported to rank highly among migrants hoping to get to Europe though the country is more peaceful and politically stable than other countries where migrants originate. About 5,636 Ghanaians reached Italy by boat in 2016. In 2017, the Brong-Ahafo region, now divided into three regions of Ahafo, Brong, and Bono East, had the highest number of migrants. Out of 4,092 Ghanaian returnees from Libya, the highest number of 1,562, representing 38.17 percent, were from Brong Ahafo. Ashanti Region had 601, indicating 13.63 percent.  Receipt of migrants in Germany  Deportation of African asylum seekers Many people who end up seeking to stay in Germany get deported because their claim for asylum, the right to be reunited with family, are unsuccessful. Only asylum seekers who receive one of the four forms of protection are given the right to stay. The four forms include Refugee Protection, Entitlement to Asylum, Subsidiary Protection, and National ban on Forced Return. Usually, successful seekers are those who can't provide evidence of persecution in their country of origin and other serious challenges back home. People who come to Germany to improve their economic situation are not refugees. Additionally, moving from one EU country to the other does not permit the application for asylum again in another EU country. Germany also grants assisted voluntary return for some migrants.

Urumqi Glacier No.1 () or Urumqi River Glacier No.1 (), Tianshan Glacier No.1 (), is the glacier closest to an urban area in the world, located only 120 km southwest to downtown √úr√ºmqi, Xinjiang, China. As a major source of the Urumqi River, Glacier No.1 lies in the north slope of Tiangeer II Peak in the middle section of Tian Shan and it is within √úr√ºmqi County. Tianshan Glaciological Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences started observing the glacier change of the glacier since 1959, giving it longer observation history and records than any other glacier in China. Ever since then, the glacier has been continuously retreating. Due to its constant recession, the glacier has been separated into two branches in 1993. The glacier is one of the 'reference glaciers' for mass balance of the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS). In 2019, researchers estimated that the glacier will have disappeared in the next 50 years. Since 2017, a natural reserve covering an area of has been set up by the Regional Government of Xinjiang to protect Glacier No.1. Besides, tourism surrounding the glacier was banned by the Regional government during the 13th 5-year Plan (2016-2020).  Observation history  Glacier No.1 has longer observation history and fuller records than any other glacier in China. In June 1958, Daxigou Weather Station was established right below Glacier No.1 at the mountainside of Tiangeer Peak, to measure and analyse the weather conditions in the area. In 1959-60, the research group for the use of mountainous ice and snow , Chinese Academy of Sciences, sent 8 sub-groups to investigate into the glaciers in Tian Shan, during which Tianshan Glaciological Station near Glacier No.1 was set up by Shi Yafeng in 1959. The glacier was first named as Shengli Daban Glacier No.1 before changing to the current name. In 1967-1979, the Cultural Revolution and other factors interrupted the observation. In 1982, the glacier became part of World Glacier Monitoring Service as a reference glacier. In 2010, an observation tower was built in the glacier area. In 2013, the glacier was listed among the sites for Global Cryosphere Watch. = Future = Several modelling and predictions of Glacier No.1 have been put. Duan et al (2012) estimated that by 2040, the terminus of a glacier will be retreating at a relatively slow rate but the thickness of the glacier will be significantly reduced, while after 2040, the retreat of the terminus will be speeding up. According to Gao et al (2018), by 2040, the ice of the glacier will be 1/5 as large as it was in 1980, with the area halved. By 2100, 92% of the glacier area will be gone.  Protection  During Xinjiang's Lianghui session in 2012, Cui Chunyu, Regional People's Representative, proposed an initiative to set up a comprehensive natural protection area covering an area of surrounding Glacier No.1. In 2013, the Regional Environmental Protection Bureau set up a framework for the establishment of such protection area. In April 2014, the Regional Government decided to set up the protection area. In 2017, Project for protection of the ecology of Urumqi rivers and lakes started to be carried out, which included the protection area for Glacier No.1. The whole project cost 560 million RMB, involving 3 counties surrounding the area, covering an area of . Plus, the government of Urumqi County has been applying for setting up a new national park. To reduce human activity near the glacier, tourism surrounding the glacier was banned by the Regional government during the 13th 5-year Plan (2016-2020). Yet, this is challenged by doubt and concerns, for tourism is not the main cause of the glacier retreat but can help people to understand the importance of environmental protection and pollution reduction if well governed. The grazing industry was relocated to reduce its influence to the glacier, and the herding routes were re-designed. The regulation over the manufacturers and miners was tautened. The number of cars passing through part of National Highway 216 near the glacier was restricted and the construction of a new road to replace the current route that is too close to the glacier is being planned.

Released in 2019, the album reached the top five of the Billboard Jazz Albums chart, and also entered the Holiday Albums Chart. Composition The album draws stylistic inspiration from 1950s and 1960s jazz and swing. In an interview, Gasteyer said of the album, \\"It‚Äôs exactly the record I wanted to make. It‚Äôs nostalgic. It‚Äôs throwback. It‚Äôs joyful. It‚Äôs ridiculous. It‚Äôs happy.\\" In an interview with Billboard, Gasteyer added that, contrary to expectations, it was not a comedy album, and remarked that \\"if I were to make a comedy album I'd hope it'd be funnier\\". At the start of her work on the album, Gasteyer vowed to write three original holiday songs for it. The album includes a number of standards, including \\"Nothing Rhymes with Christmas\\" and \\"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\\" \\"Secret Santa\\", the album's lead single, is presented as a phone call between Gasteyer and fellow former Saturday Night Live cast member Maya Rudolph. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Maureen Lee Lenker described the song as \\"a cheeky song with a retro-Cuban beat that tells the fictional story about a Secret Santa gift quest that results in Gasteyer getting 'woke' in Havana\\". In \\"Nothing Rhymes with Christmas\\", Gasteyer attempts to find a rhyme for the holiday's name, and concludes that only one word does: isthmus. In a statement, Gasteyer elaborated on her goals for the album: \\"We set out to make a new Holiday album with a throwback feel [...] This album is a nod to the swing sound of the 1950s and 1960s but with a modern twist. It is festive, with a full-bodied sound, that I hope makes people feel joyful, jolly and gay. I love records from the late 1950s and early 1960s that never scrimped on sound. That‚Äôs hard to do in this day and age, but we sought arrangements that utilized a proper band, including horn and percussion and created as full and lush a sound\\". Release On October 11, 2019, \\"Secret Santa\\", was released as the album's lead single. The song was premiered on the Entertainment Weekly website, where it streamed exclusively. The album was released by Henry's Girl Records on October 25, 2019. Chart performance Sugar & Booze became a top 5 album on the US Billboard Jazz Albums chart and a top 50 album on the Billboard Holiday Albums chart. On the Jazz Albums chart, the album debuted at number 5 on the chart dated November 9, 2019. In its seventh week on the chart, dated December 21, 2019, the album attained a new peak of number 4. On the Holiday Albums chart, the album peaked at number 47 on the chart dated November 9, 2019.

Biography  Hibberd started writing songs when she was 14, and playing the guitar at 15, later telling Music Week \\"I write two songs a week, I always have\\". She studied at Platform One College of Music in Newport, instead of going to sixth form, graduating in 2015 with the equivalent of 3 A* grades at A level. Her first single, The House I Built When I Was Small, was released in December of that year. It was played by Tom Robinson on BBC Radio 6 Music, and featured on the in-store playlists for Harrods and Costa Coffee in January 2016. Her early work was influenced by indie-folk artists such as Laura Marling, Feist and Lucy Rose, but when she started recording with producers Boe Weaver, she was encouraged to listen to the music of Weezer and \\"fell in love with the way stories are conveyed, like conversations\\". From then on, her music began to move in a more indie-pop direction. In an Instagram Live broadcast on 22nd March 2020, Hibberd disowned her earlier work, jokingly comparing a reference to her Favourite Shade of Blue EP to the practice of deadnaming. Her breakout hit was \\"Call Shotgun\\", which was playlisted on BBC Radio 1 in August 2018. This led to her playing the BBC Introducing stage at the Glastonbury Music Festival in 2019. She has accompanied US bands Hippo Campus and The Regrettes on the European legs of their tours, in addition to her own headline national tours. In February 2020, UK Music announced that Hibberd would be included in the British Music Embassy line up at the 2020 South by Southwest Festival, though this was subsequently cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The benediction, performed by Bishop Johann Franz Schenk von Stauffenberg of Konstanz and the assisting Abbots of Einsiedeln and Mehrerau, was delayed until 24 June 1721. = Toggenburg war = After his election, the new abbot immediately tried to make peace. Thus, at the beginning of May 1718, six years after the end of the Toggenburg War, negotiations in Baden began. The peace contract contained 84 points and was signed on 15 June 1718. The contract that was ratified by the abbot was brought to Zurich and Bern on 6 August 1718 in order to be ratified there as well. However, Clement XI discarded the contract, which led to riots. Abbot von Rudolphi returned from exile to Rorschach on 7 September 1718. He began receiving homage in Toggenburg. On 11 October, he moved into Saint Gall and on 15 October, lections and the silentium as well as, a day later, the orthros could be reintroduced. Only on 23 March 1719 did the abbot receive a large part of the library that had been brought to Zurich at the beginning of the war. Other items belonging to the prey of the people of Bern, for instance eight bells and seven fire engines, arrived in Saint Gall on 5 May 1721. = Achievements = Von Rudolphi founded new parishes and divided Gossau and Oberriet. He introduced a new registry of documents to the archive of the monastery and let escape boxes be made. From 1719 to 1722, from 1724 to 1726, in 1730 and from 1735 to 1736, the abbot conducted visitations in order to gain an overview of local school conditions. On 8 and 9 May 1737, von Rudolphi organised a synod in Saint Gall. He ordered Caspar Moosbrugger in 1721 to draw a draft of the new minster. Von Rudolphi defined the exact border demarcations with the dominions adjoining Saint Gall. On 29 April 1731, the abbot renewed the alliance with France that began in 1663. After several disputes in Toggenburg, abbatial magistrates Johann Baptist Keller and Niklaus R√ºdlinger, who had formerly been leading the opposition against the abbey, were murdered on 8 December 1735. On 9 January 1739, the conference in Frauenfeld concerning the six places of arbitration (dt. \\"Schiedsorte\\") that was supported by France ended without result. Merchants and manufacturers were called together by the abbot to a conference in Rorschach on 11 March 1739 with the aim of discussing trade questions and the implementation of a trade and industry order, which was passed and evoked on 8 April of the same year. By means of thoughtful administration and economy, the abbot reduced the abbey's debts. On 21 September 1739, von Rudolphi expelled Konstanz's official Franz Andreas Rettich, who had been assigned by the bishop to visit the Saint Gall parishes, from the abbatial territory. This led to a renewed conflict with the Bishopric Konstanz concerning jurisdiction and visitation rights.  Notes and references   External links  * Erhart, Peter. 2010: \\"Joseph von Rudolphi\\".

He was the founding president and planning director of the University of Business and Technology in Oman (academically affiliated with Virginia Tech in the US), and inaugural chair for institutional development at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in China. = Brac University = Shortly after joining Brac University in February 2019, he introduced Brac University 2.0 as Bangladesh's international university and a research institution. He has made the near-term milestones consist of three pillars, namely internationalization, student life, and research with impact. During his first year in office, he re-structured and created the Graduate School of Management, School of Data and Sciences, School of Life Sciences, School of Architecture and Design, and School of General Education, in addition to School of Engineering, School of Law, School of Business and School of Public Health. The School of Medicine is currently under planning. In March 2019, Chang visited the Rohingya refugee camps, which are located near Cox's Bazar in south-eastern Bangladesh in close proximity to the neighboring country Myanmar. Over one million Rohingyas have taken refuge in the camps following a Myanmar military crackdown in Rakhine State in August 2017. He has since committed Brac University to humanitarian research particularly about the Rohingyas. Following the visit, he supported the partnership between Brac University's Centre for Peace and Justice and the International Institute for Social Studies (ISS) to organize the International Conclave on Justice and Accountability for the Rohingyas, which was held in The Hague, Netherlands, on October 18, 2019. The Conclave opened up constructive debates around the Rohingya crisis. He officially introduced Brac University 2.0 on October 26, 2019 in the Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony for Brac University's new campus in Dhaka. The founder of Brac University, Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, laid the foundation stone. In December 2019, Chang received the Bangladesh's national flag that was taken into space by Bangladesh's first nano-satellite BRAC Onnesha. The flag was delivered by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. The satellite was developed by Brac University School of Engineering's faculty and students. In January 2020, he mandated the Duke of Edinburgh Award Programme into Brac University's student life curriculum. It is the first University in Bangladesh to make it an essential student experience. He was instrumental in Brac University's inaugural membership of the Open Society University Network. George Soros announced the University's involvement at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on January 24, 2020. Under his leadership, Brac University ranked GLOBAL TOP 50 for ‚ÄòSustainable Development Goals (SDG 1): No poverty‚Äô in Times Higher Education (THE) Impact Rankings 2020. Brac University's performance has been found to be particularly encouraging in delivering the goals in the university's research on poverty and their support for poor students and citizens in the local community. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chang launched the Student Assistance Fund in May 2020. And in June 2020, he launched Brac University's online learning platform buX.

The purpose of UFIPA and its predecessor, the UPIA, is to provide procedures by which personal representatives administering estates, and trustees administering trusts, allocate receipts and disbursements to income and principal. The goal of the law is to carry out the intentions of the decedent or trust creator, and to govern the proper distribution of assets to trust beneficiaries, heirs and devisees. To be enacted into law in a state, UFIPA must be adopted by a state's legislature.

Design and development The KAI-15 was designed by a team led by P. Kamychev and built at the Kazan Aviation Institute (KAI), flying in 1963. It had chemically milled metal wings to reduce weight and highly polished wing surfaces in an attempt to maintain laminar flow over them, together with a low profile fuselage to minimize drag. The all-metal shoulder-mounted wings were built around single spars. Their skins were chemically milled to reduce thickness from 800 Œºm at the roots to 600 Œºm at the tips while maintaining the original 1200 Œºm thickness over the spars. They had laminar flow profiles and were tetrahedral in plan out to small salmon tip fairings. Each wing carried a two part aileron and three part flap, all sandwich-cored metal structures. Its all-metal, semi-monocoque fuselage was slender, with a maximum cross-sectional area of 0.36 m2 This was achieved by giving the pilot a strongly reclined position under a two-piece canopy that occupied almost all the fuselage forward of the wing leading edge. Unusually, the cockpit was equipped with oxygen for high altitude flight. Behind the wing the fuselage tapered further to a cantilever T-tail. The broad vertical tail was essentially tetragonal in profile, with a generous rudder. The horizontal tail was also tetragonal but much smaller in area. The KAI-19 landed on an electrically operated, fully retractable monowheel with an oleo strut and a disc brake. It was able to launch with a total of of water ballast. About half of this was in the fuselage, the rest in the wings. Operational history Not much is known about its history, beyond a probable first flight year of 1963 and a 1966 report that it had been under test for some months.

G√§rtner graduated in 1973 with Diplom from TU Dresden. He received in 1976 his Ph.D. from Lomonosov University under the supervision of Mark Freidlin. At the Weierstrass Institute, G√§rtner was from 1976 to 1985 a research associate; he habilitated there in 1984 with Dissertation B: Zur Ausbreitung von Wellenfronten f√ºr Reaktions-Diffusions-Gleichungen (The propagation of wave fronts for reaction-diffusion equations). At the Weierstrass Institute he was from 1985 to 1995 the head of the probability group. He was a professor of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR from 1988 until its disbandment in late 1991. At TU Berlin he was from 1992 to 2011 a professor, retiring as professor emeritus in 2011. In 1977 he proved a general form of Cram√©r's Theorem in the theory of large deviations (LD); the theorem is known as the G√§rtner-Ellis Large Deviations Principle (LDP). (Richard S. Ellis proved the theorem in 1984 with weaker premises.) In 1982 G√§rtner wrote an important paper on the famous KPP equation (a semi-linear diffusion equation introduced in 1937). In 1987 G√§rtner, with Donald A. Dawson, introduced the construction of a projective limit in the LDP. From 1987 to 1989 G√§rtner and Dawson wrote a series of important papers on the McKean-Vlasov process. Their results were extended by other mathematicians in the 1990s to random mean-field interactions and to spin-glass mean-field interactions. In 1990 G√§rtner and Molchanov wrote a seminal paper on intermittency in the parabolic Anderson model; the paper introduced a new approach to intermittency via the study of Lyapunov coefficients. G√§rtner was a member from 1984 to 1992 of the editorial board of Probability Theory and Related Fields and from 1990 to 2000 of the editorial board of Mathematische Nachrichten. In 1992 G√§rtner was an invited lecturer at the first European Congress of Mathematics in Paris.

It is found in Japan and Korea, and has been much studied because it provides an example, rare among insects, of paternal care of the young. With the destruction of its typical habitat and its poor dispersal abilities, it has been listed as being an endangered species in Japan. Description Appasus japonicus grows to a length of about , rather smaller than the otherwise similar Appasus major. Three clades have been identified genetically, two in Japan, separated by mountain ranges, and one in Korea. Distribution and habitat Appasus japonicus occurs in freshwater habitats in much of Japan, but not in the Ryukyu Islands, and it also occurs in Korea. It is found in lakes and ponds, side pools and backwaters of rivers, marshes and bogs. As development has reduced these types of habitat, it has taken to living in rice paddies and agricultural water stores. It tends to inhabit warmer habitats than A. major, and occurs at lower densities. Life cycle The male Appasus japonicus initiates courtship in this species by performing a series of up-and-down movements, a \\"pumping display\\". Females are attracted to mate with males that are already carrying eggs in preference to non egg- carrying males. After mating, the female lays its eggs on the back of the male, glueing them in place. The eggs form a pad, and other females lay their eggs alongside the first clutch, so that the eggs on a male's back may have several different mothers. A female lays up to fifty eggs, while a male's carrying capacity is up to about 150 eggs. The male carries the eggs and tends them until they hatch; this takes a month or so in the spring but about a week in the warmer waters of summer. When all the eggs have hatched, the male resumes breeding activities, and may carry four batches of eggs during the course of one year, between April and August. Ecology The front pair of legs is modified for grabbing and holding prey. The proboscis is used to stab the prey and then inject it with a toxic saliva, after which the bug sucks out the liquefied contents. The diet consists mostly of water snails and aquatic insects.

Published in 2005 by Indiana University Press, the book explores the situation of the German people after their government's surrender to the Allies on 8 May 1945 at the end of World War II. In particular, Barnouw discusses the absence of mourning for Germans, their dead, and their lost cities and artifacts destroyed by the Allied air war. Germans themselves could not mourn, because the strong message from the victors was that a just war had been fought against an evil regime, one regarded as uniquely evil for having caused the Holocaust. The politics of memory permitted no regret for Germans, the T√§tervolk, the guilty people. Divided by the Allies into the democratic Federal Republic of Germany in the west and the communist German Democratic Republic in the east‚Äîwith the former capital, Berlin, split by a wall from 1961‚ÄîGermans were forced to look forward only and to view the hour of their surrender, Stunde Null, as a rebirth., ix.

He was the fourth of five children.‚ÄúGeneAnet:\\"M James Howard Trevelyan Maude ROXBY‚Äù In 1966, he was adopted by his Italian cousins, Francesco Luigi Antonio Montalto, Duke of Fragnito (1899 - 1979) and Anna Maria Gabriella Giulia Cecilia Fioravanti (1909 - 1982) after they lost their son, Ruggiero Montalto di Fragnito Principe di Lequile who died in an accident in 1966. With the adoption, David M-R inherited his adopted parents' surname, Montalto di Fragnito, and their hereditary Italian noble titles (including upon the death of his adopted father), The Duke of Fragnito, Prince of Lequile). As his natural parents were still alive, he also kept their surname, Maude-Roxby. In 1947, David traveled with his tutor (and one of his brothers) to Victoria, Australia to write and illustrate a book on the wildlife of the Great Barrier Reef. In Australia, he attended Geelong Grammar School, where he studied under Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack, a member of The Bauhaus movement. He returned to England, to attend Claysmore School in Dorse. After graduation, he went on to study at Sorbonne University and then the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence Italy, studying under Primo Conti and Goffredo Trovarelli. Montalto remained in Italy after his adoption and was offered a partnership with Giancarlo 'Jinx' Girard at Tunsi Ceramics. Some of their works have been acquired by The Museum of Childhood in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. Inspired by the works of Lawrence Whistler and other masters of diamond point stipple glass engraving, Montalto developed his own techniques. In 1973, to celebrate Great Britain joining the European Economic Community, David was commissioned to design and engrave series commemorative glasses which were presented to every Head of State. He has worked for the jewellers Harry Winston, designing and making an ornamental gold pendent to hold a 50 Carat Ruby. David has also designed a pen with a solid Baccarat Crystal box for Montegrappa, the luxury pen company. In 2008 David collaborated with the master watch maker Michel Parmigiani to create for Parmigiani Fleurier a uniquely engraved wrist watch.‚ÄúDavid Montalto Bio‚Äù‚ÄúThe Guardian :\\"Orangerie, no lemons (from the archives)‚Äù David Montalto has lectured at The Harvard Club of Boston, The Royal College of Physicians, Sotheby's, Christie's Fine Art Courses and The Friends of Zion Museum.

The show was be produced and scripted by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL; Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\") and took place at Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico. The show included six matches in total, with the first, third, fourth and sixth match featuring luchadors who were invited to the show for the celebration of lucha libre legends. In the main event Rayo de Jalisco Jr., Tinieblas Jr., and Villano IV defeated El Canek, Fuerza Guerrera, and M√°scara A√±o 2000. On the undercard El Sat√°nico defeated El Solar and the opening match saw Los Diabolicos (El Gallego, Rocky Santana, and Romano Garcia) for the third year in a row, this time losing Super Mu√±eco, Ricky Boy, and Skayde. In the semi-main event Bandido, Volador Jr., and Valiente defeated Nueva Generacion Dinamitas (El Cuatrero, Sans√≥n, and Forastero), who are all nephews of M√°scara A√±o 2000. Production =Background= The Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) first held a show under the name Leyendas Mexicanas (\\"Mexican Legends\\") in November 2017, with the 2019 show marking the third time the name has been used. The Leyendas Mexicanas shows feature various lucha libre \\"legends\\" and celebrates the history of CMLL. As part of their celebration some wrestlers, who had previously been unmasked by losing a Lucha de Apuestas match, were given permission by the Mexico City professional wrestling commission to wear their mask again for one night. The wrestling mask has always held a sacred place in lucha libre, carrying with it a mystique and anonymity beyond what it means to wrestlers elsewhere in the world. The ultimate humiliation a luchador can suffer is to lose a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match. Following a loss in a Lucha de Apuesta match the masked wrestler would be forced to unmask, state their real name and then would be unable to wear that mask while wrestling anywhere in Mexico. While the name was not used until 2018 CMLL has often held shows featuring and honoring \\"legends\\" of Lucha Libre, especial for anniversary shows such as Arena Coliseo 70th Anniversary Show, Blue Panther 40th Anniversary Show, Atlantis 35th Anniversary Show, Negro Casas 40th Anniversary Show that all featured \\"legends\\" booked by CMLL for special appearances. =Storylines= The event will feature a number of professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portray as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. On November 14, 2019 Romano Garcia, also known under the ring name \\"Mr. C√≥ndor\\" announced the he, and his fellow Los Diabolicos (El Gallego and Rocky Santana), would compete for CMLL on December 6, 2019 as part of their major show. Los Diabolicos previous worked on both the 2017 and 2018 Leyenda Mexicanas shows, each time facing Trio Fantasia (Super Mu√±eco, Super Pinocho, and Super Raton). The following day Jorge Rivera Soriano, known in wrestling as Skayde revealed that he would also appear on the December 6 show. Skayde briefly worked for CMLL in the first part of 1999, 20 years prior to the Leyendas show. CMLL later confirmed that the December 6 Super Viernes show would indeed be the Leyendas Mexicanas show. In the lead up to the show, Mano Negra announced that the Leyendas Mexicanas show would be his final match at Arena M√©xico.

A tool alone is useless; but the knowledge of how to leverage and utilize that tool is invaluable.'

It was constructed on the grounds of a house once owned by the merchant Benjamin Deicrowe Jr. that Mayoe obtained from the indebted Deicrowe through legal manoeuvring. Burleigh House, which did not receive that name until the 19th-century, was particularly known for its ornate iron gates. It was demolished in 1913 and shops and a cinema built on its grounds but is remembered in the modern Burleigh Way. Burleigh House interior History Burleigh House was built in Church Street, west of Enfield Marketplace, in the mid-17th century for the lawyer James Mayoe, who erected it on the site of a larger house once owned by the merchant Benjamin Deicrowe Jr., which, through connivance and legal manoeuvring, Mayoe had obtained from the indebted Deicrowe.A detailed account of the legal proceedings through which Mayoe obtained the house from Deicrowe may be found in Pam's History of Enfield, Vol. 1, pp. 168-170.

The central part of the house, and probably the oldest, was ornamented by brick pilasters. The entrance hall was of Purbeck stone with a fireplace decorated with Flemish tiles. In the early 1900s, the kitchen still had a roasting spit that was thought to be 200 years old and a deep well that still provided water. The drawing room was on the first floor with three round- headed windows and a chimney-piece in white marble showing Alexander the Great. Above the drawing room were the bedrooms. One room contained a fireplace with the initials BDM for Benjamin and Margaret Deicrowe. A noted feature of the house was its iron gates, believed to have been made by the blacksmith Thomas Warren (1673-1736). Demolition and legacy The house was demolished in 1913 with the fixtures and fittings sold at auction and the site sold for ¬£7,000. Shops were built on the frontage by 1914 and the Rialto Cinema built on the bulk of the site in 1920. The cinema was renamed the Granada in 1967 and closed in 1971.

Gray (February 14, 1942 - March 22, 1994) was an American attorney and political figure from Vermont. He is best known for his service as United States Attorney for the District of Vermont from 1977 to 1981, managing the successful 1986 reelection campaign of U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, and running unsuccessfully for the US Senate against Republican Jim Jeffords in 1988. Early life William Barton Gray was born in Brattleboro, Vermont on February 14, 1942, the son of Edwin and Mabel Gray. His father managed buildings and grounds maintenance at The Putney School, and his mother ran the school's kitchen. Gray's siblings included Olympic skier Bob Gray. He was raised in Putney, Vermont and attended The Putney School, from which he graduated in 1960. He then attended Harvard College, from which he received his bachelor of arts degree in 1964. While at Harvard, Gray was a member of the Hasty Pudding Club and The Harvard Krokodiloes. In 1967, Gray received his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and attained admission to the bar. In addition to pursuing a legal career, Gray was an amateur singer, and during his years as a prosecutor in New York City his musical activities included performing as an extra in La boh√®me with the Metropolitan Opera and performing with the New York Choral Society. After returning to Vermont, he became a member of Burlington's Musica Propria choral group. He was also an avid cross-country skier, bicyclist, and runner, and took part in several marathons. Start of career From 1967 to 1968, Gray was a law clerk in the office of federal judge Sterry R. Waterman. From 1968 to 1972 he was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. From 1972 to 1975, Gray was an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont. In 1975, he was appointed an Associate Deputy U.S. Attorney General and Director of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys. United States Attorney In 1977, Gray left the director's position to become United States Attorney for the District of Vermont during the presidential administration of Jimmy Carter. He served until the end of Carter's administration in 1981. Among the notable prosecutions Gray handled as U.S. Attorney was the controversial 1978 case of Kristina Berster, who had been arrested at the U.S.-Canada border in Vermont and was accused by the government in West Germany of being a member of the Red Army Faction terrorist group. Berster faced an eight-count indictment for passport violations and illegally crossing the border. No links to terrorism were proved, but there were allegations of illegal surveillance and false testimony made against U.S. law enforcement agencies. Berster was convicted of one felony and one misdemeanor. She was sentenced to nine months in prison, all but two weeks of which she had served while awaiting trial. Charges against her in West Germany were dismissed, and she returned home after finishing her American sentence. Gray also prosecuted Gerald Bull, an engineer and weapons designer who operated Space Research Corporation of North Troy, Vermont. Bull and a colleague were convicted of illegally selling arms to South Africa in 1980 and served prison sentences. Continued career In 1981, Gray began to practice law in Vermont as a partner in the Burlington firm of Sheehey, Blue, Gray & Furlong. In 1986 he left the practice of law to volunteer as the campaign manager for Democratic U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy. Leahy was elected to a third term, defeating the Republican nominee, former Governor Richard Snelling in the general election. In 1988, Gray won the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Robert Stafford. In the general election, Gray was defeated by the Republican nominee, Republican Jim Jeffords. In 1991, Gray served as chairman of the Vermont Bicentennial Commission, which was created to organize celebrations and activities commemorating Vermont's 1791 admission to the Union as the 14th state. He was also a board of directors member for the Vermont Council on the Arts, the Flynn Theater for the Performing Arts, The Putney School, and the Visiting Nurse Association of Chittenden and Grand Isle Counties. In 1993, Leahy and Jeffords recommended Gray to serve as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the same seat once held by Sterry Waterman. Gray's nomination was still pending at the time of his death, so he was never confirmed for the position. Death and burial Gray resided on a farm in Jericho and practiced law until he was diagnosed with leukemia in 1993. In addition to his legal practice, he raised sheep, kept bees, and grew Christmas trees and apples. He died on March 22, 1994 while undergoing treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. He was buried at West Hill Cemetery in Putney, Vermont. Family In 1965, Gray married Sarah Kerlin of Riverdale, Bronx, New York. They were the parents of son Joshua Barton Gray and daughter Sarah Hawkes Gray.

In response to perceived threats against Jackson and allegations of child sexual assault made against him, the FBI \\"made several investigations\\" into Jackson, \\"none of which led to charges\\". Between 1993 and 1994, and separately between 2004 and 2005, Jackson was investigated by California law enforcement agencies due to allegations of child abuse. The FBI provided technical and investigative assistance to these agencies during the cases. The FBI also investigated threats made against Jackson and others by an individual who was later imprisoned for these crimes. These investigations occurred between 1992 and 2005 and in each allegation, the FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf. The records released consist of 333 pages of over 600 pages total and appear divided into 7 parts on their official website. These files include copies of letters from members of the public commenting on his performances, newspaper clippings, and various documents reporting that Jackson was the target of extortion attempts, terrorist threat, and more as many of these topics were dissected in significant media coverage of the FBI files on Michael Jackson upon release, and for years that followed.  FBI monitoring and investigation of Jackson  Prior to events recorded in Jackson's file, the FBI began monitoring Michael Jackson by 1992, when they \\"looked into death threats against Jackson by a man obsessed with his sister, Janet\\". = Part one: FBI monitoring tabloid articles on Jackson = Part 01 of 07 of the FBI files consisted of 10 pages, primarily legal documents and tabloid newspaper clippings. The clippings make mention of an alleged 1993 phone call that took place between Jackson and Terance George, a British disc jockey, where phone sex was alleged. The phone call allegedly took place in 1979 when Jackson was 20 and George was 13 years old. The tabloid clippings in the FBI files would also reveal that it was the British native that pursued contact with Jackson and not the other way around. The clipped article claimed ‚Äúthe final rejection came four years later when Terry tried to rekindle their friendship when Jackson came to London again. Terry tracked him down and was even photographed alongside his idol, but now the management was on hand to issue the polite brush-off.‚Äù In 2003, 10 years after George accused Jackson, he cheerfully recalled his 1979 interview with him in Louis Theroux‚Äôs documentary, Louis, Martin & Michael. When asked about the accusation he said ‚Äúit came out really without my authority‚Äù and \\"it developed from somebody who had a big mouth, basically, one of my close friends who knew about the story.\\" Regarding whether the story was true George told Theroux ‚Äúparts of it are true yeah...parts of the story are true...I mean I would say the majority is true but papers get their bit and they twist it and they make things a bit sensationalized really.\\"Louis, Martin & Michael. (2003). [Documentary film] Directed by L. Theroux. With no proof, no recorded phone call, and nothing reported to law enforcement or lawsuits filed, nothing ever materialized over George's allegation and Legat London and the FBI took no further action.p. 1, = Part two: forensics analysis of Jackson's computers = Part 02 of 07 of the FBI files consisted of 44 pages orbiting around the forensics analysis of Jackson's computers and hard drives. As a result of investigatory raids on Jackson's properties in 2003, 16 hard drives were confiscated in total. The results of what the FBI's Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) found on these hard drives were in a report addressed to Sheriff Jim Anderson, dated April 4, 2004 The FBI meticulously went through all 16 hard drives and found nothing incriminating on them. The hard drives contained no form of illegal material, and the computer's history contained no record of accessing or searching for such material. On March 29, 2004, CART forwarded 4 DVDs to the Forensic Audio Video Image Analysis Unit (FAVIAU) for file formatting issues and requested that the files be converted to a readable format. Sometime after the conversion, it was noted that ‚Äúthere are no outstanding leads or evidence items.‚Äùp. 37-39 = Part three: LAPD seeks Mann Act assistance and investigators determine the credibility of other allegations = Michael Jackson‚Äôs Driver‚Äôs license found in Part three on page 8 of the FBI Files The 59 pages that inhere part 03 of 07 of the FBI files provide an early timeline for the 1993 allegations against Jackson. This file indicates that it was on September 7, 1993, when there was a request for the FBI assistance with investigations into the first accusations of sexual abuse against Michael Jackson. It is learned that the LAPD wanted the FBI to assist with prosecuting Jackson under the Mann Act, also known as the White-Slave Traffic Act.p. 1-20, The law prohibited the transportation of anyone over state borders for the purpose of illegal sexual acts and was first used as a tool for political prosecution against boxing champion, Jack Johnson. It is also revealed that the request was short-lived as on September 8, 1993, the United States Attorney declined to prosecute Jackson for violating the Mann Act.p. 20, The remaining pages in this file include various allegations against Jackson during the 1993-1994 period, with many of the pages being replicated from file part one. Other allegations being tracked by various newspaper clippings included detectives traveling to the Philippines to interview a couple who use to work for Jackson. Due to credibility issues over back pay, their claims were dismissed. Other accusations against Jackson included a writer who claimed that Jackson sexually molested 2 Mexican boys in 1985 or 1986. The writer contradicted this by also claiming that after being investigated by the FBI, the government assisted in a cover-up because Jackson was to receive an honor in 1984, from the President at the White House. After checking their own archives, the FBI concluded that no such reference was found.p. 52, = Part four: video analysis = Containing only 9 pages, Part 4 of 7 focuses on the analysis of a multi-generational poor quality VHS tape seized by US Customs in West Palm Beach, Florida in 1995. The tape was labelled ‚ÄúMichael Jackson‚Äôs Neverland Favorites An All Boy Anthology‚Äù but the files do not mention that Jackson himself owned the tape or had anything to do with it. The investigation whether it contained child pornography was concluded on January 24, 1997. No charges were filed. = Part five: 2003‚Äì2005 period accusations = The 18 pages in Part 5 of 7 of the FBI files provide documentation of a brief timeline of the 2003-2005 accusations from an indictment, to arrest, to CART and the FBI's investigatory assistance, to the trial's acquittal. The documents found here also reveal that police in Santa Barbara, where Jackson stood trial, contacted the FBI because they feared he might become a terrorist target. At the molestation trial, the FBI concluded there was little risk of terrorism. They noted that a Nation of Islam follower and a New Black Panther Party member attended one court appearance. Both parties remained unnamed in the file. Jackson was acquitted of all charges on June 13, 2005. = Part six: death threats and extortion attempts = Part 6 of 7 happens to be the FBI‚Äôs largest released file on Jackson, consisting of 199 pages. This part examines death threats against Jackson and others by Frank Paul Jones, who served two years in prison for sending threatening letters. Jones' conviction was the result of a letter that read, ‚ÄúI am going to Washington, D.C., to threaten to kill the president of the United States, George Bush.‚Äù The letter also mentions threats against Jackson where Jones writes, ‚ÄúI will personally attempt to kill if he doesn't pay me my money.‚Äù Jones was arrested for trespassing on June 22, 1992 at the Jackson family compound in Encino, California. = Part seven: law enforcement interviews the 1993 accuser for 2005 trial = With only 5 pages, part 07 of 07 is the shortest part of the released FBI files on Jackson. This part reveals investigators‚Äô attempt to pursue the 1993 accuser as a second case to coincide with the 2003 accuser. After a meeting in June 2004 between Santa Barbara Assistant District Attorneys (SBADAs) and the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), it was concluded that a Federal case could still be pursued with the 1993 accuser. A conference call was then held on August 30, 2004, where it was agreed that Santa Maria RA should open a case on the 1993 accuser. A meeting was later held in New York in an attempt to get the 1993 accuser to testify for 2005 trial. The 1993 accuser informed the two agents in the meeting that he would not testify against Jackson and would ‚Äúlegally fight any attempts to do so.‚Äù A document dated 12/09/2004, indicates that the case was closed, citing ‚Äúno outstanding leads or evidence items.‚Äùp.5,  Media reaction  Quite a few media outlets gave notability to the release of the FBI files on Michael Jackson on December 22, 2009. On that day, news media started to report on the content of the FBI files. These outlets include, but not limited to, the following: The Guardian, MTV, CNN, Billboard (magazine), ABC News, Variety (magazine), CBC News, BBC, France 24, and Reuters. In a December 2009 edition of Good Morning America, Robin Roberts interviewed former Jackson Family lawyer, Brian Oxman. Oxman revealed that there was a total of 673 pages in the FBI files, and that out of the 333 pages that were released, he says, > In all these pages, hundreds of pages, many many hours of investigations... > there's not one scrap of evidence that Michael Jackson ever did anything > wrong, committed any crime... It's almost a vindication when you look at > this. The FBI looked at all of these matters and said, 'There's nothing > here'. In the same segment of the show, a former investigator for the FBI told GMA that due to local law enforcement's limited capabilities, it was common that the FBI get involved as they were well-resourced to assist in such manners. The FBI files would again become media attention when in 2013 a London tabloid reported that there were \\"secret FBI files\\" that revealed Jackson paid millions in hush money to dozens of other boys he allegedly abused. Journalists soon started to question tabloid reports. Drew Griffin, a CNN Special Investigations reporter said, \\"It just sounds like recycled tabloid reports from 20 years ago.\\" Thomas Mesereau, Jackson's 2005 criminal defense attorney, made mention that the FBI case into Jackson was closed and that there was no inclusion of the tabloid's claims in the files as he dismissed the reporting by saying, \\"it sounds like a bunch of utter nonsense.\\" Diane Dimond, who admittedly is no Jackson defender, also dismissed the reports by saying, \\"The problem is there's no evidence to back up the claim that Jackson made that many payoffs.\\" In 2016, Radar Online alleged that child pornography was found in the 2003 raid of Jackson's properties, though Part 2 of the FBI files reveal no such evidence was found. The allegation was based on documentation that allegedly was from the police department that investigated Jackson. However, Kelly Hoover, a spokesperson for the police department told USA Today that, > Some of the documents appear to be copies of reports that were authored by > Sheriff‚Äôs Office personnel as well as evidentiary photographs taken by > Sheriff‚Äôs Office personnel interspersed with content that appears to be > obtained off the internet or through unknown sources... The Sheriff‚Äôs Office > did not release any of the documents and/or photographs to the media. The > Sheriff‚Äôs Office released all of its reports and the photographs as part of > the required discovery process to the prosecution and the defense. Judge Melville, the presiding judge of Jackson's 2005 trial, also signed a press statement stating that no child pornography or anything illegal was ever found in Jackson's possession or on his properties.

It is located in the village of Vilnes on the south side of the island of Atl√∏yna. It is one of several churches for the Askvoll parish which is part of the Sunnfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The brown, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1674 using designs by the local parish priest, Otthe Jonass√∏n. The church seats about 130 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1320. The original church at Vilnes was likely a stave church. The altarpiece is dated as 1250 AD, so it is very likely the church was built around that time. The old medieval church stood for centuries until 1673 when it was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. The following spring and summer, the parish residents quickly built a new church using plans by the local parish priest, Otthe Jonass√∏n. Not being an architect, the church was completed, but there were some areas of the design that were lacking. In 1686, the church had to replace part of the roof that had not been built correctly. The church was cold and drafty, and often on a windy and snowy day, some snow was able to find its way into the church. After World War II, the architects Johan Lindstr√∏m and his son Claus Lindstr√∏m were hired to renovate, restore, and upgrade the church. The project lasted nearly a decade and they took care to maintain the historical look of the church. They rebuilt the roofs, insulated the walls, and added lights and heating.

He is the father of the composers Friedrich Burgm√ºller and Norbert Burgm√ºller.  Life and work  Therese and August Burgm√ºller as spectators at Napoleon's entry into D√ºsseldorf on 3 November 1811, coloured engraving by Johann Petersen (excerpt); Stadtmuseum Landeshauptstadt D√ºsseldorf Burgm√ºller was born on 3 May 1760 in Magdeburg and baptized on 6 May with the names \\"Anton Friedrich\\".Magdeburg, Evangelische Superintendentur, baptismal register Domgemeinde 1656-1814, . In the older literature the first names are also \\"Friedrich August\\" or \\"Johann August Franz\\", the latter in most handwritten sources. He himself signed mostly briefly \\"August Burgm√ºller\\". His father was Johann Christian Burgm√ºller (1734-1776), organist at the Magdeburger Dom, who taught him how to play the piano. From 1783 Burgm√ºller studied in Leipzig and Erfurt, but dropped out in 1785 and went from Erfurt to Weimar to the theatre troupe of the principal Joseph Bellomo (real name Joseph Edler von Zambiasi, 1752/54-1833). Burgm√ºller worked there as Kapellmeister, but also as an actor, and composed a Singspiel and stage music for the troupe. Already in autumn 1786 he changed to Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm Gro√ümann and his co-director Christian Wilhelm Klos at their newly founded theater company ato Cologne with which he also gave guest performances in D√ºsseldorf and Bonn. At last Klos led the company alone and led it into bankruptcy in July 1788 in Aachen. From this outstanding ensemble emerged the so-called Bonner Nationaltheater, which was subsidized by Elector Maximilian Franz with 15,000 Reichstalers annually and opened on January 3, 1789. Together with other members of the Klosschen Troupe - including Christiane Keilholz, Carl Demmer, Joseph Lux, Johann Baptist Spitzeder and Heinrich Vohs - Burgm√ºller also went to Bonn and became Kapellmeister there. His theatre orchestra consisted mainly of musicians from the Bonn court orchestra, among them the 18-year-old Ludwig van Beethoven, who played viola. Beethoven obviously hoped that Burgm√ºller would perform his Cantata on the Death of Emperor Joseph II WoO 87, because he wrote to the Hofkammerrat August von Schall on 16 June 1790: The whimsical letter still contains numerous news from Bonn's cultural life, but even in Bonn Burgm√ºller did not endure long. In the same year he moved to the Nationaltheater in Mainz. After the French occupation of the city in 1792 he went to D√ºsseldorf where he settled as a piano teacher. Here he met his pupil and later wife Therese von Zandt. When in October 1794 D√ºsseldorf was also occupied by the French, he lost sight of her again for many years. Burgm√ºller fled again to Mainz and took over the musical direction of various acting troupes around Friedrich Wilhelm Hunnius and Johann Ludwig B√ºchner. With the two troupes he also played in Aachen, Cologne and D√ºsseldorf. Due to a search advertisement published by Therese von Zandt in the Leipzig newspaper Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung on 9 November 1803, Burgm√ºller left the Rhineland and travelled to Regensburg in August 1804, where he saw his former fianc√©e again and married on 13 May 1805. On the recommendation of the Privy Councillor Karl Christian Ernst von Bentzel-Sternau, Burgm√ºller was appointed Music director of the newly built Theater Regensburg. In addition he founded the first German drama school there, decisively supported by the influential Elector and Reich Chancellor Karl Theodor von Dalberg. Burgm√ºller's move to Regensburg can presumably be explained by the fact that Therese's father had done everything in his power to break the liaison with the musician, so that the two could only live together in \\"exile\\". F. A. Burgm√ºller's tombstone Half a year after his last festival leadership in D√ºsseldorf, 1822, he was dismissed for inexplicable reasons by the theatre directors Josef Derossi and Wolf, which led to severe financial losses for Burgm√ºller, as a result of which he fell seriously ill. He did not recover from this suffering and finally died on 21 August 1824. He was buried at the . After his death a benefit concert was organized in favour of his family. The people of D√ºsseldorf thanked him afterwards in 1949 for his merits with a new grave plate and the inscription: \\"St√§dtischer Musikdirektor Friedrich August Burgm√ºller, founder of the Niederrheinischen Musikfeste, 1760-1824\\". His two sons Friedrich Burgm√ºller and Norbert Burgm√ºller also became respected pianists and composers, with Norbert becoming the more talented and successful musician despite his short life and following in his father's footsteps. He also played an outstanding role in the D√ºsseldorf music scene. Burgm√ºlller died in D√ºsseldorf at the age of 64.

The story centers around the efforts of a group of people to salvage valuables from a sunken yacht in the Bahamas in 1933 and their schemes to betray and double-cross one another. The film is based on the 1933 short story \\"After the Storm\\" by Ernest Hemingway with a screenplay by A. E. Hotchner. Originally intended for theatrical release, it instead was broadcast as a television film in the United States on the USA Network. Plot Arno ‚Äî a World War I veteran whose father followed Arno's advice to invest heavily in stocks and hanged himself after losing the family's money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929 ‚Äî left everything behind after his mother also died soon afterward, taking with him only his father's expensive pocket watch. He lives alone in a beachfront shack in the Bahamas with only a pet parrot for company and ekes out a living as a beachcomber, travelling among the islands on his boat Caca de Toro and selling items he finds washed up on the beach. While in town one day in 1933, Arno discovers that Coquina, a woman he is attracted to, has returned from a three- year stay with her uncle on another island. Coquina's grandmother dislikes Arno and wishes Coquina to marry Thomas, a shopkeeper with greater financial security than the indebted and impoverished Arno, but Arno makes romantic overtures to Coquina, and a romantic relationship soon develops between them. Arno visits Janine, a married woman with whom he has a sexual relationship, and announces that their relationship is over. Arno also encounters Janine's husband Jean-Pierre, a Frenchman who operates a boat named La Chamade that he uses both for marine salvage work and to offer charter cruises as a gigolo for wealthy female tourists. Aboard the La Chamade is Ortega, a shady associate of Arno's for whom Jean-Pierre often works. Ortega needs Arno's boat and knowledge of Cuban waters for an illegal voyage to Cuba and offers Arno US$500 to work with him, but Arno dislikes Ortega and turns him down. Ortega approaches the corrupt local police chief, Sergeant Major Jim, and they concoct a plot to blackmail Arno into working for Ortega. Aboard the Caca de Toro, Arno comes across a yacht, the Pride of Chicago, and is invited aboard. The yacht's owner, a rich American bootlegger, hires him to take a package to Bimini and the bootlegger's ailing wife asks him to pick up a package of medication for her as well while he is there. After Arno picks up her package on Bimini, one of Sergeant Major Jim's constables attempts to take it from him, but one of Arno's friends suddenly appears and assaults the constable, allowing Arno to escape just as a severe storm strikes. Arno seeks shelter in the bar and restaurant of a hotel. Sergeant Major Jim, Ortega, Janine, and Jean-Pierre all are there. Sergeant Major Jim seizes Arno's package, finds it contains heroin, and threatens Arno with arrest. Ortega intervenes, offering to pay Arno's bail if he will take the Cuba job Ortega is offering. A fight breaks out and Ortega pulls a knife, but Arno wrestles the knife away and stabs Ortega with it. Accused of killing Ortega, Arno escapes into the storm aboard the Caca de Toro. He and his boat survive the storm, but he discovers the next morning that his father's watch has broken during the ordeal. Arno tries to find the Pride of Chicago to deliver the package he picked up on Bimini, but discovers that the yacht sank in the storm and lies upside down on the ocean bottom in shallow water. Through portholes, he sees the drowned bodies of women he had met aboard the yacht, still adorned with expensive jewelry. He lacks the diving and salvage equipment necessary to enter the wreck and retrieve the jewelry. Determined to salvage valuables from the wreck before anyone else can, he returns to town and finds Coquina. The two of them steal diving equipment from Thomas's family and return to the wreck of the Pride of Chicago, but the stolen equipment malfunctions and Arno almost drowns. Coquina saves him. Ortega, it turns out, suffered only a minor stab wound in his fight with Arno. He hires Jean-Pierre to find Arno and bring him in for a reward. Jean-Pierre has heard about US$1 million in gold in a safe aboard the sunken Pride of Chicago and that a major search for her wreck has begun. Aboard the La Chamade, Jean-Pierre and Janine soon find the Caca de Toro. Arno and Jean-Pierre make a deal: Jean-Pierre ‚Äî unable to dive due to eardrum damage ‚Äî will not report the wanted Arno to the authorities or take him to Ortega and will provide diving and salvage equipment. In exchange, Arno will reveal the location of the Pride of Chicago, do the diving to bring up valuables from the wreck, and agree to split the profits. Jean-Pierre does not tell Arno about the gold aboard the yacht or that Ortega is alive. Arno begins diving on the wreck and retrieving expensive jewelry from the bodies inside her hull, narrowly avoiding an attack by a shark swimming inside the wreck. Arno and Jean-Pierre divide up the day's salvaged valuables that evening, hiding their shares so that neither can steal from the other. Arno and Coquina have sex, and afterwards he gives her his father's watch to wear around her neck. On his next dive, he makes his first attempt to enter the wreck and nearly suffocates when his air hose snags on the wreck; Coquina saves him again. Arno secretly keeps some of the salvaged jewelry for himself without letting Jean-Pierre know he had found it in the wreck, and he takes it to Sergeant Major Jim to bribe Jim to drop the murder charges he believes have been lodged against him. Jim accepts the bribe, then tells Arno that Ortega is alive and well. Arno returns to the La Chamade and accuses Jean-Pierre of lying to him about Ortega. A fight ensues, Arno throws Jean-Pierre overboard, and Arno pulls him back aboard only after Jean-Pierre informs him of the gold that is aboard the Pride of Chicago. While Arno makes a night dive on the Pride of Chicago, Jean-Pierre suggests to Coquina that Arno might betray her, take all the gold, and run off with Janine. He suggests that they double-cross Arno and Janine and split the profits with one another, and even that they could kill Arno by shutting off the air compressor feeding him air during his dive. In the wreck, the shark attacks Arno; he escapes, but loses the diving helmet and diving suit. Arno and Jean-Pierre go ashore and procure explosives with which to blow the safe open and an open-bottomed diving bell that will make up for the loss of the diving helmet and suit by allowing Arno to catch breaths of air without having to come to the surface. While they are gone, Janine confides in Coquina, telling her that she plans to leave Jean-Pierre as soon as the salvage operation is over and that Coquina should be careful about Arno abandoning her, especially when she is older and less beautiful. When Arno and Jean-Pierre return, Coquina tells Arno that Jean-Pierre plans to steal his share, and Arno says that she should play along and that they will turn the tables on Jean-Pierre by stealing his share instead. Janine accompanies Arno in the diving bell on his next dive, a night dive in which he detonates the explosives to open the safe aboard the Pride of Chicago. As he visits the diving bell to breathe, Janine proposes that they double-cross Coquina and Jean-Pierre, keep all the treasure for themselves, and run off together. Arno plays along and agrees with her. On the La Chamade, Jean-Pierre asks Coquina to join him in double-crossing Arno and Janine; Coquina agrees to the double-cross. At the wreck, Arno and Janine recover the gold, but the shark returns and attacks Janine through the open bottom of the diving bell, killing her and swimming off with her body. Back aboard the La Chamade, Jean- Pierre blames Arno for Janine's death, and Coquina appears to take Jean- Pierre's side. Ortega and one of his henchmen suddenly storm aboard and try to take all the salvaged valuables for themselves at gunpoint. In an effort to appease Ortega, Arno and Jean-Pierre both reveal the hiding places for their shares of the treasure aboard the La Chamade, but a struggle ensues. Ortega stabs Arno in the shoulder but Jean-Pierre shoots both Ortega and his henchman, killing them. Coquina tells Arno that she sided with Jean-Pierre in the argument over Janine's death merely to play along with Jean-Pierre in his scheme to double-cross Arno. With Arno's knowledge, Coquina drugs Jean-Pierre so that she and Arno can flee with all the salvaged gold and treasure, but Arno wakes up the next morning to find that Coquina also drugged him, and that she has disappeared in a skiff, taking all the gold and jewels for herself. He laughs ironically when Sergeant Major Jim arrives on another boat to arrest Jean-Pierre and him for possession of the gold. Arno returns to his life as a beachcomber. One day he stops by the bar where he picks up his mail and receives a package. It contains his father's watch, which Coquina has had repaired and mailed back to him. Cast * Benjamin Bratt as Arno * Mili Avital as Coquina * Armand Assante as Jean-Pierre * Simone-√âlise Girard as Janine * Nestor Serrano as Ortega * Stephen Lang as Sergeant Major Jim Screenplay A. E. Hotchner, a playwright, novelist, and editor who was a friend and biographer of Ernest Hemingway and had previously adapted Hemingway's The Snows of Kilimanjaro, The Killers, and The Fifth Column for television, wrote the screenplay for After the Storm, basing it on a seven- page Hemingway short story of the same name published in the May 1932 issue of Cosmopolitan.University of Delaware Special Collections Department Ernest Hemingway In His Time:Appearing in the Little Magazines Retrieved November 16, 2019 Hemingway based the short story on a purportedly true story a charter- boat captain in Key West, Florida, told him in 1928 about a conch-fisherman's account of the sinking of the Spanish steamer with the loss of all 488 people on board on September 9, 1919, during the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane. The short story's anonymous narrator gives a first-person account of escaping a bar fight by slashing his assailant with a knife and fleeing in a skiff to hide out in the belief that he had killed the man. The narrator comes across the wreck of an ocean liner in shallow water. He dives on the wreck and through a porthole sees a dead woman wearing jewelry, but he is unable to break the glass in the porthole to reach the jewelry. He returns to shore, discovers that the man he slashed did not die, and learns that the liner ‚Äì reportedly carrying gold on board in a safe ‚Äì had sunk when she sprang a leak during a storm and her boilers exploded, killing her entire crew and all 450 passengers aboard. He waits for a week for stormy weather to subside before returning to the wreck, then discovers that someone he refers to as \\"the Greeks\\" had blown the wreck open with dynamite and taken all the gold and valuables aboard. He laments having made no money off his discovery of the sunken liner.fiu.edu Ben Stoltzfus, Benjamin, \\"Hemingway's \\"After the Storm\\": A Lacanian Reading,\\" fiu.edu Retrieved November 16, 2019.Hemingway, Ernest, The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway, New York: Scribner, 1987, pp. 227‚Äì230 Retrieved November 16, 2019 Although the location of Hemingway's story ‚Äì apparently the Florida Keys ‚Äì is ambiguous at best and it provides no dates for its events, Hotchner sets the film in the Bahamas in 1933. Like Hemingway's anonymous narrator, Hotchner's Arno character believes he stabbed a man to death in a bar fight, flees to avoid arrest, and discovers a sunken vessel containing the body of a woman (two women in the film version) wearing jewelry, although the unnamed ocean liner in Hemingway's story is replaced by the yacht Pride of Chicago in the film. Like the narrator, Arno returns to shore, discovers that he did not kill his assailant in the bar fight, and returns to the wreck in the hope of salvaging valuables from it, and like the narrator, Arno ends up with nothing. Otherwise, the film adds a great deal of narrative that does not exist in the short story. Like the narrator's unnamed assailant, Ortega fights with Arno and is stabbed, but neither Ortega or any of the other characters in the film appear in the short story. The anonymous narrator has no equivalent to Arno's back story about his father and his father's watch or to his romance with Coquina, his relationship with Janine, or his associations with Jean-Pierre, Ortega, or Sergeant Major Jim, and the narrator deals with none of the schemes and double-crosses the film's characters do. Unlike Arno, the narrator encounters no shark while diving. While in the short story the narrator finds that someone else has dynamited the ocean liner's wreck and made off with the valuables, in the film Arno dynamites the sunken yacht himself and only loses the gold and jewelry he salvaged when Coquina steals it from him.

King Baudouin was the eldest son of King Leopold III of Belgium and Princess Astrid of Sweden, while Do√±a Fabiola was the sixth child of Don Gonzalo de Mora y Fern√°ndez, 4th Marqu√©s de Casa Riera, and Do√±a Blanca de Arag√≥n y Carrillo. Engagement The marriage of King Baudouin, who acceded to the throne in 1950, was of great interest to the Belgian people. Leo Joseph Suenens, Auxiliary Bishop of Mechelen, took matters into his own hands and sent Irish nun, Sister Veronica O‚ÄôBrien, to find him a devout Catholic, Spanish, aristocratic wife. Sister O'Brien believed she found the perfect candidate in Fabiola, who was then working as a hospital nurse. The couple announced their engagement on 16 September 1960 at the Castle of Laeken. The news came as a pleasant surprise to the Belgian people, who were not aware the King was seeing anyone. The wedding attracted media attention, both in Belgium and Spain and abroad. In its 6 September 1960, issue, TIME magazine called Do√±a Fabiola the \\"Cinderella Girl\\" and described her as \\"an attractive young woman, though no raving beauty\\" and \\"the girl who could not catch a man.\\" Spanish bakers set out to honour the impending marriage by creating a type of bread called \\"la fabiola\\", which is still made in Palencia. Pre-wedding celebrations Prior to departing Spain, Do√±a Mar√≠a del Carmen Polo y Mart√≠nez-Vald√©s, wife of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, presented Do√±a Fabiola with a strawberry leaf tiara, resembling a Ducal coronet, with interchangeable rubies, aquamarines and emeralds, on behalf of the Spanish government. On 13 December, a ball was given at the Cinquantenaire Museum. On 14 December, a ball was given at the Royal Palace of Brussels. The wedding Cardinal van Roey conducts the nuptial mass. =Civil marriage= Prior to the religious service, the couple were married civilly in the Throne Room of the Royal Palace of Brussels.

A representative from the Holy See read a personal message from Pope John XXIII. As the King and new Queen left the cathedral Handel's Hallelujah chorus from Messiah was played. Attire The bride's white silk and tulle gown, trimmed with ermine, had a high neckline, three-quarter length sleeves with a drop waist and a full skirt. It was designed by Crist√≥bal Balenciaga and had a 22-foot long train. She wore the Art Deco diamond tiara given to her late mother-in-law at the time of her own marriage in 1926. The groom wore the uniform of a Lieutenant-General of the Armed Forces with the riband and star of the Belgian Order of Leopold and the collar of the Spanish Order of Isabella the Catholic.

It remained in that Army for the rest of the year, with one brief exception, until it was transferred to Don Front's 64th Army in January, 1943 during the closing stages of the battle of Stalingrad. In March this Army became 7th Guards Army and was railed to the northwest, joining Voronezh Front south of the Kursk salient. In the battle that followed the 15th Guards assisted in the defeat of Army Detachment Kempf, then took part in the summer offensive into Ukraine, winning one of the first battle honors at Kharkov. It remained in either 7th Guards or 37th Army into the spring of 1944. It saw action in the Nikopol-Krivoi Rog Offensive and was awarded the Order of Suvorov before being involved in the frustrating battles along the Dniestr River on the Romanian border. In June the division became part of 34th Guards Rifle Corps in 5th Guards Army and was redeployed north becoming part of 1st Ukrainian Front and taking part in the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive into Poland. The 15th Guards made a spectacular advance across Poland during the Vistula- Oder Offensive and was further decorated with the Order of Kutuzov for forcing a crossing of the Oder River. It then saw action in the drive on Berlin in April and the Prague Offensive in May, winning a further battle honor and an unusual second Order of the Red Banner in the process. After the war the division did garrison duty in Austria, then in Ukraine, followed by a move in late 1947 to Crimea and the Kuban where its personnel assisted in rebuilding the local economy and infrastructure for nearly 20 years. It September 1965 it was renumbered as the \\"51st\\" and became the 2nd formation of the 51st Guards Motor Rifle Division. Formation The division was officially raised to Guards status on February 16, 1942 in recognition of its role in the first liberation of Rostov-on-Don on December 2, 1941 and its subsequent attacks across the Mius River.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", Soviet Guards Rifle and Airborne Units 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IV, Nafziger, 1995, p. 48 Its sub-units would not receive their Guards redesignations until some time later. It inherited the Order of Lenin the 136th had earned in March, 1940. Its order of battle, based on the last peacetime shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions, was eventually as follows: * 44th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 378th Rifle Regiment) * 47th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 541st Rifle Regiment) * 50th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 733rd Rifle Regiment) * 43rd Guards Artillery Regiment (from 291st Artillery Regiment) * 20th Guards Antitank Battalion * 18th Guards Antiaircraft Battery (until May 1, 1943) * 27th Guards Mortar Battalion (until October 20, 1942) * 17th Guards Reconnaissance Company * 11th Guards Sapper Battalion (from 42nd Sapper Battalion)Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed Before June 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VIII, Nafziger, 1996, p. 69. In common with all prewar rifle divisions the 136th had had a howitzer regiment but this was removed in 1941. * 25th Guards Signal Battalion * 16th Guards Medical/Sanitation Battalion * 19th Guards Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company * 13th Guards Motor Transport Company (later 220th Motor Transport Battalion) * 4th Guards Field Bakery * 12th Guards Divisional Veterinary Hospital * 112th Field Postal Station * 368th Field Office of the State Bank The 136th had been under command of Col. Nikolai Porfirevich Raevsky but he was replaced on the day of redesignation by Lt. Col. Pyotr Dmitrievich Kondratev. At this time it was in the 18th Army of Southern Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 29 On March 27 the division was further recognized for its service in the Donbass and along the Mius with the award of its first Order of the Red Banner. Operation Blue In April the 15th Guards was moved to the 58th Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. By the start of the German summer offensive in the Caucasus in late June it had been assigned to 28th Army in Southwestern Front and was directly facing the 164 tanks fielded by 3rd Panzer Division of German 6th Army's XXXX Panzer Corps. The five rifle divisions of 28th Army were deployed in a single echelon with three tank brigades (numbering in total about 90 tanks) and the 244th Rifle Division near Valuyki on the Oskol River as Southwestern Front's reserve. Under the weight of the attack which began on June 30 the division, along with the 13th Guards and 169th Rifle Divisions, backed by 13th Tank Corps, managed to hold the advance of the XXXX Panzer to less than 10 km on the first day. However the German XXIX and VIII Army Corps to the north struck more than twice that distance, tearing a yawning gap between 28th and 21st Army. Over the coming days 28th was forced to fall back towards Valuyki, exposing the flank of the 21st to its north. By July 10 the situation had drastically deteriorated and the 28th Army headquarters was forced to report:Over the next three days the Army reported that elements of the divisions made it back safely. However by this time they mustered only 40 to 400 \\"bayonets\\" (riflemen and sappers) each, with only a handful of guns and mortars. Within days the 28th and its depleted units were transferred to the new Stalingrad Front.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 108, 111, 127-30, 134, 180-81 =Battle of Stalingrad= Later that month the 15th Guards was transferred to the 57th Army, commanded by Maj. Gen. F. I. Tolbukhin, still in Stalingrad Front. This Army at the time was very small, consisting of the worn-down 15th, the 38th Rifle Division and the 13th Separate Destroyer (antitank) Brigade. It constituted the Front's reserve and was located in Stalingrad itself but on August 1 as 4th Panzer Army advanced from the southwest towards the city it was ordered to new defensive positions to the south with the division watching a line from Lake Sarpa to Raygorod on the Volga. The following day Lt. Colonel Kondratev handed the command of the division over to his chief of staff, Lt. Col. Andrei Evtikhievich Ovsienko. Under the crisis conditions on August 5 the STAVKA ordered new command arrangements including assigning 15th Guards to 64th Army in the re-created Southwestern Front. On August 9 the division took part in counterattack against XXXXVIII Panzer Corps north and south of Tinguta which struck the 14th Panzer and 29th Panzergrenadier Divisions almost simultaneously from three sides, much to their surprise. During a two-day battle the panzer troops lost heavily and were forced to retreat towards Abganerovo, bringing 4th Panzer Army's advance to a halt and a near collapse.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 276-79, 282, 287-89, 556 Within days the 15th Guards returned to 57th Army which was now substantially reinforced with four more rifle divisions (not including the 38th which remained in 64th Army) and several other units. The Army was assigned the task of defending a 70 km-wide sector from State Farm (Sovkhoz) No. 4 (4 km east of Tinguta) and State Farm \\"Privolzhsky\\" to Raygorod to prevent the Axis forces from penetrating to Stalingrad from the south. 4th Panzer Army renewed its advance on August 20; by now the substantially rebuilt division was in the Army's first echelon with the 36th Guards Rifle Division. Initially the main attack was against 64th Army which was forced back but was still putting up heavy resistance. As a result, on the next day the 14th Panzer shifted to the east the next day, crossed the Malaya Tinguta River and pushed about 4 km to the north, driving a wedge between 64th Army's 38th Division and the 15th Guards. At the same time the 24th Panzer Division struck the center of the division's defenses at the \\"Privolzhsky\\" State Farm and crossed the river farther east. With the assistance of a rifle regiment of the Vinnitsa Infantry School the division managed to withdraw 10 km to take up new defenses stretching westward along the Dubovyi and Morozov ravines from the northwest bank of Lake Sarpa to 74 km Station. As 24th Panzer wheeled to the east towards Tundutovo Station, General Tolbukhin reinforced the division with the fresh 422nd Rifle Division. Between them they brought the German advance to a halt. Despite this stout defense by the evening of August 21 the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps had carved a wedge 15 km wide and 20 km deep between 64th and 57th Armies and threatened to encircle the former from the east. Therefore Southwestern Front sent six antitank artillery regiments to the two Armies, with one to be allocated to each of the front-line divisions.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 306, 365-67 On August 23‚Äì24, 4th Panzer Army again regrouped, lunging northwards early on the 25th along the boundary of the 422nd and the 244th Rifle Divisions and advancing 8 km to the Chervlennaia River. Once there, however, concentrated artillery and mortar fire of the two divisions, joined by 15th Guards coming up from second echelon, separated the German tanks from their infantry, while heavy antitank fire and counterattacks by 6th Tank Brigade destroyed or damaged many panzers. The remainder had no choice but to fall back to their jumping-off positions by the end of August 26.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 368-69 On September 8 Lt. Colonel Ovsienko returned to his chief of staff duties and the division came under the command of Col. Nikolai Ivanovich Telegin. The German 6th and 4th Panzer Armies completed the isolation of 62nd Army in the city by September 12 at which time the 64th and 57th occupied the Beketovka \\"bridgehead\\" along the Volga directly to its south with the 57th southwest of Ivanovka - Tundutovo - the Dubovyi ravine, facing elements of Romanian VI Army Corps.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, p. 104 As the battle raged within Stalingrad during late September and early October the STAVKA planned attacks to its north and south to divert German strength and possibly relieve the siege. A composite detachment made up of two detached rifle regiments (from 422nd and 75th Rifle Divisions) and the 155th Tank Brigade, supported by 1188th Antitank Artillery Regiment plus 18th and 76th Guards Mortar Regiments, was in the sector of the 15th Guards, which was also instructed to provide fire support. This detachment assaulted the positions of the Romanian 1st Infantry Division south of Lake Sarpa overnight on September 28/29. The attack achieved almost immediate success, penetrating the Romanian defenses, advancing roughly 5 km, and liberating the villages of Tsatsa and Semkin by 1400 hours on October 1. As a result of this attack, as well as a similar one by 51st Army, the Romanian VI Army Corps was badly damaged and forced back to even less defensible positions. 15th Guards exploited the victory by capturing the Dubovyi ravine region by the same hour and dug in.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 342-45 Through October a sergeant of the 50th Guards Regiment, Nikolai Yakovlevich Ilyin, continued to build on his already established reputation as an effective sniper. On October 16, as a reward for his skills he was given the use of the sniper rifle that had been used by the late Hero of the Soviet Union Khusen Borezhevich Andrukhaev, who had served in the 733rd Regiment of the 136th Rifle Division.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=2800. In Russian, English translation available. Retrieved November 18, 2019. From October 18 to November 1, fighting mostly in the area of the Dubovyi ravine, Ilyin was credited with 95 kills of Axis soldiers and officers. As the battle continued he increased his count to 216 by February 1943 and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and shortly thereafter was also made a Hero of the Soviet Union.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=2789.

In Russian. Retrieved November 18, 2019 =Operation Uranus= On October 18 Colonel Telegin was replaced by Maj. Gen. Emelyan Ivanovich Vasilenko, who had previously commanded the 136th Rifle Division in 1941. In the buildup to the Soviet counteroffensive the division was transferred to the 51st Army just to the south of the 57th. It began its attack from the Shalimovo region south of Lake Sarpa promptly at 0830 hours on November 20 with tank support and easily penetrated the defenses of Romanian 18th Infantry Division's two defending battalions, sending the survivors scurrying westward and northwestward. Wheeling in the latter direction the guardsmen and tanks advanced up to 11 km by 1800 hours against virtually no opposition and linked up with 57th Army's 143rd Rifle Brigade near the village of Kamensky. This left much of the Romanian 2nd Infantry and about half of 18th Infantry Division encircled and the 15th Guards reported capturing 2,500 men, 500 rifles, 50 machine guns, 15 guns, 13 mortars and other equipment by the end of the day. The encircled force surrendered overnight and left the remainder of the two divisions in a shambles with no further effective combat power.Glantz, Endgame in Stalingrad, Book One, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 66, 89, 254-55, 259 The division spent the morning of November 21 mopping up the encirclement area then reassembled about 12 km southwest of Lake Sarpa before wheeling westward along the route of the 4th Mechanized Corps. This Corps had a shaky start the first day, but made spectacular progress on the second and by day's end had surrounded the remnants of the two Romanian divisions in cooperation with the 15th Guards and 143rd Brigade. This advance also overran most of the Romanian logistic installations north of the Aksai River. On November 23 one of the main tasks for 51st Army was to move the 4th Mechanized northwestward to the Sovetskii region to link up with Southwestern Front's mobile groups. A battalion of the Corps' 59th Mechanized Brigade became involved in heavy fighting on the outskirts of Karpovka which was resolved with the arrival of the division in the evening, as recorded in its history:Other Soviet sources state that the division and the mechanized battalion were forced to abandon Karpovka and Karpovskaia Station due to counterattacks by elements of 29th Panzergrenadier Division during the evening and gradually fall back to positions south of the rail line by nightfall on the 24th.Glantz, Endgame in Stalingrad, Book One, pp. 292, 297, 363-34 By this time the encirclement of the German forces at Stalingrad had been completed. 51st Army was in the difficult position of conducting operations along both the inner and outer encirclement fronts. The division, on the inner front with 4th Mechanized, was fighting for the Marinovka and Voroshilov Camp regions southwest of the pocket. The 4th Mechanized was attempting to encircle and destroy Battlegroup \\"Willig\\" of the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division defending the fortified strongpoint at Marinovka. 15th Guards entered the battle by attacking the sector between Marinovka and Voroshilov but in two days of fighting the Soviet forces were unable to pry their opponents out of their positions. On November 25 the division was transferred back to 57th Army and continued to conduct probing attacks against the German battlegroups defending the rail line and the road between the two strongpoints, with no success. In the following days the situation stabilized.Glantz, Endgame in Stalingrad, Book One, pp. 406-07, 454-55 =Operation Ring= During the first half of December the situation around Stalingrad was dominated by Army Group Don's attempted relief offensive and a proposed effort, Operation Donnerschlag, by the trapped 6th Army to break out. Among the moves made by Don Front to counter the latter the 235th Separate Tank Brigade and 234th Separate Tank Regiment were brought up to support the 15th Guards' positions south of Karpovka on December 20.Glantz, Endgame in Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 349-50 Operation RingOperation Koltso began on January 10, 1943 and on that first day the division, deployed on 57th Army's left flank, seized the first line trenches of the German 376th Infantry Division and followed this on the 13th with a general assault with the 50th and 44th Guards Regiments in the 4 km-wide sector between Staryi Rogachik and Bereslavsky Farm. Attacking eastward the two regiments punched gaping holes through the 376th's defenses and advanced up to 6 km, capturing both positions and reaching the Chervlenaia River. In the process one German battalion was encircled and destroyed in Staryi Rogachik and four more were forced across the river in considerable disorder. By the day's end the remnants of the German division were caught in a large pincer between the 422nd Rifle, 15th Guards and the 120th Rifle Division of the adjacent 21st Army. The attack continued on January 14 and the division, which was already over the Chervlenaia, advanced eastward, captured Peschanyi Karer and reached the railroad 2 km west-northwest of Basargino. By the end of the day the three Soviet divisions had trapped the 376th in the region southwest of Basargino which prompted Army Group Don to note late that evening that \\"376th ID seems to have been broken up.\\" Overnight the remaining men of the division died in place, surrendered or disappeared into the darkness.Glantz, Endgame in Stalingrad, Book Two, pp. 471-73, 479-80 After a pause, Operation Ring resumed on January 18. North of the railroad the 15th Guards shattered the defenses of the escaped remnants of the 376th, by now little more than a reinforced battalion, and took Hill 155.0, 2.5 km northwest of Alekseevka. On January 23 the 422nd and 38th Rifle and 15th Guards advanced east up to 6 km on both sides of the railway, further shattering the 297th Infantry Division and the Romanian 82nd Infantry Regiment. The Soviet force reached positions extending from Poliakovka on the upper Tsaritsa River southeastwards to the western outskirts of Verkhniaia Elshanka. Two days later the three Soviet divisions continued to cooperate in thrusting eastward along the railway into the southern part of the city and seizing Railroad Station No. 2, then wheeling north in pursuit of the withdrawing remnants of IV Army Corps. This advance cut off most of the 297th Infantry leading its commander to seek terms of surrender and by nightfall the 38th Division had him and most of his men in custody.Glantz, Endgame in Stalingrad, Book Two, pp. 512-13, 519, 526 From January 28‚Äì31 the 15th Guards took part in the liquidation of the remaining Axis forces in downtown Stalingrad. On the first day it attacked northward across the Tsaritsa west of the railroad bridge with 38th Division and 143rd Rifle Brigade. In the process they captured the ruins of two hospitals forcing the defending 44th and 371st Infantry Divisions to withdraw up to 1,000m. 15th Guards encircled and seized Hospital No. 1 which included the headquarters of 44th Infantry and captured its commander, Lt. Gen. H.-A. Deboi with several hundred of his men. Attacking abreast from positions from Novoriadskaia Street eastward along Golubinskaia Street to the railroad at Krasnoznamenskaia Street on January 29 along converging axes the 15th Guards, 38th and 422nd Divisions and 143rd Brigade advanced up to 800m and reached positions from Salskaia to the vicinity of Railroad Station No. 1. Collectively during the day the advances of 57th, 64th and 21st Armies broke the back of resistance in 6th Army's southern pocket. The STAVKA was confident enough of the outcome that it released the 57th's headquarters and attached forces to the Reserve to be redeployed to the northwest, while 15th Guards and the remaining units were reassigned to 64th Army.Glantz, Endgame in Stalingrad, Book Two, pp. 546, 550, 552 During January 30 and 31 the division was involved in what was effectively mopping-up operations in the city's center. In the immediate wake of the6th Army's surrender on February 2 the 64th Army was ordered to begin moving north to the Livny region, but this was revoked the next day when the 65th Army was substituted for this deployment. 64th Army was retained at Stalingrad as part of Maj. Gen. N. I. Trufanov's operational group of forces and later the Stalingrad Group of Forces, rebuilding and retraining but also continuing to dig out German die- hards.Glantz, Endgame in Stalingrad, Book Two, pp. 556-57, 565, 574-75 At 1700 hours on February 28 the STAVKA ordered as follows:On April 16, 64th Army became the 7th Guards Army.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, p. 575 At that time the 15th Guards' personnel were noted as being about 50 percent Russian and 50 percent Tajik and other central Asian nationalities.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 595 Battle of Kursk By the middle of May the division had been assigned to the new 24th Guards Rifle Corps with the 36th Guards and 72nd Guards (former 29th) Rifle Divisions. The left flank of 7th Guards Army was the boundary between Voronezh and Southwestern Fronts and 24th Guards Corps was on its Army's left (south) flank. As of July 5 the 15th Guards had a total of 8,684 personnel (832 officers, 2,462, NCOs and 5,390 enlisted) plus 996 horses. For small arms it was armed with 3,778 bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles, 2,408 sub- machine guns, 420 light, 140 heavy and 5 antiaircraft machine guns and 252 antitank rifles. Mortars consisted of 14 50mm, 86 82mm and 27 120mm types. Its artillery equipment was 48 45mm antitank guns, 12 76mm regimental guns, 24 76mm field guns and 12 122mm howitzers. The division was in the Army's second echelon in its second belt of defenses and was acting as the Army's reserve on a frontage of 25 km. In order to reinforce unit boundaries it was ordered to strongly back up the 36th Guards. In late May the 43rd Guards Artillery Regiment was transferred to 36th Guards and that division's second echelon formations were moved closer to the front line, being replaced by the 44th Guards Rifle Regiment. On June 19 there was an extended discussion between Lt. Gen. M. S. Shumilov, commander of 7th Guards Army, and the chief of staff of Voronezh Front on the merits of redeploying a regiment of 213th Rifle Division to replace 44th Guards.Valeriy Zamulin, The Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2018, pp. 31, 34-36, 44-45, 51, 56, 59-62 When the battle began on July 5 the main attacks by Army Detachment Kempf focused on the Army's right flank where it held a bridgehead over the Northern Donets near Belgorod facing the 81st Guards Rifle Division and in the center where it aimed at the junction between the 24th and 25th Guards Rifle Corps. As a result General Shumilov decided to hedge his bets and leave 15th Guards in its reserve positions in case the German force might still strike the boundary between the two Fronts after creating a diversion. Towards the end of the day the Front commander, Army Gen. N. F. Vatutin, ordered the 111th Rifle DivisionZamulin states on separate pages that this division had been in 49th Army or 49th Rifle Corps. In fact it had been in 69th Army: Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 164 to come under command of 7th Guards Army and take over the positions of 15th Guards, thus freeing it and the 213th to act as Shumilov's reserve as part of an active defense. This handover was completed by 0100 hours on July 6; as part of it the division regained control of its 43rd Guards Artillery Regiment.Zamulin, Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, pp. 188-89, 225-26, 247-48 In the afternoon Soviet reconnaissance determined that a significant amount of the armor of 7th Panzer Division had managed to cross the Donets at Solomino and threatened the 73rd and 78th Guards Rifle Divisions of 25th Guards Rifle Corps in the main defensive belt. As insurance against any breakthrough Shumilov moved up the 15th Guards to a line along the Koren River. As part of this move the division came under the command of the same Corps. On the morning of July 7 the reconnaissance battalion of 7th Panzer reported to its headquarters that a strong defensive line along the Koren was being held by fresh troops, which forced that division to change its plans. Led by Tiger I tanks, during the day it gradually created a breach between \\"Batratskaia Dacha\\" State Farm and the village of Miasoedovo. Rather than commit 15th Guards piecemeal in response, Shumilov ordered General Vasilenko to complete a handover to the 270th Rifle Division from the rear, which was not fully accomplished until the evening of July 8.Zamulin, Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, pp. 274-76, 333, 336 =Battle for the Farms= Despite this, during the night of July 7/8 Lt. Col. I. A. Usikov's 44th Guards Regiment was sent forward to engage the reinforced reconnaissance battalion of 7th Panzer. Confused fighting went on all night but by the end of it the 44th Guards Regiment had advanced about 1,000m and its headquarters reported knocking out or capturing two tanks, two halftracks, a 75mm gun and four machine guns as well as finding the bodies of 100 German men and officers. A truck loaded with uniforms and a motorcycle was also taken. Despite these apparent successes Usikov was later criticised for advancing hastily and without reconnaissance and adequate fire support. During July 8 he directed two further efforts to retake \\"Batratskaia Dacha\\" and the \\"Solovev\\" collective farm which failed due to dispersion of effort as well as the previous faults. At 1530 hours General Vasilenko wrote: \\"I decided to halt the attack by the 44th Guards Rifle Regiment until 1920 or the onset of darkness, in order to bring up fire support and prepare concentrated fire from all guns on [the two farms].\\" Furthermore the Voronezh Front headquarters, and through it the STAVKA, believed the two farms were back in Soviet hands. However, as an indication of the pressure on 7th Panzer to regroup and continue its advance it had committed its 58th Panzer Pioneer Battalion into the fighting at \\"Batratskaia Dacha\\" Farm; one of its men was captured and revealed under interrogation at the 15th Guards' headquarters that \\"[h]is company consisting of 120 men had been operating as an infantry unit. In the words of the prisoner, the company has suffered 50% losses.\\"Zamulin, Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, pp. 372-73, 394-95, 397-98 As of the morning of July 9 the 25th Guards Corps had no fewer than six rifle divisions under command, although the 15th Guards and 270th Division were under operational control only and could not be used without permission from General Shumilov. By the next day Gen. W. Kempf was in a hard spot; he was being prodded by Field Marshal E. von Manstein for the slow pace of his advance and was tasked with, among many other objectives, to break through at the boundary of 15th and 94th Guards Rifle Divisions and finally reach the woods east of Miasoedovo. At this point his three panzer divisions had a combined 109 serviceable tanks and assault guns and the panzergrenadiers had also suffered heavy losses. The boundary between the two Soviet divisions was being covered by the 31st Separate Antitank Artillery Brigade, but this was now reduced to 17 45mm and 11 76mm guns.Zamulin, Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, pp. 416, 447-48, 453 Overnight a serious mishap occurred along this boundary due to mistakes made by a number of officers of 94th Guards. 47th Guards Regiment was to replace that Division's 286th Guards Regiment in the northern portion of the Miasoedovo woods. Not only did reconnaissance patrols of 7th Panzer discover the handover was taking place they also discovered a gap left between the two divisions due to failure to follow procedures. Taking advantage, elements of 37th Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion entered the gap and seized three hills. Upon discovering the situation Lt. Col. P. I. Gremaiko, commander of 47th Guards, ordered counterattacks which restored the situation just before noon. Only about two platoons of German infantry were involved in this but they were supported by five medium tanks and one Tiger, all of which were destroyed or knocked out by Gremaiko's forces. By the afternoon the 47th and 50th Guards Regiments had fully moved into the first echelon of 25th Guards Corps' defenses, tying into the 94th Guards Division (which was now under 35th Guards Rifle Corps of 69th Army) on the right and 73rd Guards Division on the left. At about the same time 78th Guards Division began a further effort to retake the two farms which soon ran into trouble due to heavy German fire. General Vasilenko ordered Lt. Colonel Usikov to leave one battalion of his 44th Guards Regiment on defense and attack towards the farms with the other two. Usikov now deployed his fire support effectively and the attack began well, catching units of the 7th Panzer during a redeployment.Zamulin, Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, pp. 473-76 A battery of M-13 Katyusha launchers firing at enemy targets, 1943In the course of an hour the Guardsmen pushed the German grenadiers back 300-500m into the depths of the State Farm before they began to offer strong fire resistance. To prevent the attack from bogging down it was reinforced with a regiment of 73rd Guards Division while the 25th Guards Corps commander ordered the 97th Guards Mortar Regiment to support it with rocket fire. At 1855 hours five launchers fired a salvo of 78 M-13 (4.9 kg of high explosive each) at a concentration of German infantry and armor in the area of the woods 1,000m west of \\"Batratskaia Dacha\\" Farm which \\"blanketed\\" the target. Following this Usikov's men returned to the attack. Almost immediately the left flank of his 2nd Battalion was counterattacked by a German company north of the State Farm. Usikov smoothly deployed the 8th and 9th Companies of the 3rd Battalion which overran the panzergrenadiers. Vasilenko reported: \\"The units with a decisive charge burst into the enemy trenches and tied the Germans up in hand-to-hand combat. The Germans, unable to withstand [this], retreated...\\" By day's end the 44th Guards Regiment had advanced 1.5 km and reached the western outskirts of the State Farm but was unable to take it completely. Usikov reported that in the course of the attack the Regiment had lost 20 men killed and 120 wounded. Two German guns, two vehicles and four machine guns were destroyed, while two machine guns, 12 sub- machine guns, 23 rifles and 500 81mm mortar rounds were captured intact.Zamulin, Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, pp. 476-77 While this was happening, between 1820 and 2100 hours the 47th Guards Regiment repulsed three armored attacks launched by 7th Panzer but after the fourth, under pressure of superior enemy strength, the battalion commanders began to withdraw their companies to reserve positions to the east. Although Lt. Colonel Grimailo's succeeded in tying up the panzers in the woods southeast of Miasoedovo it came at a cost. By dawn on July 11 Grimailo didn't know the location of his 2nd Battalion, which had taken 7th Panzer's main attack. Vasilenko was forced to move up reserve, the divisional training battalion, to the Regiment's right flank. By 0700 communications to the Battalion were restored and its commander reported a serious situation: the whereabouts of more than half the personnel was still unknown; panzers had crushed four 45mm antitank guns;Rifle battalions at this time had two such guns and usually two more assigned from their rifle regiment. See: Gordon L. Rottman, Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, Osprey Publishing, Ltd., Oxford, UK, 2007, p. 15. and almost all the machine guns had been knocked out. During the previous day the 47th Guards Regiment had suffered about 400 casualties. Its limited retreat gave 7th Panzer just enough space to manoeuvre for a further advance against the left flank of 94th Guards Division.Zamulin, Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, pp. 479-80 With the training battalion and what remained of 31st Antitank Brigade forming the boundary with 94th Guards Division it was clear that reinforcements were required, so General Shumilov ordered six KV tanks of the 262nd Heavy Tank Regiment to move up for this purpose. Further tank support in the form of T-34s also arrived in the early afternoon, four of which would substantially strengthen the depleted 47th Guards. However it was the 29 gun crews of 31st Antitank that mainly attracted the attention of 7th Panzer. They were not adequately covered by the infantry of 94th Guards and near noon came under attack by 16 German tanks, most of which were Tigers, and by 1430 hours had been crushed, at the cost of between 20-34 armored vehicles. Once this was accomplished the German division moved a company of tanks to its right flank to contain the 15th Guards while its main forces launched an attack against the left-flank regiment of 94th Guards. The objective of Kempf's III Panzer Corps now was to get into the rear of 69th Army and link up with 4th Panzer Army at Prokhorovka.Zamulin, Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, pp. 492-95 During July 12 General Shumilov sought to distract Kempf's forces from their mission by launching counterattacks towards his forward supply base at Krutoi Log. At this time the 15th Guards was still in good shape with a total of 8,440 men as of the previous morning, but most of the counterattack force was much weaker. According to the plan the division was to launch secondary attacks with 44th and 47th Rifle Regiments and the training battalion against the left flank of the 198th Infantry Division. However, mostly due to a lack of supporting artillery the attack was halted in its tracks within a few hundred metres. By noon the 44th Guards managed to renew its assault and took the \\"Solovev\\" collective farm by 1235 hours; this was especially noted at the headquarters of Army Detachment Kempf where von Manstein was located. At this point the attack stalled again and the Regiment continued to engage in heavy fighting there until late in the evening. During the day the division lost 146 men killed and 881 wounded according to 7th Guards Army records.Zamulin, Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, pp. 530, 532, 539-40, 543, 547, 556, 561 The same evening Hitler announced his decision to end the offensive. Into Ukraine By the beginning of August the 15th Guards had moved to Steppe Front with 7th Guards Army, but was now part of 49th Rifle Corps with 111th Rifle Division.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 195 Later that month both divisions were awarded one of the first honorifics granted by the STAVKA:In October Steppe Front became the 2nd Ukrainian Front and the division was reassigned to the 68th Rifle Corps of 37th Army, before being moved to the 57th Rifle Corps of the same Army a month later.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 280, 308 In January, 37th Army was shifted to 3rd Ukrainian Front and the 15th Guards joined the 82nd Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 48 On January 26, 1944 General Vasilenko was wounded and hospitalized; he was replaced in command by Col. Pyotr Mikhailovich Chirkov. This officer would be promoted to the rank of major general on March 19 and held this position for the duration of the war. During the Nikopol-Krivoi Rog Offensive the division was recognized for its role in the liberation of the latter city with the award of the Order of Suvorov, 2nd degree, on February 26. At the beginning of April as the 37th Army was approaching the Dniestr River and the Romanian border the 15th Guards was the Army's reserve formation. Overnight on April 18/19 the Army was to make a second effort to cross the river and seize German positions near Bender that included the division committed from reserve. In the event the offensive was postponed until April 20 and in heavy fighting over the next five days the Army made no progress whatsoever.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp. 112, 150-51 Despite this failure one soldier of the 44th Guards Regiment managed to burnish his reputation. Sergeant Mikhail Stepanovich Sokhin had begun the sniping \\"movement\\" in his regiment the previous year and had trained many other personnel in sniping tactics. During this battle he had led a party of four across the river without being observed, set up a good position near the front line, and personally accounted for two German officers and three machine gun crewmen, supporting the crossing of the rest of the regiment. By May his score stood at 202 enemy officers and men and on September 13 Sokhin, now a sergeant-major, was made a Hero of the Soviet Union. His final official total was 261 killed, making him the 53rd-highest-scoring Soviet sniper of the war.http://www.wio.ru/galgrnd/sniper/sniperru.htm. In Russian.

During the advance the 50th Guards Rifle Regiment was also awarded an honorific:The 44th Guards Rifle Regiment would later receive the battle honor \\"Silesia\\" while the 43rd Guards Artillery was awarded \\"Oder\\". On January 23 units of the division reached that river in the area from Frauendorf to Zagred about 6 km north of Oppeln. Maj. Mikhail Efimovich Kolosov, commander of the 1st Battalion of the 50th Guards Regiment, ordered an assault team to cross the frozen river which it did almost without a fight, afterwards digging in at a dam. This group was hit by several German counterattacks but threw them back with little difficulty. Meanwhile Kolosov took advantage of this distraction to get the rest of his Battalion over the river. By the dawn of January 24 he had linked up with elements of 47th Guards Regiment to the south, helping to create a bridgehead 5 km wide and 3 km deep which was successfully held for the next two days.

On the same date the 47th Guards Regiment received the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd Degree, for its operations in Silesia. =Lower Silesian Offensive= On the night of January 30/31 the 55th Rifle Corps of 21st Army relieved 34th Guards Corps in its bridgehead between Oppeln and Brieg. Beginning on February 8 the 5th Guards Army took part in the Front's Lower Silesian Offensive with its main objective of encircling the German garrison of Breslau. On its sector the offensive was based on the bridgehead seized by 14th Guards Rifle Division in January. The German defense was based on the 269th Infantry Division with several battlegroups, independent battalions, two panzer battalions and an NCO school. The Army's attack was led by 32nd Guards Rifle Corps and developed slowly over the first three days. On February 11 the Front commander, Marshal I. S. Konev, shifted the 31st Tank Corps from 21st Army and committed it on the sector of 33rd Guards Rifle Corps the next day with the immediate objective of capturing the Bogenau area. Over the next two days the 34th Guards Corps was committed from second echelon and advanced steadily.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 363, 424-26 On February 13 German resistance did not abate and if anything increased as further forces entered the Breslau area but despite this the 4th Guards and 31st Tank Corps linked up with the 7th Guards Mechanized Corps of 6th Army to complete the encirclement. Konev chose to leave 6th Army and 34th Guards Corps to maintain the siege while the 32nd and 33rd Guards Corps of 5th Guards Army were ordered to make a decisive attack from the Magnitz area toward Koberwitz and then to the southwest. By the end of February 15 the cordon between the encircled forces and the main German forces had been widened to up to 13 km. By February 25 the 34th Guards Corps was taken out of the line in the Breslau area.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 428-29, 443 =Upper Silesian Offensive= For this offensive the Corps was used to reinforce the 21st Army while remaining under 5th Guards Army command. The Corps would attack with 4th Guards Tank Corps in the direction of Priborn with the task of reaching a line from Strelen to Munsterberg by the end of the second day. The Corps was reinforced with the 116th Heavy Howitzer and 1st Howitzer Brigades, the 7th Mortar Brigade and the 1073rd Antitank Artillery Regiment. The 15th and 58th Guards Rifle Divisions were in first echelon with the 112th Rifle Division in second. The 15th and 58th each formed a forward detachment consisting of a reinforced rifle battalion. In addition the Corps detached a forward battalion, which went into the attack at 0600 hours on March 15.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 470-71, 479-80 The preliminary attack began after a 10-minute artillery preparation and the infantry assault took the defenders off guard by following very close behind the artillery. The forward battalion, attacking on the left flank, captured the grove 1,000m north of Voigtsdorf. The main Corps attack began at 1120 hours following an additional 80 minutes of artillery fire. 4th Guards Tank was committed to the attack at the same time from the western outskirts of Grottkau. The assault broke through along a 3km front and by the end of the day had widened the gap to 5km and captured the German second line of defenses along the left flank. The advance continued overnight and into the next day, gaining just 3km but also providing flank cover for the mobile forces of 21st and 4th Tank Army which were attacking in the direction of the Neisse River. Beginning from the latter half of March 20 the 34th Guards Rifle and 4th Guards Tank Corps continued to attack to the west, beating off numerous counterattacks and eventually reaching the east bank of the Krin River. The offensive officially ended on March 22, but from the 24th to the 27th the two Corps, joined by 32nd Guards Corps, engaged in a battle for the town of Strelen which was only partially successful before being halted on March 28.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 480, 502, 504, 514, 516-17 =Berlin Operation= Prior to the start of the Berlin offensive the 112th Division was replaced by the 14th Guards Division in 34th Guards Corps. 5th Guards Army was deployed along the eastern bank of the Neisse on a 13km front and planned to launch its main attack with its right wing on the 8km sector from Gross Saerchen to Muskau. While the Corps had its divisions in a single echelon 15th and 58th Guards were in the attack sector while 14th Guards was holding along the river, which was about 50m wide and 2-3m deep at this point.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation 1945, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., ch. 11 When the offensive began on April 16 the 15th Guards was to break through the German defense on a sector from Kobeln to the farm, help to eliminate a German bridgehead on the eastern bank in the Muskau area, then cross the Neisse under the cover of massed artillery fire and capture the northern part of Berg before advancing into the German rear. For this mission the 50th Guards Regiment was supported with a company of tanks, a platoon of self-propelled guns, a sapper company and two batteries from a separate antitank battalion. The 47th Guards Regiment had the same supporting forces less one antitank battery while the 44th Guards Regiment was in the second echelon with orders to assault across the Neisse behind either the 50th Regiment or in the sector of the 58th Guards Division, depending on circumstances. For the crossing the division had gathered 33 boats, two 16-tonne ferries and two 3.5-tonne captured pontoons. In addition each first echelon battalion had one storming bridge and a large number of improvised crossing means had been prepared.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation 1945, Kindle ed., ch. 13 The attack was covered by a powerful artillery preparation under which the Muskau bridgehead was overrun and eliminated. The 50th Guards Regiment reached the river by 0800 hours and completed its crossing to the west bank two hours later. The right flank of the 47th Guards Regiment also reached the river by 0930 while its left flank was still fighting along the northern outskirts of Muskau; despite this at 1100 the Regiment began forcing the river in the area of the farm but was met with heavy German fire and failed to cross. General Chirkov addressed this situation by committing the 44th Guards Regiment into the battle, using the crossings of the 50th Guards Regiment and one crossing of the 58th Guards Division. This Regiment crossed successfully and attacked to the southwest, carrying out the assignment of the 47th Guards Regiment and by noon had begun clearing the north of Berg in conjunction with the 50th Guards Regiment. The 47th Guards Regiment meanwhile detached a company to mop up the Muskau bridgehead while moving into the division's second echelon. During the rest of the day the 15th and 58th Guards Divisions advanced as much as 6km into the German defenses on the west bank and continued to advance through the night, reaching the Wossinka area by 0100 hours on April 17. Later that morning the division crossed over its artillery and helped clear the passage of the 14th Guards by advancing into the rear of the German forces it was facing.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation 1945, Kindle ed., ch. 13 By April 22 the 5th Guards Army was pursuing defeated German forces to the west, destroying rearguards and advancing 30km during the day. 14th Guards was left behind to help guard the south flank of the advance while the 15th and 58th Guards continued attacking towards the Elbe River. On April 25 the 58th Guards Division joined hands with the U.S. 69th Infantry Division at Torgau.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation 1945, Kindle ed., ch. 16 Postwar From May 6-11 the 15th Guards took part, with the rest of 1st Ukrainian Front, in the final offensive on Prague, in recognition of which it received its second honorific:On May 28 the division was further distinguished with the award of its second Order of the Red Banner for its part in the capture of Cottbus and several nearby towns in Germany. Immediately after the war the division did garrison duty in Austria, followed by a move to the northwest Ukrainian cities of Volodymyr-Volynskyi and Liuboml. In late 1947 was moved to Crimea and the Kuban, being redesignated as the 15th Guards Motor Rifle Division in 1957. It September 1965 it was renumbered as the \\"51st\\" and became the 2nd formation of the 51st Guards Motor Rifle Division.

Her research investigates the identification and development of bacteriophages that kill pathogens in an effort to develop new antimicrobials.  Education  Clokie studied biology at the University of Dundee. She graduated in 1996 and moved to Edinburgh, where she started a postgraduate degree in biodiversity. She earned a master's degree at the University of Edinburgh in 1997 and moved to Leicester. Clokie earned her doctoral degree in molecular ecology at the University of Leicester in 2001 for research on the evolution of three genera of plants: Eucryphia, Griselinia and Coriaria.  Research and career  After her PhD, Clokie was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Warwick and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Clokie started her research career investigating the molecular evolution of plants. Clokie joined the University of Leicester as a lecturer in 2007 and was promoted to Professor in 2016. She is interested in viruses known as bacteriophages which can be used to treat disease. Her work involves cyanobacteria and the sequencing of various bacteriophages. She demonstrated that marine phages contain the genes responsible for photosynthesis, and that phages do not only exert pressure on the infection-survival mechanism of cyanobacteria but can acquire the genes of a bacteria's prey. Her research includes identifying specific phage combinations that can be used to destroy Clostridioides difficile Infections (CDI) while maintaining a healthy gut. CDI causes almost two fifths of diarrhoea associated with antibiotics in the Western world, and one in ten of patients die due to a lack of effective treatment. The bacteriophage could reduce the growth of C. difficile and simultaneously defend beneficial bacterial that are typically destroyed by antibiotics. The bacteriophages can be delivered orally and result in destruction of C. difficile within two days. Clokie went on to demonstrate that C. difficile can evolve into a new species, with a specific strand that is adapted to spread quickly in hospitals. The new species survives on the sugar-rich diets of Westerners and can evade common disinfectants. She has also worked on bacteriophages that can be used to prevent bacterial infections in Antheraea assamensis (Muga silkworms). Muga silk is produced in Assam and is one of the most valuable silks in the world. They are at risk from Flacherie, a bacterial disease that is caused by larvae eating infected leaves. Alongside working on silk worms, Clokie has explored the use of phages in the treatment of drug resistant urinary tract infections. She has shown that bacteriophages could be used to treat bacterial disease in pigs. These phages disable the Salmonella bacterial disease that infects pigs and can be added to pig feed. = Selected publications = Her publications include; * Bacteriophages: Methods and Protocols * Phages in nature * Marine cyanophages and light * Bacterial photosynthesis genes in a virus Clokie is founding editor-in-chief of the journal PHAGE: Therapy, Applications and Research. =Awards and honours= Clokie was awarded a Grand Challenges exploration fund award from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This allowed her to investigate bacteriophages that could be used to eradicate Shigellosis. In 2019 Clokie was interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 programme The Life Scientific.

Built in 1916, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. With History Sierra was built at Matthews shipyard in Hoquiam for E. K. Wood Lumber Company and was the first motor ship built on Grays Harbor. The ship's engines were made in Sweden by Bolinder, which sent a representative to oversee their installation. Senator Miles Poindexter attended the ship's launch on August 30, 1916. Its first long voyage was to Valpara√≠so, Chile. Sierra was able to complete the round-trip without refueling. Sierra was used to ferry lumber between Bellingham, Washington and Hoquiam, Washington. In one month in 1920, Sierra carried a shipment of 1,200,000 feet of lumber out of Bellingham. On Feb 7, 1923, Sierra was badly damaged after colliding with the steamship Wilhemina in dense fog near San Francisco; damages were estimated at $135,000. In 1926, Sierra caught fire at Berth 77 in the Port of Los Angeles, the first fire fought by the fireboat Los Angeles City No. 2. Sierra was sold in 1927 and equipped with refrigeration equipment to carry reindeer meat from Alaska for the Arctic Transport Company. During World War II, the U.S. Army operated Sierra as a training ship. After the war, Sierra was assigned to the Maritime Commission reserve fleet at Olympia, Washington, then later sold and transferred to Lake Union. In 1964, the new owner began restoring Sierra to its original, lumber-carrying configuration.

She served the United States Atlantic Fleet and saw service in World War I.  Construction and commissioning  Patapsco was a two-masted, steel-hulled, sea-going tug, laid down on 15 April 1907 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, and launched on 29 June 1908. She was commissioned on 27 July 1909 as USS Patapsco (Fleet Tug No. 10).  United States Navy service  Prior to the outbreak of World War I, Patapsco operated off the eastern seaboard as a tender for the Atlantic Fleet. Then, for the first months of the war, she served with Mine Squadron 1 as nets were planted and mine experiments carried out. In November 1917, as plans for a mine barrage across the North Sea necessitated a drastic increase in trained mine personnel, a training camp was established at Newport, Rhode Island, and Patapsco included seamanship training duties in her schedule. In early spring 1918, new ships were added as the squadron prepared for overseas deployment. Patapsco, with Patuxent (Tug No. 11), sailed early to escort submarine chasers to Brest, whence they steamed to Naval Base 18, Inverness, Scotland, arriving 24 June. For the remainder of the war she remained in the area, inspecting mine fields and keeping up communications between mine bases. Following the Armistice, Patapsco, again with Patuxent, conducted experiments to develop the gear and techniques to sweep the North Sea Mine Barrage. In December, she accompanied wooden vessels to the barrage to determine the effectiveness of the remaining mines, and found most still \\"live\\". Experimental activities and tender duties continued through the winter months, and in March 1919 Patapsco and Patuxent tested \\"electrical protective devices\\" to render mine exploders ineffective. On the 22nd she arrived off the mined area, which stretched between the Orkney Islands and the Norwegian coast. By afternoon the devices' efficacy had been proven, but other problems were discovered, among them the danger of countermined mines. On the last sweep of the day Patapsco exploded an upper level mine. Two lower-level mines were detonated by the first, one directly beneath Patuxent. Damage to the latter was repaired quickly, and both vessels soon returned to the barrage for experiments to minimize the danger of countermining. In April the base of operations was moved to Kirkwall. At the end of the month minesweeping operations began. On 9 July 1919, during the fourth operation, Patapsco fell victim to the danger she had worked against. Three low-level mines, countermined, exploded beneath her. Luckily, and unlike six other vessels mined that day, the tug's damage was minimal. Patapsco continued operations with the North Sea Minesweeping Detachment until 25 November, then after availability in England, sailed for the United States. In January 1920, she reported to the First Naval District at Boston, for a -year tour. Thence, in July 1922, she sailed south to Santo Domingo where she remained as tender until the summer of 1924. Returning to the east coast, she entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for inactivation, decommissioning on 16 January 1925.  Final disposition  Patapsco remained in reserve at Norfolk until stricken from the Navy List on 4 March 1936. Her hull was sold for scrapping on 18 June 1936, to the Boston Iron and Metal Co., Baltimore, Maryland. She was not immediately scrapped, however, and remained intact at the facility through 1940. It is believed that scrapping of the vessel was completed the following year.

Background Following Syrian government victories in 2018 during the siege of Eastern Ghouta, the Southern Damascus offensive, and the completion of rebel evacuations from eastern Qalamoun‚Äîwhich partially concluded the government's Rif Dimashq Governorate campaign‚Äîparts of northwestern Syria in the Idlib and Aleppo Governorates became the only significant opposition-controlled territory. Fighters of the Syrian National Army loyal to the Syrian Interim Government (concentrated in Aleppo) and some 20,000 fighters aligned with the internationally proscribed terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and loyal to the Syrian Salvation Government (concentrated in Idlib - see National Front for Liberation‚ÄìTahrir al-Sham conflict) held out against the government and its allies, with a civilian population of three million living in the area. According to a Reuters analysis, the January 2019 takeover of Idlib by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham ended any realistic prospect of fulfilling the requirements of the 2018 Turko- Russian Agreement, which called for the disarming of the jihadist faction and reopening of the strategic M4 and M5 highways. The offensive that began in December 2019 was aimed at reopening the highways to civilian traffic, as well as the final elimination of rebel control over the territory. Prelude On 20 November 2019, Qah was struck by a ground-to-ground missile from the Assad regime with Russian and Iranian support. It killed at least 16 people. The United States strongly condemned the attack. On 24 November 2019, pro-Syrian government forces, supported by Russian airstrikes, entered the villages of Umm Elkhalayel, Zarzur, al-Sayeer and Msheirfeh, causing dozens of casualties on both sides. The next day, a second advance was attempted by government forces targeting the village of al-Farjah, which Syrian state media reported as being under the control of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On 26 November, opposition media reported that the rebel \\"Fatah Mubieen Operations Room\\" repelled another attempted government advance on the Sahel village in Idlib's southeastern countryside. On 28 November, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham announced repelling a joint Iranian militia-Syrian advance on Kabani in northeastern Latakia Governorate, with pro-government forces withdrawing after hours of clashes. Russian warplanes were also reportedly seen during the assault, according to opposition sources. On 30 November, HTS and other rebel groups reportedly captured several villages near the Abu al-Duhur Military Airbase, according to pro-government sources. On 1 December, according to government sources, HTS, the Turkish-backed National Front for Liberation (NFL), Ajnad al-Kavkaz, and Ansar al-Tawhid attacked government-controlled villages, with fierce clashes occurring in the towns of Establat and Rassem Wared in which two tanks and five transport vehicles were reportedly destroyed; during the rebel advance, the Syrian military said it destroyed two SVBIEDs (suicide car bombs) near the town of Kafriya. The joint rebel offensive was ultimately repelled. On 4 December, clashes occurred as the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) seized a military base east of Umm al-Tinah village. On 9 December, pro-government sources reported that the military bombarded rebel-held areas in the southern Idlib countryside, as well as portions of the western Aleppo countryside and parts of Aleppo city's outskirts. The offensive Pro-government airstrikes began to intensify on 15 December 2019.Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, 28 January 2020 Meanwhile, on 17 December, Russian intelligence reported that 300 fighters from the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) arrived in Idlib from Afrin in preparation for renewed fighting. Following the air bombing campaign and after the 14th round of negotiations in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan ended a few days prior without any definitive ceasefire agreement, ground fighting resumed on 18 December, reportedly due to the opposition's refusal to accept new Russian terms regarding control of Idlib. As many as 200 Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and Guardians of Religion Organization fighters jointly attacked Syrian government forces in the Umm al Khalakhil and Zarzur fronts. The Syrian military said they had repelled all attacks and that 12 pro-government fighters were injured and hospitalized. By the end of the month, hundreds of SNA fighters (two brigades) were transferred to Idlib as a result of an agreement with HTS, which had previously blocked the entry of SNA combatants. =Opening advances= On 19 December, pro-government media reported that the Syrian government had initiated the \\"second phase\\" of Operation Dawn of Idlib, the prior government offensive in summer 2019, with pro-government forces led by the 25th Special Mission Forces Division (formerly known as the Tiger Forces) attacking several villages in southeastern Idlib Governorate, particularly along the Umm Jalal axis. A Syrian military source said the objective of the operation was to capture territory south of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man, a key rebel stronghold on the M5 highway. There were Russian airstrikes on Tal Mardikh in the eastern Idlib countryside and the village of Marshamarin in southern Idlib, and government helicopter barrel bomb attacks on Jarjnaz and al- Ghadfah, as well as bombing of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man. 80 people were reported killed on both sides on 20‚Äì21 December, including in heavy air strikes on Ma'arrat al-Nu'man and Saraqib. Russia reported that 17 Syrian soldiers were killed. On 21 December, according to pro-government sources, several pro- government fighters were killed in an ambush by the NFL in Latakia, with several light weapons also captured. Meanwhile, HTS claimed a suicide attack in the village of al-Furqa, southeast of Idlib, which reportedly killed 30 Syrian government fighters. By 22 December, government forces spearheaded by the 5th Corps and the 25th Special Mission Forces Division had made notable advances in the southeastern Idlib countryside, battling rebel units in the area and reportedly capturing over 15 towns and villages within a 48-hour period. According to front line reports, the SAA death toll had risen to 40, with over 50 wounded. An SAA source said the rebels had suffered 70‚Äì80 dead. During its advance, the Syrian army began encircling the Turkish observation point near Sarman. Government sources reported the death of Colonel Basil Ali Khaddour, the commander of the sixth regiment of the 25th Special Mission Forces Division, while opposition media reported several of the Division's members killed. On 23 December, the Syrian army advanced further, completely surrounding the Turkish observation point near Sarman and capturing Jarjnaz, considered the largest town in the eastern countryside of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man. On 24 December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and other opposition elements launched a morning counterattack to retake Jarjnaz, recapturing the villages of Tell Mannas, al-Barsah, Farwan, and al-Ghadfah in the process, according to SOHR; an SVBIED was deployed and attacked pro-government forces in Jarjnaz. By 24 December, 30,000 people had fled from the areas around Ma'arrat al-Nu'man while airstrikes on the M5 highway reportedly targeted civilians fleeing north from the front lines. Pro-government media reported that HTS withdrew from its defensive positions in and around Ma‚Äôarat Al-Nu‚Äôman as well as other defensive positions in the southern Idlib countryside, handing control over to Ansar al- Tawhid, part of the Rouse the Believers Operations Room. The Deputy Defense Minister of the Syrian Interim Government said that HTS had blocked reinforcements sent by the SNA from areas in northern Aleppo such as Afrin and further alleged that the only SNA factions allowed into Idlib by HTS were the Levant Front, Ahrar al-Sharqiya and the Lions of the East Army. HTS denied the claims. On 25 December, the Russian Air Force reportedly bombed a military convoy of Ahrar al-Sham moving near the town of Kafr Nabl in southern Idlib, killing an unknown number of its field commanders and militants. On 26 December, ground advancements largely halted and both sides began shelling each other's positions around Ma'arrat Al-Nu‚Äôman, with casualties reported on both sides. Pro-government forces began shelling the rebel-held towns of Bernan, Farwan, Barissa, and Halban. Both government and opposition factions later reported that they paused their field operations in the Idlib region due to poor weather conditions. According to a Syrian army source, the air force was temporarily grounded because of limited visibility. The NFL reportedly planned to launch a counterattack, but it was also called off due to poor weather conditions. Instead, they brought reinforcements to their positions. The government offensive was condemned by world leaders, including United States president Donald Trump, who tweeted that \\"Russia, Syria, and Iran are killing, or on their way to killing, thousands of innocent civilians in Idlib province.\\" By this stage, United Nations agencies were reporting that \\"mass evacuations\\" of pro-opposition families from front line areas \\"have left behind a landscape of ghost towns\\". =Russia‚ÄìTurkey ceasefire= According to a Russian major-general, a ceasefire was agreed with Turkey, which supported many of the rebel factions in the area, between late December 2019 and early January 2020; the ceasefire was introduced in the Idlib de-escalation zone on 9 January 2020. Turkey had sent a delegation to Moscow to establish a new ceasefire in the region. Turkey's defense ministry announced that the ceasefire would take effect on 12 January and said that Syrian and Russian land and air attacks would halt at one minute past midnight. The ceasefire was set to stem the flow of refugees from Idlib and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to the region. On 11 January 2020, a day before the brokered ceasefire went into effect, Ansar al-Tawhid released a video of a mechanized attack against government positions in southeastern Idlib using heavy machine guns previously captured from the Syrian army. The group also reportedly ambushed a vehicle carrying government officers and successfully captured a position from government forces, seizing some small arms in the process. =Post-ceasefire advances= Late on 15 January, post-ceasefire, the Syrian Arab Army and its allies resumed offensive actions in southern Idlib in response to a prior series of apparent ceasefire violations by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and other militant groups. The Syrian Army captured the villages of Barsah and Nouhiya, located west of the Abu al-Duhur Military Airbase. On 16 January, the Syrian army captured three towns in southeast Idlib after troops stormed the towns of Talkhatra, Abu Jurayf and Khirbat Dawud in the morning. The three towns were secured following several hours of clashes that killed 22 militants, including 16 jihadists, according to SOHR. HTS and its allies claimed to recapture Abu Jurayf in a counterattack that killed more than ten Syrian troops, due to the SAA failing to secure the town after initially storming it. On 17 January, the rebels captured Tal Musaytif from government forces, according to SOHR. Russia's defense ministry stated that a major clash had occurred on the evening of 22 January between Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) forces‚Äîbacked by 20 cars, tanks and two armored vehicles‚Äîand Syrian government forces. The ministry and Syrian state media added that the militants also used attack drones and car bombs and that the assault pushed the SAA out of two settlements in Idlib. The clashes reportedly left up to 50 fighters killed and 90 wounded while government forces lost 40 dead and 80 wounded. An NFL spokesman said the assault had taken place earlier in the week. A Syrian military source was cited as saying army units were redeployed to the area and eventually repelled the attacks \\"with high efficiency\\". However, a \\"field source\\" in Hama quoted by pro-government media said he was not aware of any significant attack near the front lines and that rebels were mostly using artillery and rockets to strike the SAA's positions in the de- escalation zone. On the same day the Rouse the Believers Operations Room released photos of captured equipment and also released a photo of a pro- government fighter's German Identification card. The coalition also released video footage of mortar attacks against the government. =Capture of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man= After a short lull, and after the Russia-Turkey ceasefire failed to materialize, the Syrian Arab Army renewed its ground offensive towards Ma'arrat al-Nu'man on 24 January, assisted by massive airstrikes. Ma'arrat al- Nu'man was of both strategic and symbolic importance due to its location on the strategic Aleppo-Damascus highway/motorway (M5)‚Äîone of Syria's economic arteries‚Äîand that it was a major center for anti-government protests against Assad's rule since the civil war began in 2011. Led by the 4th Armored Division, the Syrian army also launched new ground operations on the Aleppo axis on 25 January, opening with a massive artillery barrage on rebel defenses in the western Aleppo outskirts, spanning from the Al-Zahra'a Association Quarter to Rashiddeen 3 and 4 suburbs. The 4th Division conducted an armored assault on rebel defense lines near the Great Prophet Mosque, the local scientific research building, and Rashidden 3 suburb, but did not make any significant gains. Between 24 and 26 January, the Syrian army captured eight towns and villages in the Ma'arrat al-Nu'man countryside, including Tell Mannas, Ghadqa, and Maar Shamshah, and captured a section of the M5 highway north of the stronghold, cutting a major rebel communication and supply line from Idlib. According to SOHR, by 26 January, Russia had conducted 78 airstrikes targeting front lines around Ma'arrat al-Nu'man, south of Aleppo, and in the western countryside while Syrian helicopters reportedly deployed 52 barrel bombs in rural areas. According to opposition activists and paramedics, Ma'arrat al-Nu'man was almost empty of its 110,000 civilian residents as a result of the intense government bombardment in prior weeks which displaced hundreds of thousands, many of which fled north towards the border with Turkey. By the end of 26 January, the SAA was less than a kilometer from the city. On 27 January, heavy clashes continued as government forces reached the eastern, northern and southern outskirts of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man, nearly encircling it. The 25th Special Mission Forces Division reportedly overran rebel defenses on the city's southern flank, capturing several towns and villages, including Sahyan, Kafr Basin, and Muqah, and capturing the majority of the M5 highway located south of the metro, except for the Turkish observation post at Maar Hattat. According to SOHR, pro-government forces were besieging Ma'arrat al-Nu'man from three sides and had captured 22 areas since 24 January; SOHR recorded 91 deaths among pro-government forces and 112 among the rebels, including 89 jihadists, since 24 January. On the Aleppo front, there were reports in pro-government media of an ongoing battle near Khan Tuman between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Syrian army, assisted by the National Defence Forces (NDF). The army attempted to capture the village after they seized several hills to its northeast. The Syrian Armed Forces' official statement on the capture of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man On 28 January, the Syrian Arab Army and allies captured Kafr Rumah and the Wadi Deif military base following token rebel resistance. Pro-government forces subsequently stormed Ma'arrat al-Nu'man from three fronts, entering the city and capturing most of its districts after short clashes, according to Syrian state media. A Syrian military source said HTS and allied rebels mostly withdrew from the stronghold the day before, neglecting to defend the city proper, besides a small garrison. It was the first time Syrian government forces had control of the city since losing it on 10 October 2012. Rebel units subsequently counterattacked pro-government forces in the vicinity of the stronghold. SOHR said that at least 147 pro-government fighters and 151 opposition fighters were killed in the battle. The SAA continued to push west of Ma'arrat al- Nu'man, reportedly capturing Hantutin. Meanwhile, the SAA reported it had reached the outskirts of Khan Tuman after capturing the last hills to its east during repeated assaults spearheaded by the Republican Guard's 30th Division. On 29 January, following the latest army advances, the SOHR reported that 57% of the Idlib Governorate remained under rebel control, while the other 43% was controlled by government forces. It stated that the Syrian Army had managed to capture over 40 kilometers of the M5 highway and only a 25-kilometer stretch held by rebel forces was preventing it from controlling the highway in its entirety. It also reported a government advance on the outskirts of Aleppo, but stated that it did not hold strategic significance. Al-Masdar News reported that the Syrian Army had secured Ma'arrat al-Nu'man's flanks and further captured the town of al-Harradah. An armed rebel group reportedly stormed Idlib Central Hospital, occupying it for military purposes for a few hours while Al-Shami Hospital in Ariha was reportedly struck by multiple airstrikes. Government forces also advanced towards Aleppo's western suburbs to push rebels away from the city. The army reported a breakthrough in the Rashideen 5 suburb of Aleppo and advanced toward Rashideen 4, stating this advance was the first major SAA breakthrough on the previously deadlocked Aleppo front. A number of Hezbollah fighters were reported killed in this stage of the offensive. On 24 January, Jaafar al Sadiq, a Hezbollah commander, was reported killed; on 27 January, three more fighters' deaths in the Aleppo countryside were announced; a fifth Hezbollah death, in al-Zahraa, was subsequently announced. =Army push towards Saraqib= On 30 January, the Syrian army reached the outskirts of the opposition stronghold of Saraqib, north of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man, after capturing the towns of Kafr Battikh, Tell Mardikh, Jobas, Qomhane, Hatamiyeh and Tell Dibs, pushing the front line three kilometers away from Saraqib's city center. Later in the day, the army advanced further in the southeastern Idlib countryside, capturing the al- Suater hilltop from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its allies. Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan threatened to take direct military action in Idlib unless the government-led offensive ceased. On the Aleppo front, HTS detonated a remote control car bomb and deployed SVBIEDs followed by rocket and mortar attacks into the northwestern Aleppo outskirts against Syrian government positions, opening a new front. The HTS-linked Ebaa News Agency released footage of HTS inghimasi fighters pledging to wage jihad until death before deploying for Aleppo to attack pro-government positions. Syrian state media claimed government forces destroyed four SVBIEDs before they reached their destination. HTS also claimed to have killed a number of Iranian-linked militia fighters in west Aleppo. Meanwhile, according to pro-government sources, the remnant Nour al-Din al-Zenki rebel group, operating from Turkish- backed opposition-held areas in northern Aleppo, sent reinforcements to the western Aleppo countryside to help bolster area defenses. 29-31 January saw sustained bombardments as the government and its allies carried out 200 strikes throughout Idlib; Russian airstrikes on Ariha reportedly struck a bakery and a medical facility. Civilians displaced from Saraqib and other towns were also reportedly targeted as they fled the war zone. On 1 February, in response to government gains on the ground, the Turkish military established three new observation posts around Saraqib. On the same day, pro- government warplanes reportedly targeted al-Huda Hospital in the town of Hoor in the western countryside of Aleppo, destroying large parts of the building. There was an HTS counter-offensive in Al-Zahraa in Aleppo governorate, in which several Local Defense Force (LDF) pro-government militia fighters were reported killed. Four Russian FSB officers were reported killed the same day, also in the Aleppo countryside. On 2 February, fighting was reported between HTS and the LDF-affiliated Iranian-backed Baqir Brigade in the Aleppo countryside, in which a Brigade commander, Juma al Ahmad, was reported killed. An Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force commander, Asghar Pashapour, was killed the same day in the Aleppo countryside. On 3 February, Syrian and Turkish forces exchanged fire in Idlib, Latakia and the northern Aleppo countryside. Turkey and the SOHR reported seven Turkish soldiers, one civilian contractor, and 13 Syrian soldiers were killed. Turkey said it had carried out retaliation strikes south of Saraqib, and witnesses reported artillery shelling and one F16 entering Syrian airspace. According to SOHR, at least 13 Syrian soldiers were killed (with other monitors giving similar numbers), while according to the Turkish president 30-35 were killed and according to Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar 76 Syrian soldiers were \\"neutralized\\" and 57 Syrian military sites were bombed. Russia denied that any airstrikes had occurred at all and the Russian Reconciliation Center for Syria and Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) denied Turkish claims of casualties among Syrian troops. Turkey's president Erdogan described the attack on Turkish forces a \\"turning point in Syria for Turkey\\". He gave the Syrian government a deadline of the end of February to withdraw from the de-escalation zone and demanded that Russian forces in Idlib \\"stand aside\\"; he nevertheless dismissed the possibility of direct conflict with Russia saying Turkey and Russia would talk about the issue \\"without anger\\". Despite the Turkish operations, Syrian government forces continued its offensive in the southeastern part of Idlib Governorate and captured the villages of Ballisa, Tell Elaghar, an abandoned Air Defense base, Jadida Tal Khatra, Msheirfeh, Mardikh and Tell Mardikh on the same day. With this advance, the Syrian Army had captured 22 villages and towns including 110 square kilometers of territory. On the same day, according to medics and the SOHR, government airstrikes targeted civilian IDPs on the road near the village of Kafr Naya in the Aleppo countryside. The next day, Russian warplanes reportedly struck the Sarmin Health Center, leading to the almost complete destruction of the building. =Siege and capture of Saraqib= On 5 February, government forces captured around 20 settlements, including Resafah and several nearby villages, advancing east and north of Saraqib, isolating it from three directions. On 6 February, a pro-government blog reported that pro-government forces seized the area of Duwayr, cutting off the M5 highway north of Saraqib and leaving only the road through Sarmin open, which itself was under constant fire from the army. Later in the day, the 25th Special Mission Forces Division captured the town of Afs, fully encircling Saraqib and all rebel and Turkish forces stationed there, including the four recently established Turkish observation posts, and entered the city. By 7 February, after two days of siege, government forces took most of the city, opening the road towards the city of Idlib. Enab Baladi reported that seven Turkish soldiers were killed while Turkey repeated its end-of-February deadline for the Syrian government to withdraw from the de-escalation zone. Meanwhile, prominent rebel commander Obada Abu Jafar and eight other militants of an elite Ansar al-Tawhid unit were killed in fierce clashes with the Syrian Army while defending their positions in southern Idlib, according to a pro- government blog. On the same day, Israeli warplanes fired missiles near Damascus while targeting Iranian elements in the area. The Syrian government said Israel intended to \\"save the armed terrorist organisations which ha[d] been collapsing in Idlib and western Aleppo Governorate in front of the strikes of the Syrian Army\\". =Army captures the M5 highway and continued Turkish clashes= On 7 February, the Syrian army, spearheaded by the 25th Special Forces Division and assisted by the Republican Guard and Hezbollah, made further advances, reportedly capturing the towns of Zaytan, Birnah, Makhalah and Huwayyir al-Eis in the southwestern Aleppo countryside and the towns of Maharim, Khawari, Tall al-Nabariz, Ijaz, Rasm al-Ward and Abbad in southeast Idlib. The 25th Special Forces Division also captured the towns of Karrathin, al-Dahiriyah and al-Thuriyah as well as the Ebla University complex on the administrative border between southeast Idlib and southwest Aleppo by the end of the day. On 8 February, the army reportedly captured several sites along the strategic M5 highway as it advanced north of Saraqib. Government forces also reportedly crossed the M5 highway and entered the southwestern countryside of the Aleppo Governorate, the first time since 2013, from the southern approach. On the northern approach, the army advanced on the town of Al-Eiss, capturing the towns of Maryudah, Tell Bajir, Kusiniya, al-Shiekh Ahmad, Abu Kannseh, Umm Atabah, Rasm al-Eis, Rasm al-Saharij and Jub Kas in the process. According to pro-government activists, Al-Eiss also hosted a Turkish observation post. The army subsequently captured Al-Eiss and the nearby hilltop. Pro-government forces later captured the town of Tell Hadiyah in the area while, on the Idlib front, continued their northern advance along the M5, capturing the town of Talhiyah. Meanwhile, Russian-Turkish talks in Ankara concluded after three hours with no progress made. On 9 February, in Idlib, pro-government sources said the army captured the towns of Buwaybiyah and al-Kusaybiyah as well as the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) research center. Army units stormed and captured the towns of Barqum, al-Zarbah and al-Salehiyah along the M5. On the Aleppo front, pro-government forces captured the areas of Tal Kalariyah and Kalariyah and advanced on rebel positions in the Rashideen 4 district in west Aleppo. On 10 February, Syrian government forces shelled a recently built Turkish observation post at Taftanaz Military Airbase, killing five Turkish soldiers, according to the Turkish Defense Ministry. According to the SOHR and other sources, six Turkish soldiers and four Syrian rebels were killed in the attack. The attack destroyed military hardware and supplies including trucks, APCs and a main battle tank. The Turkish Ministry of Defense said, but did not provide evidence, that 115 Syrian army sites and positions were targeted in retaliation, including destroying three tanks and two mortar positions, and that 101 Syrian soldiers were \\"neutralized\\". Meanwhile, the Syrian army moved west from the M5 highway towards the Turkish border, led by the 25th Special Mission Forces Division, captured the towns of Kafr Halab, Meznaz, and another town from HTS and the NFL northeast of the ICARDA center, according to pro- government media, in an attempt to split the northern and southern parts of Idlib into separate pockets. On the night of 10‚Äì11 February, there were pro- government airstrikes on several towns in Idlib and Aleppo, killing at least 13 civilians while a maternity hospital in Atarib was narrowly missed by government bombs and a health facility in Maret al-Nasan was destroyed in shelling, according to NGOs. An IDP camp in Kafr Aruq was also struck, killing a child, according to the United Nations. On 11 February, after asserting control over the Rashideen 4 district in western Aleppo and virtually converging the northern and southern front lines in the countryside, it was widely reported that government forces controlled the entirety of the M5 highway for the first time since 2012; however, this was not claimed by government media and opposition sources said fighting continued in some northern areas. A report on a Russian TV channel showed 25th Special Mission Forces Division troops, apparently wearing UNICEF backpacks distributed as relief supplies, entering Kafr Halab; The Daily Telegraph reported the troops were deliberately shooting elderly civilians there. On the same day, rebel groups launched a counteroffensive on the town of Nayrab, located west of Saraqib and south of Sarmin. Turkey claimed that 51 government fighters were killed in the rebel counteroffensive, and Turkish-backed rebel forces shot down a Syrian Mil Mi-17 helicopter, killing all on board. Rebels were also reported to retake the town of Sheikh Dames, 20 miles south of Idlib city. Later that day, the SAA captured Khan al-Asal, a key location on the M5 highway. That night, the NGO Action on Armed Violence reported that airstrikes on Idlib city left 12 civilians (half of them children) dead and 32 injured; government airstrikes on Darat Izza narrowly missed a hospital according to another NGO. By this point, according to Reuters, the government had taken 600 square kilometers (230 square miles) of territory in the offensive, and 700,000 people, mostly women and children, had been displaced‚Äîthe largest number in a single period since fighting began in 2012 according to the UN‚Äîwhile 200 had been killed. On 12 February, Turkey's president Erdogan announced: \\"I hereby declare that we will strike regime forces everywhere from now on regardless of the [2018] deal if any tiny bit of harm is dealt to our soldiers at observation posts or elsewhere.\\" By this stage, Turkey had stationed 30,000 troops at the Syrian border, and sent 5,000 reinforcements to Idlib, bringing the total to 9,000, as well as establishing new defensive positions around Idlib city. On 13 February, heavy bombardment and ground clashes forced the World Food Programme to pause their on-going relief efforts in Idlib, with Atareb especially severely affected. The town of Takad was shelled by government forces for the first of many times, causing residents to flee, according to MSF. The SAA, alongside the auxiliary Local Defense Forces and Liwa al-Quds, advanced north of Az Zarbah and captured Rif Muhandiseen and Kafr Jum along with several surrounding tactical points on the approach to the strategic Regiment 46 base, also known as Base 46, which fell to rebel forces in November 2012. Another army unit reportedly made a push on a separate axis in Aleppo. On 14 February, a second Syrian Mil Mi-17 helicopter was shot down with a guided missile near Qubtan al-Jabal, killing its crew. According to an activist, the helicopter was shot down after dropping two barrel bombs. Between 14‚Äì15 February, pro-government shelling struck IDP camps located around the town of Sarmada, according to the UN and MSF. During 13‚Äì16 February, the UN reported that 160,000 people fled from advancing front lines, mostly from Atareb and Darat Izza sub-districts. The UN said a total of 100 civilians had been killed in the first two weeks of February by both air and ground-based strikes. =Western Aleppo assault and rebel retreat= Following the complete capture of the strategic M5 highway, the Syrian army shifted its momentum towards securing Greater Aleppo, particularly the city's western outskirts. Among opposition settlements targeted by airstrikes in this period were Turmanin, al-Dana, Kabtan al Jabal, al-Abzimo and Darat Izza. On 15 February, the army attacked opposition forces in the northern Aleppo countryside in Sheikh Aqil near Darat Izza from Bashmara, territory under joint Rojava and SAA control. On 16 February, pro-government forces achieved a major breakthrough on the Aleppo front by capturing more than 30 villages, towns and suburbs in the west Aleppo countryside in a single day amidst a sudden collapse in rebel defense lines. By the evening, government forces, backed by continued Russian airstrikes, had managed to capture the last remaining rebel-held areas in Aleppo's western periphery, including towns and cities such as Haritan and Anadan, effectively concluding the period of intermittent clashes in the area that began with the Battle of Aleppo over seven years prior. Pro-government media reported that after having many of their supply lines cut off, rebel forces fled west to avoid being encircled by the SAA, thus leaving the army in control of the Greater Aleppo area. Meanwhile, Turkish media reported that a 100-vehicle convoy of reinforcements, including troops, tanks and other military vehicles and equipment, had been deployed to the Idlib area. HTS claimed a suicide attack on Russian positions in Kafr Halab. On 17 February, President Bashar al-Assad addressed the nation in a rare televised speech, saying the military operations in Aleppo and Idlib governorates would continue regardless of Turkey's threats, and that the war was not yet over \\"but it means that we rubbed their noses in the dirt as a prelude for complete victory\\". Syrian state media also shared images of Aleppo residents apparently celebrating the recent advances, which reportedly pushed rebel mortar teams out of adequate firing range of the city for the first time in years and, along with the capture of the M5, was set to facilitate future civilian movement between northern and southern Syria up to pre-war levels. Meanwhile, according to NGOs, government forces bombed hospitals in Darat Izza. Frontline advances, 24 January‚Äì19 February 2020 On 19 February, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan announced that a Turkish intervention in Idlib was just \\"a matter of time\\".

While government forces made territorial gains in southern Idlib and northern Hama, opposition factions with support from Turkish elements had counterattacked on a separate front towards Saraqib and, on the dawn of 27 February, fully recaptured the strategic city and cut the Damascus-Aleppo M5 highway once again. The counterattack also lifted the encirclement of the four Turkish observation posts established around the city's perimeter.

Meanwhile, Reuters cited witnesses as saying the government resumed airstrikes on residential areas of Idlib city the same evening. On 28 February, Turkey said it retaliated for the Balyun strikes by striking 200 Syrian government targets and \\"neutralizing\\" 309 soldiers in a dedicated operation throughout Greater Idlib. Turkish drone and artillery strikes on Syrian army positions in the east and south of the governorate were reported to have targeted helicopters, tanks, armoured vehicles, howitzers, ammunition trucks and ammunition depots. In contrast to Turkish numbers, the SOHR reported that 34 Syrian soldiers and 14 Hezbollah fighters (10 Lebanese nationals and four of other nationalities, including at least one Iranian) and an officer of the IRGC were killed by the Turkish counterattack. Hezbollah later confirmed eight of the deaths, including an Iranian cleric identified as Sayyed Ali Zengani, while pro- government media also reported Hezbollah deaths.

Stoltenberg also urged Russia and the Syrian government \\"to stop the indiscriminate air attacks\\" and to engage with UN-led peace efforts, while the UN expressed concern at the developments. Turkey further escalated regional tensions when it threatened to open its borders with Europe to allow Syrian refugees to leave, prompting Greece and Bulgaria to tighten border security. The UN Secretary-General called for an immediate ceasefire and was backed by 13 UN Security Council members, but Russia and China vetoed the measure. Russia stepped up naval and airborne deliveries to Syria, concerned that Turkey might shut the Bosporus to Russian shipping and Turkish airspace to Russian supply flights. On 29 February, Turkish-backed rebels recaptured several villages in al-Ghab plain, reversing recent government gains. Meanwhile, according to SOHR, the number of Syrian army soldiers killed by the Turkish retaliation in the past 48 hours rose to 74.

Russia claimed the military police's task was to establish effectively a humanitarian corridor for civilians by securing safe passage of vehicles and civilians traveling along the M4 and M5 highways; this was notable since Russia had reduced its overall activities in Syria (apart from defending its own assets) after Erdogan and Vladimir Putin contacted each other on 28 February. However, opposition sources told Reuters that clashes continued in western parts of the town and the SNA said it had prevented Russian Military Police from entering; SOHR said rebels were trying to regain control while Al Jazeera reported that rebels were in control of the western part of the city while government control was limited to the eastern (industrial) zone.

On 12 March, in an apparent ceasefire violation, SOHR reported that the SAA and allies entered the settlements of Maarrat Mukhas and al-Burayj in southern Idlib without any resistance. Government forces reportedly advanced into the same areas on 7 March before withdrawing due to heavy shelling by opposition factions. Aftermath and Russian‚ÄìTurkish joint patrols On 15 March 2020, Turkish and Russian troops began joint patrols on the M4 highway as a part of the ceasefire agreement between Turkey and Russia.

Humanitarian consequences The offensive has been characterised by indiscriminate aerial bombing and shelling of civilian homes, mainly either by Russian planes, taking off from the Russian base in Latakia, or by government jets flying from Kuweires Military Aviation Institute, 18 miles east of Aleppo. On 23 December 2019, the United Nations stated that the renewed fighting that started on 18 December had caused an exodus of 80,000 people across Idlib Governorate. According to SOHR, in the week up to 24 December 100,000 people were displaced because of the fighting as well as Syrian and Russian bombing. More than 235,000 civilians were displaced as of 27 December 2019 per the United Nations. By 5 February 2020, 300 civilians had been killed in the fighting, including 49 in the first five days of February, and 520,000 were displaced (80% of the latter women and children), according to the UN and various NGOs. By 10 February 2020, the number of displaced civilians had reached 689,000. The humanitarian impact of the fighting was made more severe by extreme cold weather, with Save the Children, the International Rescue Committee and the International Organisation on Migration reporting that many children were dying due to sub-zero temperatures. By 14 February, 10 Canadian aid organisations reported that 142,000 people had fled their homes in the past five days alone, including 6,500 children a day, bringing the total number of people displaced to over 800,000 since December. By 17 February, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that the Northwestern Syria offensive since December has displaced 900,000 people. By late February, estimates had risen to 950,000. By early March, estimates had risen to 980,000. According to the UN, 82,000 displaced people were living in the freezing open air in February; 36% of newly displaced families are housed by relatives or find rental accommodation, 17% found refuge in camps, over 15% sought shelter in unfinished buildings and 12% are still \\"looking for shelter\\". Many of the displaced have been forced to move multiple times. Some of the displaced people have escaped to Syrian Democratic Forces controlled Manbij. Hospitals have been heavily targeted in the fighting. Some 70 hospitals were bombed out of action. On 12 February, Islamic Relief reported that 15 medical facilities it supported had been damaged or fully destroyed, at least 55 sites where they distributed food recorded 428 nearby airstrikes near these locations, and 90% of staff in Idlib had been forcibly displaced. Schools have also been targeted. On 25 February, Amnesty International condemned the shelling of ten schools in Idlib and Aleppo countryside, describing it as a war crime. After the 25 February attack, all schools in Idlib were suspended. In July, a UN investigation said war crimes and possible crimes against humanity were committed during the campaign. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic said people suffered incomprehensible misery. It recorded assaults by all sides in the conflict that resulted in civilian casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure. It found shelled schools, market bombings, and hospitals bombed.

It centres on two American youths, John and Julie, who have been recruited by an extragalactic being called \\"the Investigator\\" to aid his self-appointed task of ridding Earth of evil and corruption. Miniaturised and given special knowledge and abilities, they take on Stavros Karanti, an unscrupulous businessman plotting to steal a priceless painting from a Maltese cathedral. Shane Rimmer and Sylvia Anderson voice John and Julie, who are represented by marionette puppets, while Charles Thake and Peter Borg appear as Karanti and his minion Christoph. The pilot marked Gerry Anderson's first use of puppets since The Secret Service (1969). Written by his wife Sylvia from a story by Rimmer, it was filmed on location in Malta between the production of The Protectors and a planned second series of UFO (which would later be made as Space: 1999). Filming was complicated by numerous technical and logistical difficulties and the crew were unable to finish the shoot. The pilot was assembled from the incomplete footage but Anderson was disappointed with the results and abandoned his idea of pitching it to American network NBC as the basis for a new Supermarionation series. The pilot has since received a negative response from commentators. Plot The Investigator (voiced by Peter Dyneley), an omniscient being from another galaxy, has come to Earth to rid it of evil and corruption. To assist him, he has recruited two young Americans, John and Julie (voiced by Shane Rimmer and Sylvia Anderson), whom he has miniaturised and given special powers. In a cave on Malta, the Investigator (represented by a flashing green light) gives John and Julie their first assignment: they are to foil crooked entrepreneur Stavros Karanti's (Charles Thake) plan to steal a priceless Raphael painting from St John's Cathedral in Mdina. To aid their mission, he provides them with an eight-wheel miniature car equipped with powerful surveillance devices. Thanks to his new abilities, John instantly knows how to drive the car. John and Julie go to Angel's Leap and spy on Karanti as he boards his yacht, the Borgia, and meets his associate Christoph (Peter Borg). When the men come ashore and drive to Mdina, John and Julie follow. While touring St John's, to which he has donated a fake painting, Karanti learns of the cathedral's security arrangements. Karanti and Christoph return to the Borgia pursued by John and Julie, who board the yacht via a miniature speedboat provided by the Investigator. The youths accidentally knock over an object, alerting the criminals to their presence, but avoid being discovered thanks to their small size. Returning to St John's at night with John and Julie again on their tail, Karanti and Christoph knock out the cathedral's security guard and seize the Raphael painting. John tries to stop the criminals by mounting a chandelier and swinging it at them. Karanti fires a gun at John, missing him but causing him to fall to the floor, injured. Karanti and Christoph get away. Leaving Christoph at the harbour, Karanti drives to a nearby airfield, planning to leave Malta in his Cessna 150 plane. John and Julie beat him to the airfield and stow away aboard the Cessna before Karanti takes off. Speaking through a miniature megaphone, John pretends to be Karanti's conscience urging him to surrender. At the same time, Julie uses a remote control to make the plane repeatedly roll and dive, terrifying Karanti. On John's instructions, Karanti radios air traffic control to confess his crimes and lands at the airfield, where he is arrested by police. With the painting safely returned to the cathedral, John and Julie report back to the Investigator, who congratulates them on a job well done. Production The Investigator was Gerry Anderson's first puppet production since The Secret Service (1969), the last Supermarionation series to be made by his former company Century 21 Productions. Having gone on to make the live-action series UFO and The Protectors, neither of which were made specifically for children, Anderson wanted to create something new for the younger audience and devised The Investigator as the template for a new Supermarionation programme, intending to pitch it to American network NBC in the hope that it would commission a series. The pilot was planned by Anderson, his wife Sylvia and their long-time business partner Reg Hill. Written by Sylvia from a story by Shane Rimmer, it was funded by private venture capital and produced by off-the-shelf company Starkits between The Protectors and a planned second series of UFO (which was later made as Space: 1999). The project saw the return of several crew members from the Supermarionation years, such as co-editor David Lane, as well as the reunion of voice actors Sylvia, Rimmer and Peter Dyneley, all of whom had voiced characters in Thunderbirds. Charles Thake had previously appeared in an episode of The Protectors. The John and Julie puppets were tall and made in the naturally-proportioned style that Century 21 had introduced for Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1967). Unlike the puppets of 1960s Supermarionation, which had been controlled from overhead bridges, they were operated from the ground with the puppeteers standing on boxes. Julie was modelled on Raquel Welch. Modified versions of the puppets later appeared in Alien Attack, a 1977 TV advertisement produced by Gerry Anderson. The model car and speedboat were designed by Hill and operated by radio control. The Investigator was shot entirely on location in Malta, which had served as a location for The Protectors and was chosen for its architecture and scenery. Specific locations included the Main Gate and St Paul's Cathedral in Mdina as well as Malta International Airport. Filming was beset by technical and logistical problems. Low light meant that the crew often had to shoot in close-up, which made it hard to capture the scale and detail of the locations. The model car was affected by radio signals from RAF Nimrods, causing it to crash into objects or speed off in the wrong direction. Poor weather also disrupted the proceedings. At one point, heavy rain forced the crew to film outdoor scenes under a plastic cover that started to leak, soaking the set. On another occasion, a storm hit while Gerry Anderson was on Malta and the rest of the unit were on Gozo, leaving the director and his crew cut off from each other and causing the production to lose a day. Another day was lost when the sailing yacht doubling as the Borgia fouled its anchor. Anderson did not have facilities in Malta to view rushes from the production. Footage was instead flown back to the UK, where it was processed by Hill. Eventually the production's schedule ran out and the crew were forced to return to the UK before they had finished filming. This meant that the aerial footage for the scenes aboard Karanti's plane had to be shot over the English countryside. The pilot was then put together using the material available. The theme music was composed by Vic Elmes, Sylvia Anderson's then son-in-law.Archer and Hearn, p. 220. Elmes was originally to have scored the entire pilot, but Gerry Anderson was unimpressed with his efforts and replaced him with John Cameron, the composer for The Protectors. The incidental music was recycled from Cameron's work on that series. Reception The Andersons and Hill were disappointed with the finished pilot and abandoned the idea of pitching it, feeling that its quality was too low to satisfy NBC or any other broadcaster. Gerry Anderson's opinions on The Investigator ranged from a \\"pretty dull, uninspired piece of filmmaking\\" to a \\"disaster\\". He regretted serving as both director and producer as he felt that his need to limit costs as producer compromised his vision as director. In his 1996 biography, he called the project an \\"absolute non-starter\\" and reflected that \\"everything, but everything went wrong on The Investigator.\\" Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn compare The Investigator to The Secret Service, which combined puppets and live actors in a similar way. They describe it as an \\"extrapolation\\" of the earlier series. Ian Fryer suggests that The Investigator \\"pushed the notion further\\" by being filmed entirely on location. He argues that the pilot displays \\"decent professional standards\\" and that the \\"sketchiness\\" of the premise can be justified by the fact that unlike the first episodes of the Supermarionation productions, where all story elements had been approved prior to filming, The Investigator was made as a \\"true pilot\\" whose elements were still subject to approval. He praises the model work, believing the car and speedboat to be well designed despite the low budget, but regards John and Julie as poorly- developed characters, pointing out that they receive a shorter introduction than the car. Suggesting that an Investigator series could have been a \\"junior version\\" of Mission: Impossible, noting that 1973 was the \\"tail end of the post-Bond craze\\", Fryer acknowledges the pilot's failure, concluding that \\"the return of Supermarionation died, unheralded, on the rain-swept streets of Malta.\\" TV Zone magazine comments that the lack of puppet movement \\"does little to enliven the characters\\" and calls The Investigator a \\"poor attempt to recreate the heyday of Century 21\\". SFX describes it as a \\"weirdly forlorn thing\\" and \\"existentially peculiar even by Anderson's standards.\\" According to Anderson's son Jamie, The Investigator \\"lacked the science fiction context that made [his] previous shows so successful.\\" Other media Toy versions of the car and speedboat were produced by Dinky. However, the toys' launch was cancelled when it became clear that no series would be made. After being redesigned and repackaged to omit all references to The Investigator, the car and speedboat eventually went on sale in 1975 and 1977 respectively. For many years The Investigator was unavailable on any home video format, although fan- made copies existed and it was screened at Anderson conventions. In 2012, Fanderson released a DVD of The Investigator exclusively for its members. The print used to make the DVD had been restored by BBC Resources, which also recreated its missing closing titles. The Investigator was later included in 2015's \\"The Lost Worlds of Gerry Anderson\\" DVD by Network.

In this configuration the polarization of light is preserved through the optics. 292x292px Other advantages of this design are a large field of view in a compact volume. Due to its off-axis nature the secondary mirror does not block any of the incoming light. At millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths this greatly decreases systematic effects due to diffraction. The main disadvantage is that the size of the secondary mirror is of similar size to the primary mirror making it expensive to make and heavy (requiring large supports). However, for professional applications where low systematic effects are critical (for example in cosmic microwave background experiments), the benefits of low systematics across a large field of view can far out-weight these disadvantages.  History  Corrado Dragone, from who this optical design gets its name, first described the design in his 1978 paper. Several follow up papers were published in the 1980s, however it was not until recently that astronomers have been able to build focal planes large enough to warrant the extra construction costs associated with the large secondary mirror of the Cross Dragone design. Older millimeter or submillimeter telescopes have typically been of Gregorian or Cassengrain designs.  Examples  Some examples of existing and planned telescopes that use this design include: * The QUIET experiment * The Atacama B-mode Search (ABS) * EPIC-IM * CCAT-prime  Variations  Although the field of view of Crossed Dragone telescope is large, it can be increased further by the addition of canceling aspheric terms in the primary and secondary mirror shapes. This approach has been used by the Simons Observatory Large telescope and the CCAT- prime telescope currently (2019) under construction in Chile. This comes at the cost of breaking the symmetry of the mirrors - they are no longer rotationally symmetric around any axis. Modern machining techniques can cut such surfaces but on a large telescope the mirror will be made of many segments/panels. When aspheric terms are added each panel becomes different adding to manufacturing costs.

She was an expert on the identification and taxonomy of Phytophthora plant pathogens. She gathered a large collection of Phytophthora cultures, and published two seminal works on the genus: a key to the species and a compilation of species descriptions. Early Life and Education Grace Waterhouse was born in South West London in 1906 and was the youngest of three children. She had two brothers. She attended the Royal Holloway, University of London from 1924 to 1927 where she studied botany. After graduation, she worked in the Botany Department of Royal Holloway College for 12 years. In 1939, she was awarded a Master's degree for her work in Phytophthora. From 1937 to 1941, she studied zoology at Birkbeck College. In 1983, the University of London awarded her a doctorate in science. Career Waterhouse started her career as a teacher at Eastbourne in 1942. She later took a teaching position at Lincoln Training College. In 1945, she returned to Royal Hollow College to continue to work on Phytophthora. In 1946, Waterhouse joined the International Mycological Institute where she worked until her retirement. While at the International Mycological Institute, Waterhouse replaced Geoffrey Clough Ainsworth as the assistant editor of the Review of Applied Mycology, a journal dedicated to abstracting world literature on plant diseases. She was also given the responsibility of identifying samples of plant pathogens belonging to the phycomycetes, which included Phytophthora. One of the challenges she faced was a lack of keys that would allow for reliable identification of the species in these groups. She therefore wrote and published seminal keys to the genera Phythophthora, Sclerospora, Pythium, and Entomophthora. In addition to working at the International Mycological Institute, Waterhouse was a member of the British Mycological Society, the Lincolnshire Naturalist's Union, and the Mycological Society of America. She was the editor of the journal Transactions of the British Mycological Societyfrom 1959 to 1965 and served as the president of the British Mycological Society in 1961. She served as the president of the Lincolnshire Naturalist's Union in 1956. Personal Life Waterhouse enjoyed field hockey, tennis, and skiing. She was on the tennis team in college and started skiing in her 50s. She enjoyed music and sang in several choirs and frequently visited Glyndebourne. She also enjoyed folk dancing, beekeeping, and detective novels. She was a dedicated Christian. Death and Legacy Waterhouse died from a stroke in 1996.

The paper was continuously published for 132 years with a circulation of 1,300. The paper was known for its longevity and outlasting its peers, in 1880 there were 16 local newspapers in Grey County, but by 1920 only one remained, The Markdale Standard.  History  =The Markdale Expositor= The newspaper began operating under the name of the Markdale Expositor. The paper was started on October 29, 1875 under editor George Jackson Blyth. Born in 1845, Blyth would publish the Expositor until 1880, and five years started up the Chatsworth News on March 12, 1885. He was a member of the International organization of Good Templars, as a District Lecturer regarding the Temperance movement. Blyth died on January 19, 1908, having suffered a stroke June of the previous year, and buried in St. Paul's Anglican cemetery. His daughter Edith would continue to manage the paper. =The Markdale Standard=  Rutledge years  On September 17, 1880 the first issue of newly renamed Markdale Standard began under Charles Wesley Rutledge, who had purchased it from Blyth. In 1899 Rutledge moved the presses from the Hill Block on Toronto Street to the Standard Block he had constructed at Main St. West & Eliza Street. On January 16, 1908, the Standard Printing Company of Markdale, under the control of J.W. Tucker, joined Rutledge in ownership. Tucker had been with the staff for nine years as a printer, five of those as foreman. The partnership between Rutledge and Tucker dissolved in 1914. Rutledge himself championed updating the library in Markdale, as Secretary-Treasurer of the Library Board when the new location was opened in 1915, relocated from the cramped confines of the local Mechanic's Institute. After retiring from the paper, Rutledge purchased Knarsboro Hall on Main Street E. from Senator Thomas Sproule, from which Rutledge's wife leased a portion of for a hospital in 1929 and to the Canadian Legion in 1946.  Colgan family years  Albert Edward Colgan took over as editor and publisher from Rutledge in January 1921. A. E., son of pioneers of Proton Township John & Sarah, was born in Dundalk in 1877. Colgan stood in provincial elections as a Conservative, winning once, and President of the South Grey Conservative Association As a young man, \\"Ed\\" Colgan served as Magistrate for both Dundalk and Markdale, A member of Odd Fellows, Orange, andMasonic organizations and leader of the local Citizen's Band, Colgan also served as chairman of the Markdale Cemetery Board. Colgan also had a partner named MacIntyre in a partnership that lasted until 1926, the next year Colgan expanding into publishing the Chatsworth Banner. Colgan became the sole owner of the Markdale Standard until his retirement and then passing in January 1945. Colgan's son Jack then became the publisher/editor. W. Jack Colgan stayed in his position until 1946, when he left for tuberculosis treatment. The paper was then run by a female family member with the help of two printers. After treatment, Jack returned and stayed with the paper until April 1949. The paper was published from offices located at 13 Toronto Street North. Circulation for the Standard is estimated at 1,300. On occasion of its 25th anniversary the Standard was recognized in The Globe's \\"The Spirit of the Press\\" column where it was noted that: \\"To the uninitiated, it may appear a soft snap to run a newspaper, but there is perhaps no business which requires closer application and more methodical attention to matters of detail than that of publishing a rural newspaper.\\" In the late-19th century, the paper published a dedicated half column to reporting railroad accidents and delays, which were then a constant feature of rural existence. After the 1935 federal election of Agnes MacPhail to the newly formed riding of Grey-Bruce, she kept her constituents appraised through a Weekly Letter From Ottawa in 1936-1937 issues. = 20th century = The Colgan family ownership ended in April 1949, when the paper was purchased by R. Gordon Craig of Ingersoll. Craig had been the editor of the Ingersoll Tribune previously. Craig published the paper until 1968 when William Kennedy, editor and publisher of the Durham Chronicle, bought the paper. In 1971 Kennedy was joined by former Hanover Post photographer Melvin John Gateman, who served as editor until 1998. Adam Freill took over from Mel, serving as the editor and general manager until 2000. John McPhee was the editor until 2001. In 2001 Lori Ledingham began her tenure as editor for the Standard until its closure in 2012. At the time, publisher Cheryl McMenemy explained the decision to end publication was strictly a business decision telling the Owen Sound Sun Times that: \\"There is no longer an advertising base within the Markdale area to sustain a community newspaper.\\" Cookbook In the late 1920s, The Markdale Standard published a cookbook. The author said that \\"proper diet\\" was essential, and called diabetes a \\"money-making disease,\\" proffering the counsel that insulin is not a cure, but keeps the disease in a \\"stagnant position\\". He also counseled that aluminium pots should never be used for cooking.

They prefer to live in high domed houses for isolation and privacy. Slaves of the Klau is a science fiction novel by American writer Jack Vance written in 1958. It is about an Earth man, Roy Barch, who is kidnapped into slavery by a warlike alien race, the Klau and taken to a forced labour planet. Roy develops a plan to escape back to Earth by stealing an anti- gravity ship from the Klau and turning it into a spaceship. Vance's preferred title is Gold and Iron, with gold being a reference to the gold skin tone of the benevolent Lekthwan aliens and iron a reference to Roy Barch's iron-willed resolution to escape his captors. It was first published in Space Stories magazine with the title Space Pirates; when Ace published it in a book, they changed the title to Slaves of the Klau and altered Vance's text with some cuts. In the 2002 Vance Integral Edition, Vance's preferred title (Gold and Iron) and the previously cut text were restored. Plot Roy Barch is a young Earth man who is the son of a scientist. His dreams of following his father's profession have been ended by the arrival on Earth of a benevolent alien race, the Lekthwan, which is far more advanced than humans. The Lekthwan pass on enough of their advanced science that many Earth scientists find that their knowledge has become obsolete, including Roy, who becomes a servant for a Lekthwan. One day, the alien's wife and two daughters arrive on Earth in a spaceship. The 20-year-old daughter, who Roy calls Ellen, is a cultural anthropologist and scientist. Roy asks her out on a date to hear a jazz band. When they arrive home, her family has been killed by huge aliens from the Klau race, who kidnap Roy and Ellen. The pair are transported to Magarak, a grim, dank Klau mining and manufacturing planet to work as slaves. Ellen is resigned to her fate, and says escape is impossible, but Roy insists that he will escape and get back to Earth. They escape to the wilderness, where they meet a tribe of other fugitive slaves led by a towering Klau named Clet. Every week, Klau and their Podruods (a subspecies of Klau used as warriors and fighters) come on flying rafts to hunt slave fugitives for sport. Roy suggests to Clet that the tribe fight back against the Klau hunters, but Clet wants to continue the statu quo. Roy leaves the tribe's cave, intending to become an exile. While he is in the woods, he spots a flying raft of Klau hunters coming towards the cave. He shoots the Klau and takes their alien rifles, which he uses to kill Clet (who Roy believes will never agree to fight the Klau). Roy announces he is the new leader of the tribe and tells them that they can escape from Magarak. While many dismiss his plan as hopeless, Roy argues that if they steal flying barges, they may be able to jury-rig an airtight enclosure and fly through space. He leads raiding expeditions to steal barges and equipment and they weld two barges face to face and mount life-supporters inside. As their raids continue, Roy realizes that the Klau will likely soon strike back. He mines the bluff overlooking the cave mouth with explosives and has a third barge filled with high explosives. When the Klau attack, they fly to the bluff, and Roy triggers the explosions. Roy orders the tribe to make the final preparations on their improvised space vessel, and then he sets out to take the explosives-filled air barge to the command and control center of the Klau on Magarek. Roy destroys it the Klau headquarters and returns to the cave. However, the tribe has left, including Ellen, and the improvised spaceship is gone. After a period, another air barge arrives filled with new fugitive slaves. Roy leads the creation of a second improvised spaceship, and they get back to Earth. He is hailed as a hero in the war against the Klau slavers. He goes to see Ellen again, and she asks him to marry her. At first he refuses, on the grounds that they are too different, and he fears that her advanced alien race looks down on humans. In the end he decides to take a risk and marry her.

Founded in 1881, the paper was published in Flesherton until 1968 when purchased by the current publishers, the Walls family.  History  = 19th century = The Flesherton Advance was founded on April 1, 1881 by A. R. Fawcett. Both himself and future publisher W. H. Thurston were born in Euphrasia Township, Fawcett near Heathcote. His early connection with newspapers was as an apprentice at the Thornbury Standard. Fawcett was a member of the Artemesia Town Council, as well as being connected to the Osprey and Euphrasia Town Councils in the early and mid 1880s. He was also attended the Artemesia Agricultural Society Annual Meeting, was a member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the Sons of Temperance and married twice. His first wife, Amelia Buchanan, passed on the 21st of February, 1885, and he remarried the next January to a Maggie Carberry of Chingacousy. By the summer of 1888 the town's population had doubled to 600, and Fawcett had sold the paper on August 1 to W. H. Thurston. After 50 years, the paper never carried less than twelve columns of advertising, the same as its first issue. The same week he parted ways with the Advance, he also sold the newspaper and job printing plant of the Streetsville Review. He went on to Streetsville, then Toronto, before settling in Burk's Falls and went on to publish the Burks' Falls Arrow, a publication that ran from 1885 to 1966. He passed on August 2, 1919. A front page reprint of Fawcett's recollection of the first days of setting up the paper, sham battles in the town during Louis Riel's rebellion, and columns by the Thurstons can be found in the June 3rd, 1931 issue. William Hadley Thurston was born in 1859, seven years after his family had relocated to Kimberly from Lindsay, his family (John M. Thurston and Adeline Purdy) being one of the first pioneers of Kimberly Valley. At the age of 17 Thurston began an apprenticeship in Orangeville for two years before heading to the Durham Review. He then spent time as a writer and typesetter with the Toronto Daily World/Globe and World, and as an editor of the Owen Sound Tribune, where he would write that the Flesherton Advance was ‚Äúanother candidate for the poor house.‚Äù Not the only newspaper man in his family, his brother Alfred D. would hold an executive position with the Montreal Gazette. Thurston would serve as the first clerk of the newly incorporated village in 1912, up to being elected Reeve in 1927. A philatelist, photographer, mushroom hunter and taxidermist, Thurston owned the first pneumatic bike in the district. On editors, Thurston once said, \\"To be a live editor, I believe, is to endanger friendships, but after all it is not true friendship which falls before honest criticism.\\" On January 4, 1884, Thurston married Kate Amelia Gaudin, with whom he would have four children with. He retired from the paper in the August 24th, 1938 issue and died January 25th, 1939, leaving the paper in the hands of his son, F. J. Thurston. = 20th century = Frances James Thurston, born in 1901, first became involved with the paper from 1916 to 1919, leaving school to assist his father as many workers were overseas fighting. After leaving the paper he worked in the industry in Toronto and Winnipeg and returned to Flesherton in 1921, marrying Lillian Leoan White on January 11, 1923. Running the paper from his father's retirement in 1938 until 1961, his brother A. S. Thurston also wrote a column for the paper. Frank would return as editor in April 1966 for two years after working on the Thornbury Review and the Alliston Herald. Frank passed away in 1987, leaving five sons. The intervening five years had seen Royden Johnston as publisher from September 1961. Johnston was born in the early 1930s, arrived in town in 1946, and made the front page of the Advance for scholastic achievements and a run-in with some local deer. In the spring of 1966, the paper was being published by Godfrey Clark. This only lasted two years, when Walter Walls and wife Phylis purchased the paper and shifted production in tandem with the Dundalk Herald. The Walls family have been at the paper ever since then, Matthew Walls succeeding his parents, followed by Cathy Walls, the paper still publishing as of 2019.  Geographic coverage  The Advance had a circulation of 1,000 for its 6 column, 8 page sheet in the early 1920s for a town of 500 persons. The paper historically served the communities of Priceville, Inistioge, Maxwell, Feversham, Eugenia, Vandeleur, Kimberly, Portlaw, Proton, Wodehouse, Maxwell, Rock Mills and Ceylon.

He was the atabeg (father-lord) of the underage sultans. Previously, he had been a eunuch in the service of Aqsunqur al- Bursuqƒ´, the atabeg of Mosul. According to Ibn al-Athƒ´r, Lu ælu æ took charge of affairs in Aleppo after the death of Sultan Ri·∏çwƒÅn in 1113, since his son, Alp ArslƒÅn al-Akhras, was only sixteen years old. In 1114, Alp ArslƒÅn was murdered in his own palace by his maml≈´ks at the instigation of Lu ælu æ because the young sultan had sought the help of ·π¨ughtakƒ´n, ruler of Damascus, to establish his personal rule. Lu ælu æ then raised his six-year-old brother, Sul·π≠ƒÅn ShƒÅh ibn Ri·∏çwƒÅn, to the throne and continued to hold the regency. In an effort to solidify his rule, he founded the first khƒÅnaqƒÅh (·π¢≈´fƒ´ monastery) in Aleppo, but this generated strong Shia opposition. He was also opposed by the family of SƒÅ øid ibn Badƒ´ ø, ra æƒ´s (leader) of the a·∏•dƒÅth (militia), whom Alp ArslƒÅn had exiled to Qal øat Ja øbar. In early 1115, threatened by his fellow Seljuk vassals, ·π¨ughtakƒ´n and ƒ™lghƒÅzƒ´ of Mardin, Lu ælu æ requested assistance from the Great Seljuk sultan Mu·∏•ammad I Tapar in Baghdad. According to Ibn al-Athƒ´r, the sultan sent the Emir Bursuq ibn Bursuq to deal first with the rebels and then with the neighbouring Frankish states. Part of Bursuq's mission was to take charge of Aleppo. When the emir ordered Lu ælu æ to surrender the city, the regent instead sent for help from his erstwhile enemies, ƒ™lghƒÅzƒ´ and ·π¨ughtakƒ´n. Reinforcements of 2,000 cavalry entered the city, and Lu ælu æ went into open defiance of the Great Seljuk sultan. According to Ibn al- øAdƒ´m, Lu ælu æ even passed along intelligence on Bursuq's movements to the Frankish leader Roger of Salerno, who defeated Bursuq at the Battle of Sarmin. Lu ælu æ was assassinated in 1117 at the instigation of the family of SƒÅ øid ibn Badƒ´ ø while on his way to meet SƒÅlim ibn MƒÅlik, emir of Qal øat Ja øbar. During a rest at a place called Qal øat NƒÅdir, he was shot with arrows by some of his Turkish retainers who had been pretending to hunt rabbit. Although the assassins plundered the regent's treasure, the people of Aleppo were able to recover it. Lu ælu æ was succeeded as atabeg by Shams al-KhawƒÅ·π£·π£ YƒÅr≈´qtƒÅsh, who had been his military commander. Ibn al-Athƒ´r reports the rumour that Lu ælu æ had intended to kill the young sultan and was assassinated before he could by some friends of Sul·π≠ƒÅn ShƒÅh.

(Army personnel file) In March 1946, the Army sent Magee to the University of Western Australia to complete his Bachelor of Engineering degree in civil engineering. He was promoted to the rank of captain on 13 December 1948, graduated in 1949, and was posted to Western Command. He was transferred to the 1st Field Squadron on 14 January 1950, and the 7th Field Squadron on 1 December. In March 1950 he completed the Junior Officers' Course. On 29 June 1951, Magee departed Sydney bound for Iwakuni, Japan, where he joined the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) Engineer Regiment. On 5 July 1952, during the Korean War, he assumed command of the Royal Australian Engineers detachment in Korea. On 15 November 1952, he became Deputy Commander, Royal Engineers (DCRE). Returning to Australia in January 1952, Magee became CRE Western Command in January 1953, with the temporary rank of major from 7 February. He married Beverly Joan Prior in St Mary's Cathedral, Perth, on 27 June 1953. They had two children, Thomas Anthony John and Jeremy Owen. He completed the Field Officers' Tactics Course in June and July 1954. In July 1955, he was attached to the Department of Supply, and was engaged in the construction of rocket launching facility at Woomera. On 15 January 1956, Magee appoint the chief engineer for Operation Buffalo, the British nuclear tests at Maralinga in 1956. While there he was injured during a cricket match. In 1957 and 1958 he was seconded to the Snowy Mountains Authority, and helped build its underground hydroelectric power stations. He wrote about his experiences in a technical paper on the \\"Behaviour of Decomposed Granites as Pavement Materials\\", which he presented at a conference on soil mechanics in Sydney in 1960. He was posted to the staff of the Chief Engineer (CE) Southern Command and became CE Western Command on 18 January 1959. Magee attended the Field Officers' Tactics Refresher Course in March 1959, and the Senior Officers Tactics School in August and September. From January to December 1960, the Pakistan Army's Command and Staff College in Quetta, where he was placed in the awkward position of having to defend the Australian government's White Australia Policy. He was appointed Commandant of the School of Military Engineering on 18 January 1961, with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel, which became substantive on 20 December 1962. He then became Chief Engineer at Northern Command, based in Brisbane on 24 March 1965. In this role he oversaw the redevelopment of Enoggera Barracks in Brisbane, and the construction of Lavarack Barracks in Townsville and the Army Aviation Centre in Oakey. Promoted to temporary rank colonel on 11 November 1968, and the permanent rank on 8 February 1969, Magee's last military appointment was as the Director of Fortifications and Works in Canberra. In this capacity he paid two visits to the Australian forces fighting in South Vietnam in the Vietnam War, looking at construction work at the Australian base at Nui Dat. On 13 January 1970, Magee retired from the Regular Army. He became a reservist on 18 October 1970, retaining his rank of colonel, and was appointed Chief Engineer 11 (Works). He was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier 1 December 1973, and the substantive rank on 31 August 1974. He retired from the Army on 31 August 1978. Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority After retiring from the Regular Army in 1970 Magee accepted the position of Executive Director of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority. As such, he was in charge of a $300 million redevelopment program at The Rocks, a slum district of historical value that was the home of many low-rent tenants. In what became known as the Battle of the Rocks, he was opposed by local residents and the powerful Builders Labourers Federation (BLP) led by Jack Mundey and Bob Pringle , who imposed green bans on the site until the BLF was deregistered in 1974. In the end, many historic buildings were saved, but the nature of the area was completely changed, and it was transformed into an up-market tourist attraction. In 1970, about 25,000 people visited The Rocks each year; forty years later, it attracted 9 million visitors per annum. Magee had memorials erected honouring people that had played a significant part in the history of Sydney Cove, such as George Barney, William Bligh, Robert Campbell and Lucy Osburn, but opposed plans to build a monument to Jack Munday. Magee resigned in 1985 over a conflict with Bob Carr concerning the redevelopment of Globe Street and the Clocktower in The Rocks. In retirement he did volunteer charity work, and served as Honorary Colonel Commandant of the Royal Australian Engineers. He remained active in debates on matters such as the proposed privatisation of the Snowy Mountains Authority, the Very Fast Train between Sydney and Melbourne, which he felt would be uneconomical, and the design of the Museum of Contemporary Art. He wrote a book on the Battle of the Rocks, titled, How The Rocks Was Won. Magee died on 14 May 2007. He was survived by his wife Beverly and sons Tom and Jeremy. Decorations Magee's decorations include the Pacific Star, War Medal 1939‚Äì1945, Australia Service Medal 1939‚Äì1945, United Nations Service Medal, Korea Medal, Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal, Australian Service Medal 1945‚Äì1975 and National Medal.

It also includes short articles about some of the events that are an integral part of the club's recent history. Upheaval (2002‚Äì2012) Despite being relegated again, the 2002 FAI Cup win had restored a confidence in the club that had been absent since the early 1990s. But this confidence was short-lived. The 2002‚Äì03 season was a shortened season, which started in July, as the League of Ireland was transitioning to \\"summer soccer\\", and the short close season had seen the departure of some key players. Dundalk's reign as Cup holders lasted just 16 weeks, when they were knocked out in the first round of the second FAI Cup tournament to be played that calendar year. They were then outclassed in Europe by Varteks Varazdin in the qualifying round of the 2002‚Äì03 UEFA Cup. After a 5‚Äì0 defeat in Croatia, the return leg (played in Tolka Park in Dublin, due to Oriel Park not meeting UEFA's revised standards for stadiums) attracted just 410 supporters, who witnessed a 4‚Äì0 defeat. The poor form continued into the league, and manager Martin Murray resigned at the end of September, less than six months after the cup final victory. The club turned to former Northern Ireland international and Linfield manager, Trevor Anderson. But results continued to deteriorate and the club slipped further down the table, finishing 10th the following season ‚Äì 20th in the Irish football pyramid ‚Äì the club's worst ever season. Anderson eventually resigned, along with a number of board members, after the 2004 season had started as poorly as the previous one had ended. He was replaced by former player Jim Gannon, and a mid-table finish followed. The membership-based 'co-op' ownership model had by now exhausted its funds, and the remaining board members decided to sell the club's training ground, Hiney Park, in the summer of 2005 in order to service debts and pay for work at Oriel Park, including the installation of an artificial pitch, which, it was hoped, would bring in additional revenue. But by the end of the season the club had again finished in mid-table, and the board saw more resignations, with Gannon also quitting. The co-op was now exhausted, and the members agreed to the club being taken back into private ownership by its CEO, Gerry Matthews. With new investment, Dundalk finished second in 2006 under new manager John Gill, securing a play-off tie against Waterford United. But, even though they won the play-off, they were still denied a place in the 2007 Premier Division, with Galway United (who had finished third in that season's First Division) selected by the FAI's 2006 IAG Report to be promoted ahead of both Dundalk and Waterford. On the opening night of the 2007 season, Dundalk celebrated their 2,000th League match in the League of Ireland with a 3‚Äì2 victory over Finn Harps in Oriel Park. But they could only manage to finish in a play-off position, then lost in the play-off to Finn Harps, who went on to be promoted. The following season they won promotion back to the Premier Division, after yet more final day drama ‚Äì defeating Kildare County in Kildare, then waiting to hear the result of the match between Shelbourne and Limerick 37. Shelbourne, Dundalk's challengers, conceded an injury time equaliser to send Dundalk up as Champions. Controversially, Gill was let go, however, despite winning the First Division title. At first, Dundalk consolidated their position back in the Premier Division and qualified for the 2010‚Äì11 Europa League. Under Ian Foster, they won the first European match played in Oriel Park since 1991, and lead the league table midway through the 2010 season. The following year, they again went into the summer challenging at the top, and reached the 2011 Setanta Sports Cup final. But after losing the final, and with the playing budget already being restricted, results subsequently deteriorated as the season drew to a close. Financial losses were mounting, and Matthews decided to relinquish control of the club. Foster's contract expired and he was allowed to leave, and they spent the 2012 season rooted in the relegation play-off spot, as the scale of the financial problems threatened to put the club of business altogether. The withdrawal of Monaghan United from the League, however, meant that automatic relegation would be avoided. Matthews put the club up for sale, and, with the assistance of a Supporters Trust, it was taken over by local businessmen Andy Connolly and Paul Brown (owners of the team's official sponsors, Fastfix). They subsequently managed to remain in the top-flight by defeating Waterford United in the play-off. Stephen Kenny's golden era (2013‚Äì2018) Stephen Kenny, Dundalk manager 2013‚Äì2018 With the takeover complete and the club saved, the new owners turned to Stephen Kenny - out of work since being sacked by Shamrock Rovers - to become the new manager. He set about rebuilding the squad, with only four of the 32 players who made League appearances in 2012 retained. He had a limited budget, so focused on signing unheralded players from outside the top clubs, and players who had been released, for example Richie Towell, who had been released by Celtic, and Stephen O'Donnell, who had considerable success at Shamrock Rovers but was considering leaving the game. When the 2013 season started neither supporters nor pundits were sure what to expect, and Dundalk failed to win any of the first five home matches. But with Kenny's team clicking into gear as his ideas took hold, they rose up the table to the most unlikely of title challenges, eventually finishing second - a defeat to eventual champions St. Patrick's Athletic ultimately costing them the title. Kenny kept the nucleus of the side together and made some more additions for the following season and Dundalk went on a charge to the top of the table, including dishing out a thrashing to defending champions St. Patrick's Athletic in Richmond Park. He went on to guide the club to its first League title since 1995 after final day drama yet again, with Dundalk defeating title rivals Cork City 2‚Äì0 in Oriel Park. Dundalk also won that season's League Cup, the club's first League and League Cup Double. The 2015 season saw them dominate, winning the club's third League and FAI Cup Double, losing only one match in the process, three years after the financial and ownership issues that had threatened its existence. A third league title in a row was sealed with two games to spare in 2016, and Kenny's team made history the same season by being the first Irish side to gain a point, and then to win a match, in the group stage of European competition. In 2017, after the Europa League run, they won the League Cup again, defeating Shamrock Rovers in the final. But the departure of some key players, and a slow start, meant they slipped to runners-up spots in both league and FAI Cup. However the club's European form had attracted interest from abroad, and a consortium of American investors, backed by sports-investors Peak6, completed a takeover in January 2018. Kenny's side reasserted itself in 2018, winning another League and Cup Double ‚Äì the second under Kenny and fourth in the club's history ‚Äì breaking points-total and goals scored-total records in the process. In the aftermath, the FAI moved to offer Kenny the Republic of Ireland U-21 manager's role, and he resigned at the end of November in order to accept the position. After Kenny (2019‚Äìpresent) Vinny Perth, Dundalk manager, celebrating the 2019 league title success with supporters in Oriel Park. Hoping to achieve continuity, and with the majority of the first-team signed to longer-term contracts, the new owners replaced Kenny with his Assistant Manager since 2013, Vinny Perth, as Head Coach, with John Gill returning as First Team Coach. The new management team had immediate success, winning the season opening President's Cup. In the League they fell 13-points behind early leaders Shamrock Rovers in April, which saw Rovers being called \\"title-winners in waiting\\", but they overhauled the deficit within weeks, and subsequently won the club's 14th league title with four games to spare. They also won the League Cup by defeating Derry City on penalties in the final, to secure a second League and League Cup Double. Chasing their first domestic Treble, which had only been won once since the introduction of the League of Ireland Cup in 1973‚Äì74, they were beaten in a penalty shoot-out in the FAI Cup Final by Shamrock Rovers. But they ended the season with a comprehensive 7‚Äì1 aggregate victory over Northern Irish champions, Linfield, in the inaugural Champions Cup. The anatomy of Dundalk: a history in stubs =L'affaire Carter= In mid-November 1999, Kilkenny City defeated Limerick by 3 goals to 2. Making his debut for Kilkenny in that First Division match was Fran Carter. It subsequently transpired that Carter had been improperly registered, with his signature being forged on the registration form by Kilkenny's manager, Pat Byrne, to ensure it could be submitted on time for Carter to make his debut. They were docked three points for fielding an ineligible player when the forgery was noticed. Kilkenny protested that Byrne had Carter's permission to sign his name for him, and threatened to resort to the law courts to have the punishment rescinded. The Vice-President of the FAI, Milo Corcoran, acting as an arbitrator, ruled that the points deduction should be cancelled and the game replayed instead. No provision for his decision to have the match replayed existed in the League's rules. Furthermore, the decision was made two weeks before the end of the League season, with Dundalk and Kilkenny duelling for the promotion/relegation play-off spot in the First Division. Therefore, Kilkenny were essentially awarded an end-of-season game in hand against a team that were, by that stage, bottom of the table. They won the replayed match, and pipped Dundalk to the play-off spot by one point as a result. Dundalk took a case to the High Court on the basis that the three-point deduction was the prescribed sanction for fielding an ineligible player, whereas Corcoran's decision had no basis in the League's rules. Instead the High Court judge ruled that, as the rules did not state that a player must personally sign his registration form, Carter had been properly registered when Byrne signed Carter's name. Therefore, he had not been ineligible for the original match, and the original 3‚Äì2 result should be reinstated. Kilkenny went on to secure promotion by defeating Waterford United in the play-off. However the following season they could only win nine points from 33 matches and were relegated. They eventually resigned from the League in 2008. =2006 IAG Report= Dundalk being excluded from the 2007 Premier Division was as a result of the FAI implementing the recommendations of the Independent Assessment Group, which used a point-system consisting of off-field metrics as well as results from the previous five seasons to decide which teams should make up the top- tier. Dundalk were rated joint-eighth for the 'off-field' criteria but suffered on the 'on-field' metric used and failed to make the 12-team cut. Reports in the local and national press described the decision to exclude Dundalk from the Premier Division as \\"scandalous\\" and \\"an injustice\\". That results from 2002 and 2003 could be used to deny the club promotion to the 2007 Premier Division infuriated many Dundalk supporters and proved to be the final straw for one particularly disgruntled fan, who entered the former headquarters of the Football Association of Ireland at Merrion Square, doused the reception area with petrol and threatened to set it alight. After a tense hour-long stand-off, the situation ended peacefully when the manager, John Gill, spoke with the fan and persuaded him to end his protest. Dundalk's owner, Gerry Matthews, met with the FAI and members of the IAG committee and subsequently acknowledged that the club were \\"happy to move on\\". Within three seasons Cork and Drogheda had gone into administration, Longford had been relegated on the back of failing to produce accounts, Derry and Cork had been relegated due to their holding companies going bankrupt, while Galway (who outscored Dundalk on the off-field criteria 389 - 348) would subsequently withdraw from the League of Ireland altogether in 2011 due to financial difficulties. =Circus= The period between Dundalk's return to the Premier Division in 2009 and the ownership crisis in 2012 was marked by a number of embarrassing incidents for the club. In May 2009 defender Dave Rogers was sacked by the board for dropping his shorts in front of visiting St. Patrick's Athletic fans in Oriel Park after being sent off. Rogers won an unfair dismissal case, costing the club a 'five-figure' sum. Less than a year later the club was again forced to pay out following another unfair dismissal case, with a former marketing manager winning ‚Ç¨40,000 at an Employment Appeals Tribunal. In July 2010 Neale Fenn, who had been signed from Bohemians at the start of the season, approached the club and requested that his contract be cancelled as he wished to retire from the game \\"for the good of his family\\". He also requested that his registration be returned to allow him play a \\"little bit of football\\". Dundalk manager Ian Foster agreed to Fenn's request, only for Fenn to sign for Shamrock Rovers four days later. Dundalk got a degree of satisfaction when Fenn and Shamrock Rovers visited Oriel Park in September and were thrashed 5‚Äì1, Fenn's replacement Matthew Tipton scoring a hat-trick on the night. =Pitch battle= During Stephen Kenny's reign a legal dispute arose between the new owners of the club and the previous owner, Gerry Matthews, over the lease of Oriel Park. After the transfer of the club to the new company Dundalk Town FC Limited in 2012, Matthews' company held onto the ground lease and retained ownership of the Youth Development Centre (YDC), built in 2010. This prevented the club's new owners from carrying out any more than basic maintenance at the ground and also meant that the YDC remained unused. Matthews sought ‚Ç¨250,000 from the club for the lease and the YDC, threatening to demolish the latter for scrap if there was no agreement. In addition some ‚Ç¨430,000 in development levies remained owed to Louth County Council, which the new owners stated they should not be liable for. The dispute, which also involved the Casey family, as the situation was in breach of the terms of the lease, dragged on for over three years. It was eventually resolved in early 2017 and the club regained control of the ground lease. References ","title":"History of Dundalk F.C.

Between 1894 and 1904, he was appointed a member of the Legislative Council. He was also instrumental in the re-introduction of the Anglican Communion and English Freemasonry to the colony. He also lobbied the British colonial government to have greater African representation in the civil service in the late nineteenth century.  Early life and education  John van der Puije was born in Ussher Town, Accra on 18 March 1848 to Jacobus van der Puije, a Euro- African and Naa Karley Ankrah, of the royal house of Otublohum or Otu‚Äôs Quarter. His paternal grandfather was Jacobus van der Puije (1954‚Äì1781), a Dutch administrator who served as the Governor of the Dutch Gold Coast in its capital, Elmina in 1780. John van der Puije attended the Accra Wesleyan School and the Dutch School for mulatto children at the Elmina Castle.  Business and journalism  He became a general commodities merchant after completing his education. He was also involved in the cocoa trade. For a time, he was active in commerce in the eastern banks of the Volta River among the Anlo Ewe people. As his trade expanded, the paramount chief of Anlo Traditional Area made him one of his emissaries by to the British Governor, William Brandford Griffith who ruled the Gold Coast at various points between 1885 and 1894. His commercial interests took him to England few times. In 1892, while in Britain he received commission from the Liverpool-based company, Messrs. J. J. Fischer and Co. Ltd to set up a subsidiary in Ghana. The firm thrived in the Gold Coast colony and was tasked by a different English firm, Messrs. Pickering and Berthoud Ltd. to open a local branch on the Gold Coast. He co-founded the Gold Coast Chronicle in 1880, together with his brother, Isaac van der Puije, an Accra merchant and member of the Legislative Council from 1893 to 1898, J. H. Cheetham, Timothy Laing, and the Pan-Africanist, J. E. Casely Hayford. John van der Puije chaired the newspaper‚Äôs board.  Chieftaincy and politics  He was enstooled the divisional chief of Otublohum, in Ussher Town Accra, of the Ga State on 12 September 1888. He was appointed the Eastern Province Representative to the governing body of the Aborigines‚Äô Rights Protection Society (ARPS). After John Mensah Sarbah died in 1892, the English Governor, William Brandford Griffith selected John van der Puije as his replacement on the Gold Coast Legislative Council on 15 May 1894. In 1897, together with the African members of the Legislative Council and ARPS, he campaigned against the Lands Bill that would have expropriated indigenous land that was hitherto governed by the land tenure system. A coalition of local newspapers coordinated the opposition to the bill, culminating in a petition by a group of nationalists, including major financier, Jacob Wilson Sey to the then Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, Joseph Chamberlain, who served in this position from 1895 to 1903. From 1901 to 1903, John van der Puije was elected a member of the Accra Town Council. He stepped down from his position on the Legislative Council in 1904 on account of illness. The president of ARPS at the time, J. P. Brown was appointed by the colonial governor to succeed van der Puije in the Legislative Council.  Freemasonry and Anglicanism  In 1891, he was installed a Freemason in England. He was a member of the Royal Victorian Lodge in Accra. He switched from the Methodist Church to the Church of England. He persuaded the Anglican church to return to the Gold Coast in 1906 after a century and half of dormancy.  Death  John van der Puije died on 12 September 1925 in Accra.

It operated from 1971 to 1992. History = Ross Street 1971‚Äì75 = In 1970 Danish-born Marianne Baillieu (1939‚Äì2012) set up business importing artworks for sale. With her husband, solicitor and businessman Ian Baillieu, they purchased a small retail property in Ross Street, Toorak, which they renovated to open Realities gallery there in April 1971. The Bulletin magazine described the gallery in up-market Toorak Village as having \\"the air of a sparkling white eggshell with almost every surface glazed white, including the floor which means the public must put on Abominable Snowman socks to be able to walk on it.\\" In October 1974 the gallery presented old master drawings, watercolours and prints rarely seen for sale in Australia. The works were acquired from London, Boston, and New York. A catalogue of 35 pages, including 12 pages of plates, displayed works in the exhibition from Italian, Dutch and French schools from the 16th to 18th centuries, including Annibale Carracci's Head of a Boy Wearing a Flat Cap priced at $A12,500; Giovanni Battista Tiepolo with two drawings ($A7,000 and $A8,000); and Jacob Jordaens' The Martyrdom of St Sebastian ($A7,500), with others by Bonasone, Boschi, Busiri, Cipriani, Ferri, Garzi, Graziani, Martini, Novelli, and Pinelli.

Realities attracted crowds of students and the general public and Baillieu expressed her delight in giving wide exposure to a broad range of the art that she showed, which included dolls, weaving and electronics as well as the traditional media: > ‚ÄúI like to produce exhibitions which have purpose. I like to classify, not > just show things indiscriminately. I like to put together a formal survey > which will produce an emotional reaction for the community, one aspect of an > artist‚Äôs work, a trend or movement. For instance I have had exhibitions > showing artists work today beside their work [of] 20 years ago.\\" = Jackson Street 1975‚Äì1992 = The early 1970s brought a boom in sales of locally produced art, joining a worldwide upward trend in the art market that did not pause until the early 1990s. The major state galleries, especially those of Victoria and New South Wales which were glamourously re-housed, were collecting Australian works and receiving blockbuster exhibitions from overseas, and art was seen as a viable investment, with incentives provided by the culturally activist Whitlam government. Deciding to concentrate on Australian artists, in 1975, Baillieu moved Realities to 33-35 Jackson Street, Toorak. Incidentally, the same year saw the closure of neighbouring Toorak Gallery 1.3 km away at 277 Toorak Rd., South Yarra, which had for ten years shown mainly contemporary Australian art. Realities' new venue was on a larger site of 1,117 sq. metres occupied by historic buildings; a schoolhouse (c.1867), parish hall (c.1912), verger‚Äôs cottage (1928) and a small ablutions block, and had them renovated and combined by architect Ross Ramus of Gunn Hayball Pty. Ltd. The adaptation of the building as a gallery (most particularly the work to the Hall) was documented in a contemporary national survey as an example of the recycling of heritage buildings. George Baldessin's three-part sculpture in bronze, rusted steel and chrome was sited at the entrance, and the first exhibition was Roger Kemp's. Brigid Cole-Adams described the space in an April 1980 article on the occasion of Bailleu's departure; Aboriginal art also enjoyed unprecedented interest, and in August 1977, Baillieu presented Paintings by the Desert Tribes of Central Australia at Realities, the first exhibition by Papunya Tula artists at a commercial gallery, and sold Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri's Warlugulong (1977), an acrylic on canvas painting, for A$1,200 to the Commonwealth Bank. After being on-sold several times, the work was auctioned in 2007 for $2.4 million, beating all previous records for Aboriginal artwork. Realities was one of few contemporary art galleries to show photography just as it too became collectible. Photographer-exhibitors included Bill Henson, Mark Strizic, Grant Mudford, American Leigh Weiner, and Joyce Evans. In 1981 as Gough Whitlam launched a biography of Melbourne artist Clifton Pugh at the gallery, he joked about having to make his speech in front of his nemesis Sir John Kerr in a controversial portrait painted by Pugh in 1975; \\"I'll have you know I had nothing to do with the placing of the exhibit.\\" In the same year, a joint exhibition by Pugh and Frank Hodgkinson of works they made in Arnhem Land was sold out for $100,000 before opening, the works all purchased by the one buyer, the multi-millionaire former car salesman Dennis Gowing. Baillieu was notably coy about money matters, saying \\"I never try to sell paintings, people have to ask me to buy them,\\" and prices were not displayed on the works on exhibition, nor in the catalogues.Brigid Cole-Adams, 'Art on the grand scale,' in The Age, Tuesday, 15 April 1980, p.21 = Administration = Baillieu remained director from 1971 until 1980. In 1976 Evi Robinson, as administrator, and Rhonda Senbergs, both partners of artists who exhibited there, joined her. Following her mother's death, in 1980 Baillieu sold the gallery to Pauline Wrobel for $365,000 (a value of $1,574,000 in 2019), and moved in 1981 to a studio house in Williamstown to paint full time,Lynette Fern, 'Galleries,' in The Sydney Morning Herald, Friday, 26 October 1990, p.16 becoming a finalist in the 1988 Archibald Prize with a controversial three- metre tall semi-abstract portrait of filmmaker Paul Cox which attracted further notoriety when it was cut and smeared by vandals.Louise Bellamy, 'Vandalism inspires art,' in The Age, Thursday, 23 November 1989, p.14 The gallery continued under the management of Wrobel and Robinson who retained most of the stable of artists. The scale of most paintings exhibited meant they were rarely purchased for domestic settings, so buyers were museums, public galleries, banks and corporations, and amongst the purchasers of artworks from Realities were Government departments including, for example, the Department of Home Affairs and Environment ($3,500 and $6,150 in 1982), and New South Wales Artbank ($11,900 in 1988, and $2,950 in 1989).  Closure  The gallery was forced by the economic recession in July 1992 to shut its doors, and on its announcement of closure Luba Bilu, Chair of the Australian Commercial Galleries Association, remarked that \\"important things had happened at Realities\\" which helped to establish its reputation for \\"honesty and integrity.\\"Rebecca Lancashire, 'Realities feels the bite of recession,' in The Age, Wednesday, 8 July 1992. p.16 The building was soldThe Age (Melbourne), 8 July 1992 for $840,000 in November 1992.

Hoffman, who described it in 1978. The puzzle consists of 27 identical rectangular cuboids, each of whose edges have three different lengths. Its goal is to assemble them all to fit within a cube whose edge length is the sum of the three lengths. writes that the first person to solve the puzzle was David A. Klarner, and that typical solution times can range from 20 minutes to multiple hours. Construction The puzzle itself consists only of 27 identical rectangular cuboid-shaped blocks, although physical realizations of the puzzle also typically supply a cubical box to fit the blocks into. If the three lengths of the block edges are , , and , then the cube should have edge length . Although the puzzle can be constructed with any three different edge lengths, it is most difficult when the three edge lengths of the blocks are close enough together that , as this prevents alternative solutions in which four blocks of the minimum width are packed next to each other. Additionally, having the three lengths form an arithmetic progression can make it more confusing, because in this case placing three blocks of the middle width next to each other produces a row of the correct total width but one that cannot lead to a valid solution to the whole puzzle. Mathematical analysis Each valid solution to the puzzle arranges the blocks in an approximate grid of blocks, with the sides of the blocks all parallel to the sides of the outer cube, and with one block of each width along each axis-parallel line of three blocks. Counting reflections and rotations as being the same solution as each other, the puzzle has 21 combinatorially distinct solutions. The total volume of the pieces, , is less than the volume of the cube that they pack into. If one takes the cube root of both volumes, and divides by three, then the number obtained in this way from the total volume of the pieces is the geometric mean of , , and , while the number obtained in the same way from the volume of the cube is their arithmetic mean. The fact that the pieces have less total volume than the cube follows from the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means. Higher dimensions A two-dimensional analogue of the puzzle asks to pack four identical rectangles of side lengths and into a square of side length ; as the figure shows, this is always possible. In dimensions the puzzle asks to pack identical blocks into a hypercube. By a result of Raphael M. Robinson this is again solvable whenever for two numbers and such that the - and -dimensional cases are themselves solvable. For instance, according to this result, it is solvable for dimensions 4, 6, 8, 9, and other 3-smooth numbers. In all dimensions, the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means shows that the volume of the pieces is less than the volume of the hypercube into which they should be packed. However, it is unknown whether the puzzle can be solved in five dimensions, or in higher prime number dimensions.

Early life and education M√ºller received his undergraduate degree from the Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel in Germany, followed by a PhD in Earth Science from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego California in 1993.  Career  After joining the University of Sydney as a lecturer in geophysics in 1993, M√ºller established the University of Sydney Institute of Marine Science (now the Marine Studies Institute) and built the EarthByte research group. He has been mainly active in research in the area of plate tectonics using GPlates software that has been developed under his leadership at the EarthByte group.  Research highlights  M√ºller leads an international research effort that developed and continues to refine a Virtual Earth Laboratory to develop custom software, workflows and research data to produce interactive, open- access models and visualisations of Earth's dynamic history, especially focused on the ocean basins. It has led to numerous discoveries that have transformed our fundamental understanding of the Earth's evolution, environments and geological resources. M√ºller leads the AuScope NCRIS-supported open-source GPlates software project (www.gplates.org) for plate tectonic reconstructions. GPlates, and its companion pyGPlates python library, have become the global de-facto standard for plate model construction and plate tectonic data analysis. It is specifically designed to generate time-dependent boundary conditions for geodynamic models to link plate motion and deformation to both deep Earth evolution as well as surface processes (erosion and sedimentation). The software has been used to create the first global plate including diffuse plate deformation in areas of crustal extension and shortening (M√ºller et al., 2019). Another companion software, pyBacktrack (M√ºller et al., 2018) allows the backtracking of the paleo-water depth of drill sites on ocean crust and tectonic subsidence analysis of wells on stretched continental crust, including the effect of mantle-convection-driven dynamic topography. This provides a framework for reconstructing the accumulation history of sediment components (lithologies) through time. In one of his most cited work, M√ºller led the construction of the first digital grid of the geological age of the world's ocean basins which became the resource for hundreds of publications. Using ocean basin reconstructions, his team showed that the ancient Izanagi mid-ocean ridge was destroyed when it plunged beneath an area stretching from Korea to north of Japan (Science, 2007). M√ºller also used reconstructions of the age-area distribution of the ocean basins to demonstrate that long-term sea-level variations over 100 metres in amplitude have been driven by plate tectonics and changing ocean basin volumes (Science, 2008). Using a combination of tectonic and geodynamic models he tackled a long-standing debate on how the Eastern Australian Highlands formed, by showing that they may result from the Australian plate wobbling over the convecting mantle (Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 2016). He used a similar approach to connect plate tectonic and mantle convection models with global sea-level models to reconstruct global surface dynamic topography through time (Gondwana Research, 2018) I. The good overall match between predicted dynamic topography patterns to geologically mapped paleo-coastlines is strong evidence that mantle-driven topographic change is a critical component of relative sea level change, and the main driving force for generating the observed geometries and timings of large-scale continental inundation through time. M√ºller‚Äôs group has developed spatial and spatio-temporal data mining across a wide range of areas. He applied internet-based data-mining algorithms to earthquake hazard mapping, finding that nearly all of the largest earthquakes of the past century have been associated with regions where oceanic fracture zones intersect deep-sea trenches (Solid Earth, 2012). Using spatio-temporal data mining, his team also constructed the first prospectivity map for Australian opal, revealing that it occurs where Cretaceous shallow seas and river systems alternated in Australia's Great Artesian Basin, followed by uplift (Computers and Geosciences, 2013). His team also used spatio-temporal data analysis to analyse the plate tectonic environments where copper-gold porphyry deposits are likely to form along convergent plate margins (Butterworth et al., 2016). M√ºller currently leads an Australian Research Council Industry Transformation Research Centre called the Basin Genesis Hub (2015‚Äì20) which has five industry and four university partners. The hub is undertaking the simultaneous modelling of deep-Earth and surface processes, from basin scale to individual sediment grains, and developing cutting-edge basin simulations for an improved understanding of the structure and evolution of sedimentary basins. The Basin Hub's recently developed Badlands software is now being used to simulate erosion and sedimentation, modelling the evolution of river systems and transport of terrigenous sediments into sedimentary basins through time in high resolution.

His research has influenced geoscience education of the public and universities. The global impact of GPlates on end-users is illustrated by the recent development of the powerful, interactive online GPlates portal allowing anyone to view global digital data sets of the ocean basins and visualise the plate tectonic evolution of the Earth. M√ºller has published more than 250 peer-reviewed articles, of which some appear in prestigious journals such as Nature, Nature Geoscience, Nature Communications Science, and Geology. His map of the age of the ocean basins has been incorporated into Microsoft's digital Encarta atlas, and four textbooks exhibited in museums in the US, Japan, and Austria. In 2015, M√ºller contributed a plate tectonic animation to NOAA (US) Science on a Sphere program, utilising their interactive 3D spherical projection systems that are installed at museums, universities and schools. In November 2019, he was listed among the top 14 highly cited researchers at the University of Sydney with h-index of 73 and more than 20,000 citations. Selected publications  * M√ºller, R.

It is currently owned by Penn National Gaming. History The Argosy opened in 1991 as a small riverboat casino named the Alton Belle owned by the Argosy Gaming Company and had 296 slot machines and 22 table games. It was replaced by a larger riverboat, the Alton Belle II, in 1993, and cruised for one hour to meet legal requirements. In 1999, when Illinois allowed casinos to be permanently moored, the riverboat no longer cruised the river, although the casino still remains on an actual boat. Unlike other competitors, the Argosy does not offer any lodging. Missouri allowed casinos in 1994, which quickly led to competition in the St. Louis metro area.

Qubeka (born 26 March 1979) is a South African film director, screenwriter, and producer. He has mostly worked on action, crime, and drama films that tell the story of post-apartheid South Africa, and has received multiple accolades, including Best Director at the 15th edition of the Africa Movie Academy Awards for Sew the Winter to My Skin. Personal life Qubeka was born in a Xhosa family in what used to be the nominally independent state of Ciskei. Although he was born during the apartheid era, he grew up in a relatively elite Black neighborhood, and stated that he \\"doesn‚Äôt have the weight of apartheid on his shoulders.\\" He describes his father as a cinephile who constantly watched movies. He states that Stanley Kubrick and Fritz Lang are among his biggest cinematic influences, but that he also enjoys comedy and is a huge fan of American comedian Eddie Murphy. He also stated that the 1982 Murphy-starring 48 Hrs. is one of his favorite films. Cinematic career Qubeka's 2013 film Of Good Report was originally chosen to open the Durban International Film Festival, but was announced that it was banned by the National Film and Video Foundation of South Africa for containing an \\"unethical\\" romance between a teacher and a student, constituting what the board said was \\"child pornography\\". This decision was later overturned after an appeal by the producers of the film. Of Good Report later won the 2014 Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Film. He won the award for Best Director for his action thriller Sew the Winter to My Skin at the 15th Africa Movie Academy Awards that were held in Lagos, Nigeria. Speaking on his 2019 film Knuckle City, Qubeka stated that he looked forward to mixing genres on his future film projects, and also spoke about the \\"toxic masculinity\\" that exists in South African culture. He is currently filming an action television show called Blood Psalms. It will star South African actress Thando Thabethe, Sello Maake Ka Ncube and Warren Masemola, and tells the story of an African queen who's battling a world-ending prophecy to navigate her people through politics and never-ending wars. He is also on the pre-production of two other projects, both directed by him, called The White Devil and Iron Mike. The latter being solely written by him. Not much is known about them as of August 2020. Reception Guy Lodge for Variety praised Qubeka's unique attempts of telling post-apartheid South Africa's story in film making that is not solely based on racial segregation, but violence and patriarchal sexuality. The adoption of black and white sequence of images, as opposed to colored, was also highlighted as adding a positive uniqueness to the film Of Good Report.

Groups which enforced different laws included the Whiteboys, Repeal Association, Ribbonmen, Irish National Land League, Irish National League, United Irish League, Sinn F√©in, and the Irish Republic during the Irish War of Independence. These alternative justice systems were connected to the agrarian protest movements which sponsored them and filled the gap left by the official authority, which never had the popular support or legitimacy which it needed to govern effectively. Opponents of British rule in Ireland sought to create an alternative system, based on Irish (rather than English) law, which would eventually supplant British authority. Background British law, a chief means of enforcing British rule in Ireland, was viewed as a foreign imposition rather than a legitimate authority. From the Anglo-Norman invasion to the beginning of the seventeenth century, common law coexisted with the indigenous Brehon law. The former predominated in English-controlled areas, and the latter in other regions; in some places, both systems coexisted. The law was written and court proceedings were held in English, at a time when Irish was the sole language of most Irish people. During the sixteenth century, the surrender and regrant system was intended to co-opt Gaelic chieftains and replace Gaelic customs with English property law. The Penal Laws restricted the civil rights of Catholics until they were repealed during the 1830s. British land law enforced the property rights of landowners, ignoring Irish customs such as tenant-right. The magistrates' courts were run by unpaid landlords and other members of the Protestant Ascendancy, rather than salaried civil servants. Trust in the judicial system was further eroded by the wrongful conviction and execution of Maolra Seoighe, a monolingual Irish speaker who could not understand the court proceedings, for the 1882 Maamtrasna murders. The British government never had the support or legitimacy it needed to effectively govern Ireland, which led to the emergence of alternative systems to fill that gap. Unwritten law The \\"unwritten law\\" or \\"unwritten agrarian code\\" was a deep-rooted idea among Irish smallholders that access to land for subsistence farming was a human right which superseded property rights and, regardless of titular ownership, the right to use land was hereditary and not based on the ability to pay rent. This concept had parallels in Brehon law, which did not recognize absolute property rights. Even a lord's demesne technically belonged to his entire sept. It was based on the idea that the land of Ireland rightfully belonged to the Irish people, but had been stolen by English invaders who claimed it by the right of conquest. Therefore, Irish tenants viewed the landlord‚Äìtenant relationship as inherently illegitimate and sought to abolish it. In the code's early version, practiced by the Whiteboys secret society beginning in the 1760s, it had a reactionary character which looked back to an era when there had supposedly been a reciprocal relationship between landlords and tenants. Later versions were friendly to capitalism, advocating a market economy in land and agricultural products without the \\"alien\\" landlord class. The idea of \\"unwritten law\\" was expressed and refined by the Young Ireland activist James Fintan Lalor (1807‚Äì1849), who insisted that the Irish people had allodial title to their own land. Lalor believed that a farmer had the first right to his crop for subsistence and seed, and only then could other claims be made on the harvest. Instead of landlords evicting tenants, Lalor preferred that the landlords‚Äî\\"strangers here and strangers everywhere, owning no country and owned by none\\"‚Äîbe served with a writ of ejectment. Lalor advised the Irish people to refuse \\"obedience to usurped authority\\" and resist English law, instead setting up their own government and \\"refus[ing] ALL rent to the present usurping proprietors\\". Lalor's writings were the basis of the agrarian code enforced by the Irish National Land League during the Land War in the 1880s. The tenets of the unwritten law appeared in \\"speeches, resolutions, placards, boycotts ... threatening letters and acts of outrage\\". Secret societies Ribbon society meeting in 1851 The Whiteboys were oath-bound secret societies in rural Ireland since the 1760s. The Threshers originated in County Mayo early in the nineteenth century and emphasized economic issues; its code regulated prices (including the price of potatoes), and demanded the reduction of the Church of Ireland's tithes and the Catholic Church's fees. Ribbon societies were first organized by poor Catholics during the 1810s. They began in northern Ireland to combat the Protestant Orange Order, but later expanded into agrarian agitation and spread southward. The Molly Maguires, who appeared in the 1840s, were often confused with Ribbonmen. Whiteboys and Ribbonism became synonymous with agrarian violence in general, and the secret societies which practiced it. The secret societies tended to pop up during agricultural depressions, and vanish in good economic times. According to American historian Kevin Kenny, the alternative law as understood by the rural poor is the most convincing explanation for the violence practiced by these societies. Rather than a civil war by the Irish against a supposedly alien landlord class, the violence was understood as retributive justice for violations of traditional landholding and land-use practices. The rural poor could be targets if they broke their oaths to the society or otherwise failed to act in solidarity with the unwritten law. Punishments ranged from digging up new pasture land in an effort to free it up for potato cultivation, tearing down fences on newly-enclosed areas, mutilating or killing livestock, to threats and attacks on landlords' agents and merchants judged to charge exorbitant prices. Murders occurred, but were rare. Although these societies did not systematically enforce their version of the law via a court system, a person accused of violating the code could be tried by their local society in absentia. According to Sir Thomas Larcom, \\"There are in fact two codes of law in force and in antagonism‚Äîone the statute law enforced by judges and jurors, in which the people do not yet trust‚Äîthe other a secret law, enforced by themselves‚Äîits agents the Ribbonmen and the bullet.\\" Repeal Association In July 1843, Daniel O'Connell announced that his mass-membership Repeal Association (for the repeal of the Acts of Union 1800) would set up a court system as part of its plan to create an Irish government. The courts would be staffed by magistrates who had been dismissed for their pro-Repeal opinions, and supplemented by individuals nominated by Repeal clergy and Repeal Wardens. John Gray, owner of the Freeman's Journal, drew up a detailed plan for a national court system based on existing districts; three or more arbiters would adjudicate cases, based on a majority vote. No court fees would be charged, and those who agreed to attend the court would be dismissed from the Repeal Association if they did not obey a verdict. After arbiters were appointed, the courts began to function by the end of October 1843. Their popularity threatened British rule in Ireland; O'Connell was arrested and charged with three counts of conspiracy in connection with the tribunals. The Repeal Association crumbled after the Great Famine (1845‚Äì1849), and the Ribbon Societies assumed its role as arbiters of land and wage disputes. Other arbitration courts were organized by local priests, who denied sacraments to those who did not observe a verdict. Contemporary Conservative commentators said that the societies were an alternative justice system; their activities were legal, as long as they did not compel attendance. Irish Republican Brotherhood After the unsuccessful 1867 Fenian Rising, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (a physical-force Irish republican group) formed a supreme council. Considering their \\"Irish Republic\\" the country's only legitimate authority, they passed a number of constitutions and laws. Violations were punished, and accused traitors were executed. Land League The Irish National Land League (1879‚Äì1882) was a nationally-organized agrarian protest society which sought fair rent, free sale, and fixity of tenure for small farmers and, ultimately, peasant ownership of the land they worked. Some of its local branches established arbitration courts in 1880 and 1881. Cases were typically heard by the executive committee, which would summon both parties, call witnesses, examine evidence presented by the parties, make a judgment and assign a penalty for violations of the code. Juries would sometimes be called from local communities, and the plaintiff was occasionally the prosecutor. The courts were modeled on British courts and, according to Western News, the Athenry Land League court docket exceeded that of its competing British court. American historian Donald Jordan emphasizes that despite their common-law trappings, the tribunals were essentially an extension of the local Land League branch and adjudicated violations of its own rules. The courts were described as a \\"shadow legal system\\" by British academic Frank Ledwidge. According to historian Charles Townshend, the formation of courts was the \\"most unacceptable of all acts of defiance\\" committed by the Land League. One of the League's main tactics was the boycott, whose most common target was \\"land grabbers\\". However, it did not invent the stratagem of ostracizing those who violated the rural code. Land League speakers (including Michael Davitt) advocated that the tactic be used instead of violence on those who seized land which had been worked by evicted tenants. The word \\"boycott\\" was coined later that year, after the successful campaign against unpopular land agent Charles Boycott. Although Boycott was forced to leave the country, the boycott's overall effectiveness was disputed and may have been overestimated by contemporary observers. Consequences of the boycott were described by Lord Fitzwilliam, a pro-landlord advocate, in 1882: \\"When a man is under the ban of the League no man may speak to him, no one may work for him; he may neither buy nor sell; he is not allowed to go to his ordinary place of worship or to send his children to school.\\" The use of \\"intimidation\\" to enforce a boycott was criminalized that year in the Prevention of Crime Act. In his 1892 book, Ireland under the Land League, Charles Dalton Clifford Lloyd described how the law's enforcement was difficult because many people refused to cooperate with the official justice system. Refusal to rent transportation equipment to the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) paralyzed the police in Kilmallock, and people turned to the Land League rather than magistrates to resolve disputes. If a person observed the official law, they were denounced for breaking the unwritten code. Lloyd complained that instead of petitioning the government for a change in the laws, \\"the Land League established laws of its own making, formed local committees for the government of districts, instituted into own local tribunals, passed its own judgements, executed its own sentences, and generally usurped the functions of the crown\\". Lloyd and other observers believed that the League was not just a competing government, but the only effective one in many parts of Ireland; a modern observer noted that \\"(t)here were areas of the country which simply could not be controlled by the British government.\\" In 1881, Chief Secretary for Ireland William Edward Forster said that Land League law was ascendant: Conservative jurist James Fitzjames Stephen wrote that boycotts amounted to \\"usurpation of the functions of government\\", and should be considered \\"the modern representatives of the old conception of high treason\\". The government passed the Protection of Persons and Property Act 1881, which provided for the detention without trial of anyone suspected of treasonous activity or who tried to subvert the rule of law, to combat the underground state. Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone had previously refused to suspend habeas corpus, saying that a Coercion Act would only be justified if Land League agitation threatened not only individuals but the state itself. National League The Irish National League (1882‚Äì1910) was a more-moderate association which replaced the Land League after the latter was suppressed. The key provisions of the National League's code forbade paying rent without abatements, taking over land from which a tenant had been evicted, and purchasing their holding under the 1885 Ashbourne Act (except at a low price). Other forbidden activities included \\"participating in evictions, fraternizing with, or entering into, commerce with anyone who did; or working for, hiring, letting land from, or socializing with, [a] boycotted person\\". The League enforced its code with informal tribunals, typically led by the leaders of local chapters. The National League's courts held their proceedings openly, and followed a common-law procedure. This was intended to uphold the League's image favouring the rule of law (Irish, rather than English law). Contemporaries considered the National League a legitimate authority. One Home Rule supporter, the Liberal parliamentary candidate Montague Cookson, said that home rule had already arrived: \\"The decrees of the Government of the Queen are set at naught in the three counties I have mentioned [Cork, Limerick, Clare], while those of the League are instantly and implicitly obeyed.\\" Magistrates and law-enforcement officials agreed with this assessment in their testimony to the Cowper Commission in 1886. According to historian Perry Curtis, the National League was \\"a self-constituted authority with powers parallel to those of the established government\\". United Irish League The United Irish League (1898‚Äì1910) was an agrarian protest organization based in Connacht, with branches throughout the country, which sought redistribution of land from graziers to smallholders and (later) compulsory purchase of land by tenants at favourable prices. After passage of the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903, the League campaigned for the sale of estates (including untenanted land) to tenants at low prices and the reduction of rent to the level of the annuities paid by new freeholders. The modus operandi of local UIL branches was to send young men to demand that graziers give up their land. If a compromise could not be reached, the grazier would be summoned to a meeting for his case to be considered. Refusal to attend resulted in the League's highest penalty: the boycott. UIL activists considered that grazing farms violated \\"unwritten law\\" because much of the land had been taken from evicted tenants; the fact that many graziers did not live on their holdings made it easier to brand them \\"land grabbers\\". Local UIL branches acted as courts, claiming jurisdiction over all matters relating to land in their area. People accused of violating the League's code would be summoned to a meeting with the plaintiff and the board of the local UIL chapter; evidence would be heard, a verdict reached and punishment imposed. The procedure was very similar to that used by British petty sessions. The plaintiff typically acted as prosecutor, following a strict procedural code. Defendants were given sufficient notice to prepare a defence, and were allowed to appeal compensation demanded by plaintiffs. Decisions made by a parish court could be appealed to an executive court. In 56 of 117 cases examined by Irish historian Fergus Campbell, the verdict was to censure the defendant; this typically led to a boycott. The appearance of fairness and impartiality was essential to encourage parties to bring their grievances to UIL courts, and the branches strove to maintain that image. Decisions were published in local nationalist newspapers, allowing UIL leaders to be accountable for their rulings. Campbell found no case in which a UIL court wrongly convicted an innocent man. Although the \\"law of the League\\" was partially derived from the central leadership's guidance and its 1900 constitution, local branches also pressured national leaders to include their own issues. The UIL's priorities shifted from anti-grazier agitation to land purchase. According to the police, their courts' verdicts were enforced by \\"boycotting, intimidation, and thinly veiled allusions in the Press\\". Police received reports of 684 boycotts and 1,128 cases of intimidation, about two- thirds of agrarian offences, between 1902 and 1908. Demonstrating the UIL courts' close connection to the concept of \\"unwritten law\\", the harshest penalties were reserved for \\"land-grabbers\\". After passage of the 1898 Local Government Act, which delegated some governmental powers to local elected councils, the UIL competed in local elections. It flew its flag over the court building if it was victorious, although such victories helped legitimize the British justice system. The courts were central to UIL agitation, because they dictated the targets and manner of agitation. Between October 1899 and October 1900, over 120 cases were heard. The inspector general said in 1907, \\"The law of the land has been openly set aside and the unwritten law of the League is growing supreme.\\" British historian Philip Bull described the UIL as a \\"proto- state\\". D√°il Courts The abstentionist Sinn F√©in party won the 1918 election in Ireland. The new Sinn F√©in party put arbitration courts into its program after its 1917 Ardfheis, and established them throughout the country. According to party leader Arthur Griffith, \\"It was the duty of every Irishman\\" to obey the arbitration courts rather than seek justice from British courts. The courts were favoured by Sinn F√©in because they adhered to the principle of self-reliance in all matters, and arbitration between two parties in a dispute was legal and binding when the participants agreed to abide by a verdict. Unlike the agrarian-society courts, Sinn F√©in's courts claimed jurisdiction over crime and enforced a written constitution. Adhering to the party's policy of abstentionism, Sinn F√©in MPs who were elected in the 1918 general election refused to take their seats in Westminster and set up the D√°il √âireann, a rival parliament. In August 1919, during the Irish War of Independence, the D√°il announced the formation of a national court system for its nascent Irish Republic. The system included local parish courts, district courts, and a court of appeal. Parish courts dealt with petty crime and civil cases under ¬£10, providing inexpensive and convenient access to justice. Local judges were elected and all officials received a salary, which cost the state an estimated ¬£113,000. The initial pretense of voluntary arbitration was dropped, and verdicts were enforced by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The resulting system had a high level of local initiative, with the D√°il exercising very little power. Because the maintenance of British rule had come to rely so heavily on the police and courts to enforce its power, the rest of the Republic's apparatus would have been a \\"pitiful charade\\" if the D√°il Courts had not become popular. Their operation was very similar to the British courts they replaced, and historian Mary Kotsonouris described them as \\"primarily concerned with the protection of property\\". The courts had a reputation for fairness, and even unionists respected their role in maintaining order. Known for their \\"conservative, almost reactionary character\\", they are \\"widely considered to be one of the greatest successes of the First D√°il\\". According to Irish unionist peer Lord Dunraven, The D√°il Courts also brought all subversive agrarian courts and IRA courts-martial, which had been operating in some areas after the withdrawal of the Royal Irish Constabulary, under the jurisdiction of the D√°il. The D√°il Courts refused to hear cases dealing with land issues, and in some cases the IRA was called in to remove squatters from private property. By 1921, those who used British courts were accused of \\"assisting the enemy in time of war\\". The IRA attacked everyone connected with the British judicial system, and declared that \\"every person in the pay of England (magistrates and jurors, etc.) will be deemed to have forfeited his life\\". Intimidation led many JPs to resign, and some RMs were assassinated. The RIC lost control of much of Ireland due to the Irish War of Independence, and rulings from British courts could not be enforced. Suppressed by the British government, the courts continued to operate underground. Their activity peaked during the July‚ÄìDecember 1921 truce, when they were busy dealing with ratepayers who failed to pay taxes to the Republic. As a result of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, the British courts were turned over to the Irish Free State. Count Plunkett requested a petition of habeas corpus for the detention without trial of his son, George (an anti-Treaty guerilla), in 1922 after the split between Irish nationalists over the treaty. The judge, Diarmuid Crowley, ordered the younger Plunkett's release; however, Crowley was arrested by the Free State government. The D√°il court system was shut down and declared illegal after this incident, although a commission was appointed to iron out the loose ends in open cases. The courts were officially abolished by the D√°il √âireann Courts (Winding Up) Act 1923.

It is owned by Gaming and Leisure Properties and operated by an employee-owned management company. History The Casino Queen in 2006 Illinois enacted a riverboat casino law in 1990 authorizing licenses for ten casinos to open around the state. One of the licenses was guaranteed to East St. Louis, in an effort to help the financially troubled city. The group that would ultimately open the Casino Queen, led by real estate developer Bill Koman, submitted its proposal to the Illinois Gaming Board in January 1992. With no other proposals before the board, Koman's group was awarded the license in May 1992. The Casino Queen opened on June 23, 1993. It was viewed positively by most city officials and residents, as the struggling city desperately needed both a revenue source and employment opportunities for its residents. Casino Queen originally operated on a boat called the White Star One. Construction of a hotel began in 1998. The 157-room hotel, built at a cost of $15 million, opened in January 2000. Changed regulations led to the casino to be moved inland, but still built above a shallow pit of water, in 2007. The move also allowed the casino to add 10,000 additional square feet of gaming space. In 2014, the White Star One was auctioned off and sold for $600,000. Casino Queen has generated over $160 million for the city of East St. Louis between 1993 and 2009. In 2012, Koman and his partners sold the Casino Queen for $170 million to a newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), which would steer the casino's profits into the retirement accounts of participating employees. In 2014, to pay down debt taken on to finance the purchase, the ESOP sold the real estate of the Casino Queen to Gaming and Leisure Properties for $140 million, leasing it back for $14 million per year. In 2020, the casino struck a deal with sports betting provider DraftKings to rebrand the property as DraftKings at Casino Queen. As part of the rebranding, Sevens sports bar will be gutted and re-built as a full sportsbook, and the casino will be integrated into DraftKings' mobile betting app. Property information The casino includes both 1,100 slots and 34 table games in its 38,000 square feet of gaming space. Per Illinois law and unlike neighboring Missouri casinos, it is not open 24 hours a day. Dining options include: the Market Street Buffet, Prime Steakhouse, Sevens, and Deli & Chips. Both a hotel and an RV Park are located on the Casino Queen property.

It is part of the Spearhead Range, which is a subset of the Garibaldi Ranges. It is situated southeast of Whistler, and south of Tremor Mountain, which is the highest point in the Spearhead Range. The Naden Glacier spreads out below the eastern aspect of the summit, the Macbeth Glacier lies below the south aspect, and the Curtain Glacier descends the northern slope. Precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from its glaciers drains into Fitzsimmons Creek which is a tributary of the Cheakamus River. Macbeth is most often climbed as part of the Spearhead Traverse. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1969 by P. Starr, E. Bass, B. Ellis, and P. Macec via the northeast ridge. The peak was named in 1964 by an Alpine Club of Canada climbing party, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth. The mountain's name was officially adopted on August 27, 1965, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Macbeth is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Macbeth.

A part of the village, about north of the main part of the city was used as an illegal landfill from 2003 to 2015 resulting in an ecological disaster. Disused landfill with toxic black fluid (2019) The village of Mavallipura had about a population of about 4500 with many involved in livestock rearing, grazing sheep, goat and cattle on the common grazing lands. Mavallipura was used from around 2003 to dump about four million tonnes of garbage (at about 1000 tonnes a day in that period) to become a large heap 40 m high and spread over several hectares. In the early years, the BBMP paid and signed a contract with a local farmer to dump garbage on his site, and it was discovered later that the land on which they dumped actually belonged to the Karnataka Forest Department. A larger plot of former grazing land was later leased out to a company called Ramky. The landfill was then operated by Ramky and garbage came from the Bangalore metropolitan authority or BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike). The company was set up in a position to handle 500 tons per day but even in the early days the inputs were as much as 1000 tons/day and rose to an estimated 3600 tons/day in 2015. In 2017, the garbage production of the city rose 4500 ton per day. The site was not identified by any administrative body based on public discussions and it was within the catchment of the Arkavathy river which flows into Kaveri which in turn supplies drinking water to the city of Bangalore. The toxic leachate from the unlined landfill site polluted the local lake and groundwater, resulting in deaths of villagers by kidney failure, cancer, and a range of illnesses. Burning of the garbage produced toxic fumes and flies were a major nuisance. The local population included many dalits and their voices were unheard. The open garbage attracted large scavenging birds like black kites resulted in a birdhit that caused the death of a pilot and posed a constant risk to Indian Air Force aircraft landing at the Yelahanka airbase. Livestock morbidity was high and after numerous complaints, the Karnataka Pollution Control Board took notice in 2012 and passed an order to stop the dumping.Karnataka pollution board halts dumping of Bengaluru's garbage at Ramky landfill. 24 July 2015. Down To Earth Magazine. This resulted in garbage accumulation within the city of Bangalore and a crisis was recognized in 2014. However the dumping continued and in August 2015, a protester from the village, which had decided to blockade the garbage trucks, died of shock after facing police.Mavallipura village resists attempts of Bengaluru municipal corporation to restart closed landfill. 4 July 2015. Down to Earth. The site operations were shut down only after being visited by a group of judges.

It is found in Australasia, including New Caledonia and Norfolk Island, and it has a wing-shaped abdomen armed with red and black spines. Description Female G. westringi have hard, shell-like abdomens that are about three times as wide (about 13 millimeters, without spines) as long (4 millimeters) and are flared upward at each end like a pair of wings. Their abdomens bear three pairs of spines. The front (anterior) pair are short, about 1 millimeter long, black, and point slightly forward. The middle (median) pair are black at the base and red for much of their length, with black tips. These median spines are about 4.5 millimeters long and curve back and slightly downward. The rear pair of spines are about 2 millimeters long. Female abdomens are marked with depressed black sigilla. Above, the front edge of the abdomen bears 10 sigilla in a curved row, the middle four relatively small and the outermost large and egg-shaped; the larger outer sigilla are also visible on the underside of the abdomen. Four sigilla form a trapezoid in the center of the upper abdomen, and another row traces the posterior edge. The sigilla may be surrounded by a pale yellow color. The male of this species has not been scientifically described. Taxonomy and distribution The first scientific description of this species by Keyserling in 1864 did not include a place of origin for the species. In 1865 and 1871, similar descriptions were published based on specimens from New Caledonia (as G. laeta) and Australia. In 1871, Koch also described a species from New Caledonia that he called G. mollusca, noting that it the specimen may have been a freshly molted individual. In 1889, A.T. Urquhart published a description of an orb-weaver from Norfolk Island, which he named G. ocillatum, noting its close similarity to G. westringi but not explaining why it warranted species status. In 1914, Friedrich Dahl provisionally united all these descriptions under G. westringi, noting that further research across the region was needed to clarify the status of different forms. In 1911, Embrik Strand briefly named a species, G. wogeonis, from Vokeo in the Schouten Islands (Papua New Guinea), writing that it was separable from G. westringi by shorter spines and smaller sigilla. Apparently based on this comment, Dahl also provisionally synonymized G. wogeonis with G. westringi, without specific comment. However, in 1915, Strand published a more detailed description and an illustration of G. wogeonis that depicted a small-spined, reddish-colored, less elongate form quite unlike any other description of taxa included by Dahl in G. westringi. Popular culture Gasteracantha westringi was featured on a 2004 Norfolk Island postage stamp series. The stamp series stated that the species is locally known as the red-horned spider and is commonly found on Norfolk and nearby Phillip Island.

He was formerly a YouTuber before his channel was permanently suspended in February 2020 for violating YouTube's hate speech policy. He describes himself as a nationalist and paleoconservative and is said to hold white nationalist and antisemitic views. Fuentes has feuded with Turning Point USA and its founder, Charlie Kirk, for supporting views that Fuentes believes to be insufficiently conservative. On October 29, 2019, his followers, known as Groypers, began heckling Turning Point's Culture War Tour, including a speaking event for Donald Trump Jr. Career and views Fuentes hosts the podcast America First with Nicholas J. Fuentes. On the show, Fuentes strongly opposes immigration, which he believes is a demographic threat to the United States. He has spoken out against the \\"LGBT agenda\\", and describes transgender people and same-sex marriage as \\"deviancy\\". Fuentes attended the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, and spoke positively of a \\"tidal wave of white identity\\" afterwards. On his show in April 2017, Fuentes said \\"Who runs the media? Globalists. Time to kill the globalists\\" and \\"I want the people that run CNN to be arrested and deported because this is deliberate.\\" Fuentes also said that \\"The First Amendment was not written for the Saudi Royal Family\\". The publisher of the show at the time, RSBN issued an apology, calling the comments \\"unacceptable\\" and \\"inappropriate\\". Following these and other comments, as well as publicity over his attendance of the Unite the Right rally, he left RSBN in August 2017. He co-hosted the Nationalist Review podcast with James Allsup until January 2018. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \\"the two had a public falling out with each host accusing the other of laziness, impropriety and a variety of petty slights.\\" In January 2019, Fuentes aired a monologue in which he compared the Holocaust to a cookie-baking operation, which has led to accusations of Holocaust denial. Fuentes later disputed that he had ever denied the Holocaust, calling his monologue a \\"lampoon\\". Fuentes has repeatedly criticized Turning Point USA and its founder Charlie Kirk, accusing them of betraying Donald Trump by advocating in favor of mass legal immigration, support in foreign aid for Israel and LGBT issues. Throughout October and November 2019, his supporters were present at many of Kirk's public speaking events, which have had guest speakers including Donald Trump Jr., Lara Trump, and Kimberly Guilfoyle. These campaigns frequently involved asking questions that prompt viewers to look up far-right and anti-semitic conspiracy theories and hoaxes online. As a result of this campaign the majority of right-wing mainstream politicians and pundits as well as mainstream conservative media disavowed Fuentes. In December 2019, Fuentes confronted conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro, who was with his family at the time, outside of a TPUSA event in West Palm Beach, Florida. Fuentes had confronted Shapiro to ask why he had given a speech at Stanford University bashing Fuentes. The encounter was filmed and led to criticism of Fuentes.Petrizzo, Zachary (December 21, 2019). \\"Nick Fuentes Trying to Bicker with Ben Shapiro Riles Up the Internet (updated).\\" The Daily Dot. Retrieved June 7, 2020. In January 2020, Fuentes' YouTube channel was demonetized and one of his videos was removed by YouTube as a violation of their hate speech policies. Fuentes had previously been banned from Twitch and from Reddit. On February 14, 2020, his YouTube channel was terminated for violating policies on hate speech. He has received support from conservative commentator Michelle Malkin, who agreed to speak at Fuentes' \\"America First Political Action Conference\\" in February 2020. As a result of supporting him, in November 2019 Malkin was promptly fired by the Young America's Foundation where she had been employed for 28 years. As of January 2020, Fuentes live- streams on DLive, where he is the most-viewed account on the platform, according to Time magazine. In June 2020, Fuentes attended a George Floyd protest in Queen Creek, Minnesota alongside Unite the Right attendee and meme creator Matthew Colligan, as well as far-right student activist Jaden NcNeil. After initiating an altercation that led to a black protester taking away Colligan's sign (which read \\"I can't read\\") and glasses, Fuentes told the protesters that police would \\"kneel on that guy's neck for taking my friend's glasses\\". Personal life Fuentes attended Lyons Township High School where he was president of the Student Council. In August 2017, he left Boston University after attending the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. He applied for transfer admission to Auburn University for the Fall 2017 term, but did not confirm his enrollment on time. Fuentes is Catholic and partially of Hispanic descent.

In baseball, sign stealing is the observing and relaying, through legal and illegal methods, of the signs being given by the opposing catcher to the pitcher or a coach to a base runner. The signs are stolen by the opposing team and then relayed to the other members of the team to give advance knowledge of what kind of pitch is coming next, thereby giving that batter an advantage. Legal sign stealing typically involves the signs being observed by a runner on second base and then relayed to the batter through some sort of gesture. Illegal sign stealing involves mechanical or electronic technology; the rules regarding this have become more stringent over time and continue to evolve. Sign stealing has been in practice almost since the game's origin in the 19th century, and has continued to be used in recent times. Legality According to the unwritten rules of baseball, stealing the signs that are given by the third base coach, or those of the catcher by a baserunner on second base, is acceptable, and it is up to the team giving the signs to protect them so they are not stolen. Even so, pitchers may retaliate when they believe their signs are being stolen with a brushback pitch. On the other hand, a batter peeking in to see the catcher's signs is definitely not tolerated. The signs the catcher sends to the pitcher to call for the next pitch are considered more \\"sacred\\" than the signs a third base coach relays to the batter. Stealing signs is not necessarily a violation of Major League Baseball's (MLB) rulebook; it depends how the signs are stolen. At the December 1961 Winter Meetings, the National League banned the use of a \\"mechanical device\\" to steal signs. The use of electronic equipment is not specifically forbidden by MLB rules, but in 2001, Sandy Alderson, while serving as executive vice president for baseball operations of MLB, issued a memorandum stating that teams cannot use electronic equipment to communicate with each other during games, especially for the purpose of stealing signs. Before the 2019 season, in an effort to reduce illegal sign stealing, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred instituted specific prohibitions on where teams could position cameras and how instant replay officials can communicate with managers. Notable incidents = 19th century = The oldest recorded instance of a team attempting to steal signs dates back to 1876, when the Hartford Dark Blues hid a person in a shack to tip off their hitters when the pitcher would throw a curveball. In 1897, George Stallings, the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, had Morgan Murphy, a backup catcher, hide in a clubhouse beyond center field with a binocular and a telegraph that he used to alert Stallings to what pitch the opposing catcher was calling. In 1900, Murphy was again used to steal signs with Phillies coach Pearce Chiles, stood on a box with electric wires that relayed to him coded messages in the form of electrical buzzes about what pitch was coming, which he communicated to the batters by stomping on the ground. He would get 1 buzz for a fastball, 2 for a curveball, and 3 for a changeup. No action was taken against any involved in these early sign stealing incidents. = 20th century = In 2001, members of the 1951 New York Giants admitted to stealing signs against the Brooklyn Dodgers using a telescope to win the National League that season. They came back from 13 1/2 games behind 10 weeks before the postseason to win the pennant using this technique. Bobby Thomson, who hit the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\", denied being tipped off to that pitch. On May 26, 1959, despite the Milwaukee Braves bullpen stealing catcher Smokey Burgess's signs, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix threw 12 perfect innings before losing the game in the 13th. The only Braves player not to accept the signs was Hank Aaron. In March 1962, newly acquired Mets pitcher Jay Hook accused his previous team, the 1961 National League champion Reds, of stealing signs throughout the season with help from former Reds pitcher Brooks Lawrence, stationed inside Crosley Field's scoreboard. Lawrence denied the charge, and Reds manager Fred Hutchinson, when asked if he would either confirm or deny the allegation, replied simply, \\"No. No comment.\\"Associated Press (March 21, 1962). \\"Cincinnati Used Signal Stealing Tactics Last Season, Says Hook\\". The Burlington Free Press. Retrieved March 3, 2020. Forty years later, Hook's story was indirectly corroborated by another member of the '61 Reds, pitcher- author Jim Brosnan, discussing the disappointing home field performance by Reds hitters during the 1961 World Series, despite having Lawrence \\"up in the left-centerfield scoreboard, stealing every sign the Yankee catchers gave.\\"Lally, Richard (2002). Bombers: An Oral History of the New York Yankees. New York, NY; Crown Publishers. .Kalb, Elliott (2007). The 25 Greatest Sports Conspiracy Theories. New York, NY: Skyhorse Publishing. Despite this confirmation, there were no consequences to those involved. =21st century= Technology has been a component in most recent sign stealing incidents.  2017 Houston Astros scandal  After the 2019 season, Mike Fiers alleged that the 2017 Houston Astros used technology to illegally steal their opponents' signs and relay them to their hitters. MLB and the Astros opened an investigation into the allegation, and it was expanded to encompass the 2018 and 2019 seasons. On January 13, 2020, Rob Manfred announced that MLB's investigation confirmed that the Astros illegally used a video camera system to steal signs during their 2017 and 2018 seasons. The organization was penalized with a $5 million fine, forfeiture of first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021, and the suspension of general manager Jeff Luhnow and field manager A. J. Hinch for one year; Luhnow and Hinch were subsequently fired by the team the same day. Three days after the Astros penalties were announced, the New York Mets and Carlos Beltr√°n (an Astros player at the time of the scandal) mutually parted ways. Beltr√°n had been hired as the team's new manager on November 1, 2019, so at the time of the announcement he had never managed a game for the team. Beltr√°n was the only player specifically named in MLB's report on the Astros scandal. While he was not directly linked to any prohibited activity, he was one of several Astros players who met during that season to discuss improvements in their sign stealing.  2018 Red Sox  On January 7, 2020, the Boston Red Sox were implicated in another sign stealing scandal after three unnamed team members told The Athletic that the Red Sox had used their replay room to steal signs of opposing teams during the 2018 season. On January 13, 2020, Manfred stated that he would determine the appropriate punishment for Red Sox manager Alex Cora, who was also implicated in the Astros scandal, when the investigation was completed. The next day, Cora and the Red Sox mutually agreed to part ways; Dave Dombrowski, the general manager who hired Cora, was dismissed from the Red Sox before the 2018 sign stealing scandal was made public. On January 29, 2020, Masslive reported that the results of the MLB investigation against the Red Sox would be released before the start of training camp and as early as the following week. However, a person with knowledge of the probe, speaking on anonymity, told the Associated Press that the Red Sox investigation will take longer than expected and will not be concluded at the start of training camp as previously hoped. On February 4, 2020, MLB Network journalist Peter Gammons reported that former Red Sox player Chris Young told him that he was the mastermind of the Red Sox Apple Watch scheme, telling him \\"I started the whole Apple Watch thing. I got it from when I was with the Yankees.\\" Young later denied this, and Gammons issued a retraction on Twitter. SNY revealed that Young had been interviewed by MLB officials as part of the 2017 investigation against the Red Sox and that multiple sources told the sports news agency that Young was in fact a leader of the team's 2017 Apple Watch scheme. The same year, a phone conversation between Yankees pitching coach Larry Rothschild and replay room officials revealed that the Yankees engaged in sign stealing with an Apple Watch as well, which resulted in the Yankees being fined.  Reactions to sign stealing  Nothing Personal host David Samson and Fox Sports Radio's Jonas Knox have said they believe this type of cheating is widespread throughout the sport.  Notable sign stealers  Many players and coaches throughout baseball history have been considered the best at sign stealing. Some of these players known for sign stealing are Del Baker, Joey Amalfitano, and Joe Nossek. Pitcher Al Worthington had a religious objection to sign stealing, and quit both the 1959 Giants and the 1960 White Sox because of the teams' sign stealing. Manager Whitey Herzog was known to complain about other teams stealing signs. After a game where the Brewers were found to be sign stealing using their mascot Bernie Brewer, he reportedly said, \\"Maybe we should put a Texas Ranger or somebody out there and shoot a gun or something when a curveball is coming,\\" referring to the incident.

During his time in China, he was thought highly of by Banzai Rihachir≈ç of the Kwantung Army, and he worked hard to learn the Chinese language and archery.

At the age of 20, Kohinata was to head to Ulan Bator in Mongolia, but he was attacked and captured by mounted bandits. He claimed his father's surname was Shao, and that he was a half-Chinese and half-Japanese person trying to find his father.

A north/south route, it connects the industrial suburbs of the East Rand in Johannesburg (Ekurhuleni) with the southern suburbs of Pretoria. It is an alternative route to the R21 freeway. Route The M57 begins at a 4-way- junction with the R29 and M37 in Primrose (north of Germiston City Centre). It starts by going east-north-east as Pretoria Road and crosses the N12 Highway (Johannesburg-Witbank Highway) as Kraft Road. Just after the N12 junction, it reaches a junction with the M44 North Reef Road in the industrialised suburb of Elandsfontein. It joins the M44 Road eastwards up to the next junction, where it becomes its own road northwards. It heads northwards as Jet Park Road through the suburb of Jet Park and then becomes Kraft Road again just before the M41 Griffiths Road t-junction, which leads to the R21 freeway and to the South African Airways headquarters in the east. Briefly following the R21 freeway northwards (parallel), it passes through Isando to its left and the outskirts of O.R. Tambo International Airport to its right. It meets the M99 Electron Avenue, which provides an entrance into the Airport. It then, as a flyover, crosses the R24 freeway as Pretoria Road and shortly after it meets the eastern terminus of the M16 Andre Greyvenstein Road as it enters the suburb of Rhodesfield in Kempton Park. Now, as Pretoria Road, it is the main road through Kempton Park's CBD and is intersected from the east by the M32 at Albatross Street (Pomona Road) and the two are cosigned for 400 metres before the M32 turns left as Plane Road and the M57 continues northwards through the CBD of Kempton Park. Crossing the M90 C.R.Swart Drive at Kempton Park Civic Center, it leaves the Kempton Park CBD and enters the city's northern suburbs, with Edleen to its left and Kempton Park extension 2, 3 and 4 to its right. After the M45 Van Riebeeck Road t-junction, it has Allen Grove to its right and Van Riebeeck Park to its left. After the Beukes Road t-junction, it has Glen Marais to its right and Birchleigh to its left. East of Birchleigh, it meets the M43 (Vlei Street) at a t-junction. North-east of Birchleigh, near Esselen Park on the outskirts of Kempton Park, the route is intersected at a t-junction by the R23 High Road to the east and then, at the next junction, by the R25 to the west as Modderfontein Road. The R25 and M57 are cosigned northwards for 800 metres, with Esselen Park and the new Witfontein extension to its left, before the R25 breaks-off and heads east towards Bapsfontein at a busy 4-way-junction, with the road westwards providing access to Tembisa South. Continuing northwards, the M57 trails the Tembisa township to its west and the parallel R21 freeway to its east before intersecting the east/west R562 Olifantsfontein Road as Goedehoop Avenue in Tembisa North. It then passes through Clayville (also known as Olifantsfontein) (passing through Clayville East) and through rural agricultural suburbs before crossing the municipal border into Tshwane and reaching the outskirts of Irene, crossing to the other side of the R21 freeway as a flyover. Crossing the M31 Nellmapius Drive, it enters Rietvalleipark and afterwards, it enters Elarduspark, becomes Boeing Street and the M57 ends shortly thereafter at a t-junction with the M10 Solomon Mahlangu Drive at Waterkloof in Pretoria.

Stemming from a celebratory procession by local Hindu groups, it was the most destructive riot in the wake of concurrent Hindu nationalist campaigns, which eventually led to the demolition of Babri Masjid. The riots were also characterized by phases of passive and active complicity of the state machinery. Official estimates put the death-toll at 87; unofficially, the count varies from around 200 to 300.  Background  Amrita Basu et al. notes that there was a near-total absence of any communal riots at Bijnor before 1988. :* A near-duplicate version of this article was also published over :* Another near-duplicate version of this article has been published over A few distinct events manifested across the politico-religious sphere in the following years, that led to the gradual build-up of animosity and did serve as a precursor to the riots. = Municipal elections = In the 1988 municipal elections, a Muslim lawyer - Zafar Khan, from BSP was elected as the chair, having defeated Sandip Lal, a fellow Hindu contender from BSP, who was also backed by BJP. Effectively, it was more of a religious fight than political. Notwithstanding the demographic skew against Hindus, Lal was poorly educated and corrupt (contra Khan) and his history of switching political allegiances drastically hampered his chances; the election also saw a lower voter turnout among Hindus. Soon enough, the elected Hindus in the council (most of whom were prominent faces of communal outfits) accused Khan of being partisan in the distribution of funds and appointments at key posts including Vice Chairman, which was traditionally allotted to opposition. The claims of fund misuse and partisan appointments have been since located to be entirely unfounded; a Muslim was illegally installed as the Vice Chairman, in absence of Khan, via a conspiracy hatched by the Hindu councilors. Along while, there were multiple attempts to bring a no-confidence motion against Khan esp by weaponizing the nominated members, but none managed to succeed esp that he was close to Mulayam Yadav, the then-chief minister from BSP (who changed nominated members at will). The last such attempt was in June 1990. = Property dispute = In around July 1990, there was a huge fracas about the fate of vacant land adjoining a mosque. The Hindu councilors along with local members of RSS claimed that the property belonged to a Hindu, who was settled elsewhere but failed to pay taxes. On notification by the municipality of pending usurpation, he did pay the dues but yet Khan had evicted him to unilaterally allot the property to a Muslim, who was supposedly planning to inaugurate a beef shop. A local daily The Bijnor Times, (which was promised with favors by Lal, shall he were elected) heavily aided in the amplification, so as to discredit Khan. The allegations were unfounded in that the municipality owned the land, since long back and there was only a single request for renting out the property, which the entire council had approved of. On 25 August, a group of Hindus, led by Bajrang Dal, occupied the property and were soon reinforced in large numbers, as rumors spread of an impending attack by Muslims. After a bout of stone-pelting between the communities, local police vacated the property by force and arrested the agitating Hindus. An old Muslim woman was killed by a ricocheting bullet and another Muslim died in the hospital, later. In light of the volatile situation, the municipality temporally stalled the scheduled land-allocation, in what was conceived as a victory by the Hindus. = Ram-jyotis = In the wake to the Babri Masjid demolition, VHP organised a cross-state tour, wherein karsevaks went about in a procession with flame-torches and sought to rekindle the Hindu spirit. The then BSP government chose to prohibit them from entering the town by installing a barricade over the lone entry-bridge, fearing communal disturbances. In response, thousands of Hindu women formed into a flash mob, stormed the bridge in active defiance of state orders, and enabled the Ram- jyotis into the town. This proved to be a major turning point as to the inclusion of women in physical manifestations of Hindu nationalism, and for the female-inflicted violence, that would form a major part of the Bijnor riot. = Communal harmony rally = The relations further deteriorated when the-then chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav held one of the many 'communal- harmony rally' at Bijnor on 9 October 1990. Poised as an antidote to RSS-BJP processions in the wake of Ayodhya, it was widely attended by Muslims from across nearby districts. Incidentally, Lal was the chief organiser, whilst Khan chose to boycott it, fearing a flare-up of tensions. In the speech, Mulayam vowed to protect the Babri Masjid and spoke about unity between Muslim and Backward Classes against Savarna Hindus. The speech was perceived to be inflammatory by Hindus and widespread violence followed soon afterward. Muslims were heckled to prevent attending the rally and their vehicles were attacked, whilst returning during night; effigies of Mulayam were burnt by a combine of BJP and ShivSena, as well. The district president of VHP was attacked, in what has been since alluded to an internal conspiracy for the sake of rumor-mongering, by local intelligence agencies. Three people (two Hindus and one Muslim) died and thirty shops were subject to loot and arson, in the aftermaths; bomb blasts were frequently heard around the town and the local marketplace was closed for four days. Ninety-five people (sixty-five Hindus and thirty Muslims) were arrested but soon released due to continuous protests by the Hindu populace, who accused the authorities of minority appeasement.  Riot  = Course =  Build up  The initial destruction of Babri Masjid was planned on 30 October 1990. The karsevaks started to arrive by 25th and pursuant to instructions of Mulayam Yadav, were subject to mass-incarcerations; by 26th, 637 were already arrested and that local prisons were filled up, a girls' intermediate college was transformed to a temporary prison. Securities at the latter facility were minimal and they wandered out to the town, with ease. Schools and colleges chose to announce indefinite closure, in light of the communally polarized environment. Public assemblies were banned soon afterwards.  Immediate trigger  On 30 October, the detained karsevaks assembled at an Arya Samaj temple, in the town square with local VHP members, in anticipation of the demolition. At around 11 a.m., a police officer reached the temple and spread misleading news, supposedly referenced from BBC, about the procession having reached Ayodhya and started with the planned destruction. Within an hour, a several-hundred strong victory procession made its way through a Muslim locality of the town and engaged in provocative sloganeering; the slogans were strikingly similar to those used in previous communal riots. Local Hindus however, rejected the claims and asserted of singing devotional songs, only. The administration did not choose to not pay any heed to multiple calls for action on the initial congregation, which was a violation of the imposed prohibition on public assembly or on preventing its passage through the Muslim quarters. Amidst this volatile atmosphere, a local Muslim doctor ‚Äì Mushir Ahmed ‚Äì chose to keep open his dispensary. After the Muslims started pelting stones at the Hindu rally; Ahmed chose to shelter a few Hindu women at the forefront of the rally, who were caught in the cross-fire. The Hindus in the rally however suspected Ahmed of abducting those women, and he was murdered. This served as the immediate basis for the riot that was to follow. As his dead body was taken back to home, the local Muslims attacked a Hindu neighborhood of Joggis, a lower caste among Hindus, and retaliation followed soon. By evening, 48 were killed.  Curfew and state-complicity  The state responded by declaring a town-wide curfew at around 1:30 AM on 31 October and deploying Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC). However, they were heavily partisan and effectively allowed the Hindus, to go on a rampage looting and burning down Muslim shops whilst restricting the Muslims to their houses; PAC later claimed of being accompanied Hindu nationalists, only as to their inability to maneuver in an alien territory. Basu notes that post the installation of a curfew, it was no longer a symmetric warfare but state-assisted and perpetrated mass-violence against Muslims, which continued unabated till 3 October. The-then editor of Dainik Jagran argues that the relatively one-sided violence perpetrated by Muslims in Bartwaan had de-professionalized the state-forces in entirety and raked in a communal mobocracy. There were numerous instances of the PAC torturing, physically violating and executing Muslims, whilst accompanied by local Hindu residents. Looting and arsons of Muslim houses were extensively facilitated, as well. 5 mosques were destroyed, per local reports. = Spread = The riots were mostly restricted to urban Bijnor but sporadic bursts of violence were reported from some adjoining villages esp. in Rampur Bakli. Agricultural equipment et al. were destroyed, in addition to torture, rape and summary executions.  Closure  The entire city was handed over to the Army on 3 November, who finally reined in the riot. Curfew timings were gradually relaxed, before being withdrawn all-together after 10 days. During the span, outsiders, even the local legislator were not allowed in. By mid- November, normalcy was restored. Official estimates put the death-toll at 87; unofficially, the count varied from around 200 to 300. = Local media coverage = The local media (esp. Bijnor Times) were actively complicit in contributing to the proliferation of rumors and sustaining the riot, via mis- reporting and partisan editorializing. There was extensive pro-Hindu bias and the reporting during riots, were essentially Islamophobic. Bijnor Times initially blamed the Muslims for stone-pelting on a peaceful procession by Hindus, and deemed the riots to be pre-planned by the local Muslim populace. It soon changed its narrative and alleged of outsiders to have instigated the riots; this was also readily accepted by the local administration. The paper also inflated the death toll, on the side of Hindus and alleged of police appeasement, towards the Muslims.  Aftermath  The entire administration was subject to a complete overhaul, soon. Pro-active policing was relied upon along with peace-building measures, to prevent any recurrence. The town has not been witness to any riot, since. The next elections for state as well as national legislature were won by BJP with percentage-totals of 53 and 47 respectively.  Analysis  The riot has been deemed to be the most destructive riot in the wake of concurrent Hindu nationalist campaigns. Jeffery argues that the riots primarily arose from pre-existing negative stereotyping of Muslims by the Hindu populace which reached a tipping point around November 1990, guided by the broader political sentiments of militant Hindu mobilization under BJP and aggressive responses by the BSP government in state; once the riots started there was a cycle of retaliation, further confirmation of prejudices and further retaliation, effectively leading to an unchecked cycle of positive feedback. Jeffery failed to locate any standing in the economic sphere, though. He noted that local explanations varied from claiming of the riot being organised and perpetuated in entirety by outsiders to blaming the local Muslims and Khan. All the sides commonly blamed the state machinery for adding to the riots, though. Some gave justifications based on intersection of caste and religion, as well. Jeffery did note that a combination of all these factors, contributed to the riots, as well. Basu, however, argues that the causes ought be located in the intersection of social, political as well economic planes. Almost all the Hindus interviewed by Basu, in the aftermath of the riots, squarely blamed Khan, for communalizing the regional politics and even instigating the riots, contrary to all available evidence. The political need of the Hindus to exert themselves in the local municipal council and thus, gain greater control over economy, aided in the manifestation of the riot. Khan's success in forging a Muslim+Lower-caste electoral base under BSP's aegis and transgression of rigid social boundaries, also hampered the social goal of BJP to subsume all Hindus under the fold of Hindutva, thus hampering larger political prospects in the region. This was since reflected in BJP playing integral roles in building up the volatile atmosphere up till the riots.

Cast  * Gemini Ganesan * Sowcar Janaki * Vanisri * R. S. Manohar  Production  Though Savitri's Telugu film Chinnari Papalu (1968) was a box-office bomb, it received critical acclaim; this prompted her to remake it in Tamil as Kuzhandhai Ullam. Savitri, in addition to directing, produced it under Sri Savitri Productions, and wrote the screenplay while M. Lakshmanan wrote the dialogues. Singh and Sekhar, the cinematographers of the original, returned in their positions.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by S. P. Kodandapani, and the lyrics were written by Kannadasan.  Release and reception  Kuzhandhai Ullam was released on 14 January 1969, during Pongal. The Indian Express wrote on 25 January, \\"[Savitri] has on the whole weaved a fairly appealing product though old-fashioned in style and treatment.\\" The film was an average success.

She is best known as one of the founding journalists of the now Alice Springs News Online as well as for her book Trouble: On Trial in Central Australia. Her next book Peace Crimes: Pine Gap, national security and dissent is due to be published in August 2020.  Biography  Finnane has an educational background in arts and film studies and completed her studies at the University of Sydney and the University of Paris (Panth√©on-Sorbonne). Following the completion of her studies she worked in television before moving to Alice Springs in 1987. In 1994 Finnane and husband Erwin Chlanda founded the Alice Springs News and it soon became the largest circulation independent newspaper in the Northern Territory. In 1997 the newspaper shifted from printed to online publication and became the Alice Springs News Online. Finnane is also a regular contributor to publications around Australia including the Alice Springs News Online, Art Monthly Australasia, Artlink, Griffith Review, Inside Story and The Saturday Paper. In 2016 Finnane released her first book Trouble: on Trial in Central Australia which was published by UQP. This book examines the complexities of life in Alice Springs, particularly the Alice Springs Town Camps, and what is revealed in the criminal court. This book attempts to dispassionately present the horrors of crimes committed in Central Australia and it is particularly focused on the violence of Aboriginal men, under the influence of alcohol, towards their kin; their wives, brothers and cousins and loved ones more generally. Barry Hill says of Trouble: Finnane's second book, Peace Crimes: Pine Gap, national security and dissent is due to be published in August, 2020. This book will look at the closely guarded and secretive military facility called Pine Gap, close by to Alice Springs, with a particular focus on the arrest of the Peace Pilgrims, nonviolent activists. One of the activists, Paul Christie, voluntarily dropped to his knees when arrested, two km's within the boundary of Pine Gap, holding flowers and a ceremonial rattle only to be charged and prosecuted under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952; a procedure normally intended for offences such as treason, espionage and terrorism- related matters. Finnane won Watch This Space's annual Lofty Award in 2013 for her contribution to arts writing and criticism in Central Australia.

The Chapel of the Virgen del Rosario is the chapel attached to the Church of Santo Domingo in the city of Puebla, Puebla, Mexico. Work of the 17th century, summit of the New Spanish Baroque, was described in its time as the Eighth Wonder of the World by Friar Diego de Gorozpe, in a print of 1690, regarded like this for a long time in the New Spain, as well as La Casa de Oro (The Golden House) and Domus Aurea. It is one of the most prominent examples of the New Spanish Baroque and one of the greatest artistic-religious achievements in Mexico. It is a chapel full of symbolisms, where each element represents something related to the Catholicism and Dominican Order beliefs. It is located on pedestrian avenue 5 de Mayo number 407. The building is part of the Historic Center of Puebla City, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1987. History Plan of the chapel. Decoration details at the Chapel of the Rosario The cult of the Our Lady of the Rosary was promoted by the Dominican Order, who dedicated in each of their convents a chapel to their devotion. In Mexico it was no exception when the first religious of the order arrived in 1526, but it was not until the year of 1531 when they began the construction of their first important church in Puebla, which is also dedicated to the Archangel Michael however the Chapel of the Rosario was conceived until 1650 and completed and consecrated on 16 April 1690. It was the first in Mexico dedicated to the Our Lady of the Rosary. Its construction served a double purpose: to worship the Virgin and teach the faithful the prayer of the Holy Rosary. It was conceived by the Dominican Friar Juan de Cuenca, who in 1650 began its construction, but given the magnitude of the work, until 1690 it was completed by two other Dominicans Friar Agust√≠n Hern√°ndez and Friar Diego de Gorozpe, who they dedicated the distinguished bishop of the Puebla of the Council of His Majesty Manuel Fern√°ndez de Santa Cruz, and celebrating its consecration on April 16, 1690, to coincide with the date on which the City of Puebla de los √Ångeles was founded. The celebration lasted 8 days (La Octava), pronouncing in each of them a sermon, processions, masses and events turning it into a great stage of joy. The determined impulse to the teaching of the Holy Rosary and the favorite devotion to the Virgin of Our Lady of the Rosary, which was given to them in the 17th century, explains the complexity of the great work, which as soon as it was finished and qualified as the Eighth Wonder of the World. In 1971 a team of restaurateurs sponsored by the Mary Street Jenkins Foundation did a restoration work in the Chapel. Architecture Exterior facade of the Chapel of the Rosario. This type of construction reflects the economic reach of the Church in those years and the ambition and sumptuousness with which its churches were planned and erected. The plan is arranged in the shape of a Latin cross, with short sections and testero. The nave is divided into three sections and its vault is barrel with lunettes in the same way as the sections of the crossing, it has a narrow dome with tholobate and on this some windows and others in the semicircular dome, whose purpose is to give illumination to the sumptuous cipr√©s just down. The interior of the chapel is majestic, where the architectural structures have been covered in every corner that is observed with reliefs in golden stucco, in order to exalt the religious feeling. View of the chapel The lateral walls of the nave are symmetrically covered by large canvases by the painter Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Carnero (1649-1725), with themes alluding to the Joys of the Virgin, the paintings are in the Chiaroscuro style that contrast with the bright and clear adorn the crossing, by the same author. The lower part of the paintings is adorned with a lambrin of azulejos from Talavera pottery. On the crossing there are other paintings with themes related also to the life of the Virgin, as well as another large one that crowns the apse of the chapel and is dedicated to the Glorification and Triumph of the Rosary. The reliefs that cover the walls, pilasters and vaults have motifs not only of the plant, animal or angelic order but also of the symbolic-religious order. The Chapel is decorated with overgilded yeseria, prepared with a base of flour with egg white and water (?) and covered with 24 carat gold leaves, like many Baroque decorations of the Pueblan capital. On the altar stands the throne of the Virgin, with a baldachin carved by the Spanish master Lucas Pinto. Portal The access portal is in the left crossing of the church, and its austere Baroque design contrasts with the wealth of the interior. It has a cushioned rounded arches, as well as the decorated and the jambs, slightly trumpet-shaped and framed by tuscan pilasters and corinthian columns. Finish the arch something similar to a balcony with a window between pilasters. Interior The chapel is characterized by being of Latin cross plan with short sections and testeros. It is a dazzling example of the 17th century New Spanish Baroque style, and a stage for faith and fantasy, where each element has a precise meaning. In the vault the representations of the three theological virtues are immersed in the foliage: Faith, Hope and Charity. We find sixty angels placed around the circumference that forms the dome and the main vault, each in a different expression, some are only heads and/or others are full-body images. A detail to highlight is that in the area dedicated to the choir and the organ, we find angels that seem to be playing musical instruments and singing songs. =Dome= The theological virtues in the order that appear in the dome. The order of appearance of the Catholic saints in the dome. * (a) In the dome, the Divine Grace (Gratia Divina) carries in its hands the palm leaf that symbolizes martyrdom, and the laurel branch of victory. Grace, without which there is no valid virtue, represents the origin of everything divine on earth; it is accompanied with the gifts of the Holy Spirit: * (b) Understanding (Spiritus Intellectus) * (c) Fortitude (Spiritus Fortitudinis) * (d) Piety (Spiritus Pietatis) * (e) Fear of God (Spiritus Timoris) * (f) Knowledge (Spiritus Scientiae) * (g) Counsel (Spiritus Consilii) and * (h) Wisdom (Spirit Sapientiae), qualities represented by female figures. Through these symbols one learns that having faith, hope and charity, being in grace and receiving the essential gifts, one can reach the supreme wisdom, represented by the dove of the Holy Spirit, which in the dome is shown wrapped between clouds and rays. In the dome there are also 16 saints: Saint Ursula (i), Agatha of Sicily (j), Agnes of Rome (k), Saint Anastasia (l), Saint Apollonia (m), Clare of Assisi (n), Gertrude the Great (o), Lutgardis (p), Saint Rosalia (q), Rose of Viterbo (r), Teresa of √Åvila (s), Thecla (t), Saint Barbara (u), Saint Cecilia (v), Saint Lucy (w) y Catherine of Alexandria (x). =Paintings= Annunciation, Visitation and Birth, all, work of the painter Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Carnero (1649-1725). Adoration, Presentation and Jesus and the doctors. On the sides of the nave six large canvases by the painter Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Carnero are displayed, which allude to the Joys of the Virgin: the Assumption, the Visitation and the Nativity. In front of them on the left side of the nave: the Adoration, the presentation in the Temple and Jesus among the doctors, scenes that represent the key moments in the human and earthly life of Mary. The lower part of the walls is covered with a superb lambrin of Talavera pottery azulejos, in whose upper strip protruding heads of cherubim alternated with the Dominican coat of arms. =Crossing= Although their sections are very short they present the same lush decoration on the nave. On the left side you can see a painting of the Assumption of Mary next to estofado carvings of John the Apostle and Matthew the Apostle; above surrounded by flowers and foliage, Elizabeth and Saint Joseph. On the right section a painting with the Coronation of Mary and the figures of Mark the Evangelist and Luke the Evangelist are displayed; in the closing next to the window, one can see Joachim and Saint Anne. The tribute to the four evangelists is because they were the first to speak of the Virgin, whose family appears here surrounded by angels (praises), flowers ( offerings), birds (music) and pelicans (the symbol of Christ). =Apse= In it is a huge painting dedicated to the Glorification and Triumph of the Rosary, in which you can see the Virgin crowned with roses. Together with the paintings of the crossing, it constitutes a descriptive triptych of the celestial life of Mary, who after climbing to the Heavens and being crowned appears on earth to distribute the Rosary. =Altar= The Assumption of Mary, on the left crossing. This place is reminiscent of the interrelation between religious architecture and its symbolisms: the square that forms on the crossing represents the earth, the octagonal base of the dome recreates the rebirth after death, and its perfect curvature represents the Celestial Vault, paradise symbol. =Cipr√©s= The cipr√©s under the drum dome that protects the Our Lady of the Rosary is made up of twelve Corinthian columns at the base made of marble from Tecali de Herrera, representing the apostles. In the first body some Dominican saints are appreciated, and in the second twelve beautiful solomonic columns covered with roses and lilies that frame Saint Dominic. The saints embedded in the roof niches hold flower clusters, four decorative ribs are embraced by plants and are arranged in the form of a vine. Also, there are mouldings with high reliefs of plants typical of the region, as if it were intended to remind us of the fertility and benefits of this land. There is even a small one that iconically represents the king star. In the top on the roof lantern, is Archangel Gabriel, a figure that tops this great Baroque work signed by Lucas Pinto. =Chorus= You can see here a relief in which there is a group of children with musical instruments, accompanied by angels and under the direction of God the Father.

Biography  Malcolm Edward Falkus was born on 13 January 1940 in Westcliff-on-Sea Essex England,General Register Office: Death Certificate: Malcolm Edward Falkus the son of the writer, filmmaker and presenter Hugh Edward Lance Falkus and Doris Marjorie Falkus (n√©e Walter). He and his twin brother, the publisher Christopher Hugh Falkus, were educated at a Marist Convent in Paignton, Devon and then at St Boniface's College, Plymouth. Malcolm took a first class degree at the London School of Economics where he subsequently became a lecturer in economic history. While at the LSE he published several significant scholarly works on economic and social history including The Industrialisation of Russia, 1700-1914 (1972) and Britain Transformed: an Economic and Social History, 1700-1914 (1987). In the 1980s and 1990s Falkus was commissioned to write several remunerated corporate histories. A history of North Thames Gas was originally planned in 1982 and a version was ready by 1985. However, in the wake of the UK Government‚Äôs decision to privatise the gas industry publication was delayed until 1988 so that the entire history of the public ownership of North Thames Gas from 1949 to 1986 could be covered. Other corporate histories were of the accountancy firm Coopers and Lybrand (1993) and the Blue Funnel Steam Ship Company (1995). In 1988 he succeeded Ron Neal as professor of economic history in Department of Economic History at the University of New England, Armidale, Australia. Falkus was instrumental in the development of the Department as a major centre for study of Asian economics. He became the first Director of the UNE-Asia Centre (UNEAC). Falkus was the general editor of the two book series ‚ÄòStudies in the Economies of East and South Asia‚Äô and ‚ÄòA Modern Economic History of Southeast Asia‚Äô. Falkus retired from UNEAC on his 60th birthday (13 January 2000) and then went to live in Thailand. While there he compiled a Thai-Khmer dictionary, and in 2001 was commissioned by the World Bank to compile a series of labour law manuals for Cambodia. He moved to Pattaya, Thailand in 2004. In June 2008 Falkus was arrested in Pattaya and charged with paying 13-year-old boys for sex, and was bailed on a surety of 200,000 baht. He denied being either gay or a pedophile and stated he never lured young boys anywhere and for any purposes. Falkus returned to the UK and lived in Norwich, Norfolk. On 28 November 2017 he was found hanged by the neck (aged 77) at his home in Arrandale Lodge Earlham Road Norwich. The Norfolk Coroner opened an inquest on 2 February 2018, an inquiry hearing was held on 2 October 2018 when the coroner gave a verdict of suicide.

She made her ballet debut as Fatima in 1837 in The Maid of Cashmere at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. Debuting in the same production was the great Augusta Maywood. Night after night, the two girls were showered with applause and bouquets. Lee studied in New York City with James Sylvain, and made her New York debut in June 1839 at the Bowery Theatre. She did not confine herself to dance, but acted in melodramas and other stage works. She toured the United States, then studied with Ballet Master Jean Coralli in Paris. When she returned to the United States, she brought the directions for several popular ballets with her. She danced the first American performance of Giselle in Boston in 1846. Lee danced and toured with George Washington Smith. She retired in 1847 at age 24 for health reasons. She married William Vanhook, a Philadelphia merchant. The couple had three children. She made a few returns to the stage, and taught dance in later life. She died in Philadelphia in 1899, and is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery. Critics and ballet lovers alike were unanimous in their praise of Lee. If she had pursued her career rather than retirement, she would likely have become a star of international renown.

It is one of a small group of henge monuments around Dumfries which includes Broadlea henge near Annan. Pict's Knowe is located 4km SW of Dumfries on a small sandy bank in the peat covered valley of the Crooks Pow stream. The site has been badly damaged by livestock, rabbit burrowing and tree rooting. The area around the monument had been occupied since the early Neolithic, but the henge itself appears to date to the early Bronze Age, based on radiocarbon analysis. The monument has one entrance, making it a Class I henge. It enclosed an area of 20-25m in diameter. In the entrance to the henge, sherds of a carinated urn were found, and fragments of cremated bone, which may have been animal rather than human. During the Iron Age the henge's bank was added to and the ditch recut, with a timber platform built over it. The site was scheduled in 1928 as a prehistoric fort. Richard Bradley identified the monument as a henge in 1990. Although the site had been recognised as a henge some decades before, this information did not make its way into official records, and Pict's Knowe was classed as an 'earthwork' by the National Monuments Record of Scotland.

Scientists and journalists rate the journal as a conspiracy ideological \\"front line\\" magazine and assign it to right-wing populism. Since 2015 presents itself Compact as a mouthpiece of the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the islamophobic Pegida-movement.P.A. Simpson(2016): Mobilizing meanings: Translocal identities of the far right web. German Politics and Society, 34(4), 34‚Äì53.  History & Business  Since 2008 the Kai Homilius Verlag puplished a book-serie called \\"Compact\\", edited by Els√§sser. Since 2009 there had been also published DVDs in Co-operation with Schild Verlag. In December 2010 number 0 of the magazine got puplished Magazins. Since August 2011 it was published in the \\"Compact-Magazin GmbH\\" in Werder. This company is founded by J√ºrgen Els√§sser, Kai Homilius and the German Muslim convert Andreas Abu Bakr Rieger. All of them are holding one- third of the company. The magazine's domain was temporarily seized by a German court in January 2018 after compact had not paid for litigation costs. The journalist Richard Gutjahr had obtained a preliminary injunction against the vile suspicions about him that had been spread via Compact. The Compact magazine suggested that the journalist had known about terrorist attacks in advance.‚ÄûIch hab dann mal die Domain gepf√§ndet‚Äú: Wie sich Richard Gutjahr gegen das umstrittene Compact Magazin wehrt. meedia.de, 23. Januar 2018. Markus Reuter: √ñffentlichkeit: Richard Gutjahr l√§sst Domain von rechtsradikalem Magazin Compact pf√§nden. netzpolitik.org, 23 January 2018. Since mid-2013, the Compact Magazine has advertised under the motto \\"Courage to the Truth,\\" which also uses the \\"Alternative for Germany\\" as its motto. Els√§sser distributed the magazine initially on AfD party days. In spring of 2015, he decided to make the magazine an election campaign for the AfD. Especially since the refugee crisis in Europe in 2015 Compact advertises regularly with front pages and theme books for AfD politicians and their positions. Three days before the state election in Saxony-Anhalt in 2016, Els√§sser hosted a live conference with leading AfD candidate Andr√© Poggenburg, giving him space to present the AfD goals. He presented Compact as the voice of the \\"silent majority\\" and the AfD as their party. On election night Poggenburg was not at the press statement of the main public broadcasters, but only answers Compact magazine. Thus positioned Els√§ssers Compact as the mouthpiece of the AfD and Pegida supporters who flat-reject the mainstream media and call it a \\"lying press\\". Beside the monthly magazine, Els√§sser and Homilius have enlarged their business activities: they run an online shop for compact-Poster, Sticker, Books and DVD. Also, they organizing so-called \\"compact conferences\\" and supply a YouTube channel with interviews. The interview partner is often based in conspiracy and far-right circles.

Junge Freiheit, 25. November 2007 Impact and reception The media journalist Benjamin Friedrich wrote in 2016: \\"The journalistic performance of the magazine is low. Els√§sser paraphrases or copies articles from the \\"mainstream press\\" and at the end adds them the toughest possible opinion.\\" Friedrich wrote, that Els√§sser for example takes over entire passages from the renowned Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and wote them in a new way, without giving citations and sources. He wrote, that the right-wing scene in Germany could probably give more readers to Compact and Junge Freiheit, but he assumed that right-wing sympathizers mistrust the medium of the printed newspaper as a whole and instead use more online media. Compact is described as ‚ÄûQuerfront-Magazin‚Äú (frontline-magazine).Thomas Sebastian Vitzthum: Anti-Kapitalismus Linker Publizist von der NPD f√ºr ‚ÄûVolksfront‚Äú gelobt. Welt Online, 16.

This made formal the religious difference between Arabs and Persians that had been smouldering since the early years of Islam. In subsequent nationalist rhetoric the Iranians could be seen as shu'√ªbiyyin, defectors from both Arabism and the orthodox faith, while in Khomeini's rhetoric Saddam was associated with Yazid, the Ummayad tyrant who killed Hussain at Karbala in 680AD\\" in which post-revolutionary Iran sees itself as the champion of the Shia Muslims in the Middle East. Its noteworthy, that Iran has very positive relations with numerous Arab countries such as Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria and Tunisia. In that sense, the rivalry and tension is with the most radical sunni countries, such as the GCC and its allies Egypt, Sudan, Jordan and Morocco. Timeline =The Iran-Iraq War= The Iran‚ÄìIraq War began on 22 September 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran, and it ended on 20 August 1988, when Iran accepted the UN-brokered ceasefire. Iraq wanted to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state, and was worried the 1979 Iranian Revolution would lead Iraq's Shi'ite majority to rebel against the Ba'athist government. The war also followed a long history of border disputes, and Iraq planned to annex the oil-rich Khuzestan Province and the east bank of the Arvand Rud (Shatt al-Arab). Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of Iran's post-revolutionary chaos, it made limited progress and was quickly repelled; Iran regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. For the next six years, Iran was on the offensive until near the end of the war. There were a number of proxy forces‚Äîmost notably the People's Mujahedin of Iran siding with Iraq and the Iraqi Kurdish militias of the KDP and PUK siding with Iran. The United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and most Arab countries provided political and logistic support for Iraq, while Iran was largely isolated. After eight years, war-weariness, economic problems, decreased morale, repeated Iranian military failures, recent Iraqi successes, Iraqi use of weapons of mass destruction, lack of international sympathy, and increased U.S.‚ÄìIran military tension all led to a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations. The conflict has been compared to World War I in terms of the tactics used, including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across fortified defensive lines, manned machine gun posts, bayonet charges, Iranian human wave attacks, extensive use of chemical weapons by Iraq, and, later, deliberate attacks on civilian targets. A special feature of the war can be seen in the Iranian cult of the martyr which had been developed in the years before the revolution. The discourses on martyrdom formulated in the Iranian Shiite context led to the tactics of \\"human wave attacks\\" and thus had a lasting impact on the dynamics of the war.G√∂lz, \\"Martyrdom and Masculinity in Warring Iran. The Karbala Paradigm, the Heroic, and the Personal Dimensions of War.\\" , Behemoth 12, no. 1 (2019): 35‚Äì51, 35. =Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy conflict= The Iran‚ÄìSaudi Arabia proxy conflict, sometimes also referred to as the Iran‚ÄìSaudi Arabia Cold War, Middle East Cold War or Middle East Conflict, is the ongoing struggle for influence in the Middle East and surrounding regions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The two countries have provided varying degrees of support to opposing sides in nearby conflicts, including the civil wars in Syria, and Yemen. The rivalry also extends to disputes in Bahrain, Lebanon, Qatar, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Morocco, as well as broader competition in North and East Africa, parts of South Asia, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. In what has been described as a cold war, the conflict is waged on multiple levels over geopolitical, economic, and sectarian influence in pursuit of regional hegemony.See:  American support for Saudi Arabia and its allies as well as Russian and Chinese support for Iran and its allies have drawn comparisons to the dynamics of the Cold War era, and the proxy conflict has been characterized as a front in what Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has referred to as the \\"New Cold War\\". The rivalry today is primarily a political and economic struggle exacerbated by religious differences, and sectarianism in the region is exploited by both countries for geopolitical purposes as part of a larger conflict. Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power.

It was published by Alfred A. Knopf on September 12, 1986. The novel follows an unnamed American woman during the Nicaraguan Revolution in Nicaragua in 1984. It is currently being adapted into film by Claire Denis, starring Robert Pattinson. Background Denis Johnson visited Nicaragua and Costa Rica two years prior to the novel's publication. He initially planned to write a magazine article, but the prospect of his words being judged seriously in nonfiction turned him off. He instead turned to fiction, using the Central American atmosphere as both the novel's setting and as a spiritual allegory for hell. The novel's female narrator and other characters remain mostly nameless. In a telephone interview with Jane Perlez of The New York Times, Johnson explained: \\"I thought it was appropriate that the people in hell wouldn't have any names. She refers to a couple of people with names, then withdraws them.\\" Johnson also said he did not feel uncomfortable writing in a woman's voice because he had previous experience from completing a number of dramatic monologues in the female voice. Plot The novel follows an unnamed American woman, supposedly a journalist, living in Managua, Nicaragua in 1984, during Sandinista rule. She originally traveled to Nicaragua as an observer for an anti-war group. She is disgusted with the corruption of both the Sandinistas and \\"the stupid CIA.\\" She hustles as a prostitute at the Inter-Continental Hotel in Managua, hoping to leave Nicaragua one day. At the hotel, she eventually meets an unnamed English oil businessman whom she falls in love with. When the Englishman has falling out with Costa Ricans, the two flee together toward border. An American who is most likely a CIA agent tracks them and pressures her to sell out the Englishman. Reception Publishers Weekly gave the novel a mixed review, writing, \\"Short as it is, the book could be trimmed by half without loss of substance. Johnson's previous novels Angels and Fiskadoro displayed an unmistakable gift. Unfortunately, this is inferior work by a manifestly superior writer.\\" Kirkus Reviews gave the novel a mixed review, saying it would have been better as a non-fiction book but concluded, \\"Johnson delivers an evocative and potently depressing travelogue, and does so with more savvy and unromantic political velleity than is found in books by, say, Graham Greene or Joan Didion.\\" Caryn James of The New York Times Book Review gave the novel a mixed review, writing, \\"language slides off its moorings, as style mirrors substance almost too well. Just as often as it is debased, the language is inflated by the empty abstractions of the narrator.\\" People gave the novel a positive review, calling Johnson \\"an original, exciting writer, worth every minute spent in his nightmarish creation.\\" John Blades of the Chicago Tribune called the novel \\"intensely mystical and poetic; it has the texture and illogic of a nightmare.\\" Legacy The novel inspired \\"The Sprawl\\" by Sonic Youth, a song from the band's fifth studio album Daydream Nation (1989). The lyrics for the song's first verse were taken directly from The Stars at Noon by the band's vocalist and guitarist Kim Gordon. Writing for The Guardian in 2012, Scottish novelist Alan Warner cited The Stars at Noon as proof that Johnson is \\"one of America's greatest fiction writers.\\" Writing for The Daily Beast in 2017, Jeremy Kryt called the novel \\"excellent\\" and compared its \\"shiftless gringo's point of view\\" to that of Oliver Stone's film Salvador (1986), writing, \\"Yet one could argue that Johnson's lost and nameless heroine is the more sympathetic character‚Äîand a more tragic figure‚Äîthan Stone's protagonist.\\" Film adaptation The novel is currently being adapted into film by Claire Denis, starring Robert Pattinson. Claire Denis tentatively announced the film's development after the April 2019 screening at the Brattle Theatre of her 2018 film, High Life, which also stars Robert Pattinson.

Photographed by Fr√©d√©ric Boissonnas, 1919. The Euthydikos Kore is a late archaic, Parian marble statue of the kore type, c 490-480 BCE Richter pp.99-100, that once stood amongst the akropolis votive sculptures. It was destroyed during the Persian invasion of 480 BCE and found in the PerserschuttThough belonging to Kavvadias's finds the question of this kore's relationship to the persian debris has been regularly raised, nevertheless support for a date of 480 remains, see M. Steskal, Der Zerst√∂rungsbefund 480/79 der Athener Akropolis, 2004.. It is named after the dedication on the base of the sculpture, ‚ÄúEuthydikos son of Thaliarchos dedicated [me]‚Äù ŒïŒ•ŒòŒ•ŒîŒôŒöŒüŒ£ Œü ŒòŒëŒõŒôŒëŒ°ŒßŒü ŒëŒùŒïŒòŒïŒöŒïŒù, IG I3 758, Raubitschek, DAA 56.. It now stands in the Acropolis Museumstatue inv. no. Akr 686, base Akr 609.. The surviving statue consists of two parts; the upper torso and head and the lower legs, feet and base, with the middle missing. The complete statue would have stood at 1.28m. The upper part was found in 1882 east of the Parthenon and the lower part in 1886-7 near the Erechtheion that the two pieces were related was a connection made by WinterK. Winter, J.d.I., II, 1887, p. 216.. The figure stands with left leg advanced (‚Äúalmost like a kouros‚Äù B. Ridgway, The Severe Style in Greek Sculpture, p.21 n.13). Her right forearm, now missing, would have been raised. She wears a chiton and a short Ionic himation draped from the right shoulder. The himation was once decorated with figured bands which Winter discerns as depicting two four-horse chariots. She also wears a taenia wound twice around the head. The eyes are heavy-lidded with both Lacrimal caruncle and canthus indicated. The lips are full, but with corners turning down and no archaic smileHence sometimes called \\"La Boudeuse\\" - the pouter: See Sculpture: From Antiquity to the Middle Ages, Duby et al. 1999. In the ears both tragus and antitragus are present. The throat and collarbone are both lightly indicated. The metatarsals are depicted on the sculpture‚Äôs bare feet. Stylistically the statue marks the transition from the late archaic to the Severe Style. Described by Jeffry Hurwit as an early classical statue in archaic dressJeffrey M. Hurwit, The Art and Culture of Early Greece, 1100-480 B.C., p.325, the Euthydikos kore exhibits a sense of volume and structure under the drapery that was novelPayne, Archaic Marble Sculpture, pp. 40-42. Since she is perhaps the last in the series of akropolis korai and represents the beginning of the new style, the dating of the statue is of some significance. As stated the bust was taken from a trench dug to the east of the Parthenon by Evstratiadis in 1882, though the stratigraphy of this trench had been compromised the layer in which the kore was found in was taken to be the Perserschutt. However, as Andrew Stewart argues this layer may be Kimonian or Periklean backfill against the south wallStewart, 2008, p. 394.. Further, Stewart maintains that the burning observed on the Euthydikos kore is in fact colouration, that the kore can be grouped with the archaising Pig ReliefAkr 581 and that the kore is by the same sculptor as the Blonde Boy. He also notes that the kore is not facially mutilated, suggesting that it wasn‚Äôt vandalised by the Persians. This implies that the kore‚Äôs date may be placed later in the 470s and that the Severe Style developed after the Median War and perhaps as a consequence of itStewart, 2008, p. 394..

The film has an eccentric proposition, it's a story about an arranged marriage couple who comes under the pressure of childbirth right after they are wedded. The film is loaded with humour, emotions and the reality of certain struggles faced after marriage. The film was earlier titled as, Hum Dono Honge Kaamyaab. The film released in cinemas on 5th July 2019. Synopsis Marudhar (Kunaal Roy Kapur) is the son of his tyrant father, Ashok Pandey (Rajesh Sharma). Straight as an arrow and boring as an oyster, Marudhar trudges along in his life, one hopeless day after the other. But Ashok has marriage plans for him and he won't have no for an answer. What follows is a comedy of ridiculous proportions as Marudhar marries the sweet and pretty Chitra (Tara Alisha Berry) from Lucknow.

The committee completed the report in March 2019 and it was published in July 2020. The report is notable for allegations suggesting any delay of publication were due to government machinations. Accusations by the opposition suggested the delay was politically motivated while the government declared any such criticism ‚Äò peddling reprehensible smears and conspiracy theories for party political reasons ahead of the election‚Äô.  Inquiry  The inquiry began in November 2017, and a 50-page report was completed in March 2019. The report thereafter went through a process of redaction by intelligence and security agencies and was sent to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on 17 October 2019. = Expert witnesses = The committee used the following external expert witnesses. * Professor Anne Applebaum ‚Äì Institute of Global Affairs * Mr William Browder ‚Äì Head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Movement * Mr Christopher Donnelly CMG TD ‚Äì Head of the Institute for Statecraft * Mr Edward Lucas ‚Äì Writer and consultant specialising in European and transatlantic security * Mr Christopher Steele ‚Äì Director, Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd  Publication delay  Johnson's government refused to publicly release the report before the general election in December 2019. This in of itself is not unusual as ‚ÄòISC report reviews‚Äô often take time to be examined prior to publication. A number of legal actions were begun to try to force the government to publish it: one brought by the widow of the murdered Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, and another by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The Prime Minister approved its release on 13 December 2019, the day after the general election. Johnson pledged in Prime Minister's Questions in February 2020 that the report would be released, but that it could not be released until the Intelligence and Security Committee (which disbanded following the dissolution of parliament ahead of the election) was reconstituted; a former chair of the committee, Dominic Grieve, said that this was an \\"entirely bogus\\" reason for delaying publication. Grieve stated that the time between approval of release and publication was typically 10 days. However, a government spokesperson responded stating that ‚ÄòISC report reviews‚Äô often take a lot longer, accusing detractors of ‚Äòpeddling smears for political gain‚Äô By June 2020, the report had still not been released, and the Intelligence and Security Committee had not been convened, the longest gap since the committee's creation in 1994. This prompted a cross-party group of 30 MPs to urge the committee to be reconstituted and the report to be published, writing that serious issues of \\"transparency and integrity\\" of the democratic process were raised by the withholding of the report.  Publication and content The report was published on 21 July 2020 and was not expected to name individuals and parts of the report were classified due to their sensitive intelligence material and subsequently censored. An uncensored report was available on an \\"eyes only\\" basis.  Conclusions  According to the report, there is substantial evidence that Russian interference in British politics is commonplace. The report describes the UK as one of Russia's \\"top targets\\" and said it is \\"seen as central to the Western anti-Russian lobby\\". The committee found no evidence as to whether Russian interference had affected the Brexit referendum, since the government had not authorized any investigation into that matter due to the fact that any such attempt was not within the purview of U.K. intelligence services because any such actions by the security services themselves could been seen as interference, itself undermining democracy. However, the report did discover evidence that the 2014 Scottish independence referendum had been interfered with, supporting the Scottish vote on independence.  Reactions  The content of the report was described by the Russian government as \\"fake- shaped Russophobia\\".

The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado. Season four stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Pamela Sue Martin as Blake and Alexis's headstrong daughter Fallon; Jack Coleman as Blake and Alexis's earnest son Steven; Gordon Thomson as Blake and Alexis's eldest son Adam; John James as Fallon's ex-husband Jeff Colby; Pamela Bellwood as Steven's new wife, Claudia; Heather Locklear as Krystle's niece and Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo; Geoffrey Scott as Krystle's ex- husband Mark Jennings; Lee Bergere as Carrington majordomo Joseph Anders; Kathleen Beller as Joseph's daughter Kirby; Deborah Adair as public relations assistant Tracy Kendall; Michael Nader as businessman Dex Dexter; Helmut Berger as playboy Peter de Vilbis; Diahann Carroll as Blake's half-sister Dominique Deveraux; and Joan Collins as Alexis Colby, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Adam, Fallon, and Steven. Development With the show's popularity soaring in the fourth season (now the third most watched program of 1983‚Äì1984), former President Gerald Ford, former First Lady Betty Ford, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger guest-starred as themselves in 1983. Michael Nader was introduced as Farnsworth \\"Dex\\" Dexter, a friend to Blake and a love interest for Alexis. Though Dex was conceived as a supporting, short- term character, Nader's performance made the character \\"unexpectedly popular\\". One of the five actors under final consideration for the role, Nader credited his chemistry with Collins with getting him the part. Collins said of Nader, \\"He's a very romantic leading man and he has a certain sinister edge.\\" Diahann Carroll was also introduced as wealthy singer and businesswoman Dominique Deveraux, from the beginning intended as a foil for Alexis Colby, the villainess played by Joan Collins. Dominique was revealed to be Blake's half- sister in season five. Noting that the increasingly popular prime time soap operas had yet to tackle racial integration, and wanting to be \\"the first black bitch on television\\", Carroll had her manager reach out to Dynasty producer Aaron Spelling, but there had been no response before she and Spelling ran into each other soon after. Spelling said, \\"When Diahann came in, Esther Shapiro and I looked at her, looked at each other and said, 'My God, she is Dynasty.'\\" Carroll told Shapiro that night, \\"If it's not me let it be someone, because it's time.\\" Spelling said, \\"We virtually closed the deal that night while having a drink at the bar.\\" Joining Dynasty made Carroll the only black actress with a continuing role on a nighttime serial at that time, and Dominique the first prominently-featured African-American character on a prime time soap opera. She appeared in the final two episodes of the fourth season, and was contracted for at least 17 of season five's 29 shows. Willis Edwards, president of the Beverly Hills/Hollywood chapter of the NAACP, said of Carroll's casting, \\"This is a major thing as far as we're concerned.

Life Mary Maxwell Campbell was born at Riccarton in Ayrshire with her twin, Isabella, on 19 November 1812. She was one of ten children of Dugald John Campbell of Skerrington and his wife Janet Baillie of Polkemmet. She was a gifted composer and lyricist from an early age. Her first and most famous piece, \\"The March of the Cameron Men\\" first appeared in print in James Davie's Caledonian Repository in 1829 when she was just 16. Originally published anonymously, Campbell only revealed herself as the author of the march after others began to claim authorship and it was not until 1866 that the piece was published with her name attached. A gifted musician, she set many of her own pieces to music, many of which were targeted at children. She produced a series of songs with music for children and her pieces were included in many anthologies of Scottish poets in her own lifetime. She never married and in later years lived with her sister Jessie Skene of Pitlour, at St Andrews. She was well connected in literary circles throughout her life and was a friend and correspondent of the poet Agnes Strickland and literary critic Principal Shairp, for whom she wrote the music to his poem \\"The Lass of Loch Linnhe\\". She died at her home at 1, Gillespie Terrace in St Andrews on 15 January 1886. March of the Cameron Men The song relays the story of Donald Cameron of Lochiel's part in the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Campbell composed the song while travelling through the Scottish Highlands with a member of the Cameron family of Lochiel. She originally intended the piece for piano accompanied voice, but later arranged a version for bagpipes. It commonly features in the set-list of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders and has become closely associated with Clan Cameron. Other works *Lament for Glencoe *The Mole and the Bat *O, What Will We Do in the Morning *The Menagerie *The Lass of Loch Linnhe (music) Legacy March of the Cameron Men has become the signature march of many pipebands, including The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa and as a song, has been recorded by many artists, including Robert Watkin- Mills, Harold Jarvis, and Kenneth McKellar. In 2018, as part of Minerva Scientifica, a project run by the National Library of Scotland, the lyrics to \\"March of the Cameron Men\\" were reworked by Frances M Lynch and Herbie Clark and recorded as \\"The March of the Women of Science\\" to celebrate the link between women scientists and composers. In Sara Sheridan's 2019 book, \\"Where are the Women? A Guide to an Imagined Scotland\\", a fictional exhibit to Campbell features in the \\"Magdalene\\" Trust Museum and Gardens.

Written and created by Neil Forsyth, the show centres on two brothers played by Mark Bonnar and Jamie Sives who get involved in a hit and run. Guilt was broadcast on BBC Two between 30 October and 14 November 2019. The series was confirmed to return for a second season, to be broadcast in 2021. Cast * Mark Bonnar as Max * Jamie Sives as Jake * Ruth Bradley as Angie * Sian Brooke as Claire * Emun Elliott as Kenny * Bill Paterson as Roy Lynch * Moyo Akand√© as Tina * Noof McEwan as Cameron Production Forsyth was keen to write a show about siblings, which he has called ‚Äúthe most interesting dramatic relationship‚Äù and a show with a leitmotif that ran through all the characters, in this case guilt. He spent several years developing the show, before finding a home for it at the BBC. Guilt was produced by Happy Tramp North and Expectation Entertainment and directed by Robert McKillop. Guilt became the first drama commission for the new BBC Scotland channel, which premiered the show‚Äôs episodes a week before UK-wide transmission on BBC Two. Guilt was shot in Edinburgh and Glasgow. In Edinburgh, locations included Calton Hill and Charlotte Square. In Glasgow, a studio was built at Parkhouse Business Park and other locations included Clydebank Docks, Aberfoyle and the Lanarkshire town of East Kilbride. Plot The show begins with two brothers, Max and Jake, in a car returning from a wedding. When they accidentally run over and kill an elderly man on an Edinburgh street, they make the decision to try to cover up the crime. As the show progresses, the brothers‚Äô difficulties intensify and the story opens up to bring in other characters and storylines, within a thematic narrative of guilt. Reception Guilt received strong viewing figures and a highly positive critical reception. The Times called it, ‚ÄúAn absolute cracker‚Äù, The Observer, ‚Äúan utter triumph, a word-of-mouth dazzler‚Äù, with ‚Äúwelcome Coen brothers echoes‚Äù. The Telegraph called it a ‚Äústealth hit‚Äù which ‚Äúfelt like Fargo relocated to Leith, or Midnight Run reimagined by Irvine Welsh‚Äù. The Independent termed it ‚Äúthe unexpected treat of the year‚Äù, The Guardian described it as a ‚Äúdarkly delicious tale‚Äù that was ‚Äúfast becoming a word-of-mouth hit‚Äù, the Radio Times called it ‚ÄúHitchcockian‚Äù and The Herald deemed it the most impressive Scottish small screen debut since the 1987 comedy drama Tutti Frutti.

Parents  His paternal grandfather was a judge, and at the same time musician and composer, author of regular musical reviews. His father also a judge, but in his spare time a passionate musician who regularly corresponded with a number of leading contemporary musicians and was an adherent of Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophy. In contrast to his father who represented clear, rational thinking, Walter's mother was interested in esotericism and frequented esoteric groups and lectures.  Childhood and youth  As a child Walter was described as quiet and obedient: very much in contrast to his older brother who had an explosive temperament and a tendency to get involved in fights. At the age of two Robert contracted polio, became paralysed for a time, and his legs remained weak for the rest of his life. Yet, significantly, he did not despair over this disability, but, on the contrary, was later eager to take part in mountain trekking. At the age of 9 he started to play the violin, later he also learnt to play the piano. At school he initially did not excel and was rather a challenge to his teachers. Yet already as a child he was perceived by his surrounding as an unusual personality: unusually serious, capable of deep reflection, somebody who showed great promise. His peers tended to regard him as a great authority. His mother wrote in a letter to her then eleven-year-old son: \\"I miss your quiet, wise presence\\". Already at an early age he showed lively interest for all kinds of esoteric knowledge (often inspired by the books he obtained from his mother) and astrology. He founded his own astrological study group at the age of 16. He remained faithful to this interest till the end of his life. Robert Walter's lukewarm attitude to his studies changed when he was sent to the first Waldorf School in Stuttgart in 1927. He stayed there for only one year, but during that time caught fire for learning, especially mathematics, yet he also retained his love for music, composed a sonata for piano and violin and reflected on the Christian dimension of music. Walter achieved certain renown among his peers through his ability to repair watches and alarm clocks. He also exhibited a deep passion for books and learning. He described himself as \\"philobiblion\\" (lover of books) and always had a feeling that his knowledge on any given subject was not sufficient. Yet perhaps his most astonishing quality at the time was his deep and serious interest in the path of spiritual development. He studied avidly the central book of Rudolf Steiner on the subject (\\"Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and Its Attainment\\") as well as the relevant chapters of Steiner's \\"Occult Science\\" and described in a letter to his father with what intensity he worked on these indications. He claimed that he did not have any particular talent for clairvoyance and maintained that achieving initiation is in principle not more demanding than obtaining a PhD in any given subject. His school report at the end of the school year 1928 was generally very good and in mathematics and physics he came at the top of his class. His mathematics and physics teacher was Dr Walter Johannes Stein, one of the most prominent pupils of Rudolf Steiner. After his return to Poland young Robert Walter corresponded with Stein, who was 17 years his senior, for a number of years.  Business ventures  Robert Walter was hoping to enrol at a university in Germany and to study natural sciences, mathematics, astronomy, or possibly medicine, yet the precarious financial situation of his parents crossed these plans and he had to return to Poland. He wanted to help his parents financially and so he turned to experiments in and production of cosmetics. His perfume creations were so successful that they were traded with a fictitious cover story that the recipes were obtained from famous French firms. Finally, a cosmetics firm under the name \\"Orient\\" was founded in his name in Poznan, and later transferred to Warsaw. All that time Robert Walter was hoping that his business ventures would enable him to study abroad, the hopes that proved to be futile. It is important in this context to stress that despite his esoteric interests Robert Walter was unusually \\"down to earth\\": extremely precise, punctual and reliable, with a very keen practical and business sense, qualities which represented the opposite of the qualities of his parents. Despite deep character differences he maintained very good relationships with his parents, particularly with his mother, to whom he always had a warm, heartfelt devotion. In 1932 Walter finally abandoned his university ambitions even in Poland. Instead, he was dragged into joint activities with his mother and became co-owner and director (and above all the product designer) of the cosmetics factory \\"Deva\\" in Warsaw, which could be regarded as a continuation of \\"Orient\\". However, this venture was not limited to reproductions of Eastern cosmetics and sold also its own creations. Over the next two years, \\"Deva\\" managed by Walter's able hand began to thrive, thanks to which he became very wealthy, yet used his wealth not to lead a luxurious lifestyle, but to expand his library (he would even purchase 16th century manuscripts) which, though housed in his private flat, was entirely open to the public. Walter's increased wealth also led to the expansion of the circle of his acquaintances, yet despite the pressure of time required to run the company and to fulfil sporadic social duties, he continued to study the fields of knowledge he was interested in, that is not only anthroposophy and astrology, but also the broadly understood history of culture. Significantly, though he described himself as a \\"loner\\" he consciously strove to maintain good, conflict-free relationships with people of very divergent outlooks and persuasions. Moreover, he would also support financially ‚Äì initially quoting the source, later also anonymously ‚Äì many poor people, restricting his private expenditure to the necessary minimum. His wealth and personal charm attracted many beautiful women, yet he never entered into any romantic relationship for as he revealed much later already as a child he felt \\"married to God\\". Parallel to his business and social duties Robert Walter got involved on the one hand in some esoteric work within the circles of Polish masonry, and on the other, and despite the utter failure of his academic ambitions, in scientific astronomical work in collaboration with leading Polish astronomers. In particular he worked out formulas for calculating the positions of Uranus and Pluto in the period between 3000 BC till 4000 AD. These formulas are used even today.  WWII  During the German occupation, when all cultural life in Poland came to a standstill, Robert Walter managed to continue his scientific work and at the same time to deepen his esoteric life. He would carry out his meditation exercises even under most adverse circumstances. During the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 a bomb hit the building in which he lived. As it happened, Walter was immersed in meditation at that moment and almost miraculously survived unscathed: the sofa, on which he lay ended up on top of a pile of rubble. It was also around the time of the Uprising that Walter committed his, as he described it, biggest esoteric mistake. He recounted later that one day in a state of clairvoyant consciousness he met a person who had earlier died in a concentration camp, but for various reasons was not aware of that fact and regarded himself as still alive. That person complained to Robert Walter (whom he \\"saw\\") that his (dead person's) friends did not seem to notice him and did not react to his approaches. To that Walter responded by saying: \\"But you are dead!\\", which produced a state of shock in that person. On an exoteric level Walter as well as his whole family were active in attempts at saving the Polish Jews from the occupiers. Walter's older brother, Ryszard, was also involved in the activities of the Polish underground. He was caught by the Germans and tortured, but survived the war.  Post war: activity as an expert, university course, cultural centre  What also survived the war, and moreover practically unscathed, was Walter's library and the supplies of his firm's raw materials. Walter moved with his belongings to a villa of his friends in Komorow in the vicinity of Warsaw, sold the astronomical part of his library for, as he said, he had studied astronomy and higher mathematics only to find out how difficult modern science was, set up a laboratory in the villa and embarked on a new existence producing expertises for perfume, foodstuffs and soap industries. He withdrew from his former firm for, as he said, the industrial activities were too time consuming and he wanted to devote all his energies to scientific work. However, he had to earn enough to support not only himself but also his parents who became jobless after the war. In 1946, at the age of almost 40, Walter enrolled at the University of Warsaw yet was not very impressed by the quality of teaching and the academic abilities of his fellow students. Nonetheless the villa in Komorow became a centre of flourishing intellectual life. Every Sunday dozens of people ‚Äì older or younger ‚Äì came to it to make use of Walter's library or to seek his advice in the matters of spiritual or simply intellectual life. One of these visitors was Nina Andrycz, one of the leading Polish actresses of the time and the wife of Jozef Cyrankiewicz, then Prime Minister of Poland. Andrycz wrote in her diary that she had become Walter's pupil (she was born in 1912 that is was about 39 at the time). Interestingly he encouraged her to read Lao Tse, not Rudolf Steiner. Incidentally, Walter learned Chinese to be able to study Lao Tse in the original, for he did not trust the translations. Cyrankiewicz himself would also seek Walter's advice e.g. concerning his marriage. While Andrycz or Cyrankiewicz or both were at Walter's, dark cars of the state security attachment would be stationed outside the villa. Cyrankiewicz's visits also brought out an interesting aspect of Walter's personality to the fore. Walter never drank alcohol for he did not like it, yet during these meetings he was forced to drink vodka because a meeting with Cyrankiewicz and without alcohol was not at all conceivable. Hence, with his \\"weak head\\" and lacking experience he had to practice drinking. He treated this as a form of mortification: an exercise in overcoming his own reluctance. Walter's handwriting was significantly changed after the war: it became smaller, finer, in a way humbler. This fact seems to indicate that during the war Walter was intensively working on will exercises as described by Rudolf Steiner e.g. in his \\"Occult Science\\", exercises necessary to achieve the highest stage of supersensible cognition referred to in Steiner's system as \\"Intuition\\".  Decision and its aftermath  In 1952 he was working on his master's thesis in the field of psychology of sensations of smell (he was hoping to get an appointment at the Polish Academy of Sciences and so combine his private life with scientific research) when a momentous turn of his destiny occurred. Walter inherited an unusually sturdy physical constitution from his parents ‚Äì his father was a member of an athletes' club and yet could not win a hand- wrestling match against his wife ‚Äì which proved to be an obstacle for Walter in carrying out certain esoteric exercises. In order to achieve the desired results in this sphere a weakening of Walter's physical constitution was necessary. In December 1951, around Christmas, there took place a \\"conference\\" in the spiritual worlds to which Walter got \\"invited\\". He complained that he could not achieve what he should and so it was agreed that because he could not and yet he should, special treatments had to be implemented. Walter understood what destiny procedures were being prepared for him and he agreed to them. In the night from 9th to 10 May 1952 he was arrested and taken to prison accused of spying. It should be added that Walter was not the only person arrested at that time. Security forces secretly occupied the villa in which Walter lived until 12 May and arrested every person who came there not suspecting the trap. One can assume that the aim of the communist authorities in taking that step was not only to detain Walter, but more generally to liquidate an independent centre of intellectual life in Poland. Walter was sent to a death cell and interrogated and tortured for one and a half years. In 1954 he was transferred to an ordinary cell which he shared with the former Polish consul in France, Juliusz Wilczur-Garztecki. Garztecki reported later two interesting details concerning the impressions he gained of Walter. Firstly, he said that Walter had been able to quote passages from Rudolf Steiner's central book on the path of esoteric training (\\"Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and Its Attainment\\" cf. above) verbatim; and secondly, he stated that Walter had had little esteem for clairvoyance as such. He regarded clairvoyance as a kind of bonus, the main aim of the esoteric path being the ordering of one's psyche. One important aspect of such an \\"ordering\\" was according to Walter the necessity of attainment of an ordered, internally consistent and logical world view (\\"Weltanschauung\\"). When this necessity was put in question he once replied \\"It's not my fault that spiritual beings demand this\\". He also insisted that before one wants to start on the anthroposophical path of inner development one should first become \\"a contemporary intellectual\\". Walter was released from prison on 30 October 1954. A physician who examined him after his release from prison reported symptoms of cardiovascular failure with swelling of the legs, dull tones in the heart, symptoms of angina pectoris, paroxysmal stomach pains, purulent discharge from the ears, skin blemishes (...) with purulent discharge, inflammation of the left sciatic nerve, and significant weakness of the lower limbs, expressed as difficulty walking and severe pains. Walter himself looked at that period of his life in the following way: > \\"I remained [in prison] for two and a half years, my body weakened, it > deteriorated in terms of health to such an extent that my development in the > following decades became somewhat easier. Anyway, there, in the cell, I > could meditate and do my exercises.\\" In a letter to his mother, written in January 1955, he stated: > \\"As for my struggles, Mother shouldn't worry too much. I am going through seven unpleasant years. [Five are behind me and] I will manage to struggle through two more somehow. My inner difficulties come from the fact that I seek spiritual states and insights, and these are bought with suffering. Each country has its own currency.\\" Despite this accepting attitude towards his suffering something had to be done to improve his health at least to the extent which would enable Walter a more or less normal existence. As his weakened immune system did not tolerate chemical medicines, the only possibility was a homeopathic treatment. Walter sought to be treated in the main anthroposophical clinic in Arlesheim, Switzerland and in a court-case brought against the state he attempted to obtain from the state reimbursement for its costs. A compensation was granted to him but in a way typical for that time it covered no more than a small amount of all his losses which included not only the costs of treatment in Switzerland, but also the need to renovate the laboratory, repurchase of his chemical raw materials, and three years of lost earnings, not to mention moral losses resulting from the forfeited master's degree at the university and the subsequent inability to work scientifically.  Arlesheim: the meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold, an Initiate  In 1956 Walter's financial situation was so bad that he was forced to start selling parts of his library and he seemed to be genuinely downcast. Fortunately in August 1958 he finally obtained state financial support and was able to travel to Switzerland. His time in Arlesheim was free from financial concerns and devoted exclusively to physical healing and spiritual growth. He also attempted to establish business contacts, which, however, proved not particularly successful. Far more significant was his inner development. According to an entry in his diary of 28 September 1958 he then experienced what is described in anthroposophical literature as the meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold: a spiritual being who prohibits conscious entry into the spiritual world to people who have not mastered their desires and emotions. It is to be surmised that it is at that juncture of his life that Walter became an initiate, i.e. a person who not only has some insight into the reality of the spiritual world and into the destinies of people more or less directly after their deaths, but retains his or her full consciousness during the periods of his or her sojourn in the spiritual worlds, is aware of their superhuman inhabitants: spiritual beings of various hierarchies, and ultimately can follow the past and future incarnations of human beings as well as of the planet Earth itself.  Later years  Walter health improved substantially in Arlesheim and when he returned to Poland and Komorow in 1959 he was able to lead a more or less normal life again. The following years, although sometimes difficult on the financial side, proceeded in a more regular fashion without great, unpleasant, external blows of fate. Unfortunately, Walter's health quickly returned to \\"normal\\", i.e. it deteriorated under the pressure of the burden of work: Walter would spend ten hours a day in the laboratory although gradually, with age, he was only able to work less and less efficiently as he progressively lost strength. A few years after the Arlesheim period Komorow became populated once again by knowledge seekers, for whom Walter straightened their life's paths and to whom he gave his advice. Walter was untiring in his readiness to help. Asked once till when one could visit him on a given day he replied: \\"Until midnight, because later it is already the next day\\". Yet he was not only involved in personal destinies of people surrounding him. He was equally active on the social level: from its founding meeting in 1965 till his death he was the chairman of the Homeopathic Society in Poland, a councillor of the Komorow Regional Council, a member of the steering committee of the local branch of the Warsaw Committee for Prevention of Alcoholism, member of the Circle of Friends of the Library of Maria Dabrowska and many other organizations. He was responsive to all forms of needs of the people in his surroundings, including their physical needs. In order to come to terms with all his duties he would sleep little. He would go to bed at midnight or even later and get up at five.  Astrology, homeopathy  It is important to note that Walter did not restrict his esoteric interests to anthroposophy. He became also a proficient astrologer and was regarded as one of the leading authorities in this area in Poland. One of his aspirations was to formulate the cognitive conditions under which astrology could again become a field of university research. He wanted to enable the dethroned former \\"queen\\" of sciences to enter again into the circle of investigations of the highest scientific quality, and protect it against amateurism which breeds its popularity from ignorance and prejudices of the masses. Another of his strivings in this field was to reconcile astrological and psychological diagnosis of personality. He was of the opinion that both disciplines produce similar diagnoses though use different concepts. He also authored a synthetic astrological typology which he presented in a lecture to the Polish Psychological Society and which was published posthumously in 1994. In 2000 one of the leading Polish newspapers published an article by Polish psychologist, psychotherapist and author , in which Eichelberger described the meeting with Robert Walter as the moment when he came to believe in astrology. Both men agreed to carry out a simple experiment: Eichelberger supplied Walter with hours, dates, places of birth and sex of three people who were his patients without revealing their names. Three weeks later the men met again and each of them read his analysis of those people. Eichelberger admitted with astonishment that two of Walter's analyses were as accurate as his own. \\"I could not believe my ears, hearing that a man who had never seen the people he talked about presented complex, intimate details of their lives and dates of the most important events of their lives and in elegant language described the essence of their psychological problems\\". Of lesser importance but nevertheless also significant was Walter's involvement in homeopathy. It is known that he studied this discipline already after his imprisonment, and later became quite proficient in that field, able to successfully prescribe homeopathic medicaments himself. As mentioned before, he also became the chairman of the Homeopathic Society in Poland. His activities in that field are extensively described by a well-known Polish homeopath, Stanislaw Jedrzejczyk.  Change of perspective  Walter's approach to spirituality took a significant shift towards the end of his life. As noted before, Walter was not only profoundly familiar with Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy, indeed, in Poland he was recognized as the supreme authority in this area, but he also achieved his insight into the spiritual world pursuing the methods described by Rudolf Steiner. Indeed, he maintained that he had achieved this insight in order to verify Steiner's claims. \\"Someone had to do it\\" he once said. Yet towards the end of his life, beginning perhaps in the 70's of the last century, he seems to have begun to question Steiner's characterization of the relationship between Christ and human beings. Christ and His role in the evolution of humanity is undoubtedly central for Steiner, indeed, he describes the \\"Mystery of Golgotha\\" as the pivotal point of that evolution, as the event which gives meaning to the whole earthly existence of humanity, yet the being of Christ is conspicuously absent on the path of anthroposophical initiation and appears to the initiate only at the very end of his or her efforts. Walter put his finger on this fact in a questioning way. In a private conversation he once said: > If you look at Steiner' exercise technique [you see clearly], there is a man > working on himself, developing his abilities, developing higher and higher > [stages of] clairvoyance. At a certain high point, indeed Steiner leads to > that point, the man encounters Christ. And Steiner says \\"This is it\\" [the > pinnacle of achievement]. But what does this meeting look like? It's pretty > different than in Catholicism where Christ is veritably seeking the man. How > is it for the Catholics? There you hear that if a man would only turn to > Christ in the last minute before death, Christ rushes to save him because he > loves [him]. And how do you have the same scene at Steiner's? Steiner brings > you to see Christ. But how does the meeting look like? Christ says: \\"Well, > if you offer all your strength to human development, so perhaps you will be > able to unite with me\\". Ma'am, this is a completely different story! At that stage of his life Walter began to stress the significance and virtues of the so-called na√Øve religiosity. He supported his view e.g. by referring to the destiny of a simple gardener (whom he had known since his childhood) in that person's life after death. That gardener went through the posthumous stages of his existence with greatest ease. He was a man of very simple religiosity, hardly judgmental, focused on his work, not looking at the flaws of the local priest, whom the people of his parish loudly criticised. Referring to such an easy path for a man without learning yet devoted to the Church and God in pure affection Walter said that he had had to spend twenty years to achieve as much as that gardener was given \\"for free\\" immediately after he died for pure trust. Walter would contrast this attitude with the attitude of even ardent anthroposophists. In one of the seminars given towards the end of his life Walter said: > I knew [‚Ä¶] an anthroposophist who would read one lecture of Dr. Steiner > every evening, simply as a [kind of] gourmet: it tasted so good. [‚Ä¶ A]fter > death it didn't look very inspiring. And he was such an anthroposophist that > he would even give lectures. And this yearning for this tasty, say, reading, > [‚Ä¶] starts hitting him ... and the book is not there, and the soul squeaks. For this reason, towards the end of his life Walter began to propagate religiousness in the spirit of Sister Faustyna Kowalska (officially today: Saint Maria Faustyna Kowalska of the Blessed Sacrament) and her attitude \\"Jesus, I trust in You\\". Walter did not claim that this approach could be turned into a general law, but he depicted it as an attitude towards God which should be at the root of everything else, regardless of other matters. Altruism cannot be given to a man in the form of knowledge. Such attitude must develop out of the impulse of the inmost free will of a person. Yet Walter saw altruism as one of the most important features of a Christian attitude towards God. At that stage Walter also sharply differentiated between occultism and Christianity. He maintained that occultists do not have access to Christ even if they are \\"Christian\\" occultists, for then though they have access to Him, He \\"does not want to have access to them\\". Walter considered the occultists' pursuit of spiritual sensations, of achieving the vision of supersensible worlds as confusing means with goals. As he would often say: To achieve transcendental experience is extremely easy and there are many techniques to do this, but one does not get better from the amount of perception, and therefore according to Walter Steiner in his writings did not emphasize enough the basic task of man, which could be expressed in simple words: fulfilling the ideal of the Good. People who knew him well at that time report that having read the diary of Sister Faustyna (who died in 1938) Walter began to cooperate with her closely. He said that Sister Faustyna had taught him humility by \\"putting her foot on his head\\". The notes he made in the last three years of his life seem to indicate that during that period he was receiving direct instructions from Christ. He would often prostrate himself on the floor as if in atonement for the sins of his own or perhaps more likely of other people. He would recite Sister Faustyna's Chaplet to the Divine Mercy (in Polish: \\"Koronka do Mi≈Çosierdzia Bo≈ºego\\"), he also often took on himself the sufferings of other people. In one conversation Walter described this \\"procedure\\" in the typical for him entirely unpretentious fashion in the following way: > So [a person] comes [to me], he is directed here by his guardian angel, or > someone else. Catholics say by simplification \\"by God\\" ‚Äì I distinguish here > certain details. A day or two before his visit in the morning or at night, I > get a portion of his depression. \\\\- And so you know that he is to come? \\\\- I > know on the basis of this depression that someone is coming, and more or > less who it will be. I'm experiencing [his state], licking out his > unpleasant mess, which this person made of himself because he is helpless > against himself and against the world and against his environment. > Therefore, because I took on a piece of his soul, I sucked in his dirty > blood, at this moment I have access to him in a way different than through > verbal, whether through scientific, or through mental or psychological > action. I have a different access. Because insofar as I suffered for him, I > have the right to him. If I have suffered five ounces, I am five ounces his > saviour, because I crucify myself for him. And so I have the right to save > him for five ounces or maybe ten. You know, this is a power which one is > given over other people. But one is not allowed to misuse it. Maciej Puczynski, the author of the most comprehensive extant biography of Robert Walter from which it was quoted extensively here, asserts on that basis that at the end of his life Walter ceased to be a pupil of Rudolf Steiner and became a pupil of Christ.

A bachelor of arts graduate in art history and the theory and practice and drawing and painting from Harvard University's Radcliffe College, she exhibited her work in photography at The Photographers' Gallery. Josp√© was elected a member of the Chelsea Art Club, the Royal Watercolour Society, the New English Art Club and exhibited her art work at the latter two societies. Biography She was born Cecil Weiner on August 15, 1928 in New Jersey. She was given the name Cecil after an aunt who served as a judge in Oakland, California. Her artistic career commenced in the late 1940s when she was educated at Harvard University's Radcliffe College, where she read art history and the theory and practice of drawing and painting. Josp√© graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1951. She lived in New York in the early 1950 and was a representational painter when abstract expressionists emerged within the art world. She married the Belgian Roger Josp√© in 1958 and relocated to London five years later. Josp√©'s marriage and the birth of her three children stopped her from working as a creative artist until she enrolled on a part-time degree in professional photography at the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster). She learnt how to print color transparencies and was intrigued in 5x4 camera technology. Josp√© used the skills she learnt to photograph her life as a housewife and mother over the past quarter of a century; her obituarist in The Times described them as \\"icons of domesticity with an undercurrent of irony\\" and \\"profoundly personal and psychologically eerie.\\" Josp√© held solo exhibitions of her work at The Photographers' Gallery in Great Newport Street, London in 1983 and 1985. She also considered training as a psychologist and was the Analytical Psychology Club of London's secretary, for which she designed a club logo and letterhead. Between 1985 and 1997 Josp√© went to classes at the Slade School of Fine Art in the belief she would help other professional art bodies, and was mentioned in the Richard Platt's The Ultimate Photo Data Guide in 1989 for her work on a French phrasebook. Eventually she ceased to work in photography and returned to her first interest of painting; she focused mainly on watercolours. In 1992, Josp√© underwent an operation for cancer and was able to continue painting for as long as she could. She was elected to the Chelsea Art Club, the Royal Watercolour Society in 2001, and the New English Art Club two years later. Josp√© was a regular exhibitor at the latter two societies with studies on ponies, purple buds and white flowers put on a dark background. She died in London on May 17, 2004. The New English Art Club named the Cecil Josp√© Prize after her. It is awarded to \\"members to the work of a non-members.\\" Personality Simon Fenwick in The Independent described her as \\"stylish and articulate\\" and said several prominent members of the Analytical Psychology Club of London entertained by her family at her home. Her obituarist in The Times noted Josp√© was attracted to \\"an aesthetic of precision, order and simplicity\\" in an desire \\"to learn when to stop and how not to over-elaborate or take a picture too far into the realm of the overwrought and fussy.\\" References External links * Category:1928 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Artists from New Jersey Category:Photographers from New Jersey Category:American watercolorists Category:Radcliffe College alumni Category:American women photographers Category:American women painters Category:Women watercolorists Category:20th- century American women artists Category:21st-century American women artists Category:American emigrants to England Category:20th-century women photographers Category:21st-century women photographers ","title":"Cecile Josp√©"},{"id":"62368035","text":"History of Humanities is a double-blind peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to the history of the different traditions and disciplines in the humanities, across periods and cultures.

In historical times, Marcus Horatius Pulvillus was consul during the first year of the Roman Republic, in 509, and a second time in 507. His nephew Horatius Cocles played the leading role in the legendary Battle of the Sublician Bridge in 508, and his son Gaius was twice consul in 477 and 457. After this prominent debut, the Horatii Pulvilli disappear from the sources until Pulvillus. Two other Horatii were however recorded: Marcus Horatius Barbatus, consul in 449, and his son Lucius Horatius Barbatus, consular tribune in 425. Pulvillus' father is not known because the Fasti Capitolini are missing for the years between 389 and 381.

As a two- year-old in 2018 she showed promise as she won the Listed Criterium du Languedoc on the second of her two starts. In the following year she won the Prix Imprudence and recorded her biggest win when she took the Group 1 Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. Background Watch Me is a bay filly with a narrow white blaze bred in France by Antoinette Tamagni and Cocheese Bloodstock. In August 2017 the yearling filly was offered for sale at Deauville but failed to reach her reserve price of ‚Ç¨30,000. She races in the colours of Tamagni's son Alexander Tamagni-Bodmer in partnership with Regula Vannod and was sent into training with Francis-Henri Graffard. The filly has been ridden in most of her races by Pierre-Charles Boudot. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Olympic Glory, whose wins included the Prix Jean- Luc Lagard√®re, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, Lockinge Stakes and Prix de la For√™t. Watch Me's dam Watchful showed modest racing ability, winning two minor races from four starts as a three-year-old in 2007. She was a granddaughter of the Prix Vermeille winner Sharaya making her a close relative of Shareta and Shawanda. She was descended from the British broodmare Aimee (foaled in 1957) whose other descendants have included Blushing Groom and King Kamehameha. Racing career =2018: two-year-old season= Watch Me made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over 1600 meters at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 11 October and disputed the lead for most of the way before finishing third behind So Unique and Ouzala, beaten one and a half lengths by the winner. On 10 November she was stepped up in class for the Listed Criterium du Languedoc over the same distance at Toulouse and went off at odds of 4.7/1 in a field of eight colts and fillies. Racing on heavy ground she recovered from a poor start to take the lead inside the final furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" by one and a quarter lengths from Go To Hollywood. =2019: three-year-old season= On 10 April 2019 Watch Me began her second campaign in the Listed Prix Imprudence over 1400 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse in which she was partnered by Christophe Soumillon and started the 5.8/1 third chpice in a field of seven. After being restrained in the early stages she made progress in the last 400 metres overtook the favourite Suphala in the closing stages and won by a short neck. The filly was ridden by Olivier Peslier when she was moved up to the highest class for the Group 1 Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 12 May. She appeared to be making good progress when she was hampered in the closing stages and came home sixth of the ten runners behind Castle Lady. In June Watch Me was sent to England and started a 20/1 outsider for the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. Hermosa started favourite, while the other seven runners included Castle Lady, Pretty Pollyanna and the undefeated Jubiloso. After tracking the leaders, Boudot sent Watch Me into the lead approaching the final furlong and the French filly kept on well to defeat Hermosa by one and a half lengths. Her victory was enthusiastically celebrated by a contingent of flag-waving French supporters. Graffard said \\"She traveled really nicely, and I shouted a lot... I worked six years in England, so I always said to myself, 'I need to come here and win a big race.' I've tried before, but today is just amazing. I love this filly. I always thought she was very good, and it's incredible\\". Watch Me returned to the track in August for the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville Racecourse, a race which saw her matched against older horses for the first time. She was made the 2.1/1 favourite but was unable to quicken in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Romanised, Shaman and Line of Duty, beaten just over two and a half lengths by the winner. After another break the filly contested the Prix de l'Op√©ra over 2000 metres at Longchamp on 6 October in which she was repeatedly denied a clear run in the straight before coming home third behind Villa Marina and Fleeting. Pedigree *Watch Me was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Shirley Heights, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

She was appointed to the post at St Lambert's Church, M√ºnster in January 2014, becoming the first woman since 1383 to have held the position. (Earlier relevant records do not survive.) \\"T√ºrmer\\" and \\"T√ºrmerin\\" are not officially designated job titles in Germany and it has indeed been known for tour guides to adopt the title for themselves. However, Martje Salj√© is believed to be one of at least three genuine T√ºrmer or T√ºrmerinen in Germany who are also women. The nature of the duties has changed in recent decades: Martje Salj√©'s appointment to the St Lambert's post was nevertheless intended to preserve an authentic tradition. (Guided tours are not possible here.) Traditionally the job involved regular ascents to the top of a high tower in order to look out and warn fellow citizens (by means of a warning horn, bell, flags and/or, after dark, flashing lights) of approaching armies in time of war, and of outbreaks of house fires at any time. At times of intensified fire risk - for instance on windy days in periods of sustained hot dry weather, or in the event of possible firebomb attacks - it became necessary for a permanent watch to be kept from the top of the tower. In many middle European towns, medieval street patterns with their narrow streets endured well into or beyond the twentieth century, and where there is no readily accessible supply of building stone, the principal building material incorporated into most surviving residential and municipal buildings is timber. Many homes were heated with peat which could often nurture simmering internal hotspots for hours after the fire was believed to have finished burning, and then burst into flames after the householders had gone to bed. This translated into intensified levels of fire risk in many towns and cities. M√ºnster's present T√ºrmerin told an interviewer in 2015 that from her \\"office\\" at the top of the tall church tower she is still sometimes able to spot house fires and report them to the fire department, although \\"it does not happen so often\\" (es \\"kommt aber nicht allzu oft vor\\"). Biography =Personal= Martje Salj√© was born in Bremen. She spent a large part of her childhood living in Norway. While she was growing up the family also lived for a time in Canada. Gunther Salje, her father worked as professor of film and theatre. She tells interviewers that even as a small child she had an appetite for performing, mastering a range of instruments including piano, guitar, Double bass, flute, renaissance lute, accordion and 'cello. While she was growing up, membership of the local church community provided ample opportunity for helping to shape the music in the church, performing in bands and, beyond the musical scene, for engaging in youth work more broadly. After leaving school she studied History and Music at the University of Oldenburg. She retains a powerful addiction to music, consciously fixing her own settings and improvisations on the \\"rules\\" identified and codified by Bach: \\"Music used to be how I supported myself: today it is my hobby\\". She has performed on international tours in France, Belgium, Italy, Britain and Poland: she has worked with rock groups, dance troupes and jazz ensembles. After leaving university she worked in museums and archive departments and in teaching. She also continued to support herself as an itinerant musician. Her application to take over the post of T√ºrmerin (loosely \\"Tower keeper\\") was one of forty-six. Her fellow applicants included six other women. This is despite the fact that the post is a public-sector part-time position without the statutory notice period applicable to full-time positions, and involves extensive night-time and weekend working. Salj√© therefore combines the post with a second, more conventional part-time position as a worker with the local Sparda-Bank: \\"something completely different, involving computers\\" (\\"Etwas ganz anderes, was mit Computern\\"). Notwithstanding her robustly ebullient manner, Martje Salj√© is deeply religious. Religion drives much of her commitment to her work as \\"T√ºrmerin\\". Despite being a Protestant, she has no issues with the fact that she undertakes her responsibilities in the tower of a Catholic church, and she makes no secret of feeling \\"a bit closer to Heaven\\" (\\"...dem Himmel ein St√ºck n√§her...\\") in her little office high above the city streets. There is also more than a hint of vocation in her reaction when asked how long she intends to continue with her work as T√ºrmerin: \\"My predecessor carried on till his seventieth year. I might carry on for even longer if my joints hold out\\". =Professional \\"T√ºrmerin\\" duties= Salj√©'s daily duties begin each day (except on Tuesdays, which are silent) at 20.30, with a walk up the 300 steps to her little office 75 meters up in the church tower. The climb takes her past the base of the flag pole that emerges at the top of the tower, past the three suspended cages that were used to display the tortured corpses of anabaptist rebels after the suppression 1535 rebellion, and past the so-called \\"council and fire bells\\" (\\"Rats- und Brandglocke\\") which normally, these days, are sounded only for mayoral elections. The office is nevertheless positioned 25 meters below the tip of the spire that tops off the church tower. It is a narrow room, about the size of a typical student room. It contains a desk and a desk-chair along with a separate chair and a bookcase. On one of the walls are photographs of other towers, some of which Martje Salj√© has visited. There is also a photograph of Tinkabell and of Cocomau Miez de la Katz. These are the two cats with whom she shares her home '\\"...although really I'm a dog person\\"). Her first task each evening, still a little breathless from climbing up the tower, is to telephone the fire station to confirm that she is stationed for her shift in the tower. Every half hour between 21.00 and midnight she sounds the \\"tower horn\\" three times, facing in succession south, west and north. She does not sound the horn towards the east, because in that direction there used to be a large cemetery and, by tradition, it is not part of her responsibility to disturb the souls of the dead. An alternative explanation involves a rich and powerful man who used to live to the east of the tower and did not wish to be disturbed. In former times the horn was sounded regularly through the night between 22.00 and 06.00. The present instrument is made of copper and dates from 1950: it is based on a sixteenth century design. The tone resembles the blast from a ships horn, sounding a low C. Those regular steady horn blasts traditionally reassure the citizens of M√ºnster that they are facing neither an imminent fire in the city nor the approach of enemies from beyond the (imaginary) city walls. The number of the blasts represents the time. At 21.00 there are nine blasts, with a brief pause after each batch of three. At 22.00 there are ten blasts, with a brief pause after the first two batches of three, followed by a third batch of four blasts. (\\"One has to breathe whilst blowing the horn! 2 Tootings are easy, 3 ooookay, 4 dang! any longer and the Tuermerin might feel somewhat giddy\\".) The same pattern is followed till Midnight (twelve blasts in four batches of three) after which, in modern times, the citizens can spend the rest of the night undisturbed by Martje Salj√©'s \\"tower horn\\". Interviewed in May 2015, after just fifteen months in the job, Martje Salj√© was able to report that she had already spotted several fire outbreaks while on watch. Under these circumstances her first duty is to telephone the fire station to alert them to as many details as she can determine from her vantage point. After that she takes up her \\"tower horn\\". Instead of the steady long blasts she uses to communicate the time, she communicates the emergency with an urgent succession of staccato notes. There is nevertheless very much more to Martje Salj√©'s approach to her job as \\"T√ºrmerin\\" than enjoying the view out of her office window and blowing her horn at half hourly intervals during the latter part of the evening. She sees herself as a principal point of contact between the city of M√ºnster and people all over the world: \\"Through my own blog [from my office in the tower] to the outside world I publicise the city's traditions ... I enter into real-time dialogue with other people and win for M√ºnster and for St Lambert's the interest of a completely new target group\\". But she stresses that her employment is not with the church, but with the city. She also operates a Facebook page from the tower. In terms of gaining the attention of target groups, she is not unaware of the extra attention she gains by being both the first woman and the first inveterate blogger in more than six centuries to have served as T√ºrmerin. She also sees herself as an advocate and representative for the tower, taking part in media interviews and presentations, and performing in charity events on behalf of the church or the city. She has opinions on many topics and is happy to share most of them. Discussions recently arose as to whether it was entirely seemly that the church tower should be used to exhibit to passers-by the three cages that were used to display the tortured corpses of anabaptist rebels in the sixteenth century. The history graduate had views to express: \\"They are part of the city's history, and it would be disingenuous to remove them. You cannot explain everything through the prism of twenty-first century norms. They must stay there to generate discussions and support opinions. M√ºnster can handle that!\\". She also turns her hand to researching aspects of city history and joining in with website maintenance and development. Even for Salj√©, however, there are topics on which she keeps her own counsel. In 2015 she rejected an interviewer's attempt to extract from her an opinion on the current (in 2019) chancellor: \\"As T√ºrmerin of the city of M√ºnster, thanks to the neutrality requirement I am not permitted to talk about politics. But I pay very close attention to what goes on in the world, in Europe and in Germany\\".

It is visible only from aerial photography. It is, along with Pict's Knowe, one of two scheduled monuments in Troqueer parish.  Description  Curriestanes is an earthwork cursus. While familiar from cursus sites in England, these types of monuments are less common than timber cursuses in Scotland. Less than fifteen monuments of this type have been found in Scotland and only five including Curriestanes have been excavated. Curriestanes is rare in having an entrance gap in one of its terminals, a feature known from only a handful of sites in the UK. The cursus is particularly wide at 100m, with a known area of at least three hectares. Only 3 other cursus monuments in Scotland are wider: East Linton, Brioch and Monktonhill. The ditches are irregular and do not appear to be have been intended to be exactly straight which suggests that they may been built in short segments. The ditches are wide, 7m, and shallow, no deeper than 0.6m.  Context  Unlike England, where cursus monuments have been known and studied for hundreds of years, the study of cursus monuments is a recent phenomenon. Before 1976, when RCAHMS began its aerial photography programme, only one definite cursus site was known in Scotland: Gallaberry in Dumfreis and Galloway. Over 50 Scottish sites have now been identified. These are found in two main geographical concentrations, in lowland Angus and Perthshire and another in Dumfries and Galloway, for the most part in and around the Nith valley. Curriestanes is one of twelve such monuments in Dumfries and Galloway. 200m to the south of the terminal of the monument, there is a ring-ditch, also only visible as a cropmark.

It is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and listed as a Historic Monument. Description The parish was established by Bishop of Paris Pierre de Nemours in 1213. The current church was built in the second half of the 16th century on the site of a former church. It was consecrated by Bishop of Paris Eustache du Bellay on June 10th, 1560. At that time, it was dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption and to Saint Gemma. The church was built with limestone from the region of Creil. This suggests the construction was made quickly in order to alleviate the lack of places of worship following the Hundred Years War. The vaults of the church were re-built after the bombings of the Franco- Prussian War. The bell tower was knocked down in 1950. The church was listed as a Historic Monument in 1984. The church was closed in 1995 for archaeological excavations to start. The renovation works started in May 2012 lasted two years. Interior The main altar and the altarpiece of the church were listed as Historic Monument objects. The stone altarpiece and the sculpted tabernacle date back to the second half of the 17th century. In 1929, two glass walls made by the Ateliers Lorin of Chartres led by Charles Lorin were added to the church. The first one shows the Adoration of the Magi and of the Shepherds, while the second one represents the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary. In arts The church of Our Lady of the Assumption was shown in Maurice Utrillo's painting Eglise de Stains around 1930. The painting is preserved at Galerie P√©trid√®s.

He witnessed the transformation of Bydgoszcz, creating numerous residential buildings throughout the city. His activity became, in a sense, an indicator of Bydgoszcz building traditions, bridging old neo classicist masters and their successors, inspired by Historicism and Art Nouveau. Life =Anton's family= Anton Hoffmann came from Greater Poland. He was born at the beginning of the 1820s in Chodzie≈º (then Kolmar in Posen). He was the first- born son of Anton Hoffmann, a translator, and Johanna n√©e Braun. His year of birth raises doubts, but one assumes Anton's most reliable date of birth is May 24, 1823.Based on the obituary posted by the family in the Bromberger Zeitung when he died He spent the first several years of his life in his hometown of Chodzie≈º, probably graduating from elementary school here. Then, between 1835 and 1837, the Hoffmanns moved to ≈Åob≈ºenica, but after a few years they moved to Bydgoszcz. In December 1846 they certainly lived in the city, in a rented house or, most likely, their own, marked No. 377, at today's Father Ignacy Skorupka street.Archiwum Pa≈Ñstwowe w Bydgoszczy , http://www.bydgoszcz.ap.gov.pl/ The exact date of their arrival in the city is known by the registration book where is recorded the birth of Anton's five younger siblings (i.e. between 1840 and 1846). =Beginnings= Anton was registered as involved in masonry when settling in Bydgoszcz: it seems likely he began his apprenticeship in ≈Åob≈ºenica, knowing the basics of profession while arriving in Bromberg at age 23, where he worked as an independent (his first own designs date back to 1847). However, he was getting educated under the direction of mason masters (Hermann Donner, Emst Koch, Johann Wilhelm Krause, Friedrich Meyer, Gottlieb Meyer, Carl Schultz and Wilhelm Adolph Sieg). Anton received his Masonry Master's diploma between 1855 and 1857. On May 8, 1866 Anton Hoffmann married Michalina ≈öwiƒôcicka n√©e Woytalewicz, widow of a Bydgoszcz shoemaker, in the parish church of Saints Marcin and Miko≈Çaj in Bydgoszcz. Michalina from the first marriage had eight children, the younger still living with her. Among them was seven-year-old J√≥zef Stanis≈Çaw (1859-1913), whom Hoffmann educated as a builder. Ha was to become one of the most famous Bydgoszcz architect, i.e. J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki. In 1881-1882, Anton and J√≥zef set up a common design studio. =Architect career= Unlike most construction masters at the time, Anton never built his own home nor lived in a property he owned: he rented the apartments in which he lived and worked.Bromberg address books indicate that A. Hoffmann never had a separate studio. With the help of address books, can consequently work out the different houses he lived in with his family:Wohnungs - Anzeiger und Adress- Buch f√ºr die Stadt und den Polizeibezirk Bromberg, nastƒôpnie Adressbuch nebst Geschafts - Anzeiger von Bromberg und des sen Vororten, na lata 1855. 1858. 1864. 1869. 1872-1908 * 52 Feldstrasse (today's Jackowski Street) in 1855 ; * 12 Bahnhofstrasse (29 Dworcowa street) in 1858; House at 29 Dworcowa * 38 Friedrichstrasse (4 D≈Çuga street), in 1864; * 12 Neue Pfarrstrasse (6 Jezuicka street), from 1866 to 1876; House at 6 Jezuicka street * 11 Wilhelmstrasse (16 Focha street), from 1877 to 1880 and in 1892; Building at 16 Focha street * 3 Bahnhofstrasse (7 Dworcowa street) between 1881 and 1884; Tenement at 7 Dworcowa street * 25 Gammstrasse (10 Doktora Emila Warmi≈Ñskiego street), from 1885 to 1891; * 151/152 Danzigerstrasse (34/36 Gda≈Ñska street), from 1893 to 1895; House located today at then 151/152 Danzigerstrasse * 36 Danzigerstrasse (59 Gda≈Ñska street) in 1896; * 41 Danzigerstrasse (69 Gda≈Ñska street) between 1897 and 1900; House at 69 Gda≈Ñska street * 47 Rinkauerstrasse (46 Pomorska Street) in 1901-1902; * 38 Danzigerstrasse (63 Gda≈Ñska street) in 1903; Tenement at 63 Gda≈Ñska street * 6 Schulstrasse (86 Bielicka street) from 1904 to 1908. Unlike his colleagues, he was not involved in lucrative and relatively popular real estate: many of his contemporaries purchased plots of land, invested in buildings, and then sold them for profit. Once retired, Anton moved to a rental flat located on the outskirts of the Bielsko Nowe commune. Here he spent the four last years of his life as a rentier. He died on Friday evening, February 14, 1908, and was buried four days later at the Nowofary Cemetery in Bydgoszcz.Nekrolog. \\"Bromberger Zeitung\\" 1908, nr 40. Style and influence Anton's architectural achievements, shaped under the influence of the older generation of architects active in Bydgoszcz from 1825 to the late 1860s, is inscribed in the city landscape. Hoffmann, remarkably, designed and participated in the implementation of construction for half a century, working with most, if not all, of building companies in the city. No one else worked in the construction industry as long as he did. A. Hoffmann was the author of a considerable number of projects made for property owners located in Bromberg and its suburbs. He designed tenement houses, modest front houses, residential outbuildings, craft workshops and various outbuildings: warehouses, stables, laundries, coach houses, sheds and toilets. By and large, front houses designed by Hoffmann are realized in classicist and neo- renaissance styles: he was a traditionalist, not looking for new solutions, but repeated proven composition patterns. His projects were buildings of simple shapes, bearing no specific features identifying them with their author. He generally based the composition of his edifices on the axis of symmetry, as done according to Neo-Renaissance canons. In addition, the decoration of his buildings was very modest, referring to the Neo-Classicism style. Listing the overall achievements of Anton Hoffmann is difficult, since the authorship of many edifices, especially those built from 1875 to 1900, remains undetermined. Loyal as he was to stylistic conservatism, Anton could not compete with the skills of the following generation, inspired by historicism and early Art Nouveau: hence he was not remembered for any prestigious building. Be that as it may, Anton Hoffmann made a permanent place in the history of Bydgoszcz architecture and his architectural activity, and his work was appreciated for its reliability.

The regiment is part of the army's infantry corps' Bersaglieri speciality and was last operationally assigned to the Bersaglieri Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\".  History  = World War I = The 18th Bersaglieri Regiment was raised on 31 January 1917 by the depot of the 12th Bersaglieri Regiment in Milan. It received the newly raised battalions LXIX (raised by the 10th Bersaglieri Regiment), LXVII (raised by the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment), and LXVIII (raised by the 12th Bersaglieri Regiment). The regiment immediately entered the front along the Isonzo and distinguished itself rapidly, earning a Gold Medal of Military Valour on 16-17 November 1917 in Fagar√® on the shores of the Piave river, where the Royal Italian Army tried to establish the new front after the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Caporetto. After the war the 18th Bersaglieri Regiment was disbanded on 31 December 1919. The regiment was raised again on 1 April 1935 in preparation for the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, but it was disbanded without having left Italy on 31 December 1936. = World War II = On 1 February 1942 the depot of the 5th Bersaglieri Regiment in Siena raised the 18th Bersaglieri Regiment again. The regiment was structured as follows: * 18th Bersaglieri Regiment ** I Reconnaissance Group (renamed LXVIII Battalion on 15 April 1942) *** 1st Armored Car Company (AB41 armored cars) *** 2nd Tank Company (L6/40 light tanks) *** 3rd Tank Company (L6/40 light tanks) *** 4th Motorcyclists Company ** II Reconnaissance Group (renamed LXIX Battalion on 15 April 1942) *** 5th Self-propelled Cannons Company (L40 self-propelled guns) *** 6th Anti-aircraft Cannons Company (20/65 anti-aircraft guns) After a few days the two tank companies were used to raise the LXVII Armored Bersaglieri Battalion, which was sent to the Eastern Front in Ukraine and Russia to join the 3rd Fast Division \\"Principe Amedeo Duca d'Aosta\\". Meanwhile the 18th Bersaglieri Regiment was sent to Provence in France on garrison duty. Recalled to Italy in early September 1943 the regiment was disbanded on 8 September 1943 after the Germans occupied Italy. = Cold War =  67th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Fagar√®\\"  During the 1975 Italian Army reform the IV Bersaglieri Battalion of the 3rd Armored Infantry Regiment in Persano was renamed 67th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Fagar√®\\". The \\"Fagar√®\\" battalion received the war flag and traditions of the 18th Bersaglieri Regiment and joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\". Bersaglieri battalions created during the reform were named, with two exceptions, for battles in which Bersaglieri units had distinguished themselves: the 67th Bersaglieri Battalion was named for its conduct at Fagar√® on 16-17 November 1917, which had earned the regiment a Gold Medal of Military Valour. = Recent times = As part of its reorganization after the Cold War the Italian Army moved the Bersaglieri Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\" from Pordenone in Northern Italy to Caserta in Southern Italy. On 1 July 1991 67th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Fagar√®\\" joined the \\"Garibaldi\\" brigade. On 20 September 1993 the \\"Fagar√®\\" battalion was renamed 18th Bersaglieri Regiment without changing size or composition and moved from Persano to Cosenza in Calabria. A company of the 18th Bersaglieri Regiment was the first Italian unit to deploy to North Macedonia for a possible NATO-led ground invasion of Kosovo during the Kosovo War. The full regiment arrived soon after and together with the other units of the Bersaglieri Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\" prepared for a planned ground invasion. After the signing of the Kumanovo Agreement between Yugoslavia and Kosovo Force the regiment was one of the first NATO units to enter Kosovo, where it advanced to the city of Peƒá, where it took up garrison and peacekeeping duties until 7 September 1999. For its conduct in Kosovo the regiment was awarded a Gold Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the regiment's war flag and added to the regiment's coat of arms. After the regiment's return from Kosovo it was re-equipped with Dardo infantry fighting vehicles. The regiment deployed to Iraq after the end of the Iraq War, arriving in Nasiriyah on 22 June 2003. Taking up garrison and peacekeeping duties in the city the regiment found itself soon embroiled in the Iraqi insurgency. On 7 October 2003 the regiment left Iraq and returned to Italy. For its conduct in Iraq the regiment was awarded a Gold Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the regiment's war flag and added to the regiment's coat of arms. On 1 January 2005 the regiment was renamed 1st Bersaglieri Regiment and the war flag of the 18th was transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

The regiment is part of the army's infantry corps' Bersaglieri speciality and was last operationally assigned to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Aosta\\".  History  The Regiment was raised on 16 September 1884 in Verona with the existing XXI, XXIII and XXXVI battalions. The XXIII Battalion had distinguished itself during the Third Italian War of Independence at Castel di Borgo in Borgo Valsugana earning a Silver Medal of Military Valour, which the battalion transferred to the newly raised regiment. The regiment participated in the First Italo-Ethiopian War and the Italo-Turkish War. = World War I = At the outbreak of World War I the regiment was garrisoned in Milan and sent to the front along the Isonzo, where the regiment earned its second Silver Medal of Military Valour and a Bronze Medal of Military Valour. On 31 January 1917 the regiment's depot in Milan raised the 18th Bersaglieri Regiment. After the war the 12th Bersaglieri Regiment was disbanded, but it was raised again in 1923 with two cyclist battalions, which were exchanged on 11 March 1926 with the XXI and XXIII Bersaglieri battalions. At the outbreak of World War II the regiment consisted of the XXI Motorcyclists Battalion, the XXIII Auto-transported Battalion, the XXXVI Auto-transported Battalion. = World War II = In spring 1941 the regiment participated in the Invasion of Yugoslavia. In early 1942 the regiment was sent to Libya to join the 133rd Armored Division \\"Littorio\\" for the Western Desert campaign. The regiment entered the line on 20 June 1942 at the end of the Battle of Gazala and was heavily engaged six days later at the Battle of Mersa Matruh. Reduced to a strength of 1,000 men the regiment fought in the Second Battle of El Alamein. Forced to retreat the remnants of the regiment reached Tripoli on 12 November 1942, where on 8 December 1942 the 12th Bersaglieri Regiment was disbanded and the survivors integrated in the 7th Bersaglieri Regiment. = Cold War = On 24 May 1961 the XXIII Bersaglieri Battalion was raised again as mechanized infantry unit of the 182nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\". On 1 March 1964 the 32nd Tank Regiment was raised again and the XXIII Bersaglieri Battalion became its mechanized infantry battalion.  23rd Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Castel di Borgo\\"  During the 1975 Italian Army reform the 32nd Tank Regiment was disbanded on 1 October 1975 and the XXIII Bersaglieri Battalion was renamed 23rd Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Castel di Borgo\\" and received the war flag and traditions of the 12th Bersaglieri Regiment. The battalion was based in Tauriano and part of the 32nd Armored Brigade \\"Mameli\\". Bersaglieri battalions created during the reform were named, with two exceptions, for battles in which Bersaglieri units had distinguished themselves: the 23rd Bersaglieri Battalion was named for its conduct at Castel di Borgo during the Third Italian War of Independence. For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the battalion was awarded a Silver Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. = Recent times = After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and the Mameli was the first brigade to be disbanded. On 1 April 1991 the brigade was officially deactivated and the 23rd Bersaglieri Battalion was transferred to the 132nd Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\". On 31 March 1992 the Castel di Borgo was transferred to Trapani in Sicily, where the battalion joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Aosta\\". On 2 September 1992 the battalion was renamed 12th Bersaglieri Regiment without changing size or composition. On 15 April 2005 the regiment was renamed 6th Bersaglieri Regiment and its battalion renamed 6th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Palestro\\". Afterwards the war flag of the 12th Bersaglieri Regiment was transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

Cruising was required until 1996, when a change in regulations allowed riverboat casinos in Missouri to be permanently moored. For some time, two casinos were actually operating, one on the boat and another on a barge, until 1999, when the entire casino was consolidated to a barge, partially due to a regulation change which eliminated boarding restrictions.https://lasvegassun.com/news/1999/nov/04/station-casino-st- charles-closes-riverboat-to-expa/ In October 2000, Station Casinos sold its Missouri properties, also including Station Casino Kansas City in the deal to Ameristar Casinos.

The term was first used in 2017 by sociologists Brad Christerson and Richard Flory in their book The Rise of Network Christianity: How Independent Leaders are Changing the Religious Landscape to describe the rapid growth of a form of Protestant Christianity from 1970‚Äì2010, and has since been adopted by other commentators. The movement is distinguished from other forms of Christianity by its use of network governance, based on networks of charismatic apostles, rather than more traditional church structures and hierarchies. These networks are sustained by the use of new communications technologies such as social media, which both facilitates communication between leaders in the network and enables leaders to build a following which is not tied to a geographical area. It is characterised by belief in and encouragement of the use of the supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit, along with a focus on the transformation of society according to Christian values through prayer and by Christians reaching positions of leadership in the areas of business, government, media, arts and entertainment, education, family, and religion. INC Christianity tends to be politically conservative and, in the US, associated with support for Republican politicians. The movement has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s Calvary Chapel and Vineyard movements, with INC Christianity emerging as leaders in these movements sought to break free from organisational structures and formed informal affinity networks. According to Christerson and Flory, INC is the fastest growing Christian group in the US. As a movement, it has been particularly appealing to younger people, especially millennials. Distinguishing features Bill Johnson, senior leader of Bethel Church; both Johnson and the church have been described by various commentators as part of INC Christianity. Independent Network Christianity is not a denomination but rather a network of independent church and parachurch leaders. Whereas more traditional church movements (which, in this case, includes neo-Charismatic movements established in the 1970s such as Vineyard, Calvary Chapel, and Hope Chapel) have sought to build congregations and create franchises of affiliated churches, INC leaders prefer to try to directly influence the beliefs and practices of individuals, regardless of their personal and denominational affiliations. Individual salvation is regarded as more important than building church congregations; without any formal denomination or movement, individual leaders are connected by informal yet powerful co-operative networks.Christerson & Flory 2017a, p. 8. INC can thus be described as operating a kind of network governance.Smith 2018. Leaders in the INC network are referred to by insiders as apostles. Apostles tend to be charismatic in the Weberian sense of being seen to possess a supernatural authority which authenticates their ministry. An international network of apostles is facilitated by modern communication technologies such as the internet, allowing the sharing of ideas and pursuit of joint projects without the limitations of operating within a hierarchical structure.Christerson & Flory 2017a, pp. 50‚Äî53. These modern technologies allow INC leaders to build international ministries and followings, using the internet and social media to create interconnected online venues which do not depend of geographical ties. Followers engage primarily with leaders through these online forums, sometimes travelling to attend conferences.Smith 2018.Ostling 2017. In their book, Christerson & Flory cite Ch√© Ahn and his Harvest International Ministries, Bill Johnson and Bethel Church, and Mike Bickle and the International House of Prayer as examples of INC leaders and organisations.Christerson & Flory 2017a, 32‚Äî42. Richard Ostling has also named Cindy Jacobs and Chuck Pierce as INC leaders.Ostling 2017. =Beliefs= Existing within charismatic Christianity, INC leaders and organisations believe in the continued operation of the supernatural spiritual gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as supernatural healing, miracles, prophecy and speaking in tongues.Smith 2018.Bringing Heaven to Earth, 2:33. Supernatural activity is not limited to charismatic leaders; schools such as Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry teach their students to practice supernatural gifts themselves and use them in the community. Christerson and Flory argue that the promise of direct experience of the supernatural is attractive to young people and a key draw for them becoming involved in INC organisations.Christerson & Flory 2017a, pp. 84‚Äî86. Dyron B. Daughrity, a professor of religion and philosophy at Pepperdine University, has noted that the charismatic beliefs and practices of International House of Prayer, an INC church, combined with the online accessibility of its content, has made it particularly appealing to millennials.Daughrity 2018, pp. 65‚Äî66. As well as belief in the supernatural gits of the Holy Spirit, a defining characteristic of INC Christianity is belief in social transformation. In contrast with classic pentecostalism, which tends to hold out little hope for social justice in this world and thus focuses its efforts on evangelism and discipleship, many INC groups believe that heaven can be made on earth through the action of Christians.Christerson & Flory 2017a, p. 92. This commitment to social change involves the desire to see INC Christians in positions of leadership in the \\"seven mountains of culture\\": business, government, media, arts and entertainment, education, family, and religion.Ostling 2017.Bringing Heaven to Earth, 2:51. The intention is to create a \\"trickle down effect\\", whereby the values of Christians who reach the top of these mountains will ultimately influence the whole of American and global society.Daughrity 2018, p. 66. INC Christianity tends to be politically conservative and, in the United States, supportive of the Republican Party, with INC leaders regularly endorsing Republican candidates. In 2016, Mike Bickle endorsed Ted Cruz's bid for the Republican presidential nomination and Lance Wallnau, another INC leader, supported Donald Trump's presidential bid. Philosopher James K. A. Smith has suggested that the religious mindset offered by INC Christianity ‚Äî that of deference to powerful and charismatic leaders ‚Äî could partly explain the growth of populism which led to the election of Donald Trump.Smith 2018. Journalist Richard Ostling has suggested that INC support of Trump, some of which regards him as an outsider anointed by God, in the mould of King Cyrus, deserves greater press scrutiny.Ostling 2017. History Christerson and Flory identify the roots of Independent Network Charismatic Christianity in the Calvary Chapel and Vineyard movements of the late 1960s and 1970s, and John Wimber as the individual with whom many of the early INC leaders had a connection. Controversies within the Vineyard in the late 1980s and early 1990s ‚Äî specifically the Vineyard's association with the Kansas City Prophets and the Toronto Blessing ‚Äî culminated in some leading figures within the early Vineyard leaving the movement and, rather than establishing their own churches or denominations, these leaders formed a looser network which enabled individual leaders to build their own ministries without the limitations or responsibilities involved in managing groups of churches. These leaders, including C. Peter Wagner, Bill Johnson, Ch√© Ahn and Mike Bickle, focused their efforts on spreading their personal influence through these networks and the use of new media technologies.Christerson & Flory, pp. 18‚Äî26. Demographics According to research by Christerson and Flory, \\"INC Christianity is the fastest-growing Christian group in America and possibly around the world.\\" While overall Protestant church attendance shrunk by 0.05% on average per year between 1970 and 2010, \\"independent neo-charismatic congregations\\", of which INC congregations are a subset, grew by an average of 3.24% per year in the same timeframe.Christerson & Flory 2017a, pp. 3‚Äî4.Christerson & Flory 2017b. INC Christianity has been particularly effective at attracting young people, especially millennials.Christerson & Flory 2017b.Daughrity 2018, p. 66.Bringing Heaven to Earth, 21:34. Ostling has suggested that this appeal is the result of INC's more flexible model of Christian belonging which prioritises experience over theology, as well as its effective use of social media.Ostling 2017.

Due to its large number of visitors and its cultural pleasures, it represented a highlight of the knightly way of life and the development of power of the dynasty of Hohenstaufen. Depiction of the Diet of Mainz in 1184 in theS√§chsische Weltchronik, Northern Germany, First Quarter 14th Century, Berlin, State Library of Prussian Cultural Heritage.  Preparation  In 1183, after successes in Italian politics and the subjugation of Henry the Lion at the beginning of the 1180s, Emperor Frederick I announced a court day in Mainz for the following year. A city of wooden buildings and tents was to be built especially for the court day. In its centre the palace of the emperor and a church were built. Since the Court Day had already been announced a year in advance, French, Spanish, English, Italian and Balkan visitors were able to arrive in addition to visitors from the imperial territories north of the Alps.  Festivities  The Diet of Mainz began on 20 May 1184. On this Pentecote the high mass was celebrated in the wooden church with the participation of the crowned imperial couple. The Emperor's swordbearer was the Count of Hainaut. The Chancellor of the Count of Hainaut, Gislebert of Mons, retrospectively claimed that there had been a dispute among the most powerful princes over the right to carry a sword and that it had ultimately been left to the Count of Hainaut, since he had been highly celebrated and related to many of the princes present. While research partly followed this judgement and noted that the emperor wanted to show the count his favour on the Lower Rhine because of his strategic importance, ritual research came to a different conclusion. Since there is no evidence that the princes had ever argued about this service before, it is assumed that the Count of Hainaut was forced to carry a sword as a symbolic form of classification into the ruling system, especially since he was also elevated to the rank of Imperial Prince at court day (Gerd Althoff). Following his entry into the cathedral, a large banquet took place, during which the greats of the empire provided the court offices of the innkeeper, Truchsesses, chamberlain and marshal. The following day the two sons of Friedrich, Henry and Frederick, personally received the accolade through him. The emperor's sons and many princes, who followed their example and did not want to be inferior to them in this respect, gave the knights and minstrels gifts in the form of horses, precious clothes, gold and silver. This was followed by a riding event called gyrum, at which the knights showed their skills in swinging shields, banners and lances. Among the alleged 20,000 participants were the emperor and his sons. The next day the riding events continued. In the following week fighting games were to take place in Ingelheim. However, a storm caused several tents and the wooden church to collapse and also caused deaths among the celebrants. This was interpreted as a divine sign and the celebration was not continued.  Actions of Politics  During the diet the emperor negotiated with Henry the Lion protected by archbishop Conrad about an anti-French alliance with England, which however remained unsuccessful. Another political event of far greater symbolic importance was the dispute over the rank of Abbot Konrad of Fulda. According to the chronicler Arnold of L√ºbeck, during a meeting of the princes he demanded it as his old right to sit to the left of the emperor at the time of court day. Only the Archbishop of Cologne had long contested the exercise of this right. The emperor then asked the archbishop of Cologne, Philipp of Heinsberg, who felt duped by the emperor's Lower Rhine territorial policy, to grant the wish of the abbot of Fulda. The archbishop had to regard this as an attack on his position, which found expression in the form of the seating arrangement. Philip then asked to leave the festivities and go to his inn, which was tantamount to refusing to consent to his ritual reduction of rank. This was followed by a scandal when numerous vassals of the Archbishop, including the Count Palatine near the Rhine, a brother of the Emperor, also requested their withdrawal from the festivities. Thereupon, according to Arnold, the emperor's son Heinrich jumped up and fell to the archbishop with the words: \\"I beg you, dearest father, stay here and do not turn our joy into mourning\\" Philip was then allowed to take the place on the emperor's left, while the abbot of Fulda had to sit on one of the lower seats.  Reception  The splendour of the Diet of Mainz was praised both in chronicles and in poetry. Thus Heinrich von Veldeke compared the court day in the Eneas novel with the marriage between Aeneas and Lavinia. The chronicler Arnold of L√ºbeck established a connection with the banquet of King Ahasuerus. Also the poet Guiot de Provins reported about the Mainz diet. The research sees in the Mainz Court Day due to the size of the number of participants and the effort a sure indication that Barbarossa wanted to put an end to his largely failed Italian policy and at the same time make it forgotten by a demonstration of his ruling power.

It is often called \\"the royal position\\" or \\"royal ease\\" in English, and is a relaxed pose typical in royal portraits and those of religious figures whose \\"kingly\\" attributes are being emphasized. The figure sits on a throne with one leg tucked inwards on the seat and the other hanging down (\\"pendent\\") to touch the ground or rest on a support (often a stylized lotus throne). Usually it is the proper right leg that dangles, but the reversed image can be found. Bare feet are normal. Asana is a general term for a seated pose, from ƒÅsana \\"sitting down\\" (from ‡§Ü‡§∏ ƒÅs \\"to sit down\\"), a sitting posture, a seat. Some sources distinguish between the lalitasana posture, as described above, and the \\"royal ease\\" (maharajalilasana or rajalilasana), where the right leg (usually) is bent, and the foot rests on the same level as the sitting body, and the extended arm is placed on the raised knee. With all variants the technical phrasing describes a figure as being \\"in\\" the pose: \\"seated in lalitasana\\".See museum and other references.

The dangling foot often rests on something, whether a lotus flower, or the figure's vahana or \\"vehicle\\", the animal that is also an identifying attribute, or a vase. As the pose emphasizes the royal aspect of the figure, they will very often wear a high Indian crown. In Indian art, especially ancient and medieval, the pose is often used for female figures, but in the art of Java these are very rare, and restricted to figures closely following Indian models. This restriction may well be because the normal female dress (though not worn by deities in art) made the pose impossible for women.Kempers, 54‚Äì55 The pose with the proper left leg pendent is technically savya-lalitasana or sukhasana, and with the right leg pendent vama-lalitasana.An Encyclopaedia of Buddhist Deities, Demigods, Godlings, Saints and Demons: With Special Focus on Iconographic Attributes, Volume 2, pp. 1014-1016, 1994, D.K. Printworld, , 9788124600191 History The pose is typical in depictions of kings, and sometimes queens and court notables, in early Buddhist sculpture (broadly dating from c. 100 BCE to 200 CE) from sites such as Sanchi, Bharhut and Amaravati. Mostly these show scenes from the life or earlier lives of the Buddha, but there are other secular scenes.Rosenfield, 186 The pose is found for religious figures from Kushan art (1st to 4th century CE) from Gandhara and Mathura,Asia, 125 although at this period it is rare, with a larger number of seated Buddha images, many with crossed legs, a pose that disappears later.Asia, 120 It becomes increasing popular in the Post-Gupta period of medieval India, and has remained so, being often used in contemporary Hindu imagery in particular. Figures commonly shown in lalitasana =Buddhist= In later periods, the pose is very common for bodhisattva images, and deities such as Tara, but rare for the Buddha himself, except as the \\"future Buddha\\" Maitreya.Pal, 24 It is often seen depicting the pot-bellied god of wealth, Jambhala in Buddhism and Kubera to Hindus. =Hinduism= The pose is common for Brahma,Asia, 132-133 Vishnu, Shiva and their consorts, from around the Gupta period onwards. Also the Matrikas, who are typically identified by their different animal supporters, and numerous other figures. As a distinctive regional feature, temples in Odisha in the classic Ka·∏∑inga architectural style very often have a figure of Gajalaxmi in lalitasana as their lalatabimba or central protective image over the doorway to a temple or the sanctuary of one.Panda, Sasanka Sekhar, \\"Goddess Laksmi: The Consort of the Lord\\", pp. 121-124, Orissa Review, July 2005 File:Labit - jataka - Scene of gyneceum in an earlier life of Buddha - Ghantasala India.jpgKing and queen in Jataka scene of an earlier life of the Buddha, c. 200, from Ghantasala File:Engravings in pathway of Ajanta.JPGNaga-king and consort, Cave 19, Ajanta Caves, c. 478 File:Maitreya (Mile), China, Hebei Province, Quyang, Northern Qi dynasty, 550-577 AD, marble, traces of pigment - Arthur M.

Founded in 1876 by Charles Goodnight and John George Adair, it is the oldest cattle ranching operation in the Texas Panhandle. Its headquarters area was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 for its association with Goodnight, one of the most influential cattle barons of the late 19th century. The ranch is an ongoing business, operated by Adair's descendants. Description and history The JA Ranch is located southeast of Amarillo, Texas in the Texas Panhandle. The main ranch house, now a museum devoted to Charles Goodnight, is located a short way south of United States Route 287. It is a two-story construction, its oldest portion a log cabin which predates the American Civil War. The main portion of the house, built beginning in 1879, has rough stone walls on the ground floor and a wood-framed second story. Nearby outbuildings include the original 19th-century stables and corral, and a house for bunking ranch hands. With Charles Goodnight (1836-1929) was a native of Illinois who became a Texas Ranger in 1857. After the American Civil War, he became involved in cattle herding operations that recovered many thousands of heads of cattle left unsupervised during the conflict, blazing major herding trails across West Texas. After starting a ranching operation in eastern Colorado, he returned to the Palo Duro Canyon area (site of a major operation he led against the Kiowa and Comanche), and established a small ranch in 1874. He then entered into a partnership with John Adair, an Ulster Scots immigrant, who funded the ranch's expansion while Goodnight managed it. Under his oversight the ranch grew to over . He retired to a smaller ranch nearby in 1889.

League history  In 1945, Branch Rickey was anticipating the integration of black players into Major League Baseball. Rickey, along with Gus Greenlee who was the owner of the original Pittsburgh Crawfords, created the USL as a method to scout black players specifically to break the color line. It is unclear if the league actually played the 1945 season or if it was only used as a pretense for integration. Rickey signed Jackie Robinson, who never played in the USL, in October of that year. The 1946 season lasted only a few weeks before the league folded. Robinson went on the break the Major League color line in 1947 with Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers.

It is bounded by Smedjegatan in north, Kungsgatan in east, Stationsgatan in south, and F√∂reningsgatan in west. To the west lies also the plaza Stora Torg, and across is block Minerva with the Terraza building. Tellushuset Tellushuset, or The Tellus Building in English, is a three story tall residential and retail building in the south- western corner along Storgatan and F√∂reningsgatan, it is also met by the street Stationsgatan from south-west, and is one of the few remaining buildings from Ljungby's market town period. It was finished in 1906 after the former wooden building with Peter Adam Johansson shoe factory burnt down 1904. Tellushuset is constructed with bricks from one of Ljungby's two brickyards, dressed in pink plaster with a base and decorations in brown-red bricks, adorned with a patina coated copper roof with an onion dome, and verdigris windows. Tellushuset was designed by architect Aron Johansson, raised in Ryssby outside Ljungby, who also designed the national parliament building Riksdagshuset and then central bank building Riksbankshuset on the island Helgeandsholmen in Stockholm. It is also likely that Aron Johansson designed Tellushuset's one story shorter twin-sister Fogelbergska huset, that stood finished 1910 and lay diagonally across the plaza Stora Torg on city block M√•nen. According to the artist and former rector of the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Institute of Art, Sven Ljungberg, the two buildings contributed the impression of being in a Russian city, especially wintertime. = Plans for demolition = While both Tellushuset and its sister Fogelbergska survived the fire of 1953, they were about to be demolished to give room to the newly planned modern metropolitan city centre. The M√•nen block with Fogelbergska was demolished already in 1963 and was replaced by an EPA department store. After that, it was Tellus' and Tellushuset's turn. The whole block had been sold to Kooperativa F√∂rbundet who planned to construct a Domus department store. However, there was an error among the calculations and it turned out that the block was too small for both the department store and its parking lot. Therefore the block was repurchased by Ljungby Municipality and the department store was instead built on block Violen. = The rescue = While it had some tenants, Tellushuset was mostly dilapidated with falling plaster and an old neglected interior, it even carried the vernacular name \\"the Brick Barn\\" [\\"Tegelladan\\"]. Ljungby Municipality was of the opinion that the whole block had to be demolished and give room to new, more modern, buildings. Tellushuset's rescue came 1978 in the form of Louise Andersson who shared her idea about buying Tellushuset with her husband Rune \\"Truck-Rune\\" Andersson, who recently sold his share of Ljungbytruck to Kalmar Verkstad, and would later found Ljungby Maskin. Rune Andersson hesitated at first when he heard his wife Louise's suggestion, but soon realized that she was right. However, during the meeting with municipal commissioner Nils-Ivar P√•hlsson the negotiations came to a complete halt as the demolition plans were too far advanced for any changes to be done. In a last effort Rune Andersson offered one million SEK for the whole block, including the renovations. This made the municipal commissioner hesitate for a moment before he, according to Rune Andersson, lit up and said \\"This we can earn votes on\\". This decision nevertheless encountered protests with slogans such as \\"Tellus to the people - not the capital\\" with an appeal as a result, but the purchase finally went through in 1979. The couple has thenceforward spent many times over renovating the block. = \\"Sm√•land's most beautiful building\\" = Since spring 2017 Tellushuset is featured on the national television channel TV3's idents that is shown in conjunction with commercial breaks. During 2019 the nonprofit association Arkitekturupproret with 37 000 members begun a vote to elect \\"Sweden's most beautiful building\\", excluding churches and castles, with a preparatory vote in each province. The basis of the vote was to \\"show that there are alternatives to the modernism's square boxes and spectacularly boastful constructions\\". In the Sm√•land vote, with a total of 1 746 votes, the Tellushuset won with 276 votes, before Kalmar Stadshotell on second place with about half the number. In the national vote with a total of 18 127 votes the Tellushuset landed in twelfth position with 313 votes, between Sollefte√• court house and Visby's old pharmacy. In first place came Lund's University Library with 1 249 votes.  Ernfrid  Ernfrid is an industrial-historic gray iron statue made by Carl Meijer (1908-2004) that stands in the south-eastern corner along Kungsgatan and Rune B. Johanssons gata portraying a worker holding a handheld concrete vibrator. It was cast January 13, 1970, together with three or four copies of the last melt from Vibro-Verket's foundry facility before it was put out of commission. The other copies were sent to the head office in Stockholm and the factories in Karlstad, Sweden and S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The prototype in bronze was given to Vibro-Verket's director Stig Giertz Hedstr√∂m when he left. The sculptor Carl Meijer was a model carpenter and made casting models at Vibro-Verket. When the foundry department were to be closed, it was decided to make a statue of the company's first and most popular product, the handheld concrete vibrator, to which they owed much of their success. The concrete vibrator was introduced in 1934 and was used to spread the concrete evenly around the reinforcing bars. As model stood maintenance foreman Ernfrid Johansson. Carl Meijer did first make a model out of wood, then plaster, before casting it in massive grey iron and then placing it outside Vibro- Verket. There it stood until Dynapac took over and moved it to the new facilities some hundred meters away. When Dynapac Ljungby was defunct in 2011, the association \\"Vibro-Verken Ljungby Historiska S√§llskap\\" [\\"Vibro-Verken Ljungby Historical Society\\"] took over much of the company's material, such as the archives and the statue. In 2013 they donated the statue to Ljungby municipality which promised to place it at a suitable spot by the central plaza Stora Torg. One of the spots that were discussed was in the corner of F√∂rningsgatan and Smedjegatan, another spot was by the Tellushuset. The statue did however remain stored. During 2018, anticipating the upcoming election, the local newspaper Sm√•l√§nningen had an article series called \\"#kandulova\\" [\\"#canyoupromise\\"] where local citizens aimed questions to local politicians. One of these questions was \\"Can you promise that the statue \\"Ernfrid\\" that Vibro-Verkens LHS donated to Ljungby Municipality 2013 during the next term of office will be placed according to agreement?\\". A couple of days later Ljungby Municipality's culture strategist answered that the next term will probably not even begin before the statue is in place. In November 2018 the statue was inaugurated, after extensive and several months long repurposing and renovation work of the former railroad embankment and the street Rune B. Johanssons gata. The statue had also been cleaned and had a back injury repaired.

Lannes (born 21 September 1947 in Pauligne) is a French mathematician, specializing in algebraic topology and homotopy theory. Lannes completed his secondary studies at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris and graduated in 1966 from the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. He received his doctorate in 1975 from the University of Paris-Saclay (Paris 12). Afterwards he was a professor there and at the Paris Diderot University (Paris 7). In 2009 he became a professor at the √âcole polytechnique and Directeur des recherches at the Centre de math√©matiques Laurent-Schwartz (CMLS); he is now professor emeritus. He was a visiting scholar at several academic institutions, including the Institute for Advanced Study (1979/80) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Lannes is known for his research on the homotopy theory of classifying spaces of groups. He proved in the mid-1980s the generalized Sullivan conjecture (which was also proven independently by Gunnar Carlsson and Haynes Miller). The mod p cohomology of the classifying spaces of certain finite groups (elementary Abelian p-groups, for which the generalized Sullivan conjecture was formulated) played an important role in the proof. The connection between the cohomology theory of these finite groups and the classifying spaces of groups is illuminated by the work of Lannes. He introduced the T-functor on the category of unstable algebra over the Steenrod algebra. Lannes thus led an important development of algebraic topology in the 1980s. He has collaborated extensively with Lionel Schwartz, Hans-Werner Henn, and Sa√Æd Zarati. Lannes has also done research on the knot invariants of Vassiliev. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Zurich in 1994. His doctoral candidates include Fabien Morel. In 2007 there was a conference in Djerba in honor of Lannes's 60th birthday.

The head of the practice (Luis Avalos) offers him the job, and Ross accepts. Back at the ER, a 10-year-old victim of a hit-and-run, Molly Phillips (J. Madison Wright) is brought in with severe injuries. She is examined by Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle) and his interns John Carter (Noah Wyle) and Harper Tracy (Christine Elise). They stabilize her, and then newly-appointed physician assistant Jeanie Boulet (Gloria Reuben) impresses ER chief David Morgenstern (William H. Macy) by identifying Molly's injuries from her X-rays, much to the chagrin of Benton. Ross returns to the ER for his final shift, greeted by Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) and Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies), but he seems strangely annoyed considering his successful interview. Harper and Carter extubate Molly and reassure her that they are taking care of her. Jerry (Abraham Benrubi) struggles with a new computer and thinks he may have accidentally deleted all the radiology data. Linda Farrell (Andrea Parker) arrives, reminding Ross that he is meant to accompany her to an opera performance that evening. She also manages to fix the computer, which Carol then uses to play Doom II. Benton orders Jeanie to write a summary of all the discharge notes for a patient that has been admitted many times over the past few years. Molly's parents (Peter Gregory and Chase Masterson) arrive, and it is revealed that they are separated. Mr. Phillips blames Mrs. Phillips for Molly's injuries. Harper asks them for a photograph of their daughter to help the plastic surgeon repair her cheek laceration. As Ross drives in heavy rain to pick up Linda, he gets a puncture. A young boy, Joey Larkin (Zachary Charles), runs up to his car, screaming that his brother needs help. Ross gets out of the car and hurriedly follows him. Joey leads Ross on the storm drain where his brother Ben (Erik von Detten) was trapped in it with his leg pinned by the grate of it.

Most of his writing centers around the time he spent in Alaska in an abandoned World War II facility with his partner, Mike Rasmussen.  Life  Jerah Chadwick was born in 1956 in Tacoma, Washington. Although born in Tacoma, he grew up in Tucson, Arizona due to the constant movement of his Air Force family. After finishing high school there, he attended Lake Forest College, 30 miles north of Chicago. There he earned a double major in English and Sociology and Anthropology. He then moved to the Pacific Northwest to work for Seattle Newspapers. In 1982, he moved to Unalaska to be with his partner, a painter and sculptor named Mike Rasmussen. They lived for two years in an abandoned World War II Quonset hut which was four miles away from Morris Cove. There, Chadwick wrote poetry inspired by his surroundings and raised goats while Rasmussen did woodworking and carpentry. In 1986, Chadwick spent his winters at the University of Alaska Fairbanks working towards a Masters of Fine Arts in Creative Writing. He completed his MFA in 1988. While in Fairbanks, Chadwick lived in the dry, wood heated cabin of his friend, Joe Enzweiler, while Enzweiler was in the Lower 48. Chadwick stayed at the university and took a job directing its Aleutian and Pribilof Center in Dutch Harbor. He was remembered as an astute and creative administrator as he managed to expand the university's off-campus offerings in the rural area he served. He was also one of the founding directors of USAFV (Unalaskans against Sexual Assault and Family Violence). In addition to his university work, he helped establish Museum of the Aleutians and assisted in a culture camp named 'Camp Qungaayux'. It was an organization that dedicated itself to preserving the Unangax cultural heritage. One of the classes he was most proud of sponsoring there was the one that taught lost Unangan bentwood hat construction techniques. He assisted elder Andrew Gronholdt, helping students make the famous long-billed hats. It was during this time that he was awarded the position of Alaska'a Poet Laureate from 2004-2006. Upon retiring from the university in 2008, they appointed him Professor Emeritus. To celebrate this achievement, Rasmussen built Chadwick a new house. Chadwick had numerous publications throughout his life in journals. Perhaps his most famous publication may have been the release of his poems in a book form. His major collection of poems, \\"Story Hunger\\", was published by Salmon Press in Ireland and was successful enough that it went for a second printing in 2005. Right before he fell sick with Alzheimer's, Chadwick was working on another collection of poems. He spent the last couple of months reconnecting with fellow Lake Forest Classmates. He faced a relatively short battle with Alzheimer's dying in the care of his sister, Barbara Nardone, on June 7, 2016.

A controversial figure throughout his life, he notably commissioned explorer Samuel Hearne's three expeditions in 1769‚Äì1772, which led to the first European discovery of the Coppermine River and the northern coast of Canada.  Early life  Moses Norton was born at Prince of Wales Fort around 1735, the son of Richard Norton and Sunannah Dupeer.  Career  After being indentured to HBC ship captain George Spurrell in 1744, he first served aboard an HBC sloop for several years before becoming an assistant to Ferdinand Jacobs, the then-chief factor of Fort Prince of Wales, in present-day Churchill, Manitoba. He later served as a mate on the Company's vessel Churchill. In 1762, Norton was appointed to the position of chief factor of Fort Prince of Wales. In 1969, he commissioned English explorer Samuel Hearne to embark on a lengthy expedition to discover the Coppermine River, after being informed of the river's existence by the Chipewyan Indians. Over the course of Hearne's protracted journey, during which he had to restart twice, a large portion of country was discovered and mapped for the first time by Europeans, but the river itself was of questionable importance. The failure of Hearne's first two attempts can largely be attributed to Norton's poor planning and unwise choices for Native guides.  Death  Norton died on 29 December 1773 from a bowel disorder, aged 37 or 38. He was survived by one known daughter, Mary, who herself died in 1782.

Later, the damaskins became church collections with teaching words and lives. They appeared at the end of the 16th century in the western Bulgarian lands and existed until the middle of the 19th century. For the most part, the damaskins were written in a simple, accessible language for ordinary people. Typically, damask is a type of decoration on a metal or leather handicraft whose etymology originates in the city of Damascus. The name \\"damaskin\\" comes from the name of the first author of such a book - the Greek writer of the 16th century Damaskinos Stouditis, whose work \\"Thesauros\\" (ŒòŒ∑œÉŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ; 1558) contains 36 lives and teachings (printed in Venice). It was first translated into Bulgarian by Bishop Gregory Prilepski in the Holy Trinity skete at the Great Lavra Monastery in Athos. The first damaskins included only translations of Damaskinos Stouditis' works, and later, after the middle of the 17th century, they were combined with translations of works by other authors. In the 18th century, part of the damaskins were out of church practice and often turned into readable collections. The damaskins are written in an accessible, spoken vernacular and have a fascinating way of exhibiting. They contain works of different genre and with different themes - of modern Greek authors, ancient Bulgarian ones, different lives, teachings, apocrypha, historical works, religious stories, stories, aphorisms and others. The damaskins marks the transition from Middle Bulgarian to New Bulgarian, which was standardized in the 19th century. The transition to analytical Bulgarian is also noted. Until the 16th century, the Middle Bulgarian was one of the four literary languages of the Ottoman Sultan's office. After that, from the 17th century it developed on a popular basis, and from the 18th century it gained Russian influence over the Bulgarian language through literature after the reforms of Peter the Great.

Her research interests include innate immunity with a primary focus on the role of NLR proteins and inflammasomes in health and disease.  Early life and education  Kanneganti was born and raised in Telangana (United Andhra Pradesh), India. She received her undergraduate degree at Kakatiya University in Warangal, where she majored in chemistry, zoology, and botany. She then received her M.Sc. and PhD from Osmania University in India.  Career  Kanneganti began her career in research as a PhD student studying plant pathogens and fungal toxins. She then went on to do postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Wisconsin and the Ohio State University studying fungal genetics and plant innate immunity. She then transitioned to study mammalian innate immunity at the University of Michigan. She joined St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as an Assistant Member in the Immunology Department in 2007, where she has focused on studying inflammasomes and cell death. She was promoted to a full Member in 2013. She became Vice Chair of the Immunology Department in 2016 and was endowed with the Rose Marie Thomas Endowed Chair in 2017.  Major contributions  = NLRP3 inflammasome and PANoptosis = Kanneganti has made fundamental contributions to inflammasome biology. Her studies along with those from other groups published in 2006 provided the first genetic evidence for the role of NLRP3 in the formation of the inflammasome, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1Œ≤/IL-18 maturation. These initial studies showed that microbial components, ATP, and MSU crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Kanneganti discovered that Influenza A virus, Candida, and Aspergillus specifically activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and elucidated the physiological role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in host defense. In addition to these studies on the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in infectious diseases, her lab also established the importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in intestinal inflammation, neuroinflammation, cancer, and obesity. Kanneganti's lab has also been working on the upstream regulatory mechanisms of NLRP3 and identified caspase-8 and FADD as expression and activation regulators of both the canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome/pyroptosis. This study demonstrated that the NLRP3 inflammasome/pyroptotic pathway is closely connected to the caspase-8‚Äìmediated programmed cell death pathway. This finding went against the dogma that existed at that time that caspase-8 and FADD were involved only in the apoptotic pathway. Following up on her original discovery that NLRP3 senses viral RNAs, her lab has discovered Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1)/DAI as an innate sensor of influenza virus upstream of the NLRP3 inflammasome/pyroptosis and also showed ZBP1 is a key regulator of apoptosis and necroptosis, establishing it as a master regulator of these cell death pathways. Her lab also established that transforming growth factor beta- activated kinase 1 (TAK1) can act as a master regulator that maintains cellular homeostasis by negatively regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Overall, these studies identified caspase-8, ZBP1, and TAK1 as master molecular switches of inflammasome activation/pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis and pioneered the establishment of the fundamental concept of PANoptosis (Pyroptosis; Apoptosis; Necroptosis; 'optosis', a form of programmed cell death). PANoptosis is defined as a unique inflammatory programmed cell death regulated by the PANoptosome, a complex that provides a molecular scaffold for key molecules from the inflammasome/pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis to interact. Kanneganti's research group recently further elucidated the molecular mechanism of PANoptosis and showed that the enigmatic caspase-6 is critical for ZBP1-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, PANoptosis, innate immune responses, and host defense against IAV. Her lab also showed that coronavirus activates PANoptosis and that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome or gasdermin D during coronavirus infection actually increases cell death and cytokine secretion rather than decreasing them. Overall, work from Kannegant's lab has implicated PANoptosis in infectious, metabolic, neurologic, and autoinflammatory diseases and cancer. = NLRP3 inflammasome and stress granules = Kanneganti's lab has investigated the crosstalk between cell survival, mediated by stress granules, and cell death pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammatory cell death, and identified DDX3X, a key stress granule component, as a driver of NLRP3 inflammasome and stress granule assembly. This study identified a mechanism for regulating cell fate decisions in stressed cells where NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis depends on the availability of DDX3X molecules that are also required for pro-survival stress granule assembly. DDX3X sits at the crossroads of inflammation and stress adaptation, essentially acting as a live or die checkpoint in the stressed cells, because of its importance in both NLRP3 inflammasome activation and stress granule assembly. Mutations in DDX3X, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and stress granules are associated with pathologies in infectious and autoinflammatory diseases, cancer, and neuronal abnormalities. Identification of DDX3X as a molecular link between stress granules and inflammasomes in this study laid the groundwork to help discover key mechanisms governing pathophysiology in these various human diseases. = Other inflammasomes and NLRs = In addition to the original discoveries published in 2006 on the NLRP3 inflammasome, Kanneganti's work has also contributed to the identification of bacterial flagellin as a ligand that activates the NLRC4 inflammasome. Her lab also identified interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) as a specific upstream regulator of NLRC4 and discovered the role of the IRF1-GBP-IRGB10 pathway in liberating intracellular bacterial ligands that are eventually sensed by the AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. These studies linked IRFs to the NLRC4, NLRP3, and AIM2 inflammasomes. Furthermore, her lab also identified a critical role for AIM2 in stem cell proliferation and cancer. In addition, her work has delineated an important role for NLRC3 in safe-guarding the intestine from overt proliferation and cancer via mTOR regulation. Dr. Kanneganti's lab has also discovered an essential role for the pyrin (MEFV) inflammasome in the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity to prevent colitis and colitis-associated cancer. Her studies also showed the physiological significance of caspase-1 and IL-1Œ≤ downstream of pyrin inflammasome activation in mediating familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and also identified the role of the TNF/TNFR axis in promoting pyrin inflammasome activation. = Cytokine signaling = Kanneganti's lab showed compensatory roles for NLRP3/caspase-1 and caspase-8 in the regulation of IL-1Œ≤ production in osteomyelitis. Additionally, discoveries from her research group suggest that IL-1Œ± and IL-1Œ≤ can have distinct roles in driving inflammatory disease. She identified the role of the IL-1Œ± and RIPK1/TAK1/SYK signaling pathway in skin inflammation. Furthermore, her studies also showed the role of another IL-1 family member, IL-33, in regulating immune responses and microbiota in the gut. Overall, Kanneganti's lab discovered distinct and previously unrecognized functions of cytokines IL-1Œ±, IL-1b, and IL-33 and their signaling pathways in inflammatory diseases and cancer.

It mandated that only those with similar, Puritan, community values could live in the town and set about a method for mediating disputes. It also required each resident to pay their fair share of taxes for the common good. Eventually 125 men would sign the covenant. Background In 1635 there were rumors in the Massachusetts Bay Colony that a war with the local Indians was impending and a fear arose that the few, small, coastal communities that existed were in danger of attack. This, in addition to the belief that the few towns that did exist were too close together, prompted the Massachusetts General Court to establish two new inland communities, Dedham and Concord. As Puritans, the first settlers came to Massachusetts in order to live and worship as they pleased. While they were subject to the General Court, they had wide latitude to establish a local government as they saw fit. The first public meeting of the plantation was held on August 18, 1636. A total of 18 men were present, and the town covenant was signed. The covenant outlined both the social ideal they hoped to achieve and the policies and procedures they would use to reach it. Eventually 125 men would ascribe their names to the document. In 1636, there were 30 signers. In 1637, there were 46. By 1656, 79 men put their names on the document. The Covenant was intended to extend beyond the lifetimes of those who wrote it and to be binding upon all residents in perpetuity. The Covenant was no longer enforced nor served as the guide for every decision by the time the town reached its 50th anniversary. It lasted well into the second generation which was, according to one commentator, \\"longer than anyone had a right to expect\\". Commitment to shared ideals The covenant stipulated that only those \\"may be probably of one heart with us,\\" in essence those who held the same Puritan Christian beliefs, could be admitted to the community. They swore they would \\"in the fear and reverence of our Almighty God, mutually and severally promise amongst ourselves and each to profess and practice one truth according to that most perfect rule, the foundation whereof is ever lasting love.\\" While it was drafted by the first settlers of the town, new members would be admitted on an equal footing if they held the same community values. None who were not committed to this ideal, nor those considered morally unfit, were to be admitted as townsmen. If the need arose, they were to be expelled. The commitment in the Covenant to allow only like-minded individuals to live within the town explains why \\"church records show no instances of dissension, Quaker or Baptist expulsions, or witchcraft persecutions.\\" The requirement to only allow those who were of a similar mind made it easier to lived a shared ideal. The goal was to create a godly community, thus ensuring that God's favor would be upon them. It was not to be a theocracy, however, as colonial law prohibited clergy from serving as civil officers. The church and the civil society were largely separate institutions. Mediation The Covenant mandated mediation when disputes arose between residents. While great effort was taken to ensure disagreements were resolved before they grew into disputes, the covenant also stipulated that differences would be submitted to between one and four other members of the town for resolution. They \\"eschew[ed] all appeals to law and submit[ted] all disputes between them to arbitration.\\" This arbitration system was so successful there was no need for courts. The same system was used to resolve disputes with other towns. As a result, residents were sometimes expected to endure unpleasant situations for the greater good in a self-sacrificial way. Once a decision was made, all were to abide by it with no further dissent or debate. For the first fifty years of Dedham's existence, there were no prolonged disputes that were common in other communities. Signers The Covenant was first signed on August 15, 1636. Five signers of the covenant, John Allen, Thomas Carter, Timothy Dalton, Samuel Morse, and Ralph Wheelock, were university graduates. The 125 signatories of the Covenant, in the order in which they signed, are: Text > I The Society Covenant in these terms, viz. 1\\\\. We whose names are hereunto > subscribed, do in the fear and reverence of our almighty God, mutually and > severally promise amongst ourselves and each to other, to profess and > practice one faith, according to that most perfect rule, the foundation > whereof is everlasting love. 2\\\\.

One hypothesis holds him to be Claudio Tolomei, but this is not widely accepted. Francesco Valcanover, L'opera completa di Tiziano, Rizzoli, Milano 1969. The work is recorded in Leopoldo de' Medici's collections, which on his death entered the grand-ducal collections, which later passed to the Uffizi and other museums in Florence. In the earliest inventories, until 1769, it was attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, then to Sebastiano del Piombo (1797) and from 1880 to 1890 to the circle of Lorenzo Lotto. The art historians Adolfo Venturi and Bernard Berenson argued against the attribution to Piombo and others started to point to Titian as a possible attribution, though it took until a 1975 restoration for this to be confirmed.

She was initially conceived by Chris L'Etoile for Obsidian before duties were taken over by Kate Dollarhyde. She is voiced by Ashly Burch, who was chosen for the role after she auditioned and was picked by Dollarhyde for how well she evoked the character. She was originally designed to be asexual by L'Etoile, while Dollarhyde expanded upon this with her own experiences as an asexual person. Concept and creation Parvati Holcomb is an engineer and one of the Companions that can join players on their quest. She is described as \\"a very sweet, naive person\\" by senior narrative designer Megan Starks. She also notes Parvati's personality contrasts with fellow Companion Ellie; where Parvati wants to help people, Ellie is more about herself. She was conceived by writer Chris L'Etoile for the 2019 role-playing game The Outer Worlds, created by Obsidian Entertainment, who later left development of the game. He drew inspiration from the character Kaylee Frye from the television series Firefly, and was also the favorite character for Obsidian staff due to her being \\"so likeable\\" and having a \\"very strong moral center.\\" He aimed for her to be an \\"empathetic moral center\\" for the main cast, and wrote her to be \\"a little more naive, but very sweet\\" and caring. When L'Etoile left, the duties for designing her were given to narrative designer Kate Dollarhyde, who was given an unusual amount of detail in a \\"very long concept\\" document, including dialogue for her. It was also unusual to have multiple writers be in charge of a Companion as what happened here. alt=A 2013 photograph of Ashly Burch Parvati is asexual (also called \\"ace\\"), a detail given to her by L'Etoile. Dollarhyde, who is also ace, gave Parvati a more \\"personal voice.\\" Dollarhyde described feeling \\"lucky\\" that she was able to \\"inherit\\" the writing duties for this character due to this. One of her lines, where Parvati talks about how others treat her as a robot, mirrors Dollarhyde's own experiences. Both Parvati and Dollarhyde are bi, and she similarly puts herself into the writing by making Parvati similarly apprehensive about speaking to the person she likes. When writing the romantic elements of Parvati's story, Dollarhyde approached this with the perspective of a friend giving advice and \\"facilitating good experiences\\" to those they care about. The details of Dollarhyde's sexuality became more widely known as a result of interviews due to Parvati (and by extension Dollarhyde's) popularity, which she outed herself during. When Parvati reveals her asexuality to the player, Dollarhyde intentionally prevented players from having the option to behave bigoted towards Parvati. Dollarhyde explains that this is because she did not want players who related to Parvati to have the \\"rug [pulled] out from under them.\\" Parvati was chosen to be introduced to the player early on due to her being a \\"unique case of a character.\\" Dollarhyde cited how the other Companion characters were more \\"worldly\\" than her, and thus Parvati is able to act as the \\"voice of surprise and delight and horror\\" for the player as they both see what the world is like, neither being very familiar with it. Other people involved in the creation of Parvati include concept artist Hannah Kennedy who helped design her model, and quality assurance tester Ariana Tavantzis who provided \\"a lot of\\" feedback. Parvati is voiced by Ashly Burch, who was given the role years after the character was first conceived due to how Obsidian handles the process. As such, Dollarhyde had to work with either no spoken dialogue or dialogue spoken by a robot while writing, which she found to be an obstacle due to not being able to properly hear her writing out loud by a person. When casting began, Dollarhyde was involved in the process. She was shown an audition for Parvati by Burch, and felt she did the role the way Dollarhyde imagined Parvati sounded. When discussing what she saw in Parvati, Burch explained that it was her ability to find \\"beauty and wonder in a bleak world\\" that stood out to her. Appearances Parvati appeared in the 2019 video game The Outer Worlds, aiding the player-character in their quest. She is first encountered being berated by the Mayor of the town of Edgewater, Reed Tobson. The player-character comes to him seeking a power generator for their new ship. In their quest to obtain one, players may take Parvati along to help, and may then choose whether to bring them on their spaceship after the quest is completed. Throughout this, Parvati acts as a moral compass for the player-character and helps with engineering tasks among other things. When they board the ship the Groundbreaker, Parvati wishes to meet with the leader of the ship and fellow engineer Junlei Tennyson, expressing admiration for her technical skills. When they meet, Junlei takes a liking to her and appears flirtatious, something which appears to be mutual for Parvati. Over time, Parvati begins to confide to the player-character their feelings for Junlei, as well as their anxieties relating to intimacy. She eventually reveals herself to be asexual, and clarifies that she is afraid to confess her feelings to Junlei due to past negative reactions to her lack of a desire for physical intimacy. The player-character helps motivate her in a discussion they have over drinks, and she eventually tells Junlei how she feels, which Junlei reciprocates. Parvati wishes to take Junlei on a date in her ship, and asks the player-character to help her find foods that Junlei talked about enjoying when she was young, as well as helping her get cleaned up and dressed up nicely. Once these steps are all complete, Parvati goes on her date, and the two become partners. Reception Parvati has received generally positive reception and has become a fan favorite. Jonathan Logan of RPGFan called her one of the \\"most adorable characters\\" he has seen, citing her \\"wide-eyed wonder\\" as part of his enjoyment of her. Alan Torres of Digital Trends felt she made a \\"strong impression,\\" while Matt Sainsbury of Digitally Downloaded said he \\"loved\\" her. Charlie Hall of Polygon called her the \\"biggest thing since Ikumi Nakamura,\\" who was regarded as the \\"most genuine person of E3 2019.\\" She was later ranked among the best video game characters of the 2010s by Polygon staff, with Hall praising her \\"painfully genuine\\" personality, her quest line, and Ashly Burch's performance. Hirun Cryer of USgamer called her the best character in The Outer Worlds, saying that the designation was obvious. He called her \\"easily likeable\\" and her willingness to challenge the choices of the player. He further noted her as the most \\"well-balanced\\" character in the cast and that she is what got him \\"hooked\\" on the game. Fellow USgamer writer Mike Williams felt she started out as \\"vanilla,\\" she began to be more fleshed out as the game went along. He also noted that her shyness made him behave nicer in the game. Dollarhyde also received an outpouring of support for her work on Parvati. Alex Avard of GamesRadar called her \\"adorably naive\\" while praising the relationship between her and the player-character as \\"believable.\\" Also writing for GamesRadar, Heather Wald expressed disappointment that she could not romance Parvati, citing Parvati's her \\"caring personality\\" and awkwardness as the qualities that attracted her to her. She eventually grew to appreciate her status as a \\"friend and supporter\\" of Parvati in her own romantic pursuits. Jess Lee of Digital Spy praised her as the best Companion character in the game, citing her \\"wholesome\\" arc. Parvati's sexuality has led to her being well-received, both by players and critics. Peter Morics of Screen Rant called her a \\"champion for marginalized players\\" as well as the \\"clear favorite\\" of the cast, the former due to her asexuality and bisexuality. He noted that this is a rare combination to see represented. He added that the way it's presented is also nice, due to not feeling strange or like a \\"big twist.\\" He also praised her for her \\"shyness and optimistic enthusiasm,\\" which he found \\"endearing.\\" Patrick Klepek for Vice regarded her as the standout character in The Outer Worlds and one of the best of 2019, noting that she has received a fan following in part because of her status as an asexual and bisexual person. He praised her writer and voice actor for helping make her feel \\"real.\\" Gita Jackson of Kotaku described her story as an \\"examination\\" of both the difficulties for certain people to fit into society as well as a \\"touching queer love story.\\" References Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional asexuals Category:LGBT characters in video games Category:Video game characters introduced in 2019 Category:Fictional bisexual females ","title":"Parvati Holcomb"},{"id":"62370402","text":"The 1970‚Äì71 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship was the inaugural staging of the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship since its establishment by the Gaelic Athletic Association.

He is known to be critical opponent of Nursultan Nazarbayev and attempted to be a candidate in 1991 and 2015 Kazakh presidential election. Early life, education Qojahmetov was born in a railway station in the village of Matay in the Aksu District and was one of the ten children. His father, Karmijan Qojahmetov, was a railroad engineer, machinist and a disabled World War II veteran who was from Semey and happened to leave the town before the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear bomb on 29 August 1949 there. His mother was half Polish and Ukrainian who was transferred to Zhetysu in 1910. In 1969, Qojahmetov was conscripted to the army while he was studying at the Tchaikovsky Musical College in the city of Alma-Ata. There, he faced terrible conditions at the training center which mostly had Russians, and constant physical and emotional abuse by his peers. Qojahmetov was accused of starting a nationalist sentiment and was punished by being isolated from others in a locked place for 2 years. As a result, he ended up escaping the facility in February 1970 by walking next to a railroad track and sneaking in to different train wagons where he eventually made it to Alma-Ata. There, he complained about the discrimination in the Soviet Army, dealt with a court suit where he found lack of support and was sent to a psychiatric hospital. After that, he returned to his musical college where he graduated in 1972. From 1998, Qojahmetov is the director of the Kazakh Museum of Folk Musical Instruments in Almaty. Political activities At the age of 20, Qojahmetov became a nationalist and believed that Kazakhstan is better off as an independent country. Throughout the 1970s, he lived and worked in Esik, wrote poems and articles criticizing the Soviet Union. In the autumn of 1975 and in April 1977, Qojahmetov produced anti- government leaflets. He came to Alma-Ata to distribute 670 articles and leaflets to expose the discriminatory policies of the Soviet Union and the CPSU to the students of the Veterinary Institute. As a result, he was imprisoned for two years in prison. After being released from prison in 1979, Qojahmetov composed music and worked as a director and a teacher at various musical colleges where he gained prominence. He participated in the Jeltoqsan riot that took place in December 1986. Qojahmetov was convicted and sent to prison where he was forced to do physical labor. However, he was later released on 7 March 1989. After the event, Qojahmetov worked as a TV music editor. In 1991, he became the leader of the Jeltoqsan National Democratic Party. From September 1991, Qojahmetov organized protests in Alma-Ata to release protesters who were involved in Jeltoqsan, allow direct presidential elections, and for Kazakhstan to declare its independence from the Soviet Union by 16 December, the 5th anniversary of Jeltoqsan riot. After the Supreme Council of the Kazakh SSR announced elections on 16 October 1991, Qojahmetov sought to be a candidate. However, the deadline for collecting signatures was shortened and Qojahmetov claimed that his signature collection was confiscated by the police. In early 1992, Qojahmetov led protests across Kazakhstan.https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/18/world/thousands-rally-in- kazakhstan-to-urge-communists-to-quit-posts.html In 1994, he became the leader of the Azat Civil Movement of Kazakhstan. In 1995, Nazarbayev proposed extending his term and changing the constitution. Qojahmetov led a hunger strike near the parliament building however by then, he had little support.
