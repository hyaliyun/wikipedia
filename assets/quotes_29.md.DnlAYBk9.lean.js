Alleys in Washington suffered from a variety of problems, most prominently overpopulation and poverty that increased rapidly over the 1800s, particularly in Foggy Bottom. In 1822, the neighborhood had an estimated forty households with a majority of skilled workers; however, by 1860 there were around 175 households. This drastic change yielded the percentage of skilled workers and unskilled workers to fluctuate. This suggests that there was a boom in the economy and a drastic change in the need for factory hands. This change was beneficial because it created greater numbers to flock into these new areas of Foggy Bottom, then forcing groups like the Alley Dwelling Authorities to step in and reconstruct old dilapidated homes.  Actions of the ADA  The ADA was given the task of evaluating homes and streets to see if they met proper living conditions. Specific documentation would state the reasons why the area needed to be renovated. This documentation would then be sent from the authority to legislation for approval. Individuals in legislation included (but not exclusively) Eleanor Roosevelt. Common reasons as to why an area needed to be renovated were: excess of individuals in one home, too many African Americans in and around the area, or a fading exterior. After the ADA gained approval from legislation, it would then give the occupants of the houses anywhere from two to four months to find a new home. By July 1, 1944, all of the houses in Foggy Bottom had been evacuated and plans were set forward for renovation. This act sought to produce larger living spaces for individuals with better conditions, so that the owners could charge more for rent. Higher rent prices were acceptable at the time because of a boom in available jobs, which created a more competitive supply and demand market for housing. Monthly rent usually ranged anywhere from seventeen dollars to thirty-seven dollars. These prices fluctuated often because of the available jobs and the condition of the houses. Older houses were typically cheaper than new homes, some of which had running water, gas heaters and cooling systems. Statistics suggest that, on average, the greater wealth arose from the majority of white residents, but also that black wealth was steadily increasing due to new job patterns.Borchert, James. Alley Life in Washington: Family, Community, Religion, and Folklife in the City, 1850-1970. Urbana: University of Illinois, 1980. Print.  Results of Actions  In the process of attempting to improve upon DC living standards, the ADA demolished entire alleys. By tearing down the houses of alley dwellers, the ADA was able to refurbish the area into better houses. Funding for the new houses were from the United States Housing Authority. The two loans that were made amounted to a total of $6,000,000 and $4,258,000. However, the construction rendered alley dwellers whose houses were being fixed with no place to live. Of the five completed projects, four of them were being occupied by African Americans. The intended purpose for these projects was to lower crime and death rates. Moreover, there was a conflict when the white population did not want the black population to dwell near them. The ADA had several moral and legal conflicts to manage, as it had to undergo multiple legal loopholes to excise the alley dwellers out of their homes.  Black demographic  The black population in DC Alleys was at its zenith during the late nineteenth century, although they could not afford sufficient housing. The black population needed more housing in order to live comfortably, but since they did not have more housing, living conditions were often cramped, particularly in small apartments. At the same time, it was necessary for them to live in DC and be close enough to their jobs. John Ihlder, a supporter of public housing and an executive officer for the ADA, dealt with implementing alley development. One government official whom Ihlder contacted was Dr. William T. Grady, chairman in office. The two exchanged letters in order to deal with St. Mary's court apartment which was specifically built for ‚Äúnegro occupancy,‚Äù. The white population believed that the black population should be completely moved out of the DC district, and that St. Mary's court should be renewed and housed for the white people living in these areas. They began to have regulations on being able to live in these apartments, causing ‚Äúnegroes‚Äù to live in the outskirts of town. The regulations included working in the West End, and preferences toward families instead of single people. Ihlder stated that three-four years before June 25, 1939, African Americans occupied most alley dwellings. five to six thousand African Americans paid low rent housing with the alley dwellings. The whites wanted to and had nuked the blacks ‚Äúnegro occupancy‚Äù. The government stated that this was inaccurate, that the reasoning for the blacks being moved out from these alleys was for them to improve the conditions of their living environment. Their plan was to put indoor plumbing and polish the housing and make more room, and made blacks move into low income home for 3‚Äì4 months. When the blacks came back to purchase their homes they were unable to afford it, due to the new improvements. Not all government officials were trying to push blacks out of these alleys; one of the main advocates for blacks staying in these alleys was Eleanor Roosevelt.  Eleanor Roosevelt's involvement  Eleanor Roosevelt was a strong advocate for the Washington Housing Authority, as she looked to put an end to discrimination. As the president of the committee, Eleanor Roosevelt made it a priority for her to aid the alley dwellers.\\"First Lady Biography: Eleanor Roosevelt.\\" The National First Lady Library. The National First Lady Library, n.d. Web. 26 Apr. 2013. . On June 12, 1934, the District of Columbia Alley Dwelling Act was passed, establishing the Washington Housing Authority as an independent agency. The government attempted to eliminate the alley dwelling lifestyle and tried to improve the situation which was the cause for the New Deal.  ADA and Snow's Court  The ADA had a significant effect upon the development of alleys, particularly in Foggy Bottom. An alley dwelling within Foggy Bottom, Snow's Court, witnessed some of the most prevalent changes in terms of alley development. The ADA effectively mended the initially horrid living conditions and the problems that arose with overpopulation in Snows Court. Because of their actions, Snows Court today is affiliated primarily with the middle and the upper class.  References  Borchert, James.

This is known as the passporting of financial services. Referred to as an International Finance Centre, Gibraltar was among 35 jurisdictions identified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as a tax haven in June 2000. However, the list's disclaimer stated: As a result of having made a commitment in accordance with the OECD's 2001 Progress Report on the OECD's Project on Harmful Tax Practices, Gibraltar is not included in the OECD's list of uncooperative tax havens. It has also never been listed on the FATF Blacklist of uncooperative countries in the fight against money laundering.

However, in its April 2009 progress report, the OECD listed Gibraltar in the list of jurisdictions which, although committed, had not yet \\"substantially implemented\\" the internationally agreed tax standard. Following Gibraltar's signing of 12 additional Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs), as of October 2009, with jurisdictions including the UK, US and Germany, to sum 13, Gibraltar is currently listed in the OECD \\"white list\\", and is considered a jurisdiction that has substantially implemented the tax standard.

(Baek was one of the first Koreans to play professional baseball in Japan, joining the great Isao Harimoto [birth name Jang Hun], who had joined the Flyers beginning in 1959.) In his first year, the Flyers won their first (and only) Japan Series championship, defeating the Hanshin Tigers. Baek played for the franchise for the next 13 years (the team went through a number of sponsors and name changes, becoming the Nittaku Home Flyers and then the Nippon-Ham Fighters), starting out as a catcher but after a few years converting to a slugging, speedy outfielder. After being let go by the Fighters after the 1974 season, Baek played seven more seasons in the NPB, for the Taiheiyo Club Lions, the Lotte Orions, and the Kintetsu Buffaloes. For the Lions, he won the 1975 Pacific League batting title with a .319 average and was declared a 1975 Best Nine Award outfielder. He had one of his best seasons in 1979, at age 35, as he hit .340 with 18 home runs and 71 RBI for the Orions. Over the course of his career in the NPB, Baek hit 209 home runs and stole 212 bases.

In 1989, Baek returned to the KBO as a full-time manager, coming back to the Chungyong, which in 1990 became known as the LG Twins. In his second year, he led the Twins to their first KBO championship, defeating the Samsung Lions in the Korean Series. As a result, Baek was named the 1990 KBO Manager of the Year. Baek managed the Chungyong/Twins for three seasons, leaving after the 1991 season. He managed the Samsung Lions from 1995 to 1997, and served as a coach for the Hanwha Eagles in 1999.

Plot After losing all his money gambling on horses, former newspaper reporter Barry Gilbert and \\"Doc\\" Norton break into a vacant mansion belonging to the Reitters for shelter from the rain. Just as the pair are settling in, Willetts and three other servants arrive. Willetts, the butler, does not know what the long-absent, but expected John Clark Reitter Jr. looks like, so he assumes that Barry is him. Barry decides to impersonate young Reitter, the black sheep son of a wealthy New York newspaper publisher, for a while when he learns the family will be away for weeks. A neighbor, Patricia Hammond, develops an interest in Barry, while a showgirl, Peggy, wife of the real John Reitter Jr. (under the name Jay Rogers), shows up and tells him her husband is being framed for the murder of a political bigshot. Barry agrees to try to clear him in exchange for Peggy not revealing his masquerade. Barry reluctantly accepts a job on Reitter Sr.'s paper under an assumed name, and though editor Bill Harwood warns him not to play detective (a common tendency of new reporters), he does anyway. He gets into trouble with Patricia when he learns that her father, Judge Hammond, was with the victim the day he was killed. He jumps to the conclusion that the judge is the killer, but the real murderer - nightclub owner Luis Romano - is eventually caught (in spite of Barry's efforts), and John is released. When Patricia and her father are introduced to John by his father, who has returned early, they wonder who Barry really is. Meanwhile, Barry does his best to hide what has gone on and to present John in the best light to his family. John's mother learns the truth from John and Peggy, but is pleased to conceal the story from her husband, who is very proud of his reformed son. Harwood lets Barry keep his job and sends him to get the scoop on a rich widow's new husband, who turns out to be Doc Norton. Patricia catches up with him and demands to know what is going on.

Chamberlain, was an American journalist and newspaper editor. Biography Samuel Selwyn Chamberlain was born in Walworth, New York, on September 25, 1851. He was graduated from New York University in 1875. He started his journalistic career at the Newark Advertiser (1873‚Äì1874). Within a short time he joined the staff of the New York World. He then moved to the New York Herald (1875‚Äì1879) as an assistant editor. He went abroad with James Gordon Bennett Jr. of the Herald, and was for a time editor of the Paris edition of that journal. In 1879 Chamberlain became editor of the New York World, but left to take charge of the New York Evening Telegram in 1881. He founded Le Matin of Paris in 1884 and edited it for two years before returning to the United States. In 1889 William Randolph Hearst engaged Chamberlain as editor of the San Francisco Examiner, and he remained on the Pacific coast until 1895, when he came back to New York City as editor of the New York Morning Journal. In 1900 he became managing editor of the Philadelphia North American, which soon resumed its former place among the successful publications of that city. In a year or two Chamberlain returned to the Hearst service, and until his death acted as general staff officer. He went to the Chicago Examiner, was recalled to the New York American (1905‚Äì1907) followed by a year as editor of the Cosmopolitan (1907‚Äì1908). In 1909 he was appointed editor of the San Francisco Examiner for the second time. For several years, until the spring of 1915, he was the Hearst representative in London. His last work was editor of the Boston American. He died in San Francisco on January 25, 1916. Character assessment Chamberlain was recognized as an exceptionally able newspaper man; his forte was a news touch of charming delicacy; he had unerring news perception and understood and carried out feature ideas that were distinct. Family On September 15, 1873, Chamberlain married Mary T. Munson. At the time of his death Chamberlain was married and had one son.

It caters for the education of boys and girls from Transition (Standard 0) to A-Levels in a multi-cultural, interdenominational environment. The school is Francistown's first English-medium education institution for primary and secondary education. A Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) accredited institution, it is highly regarded as the school of choice in Northern Botswana and the country at large, and as a gateway to the best local and international institutions of higher education. It is named in honour of Scottish missionary John Mackenzie (1835‚Äì99), who spent his working life among, and who argued for the rights of, the Tswana people.  History  A photograph of the original school premises in the church hall of what is now St. Patrick's Anglican Church, Francistown. The school was founded as the Francistown European School in 1899 by Reverend Nelson Fogarty (1871‚Äì1933) of the Railway Mission out of his anxiety to start schools in Plumtree, Francistown and Palapye. He envisaged about twelve children at each station, and considered it \\"terrible to think that there are about 120 children on the railway line growing up without any education whatsoever\\". His wish for a teacher was realised with the arrival of Mr. Edgar Lloyd from the United Kingdom in 1899. Mr. Lloyd started his school in the church hall, later to become St. Patrick's Anglican Church, on August 16, 1899, with two children. By September 28, the number had increased to twelve. The school changed its name from Francistown European School to that of John Mackenzie School in 1958 in honour of the first Deputy Commissioner of Bechuanaland, an area north of the then Cape Province and south of the Molopo River. He was a missionary with the London Missionary Society and was largely responsible for Bechuanaland becoming a Protectorate. John Mackenzie School opened its new Secondary section on 18 January 1994. This section of the school aims to service the north east of Botswana, providing much needed top quality secondary education. John Mackenzie is now able to offer education for its pupils from Pre-Primary right up to ‚ÄúA‚Äù Levels.

In 2011, it had some 4,000 inhabitants in about 500 households. The village is located between two streams which lead down from a southern tributary of the Tochi River. The area to the south is mountainous, known as the Sheikh Badin Range. Struggling from insecurity since around 2007, the 2010 Lakki Marwat suicide bombing took place here killing at least 105 people and wounding more than 100 others. History Historically, Shah Hassan Khel was a village unit of the tehsil of Marwat. Administratively it bordered the village units of Ahmed Khel to the north, Abdul Khel to the southwest, and the southwestern part of Chowki Jand to the south and southeast. In 1992, Marwat tehsil became a part of Lakki Marwat District. The neighbouring villages of Ahmed Khel and Abdul Khel constitute official union councils of the district today. The first mentions of trouble with the Taliban in the region of Shah Hassan Khel date from early 2007, with extremists taking six hostages at a marriage party and beating up a group of singers. After the 2007 Siege of Lal Masjid, Taliban militants took first control of the Shah Hassan Khel mosque, and soon of the whole village. When Pakistan security forces tried to expunge the militants from the village in the summer of 2009, the village became a ghost town for three months, with all villagers fleeing to other villages close by. After the operation was successfully ended and 24 militants were captured by the Pakistani forces, the villagers returned and organised a lashkar, a village militia to defend themselves and prevent the return of the Taliban. This worked, despite a volunteer of the militia being killed in a skirmish. 2010 terrorist attack On 1 January 2010 a Mitsubishi Pajero suicide bomb car with some 600 pounds of explosives drove into a village square where a crowd was watching a volleyball game played by some members of the lashkar, while most of the elders of the village and the lashkar were meeting in a nearby mosque. The blast caused at least 97 deaths (other sources claim 105 deaths), with a further 40 wounded. An unknown organisation within the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was responsible for the attack, which caused the most fatalities of any TTP attack. The driver of the bomb car was the son of a member of the Shah Hassan Khel lakshar. In response to the attack, the villages expanded the armed militia to defend the town and to hunt down those responsible for the attack. A boys' school which had also been demolished during the attack was rebuilt and reopened in 2012. Geography Shah Hassan Khel is located in northern central Pakistan in Lakki Marwat District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. By road it is located south of the district town of Lakki Marwat, southeast of Bannu, and south of Kohat. The main road connecting the village, Lakki Marwat Road, stems from the Indus Highway, the N55 road. Like the N55, this road connects Shahbaz Khel in the southwest and Sarai Naurung to the northwest, but bypasses the route, passing through Shah Hassan Khel and the district town of Lakki Marwat en route. The village is located between two streams which lead down from a southern tributary of the Tochi River. The Indus River flows some way to the east of the village. The area to the south is mountainous, known as the Sheikh Budin Range.

Berube (July 23, 1927 ‚Äì February 16, 2005) was an American politician from Maine. A Democrat, Berube served in the Maine Legislature for 26 years, including terms in both the Maine House of Representatives and the Maine Senate. Berube served in the Maine House from 1970 to 1982 after being elected to represent her hometown of Lewiston. Serving until 1982, Berube then ran in the Democratic primary for Governor of Maine, challenging incumbent Joseph Brennan. She ran as a party outsider. Berube, along with Republican Sherry Huber, lost the primaries but became the first women to run for Governor in Maine. Two years later, she sought and won a seat in the Maine Senate, where she served until 1996. Retiring temporarily in 1996, Berube was re-elected in 1998 and finished her political career in 2000. Personal Berube was born of French Canadian parents, Leonard O. Beauparlant and Blanche Tremblay in Lewiston, Maine in 1927. Her parents were small business owners of a furniture store in Lewiston founded in 1919 and was sold in 1975. One of her father's brothers was Aime Majorique Beauparlant, a member of the Canadian parliament. She died on February 16, 2005. She was married to Gerard Robert Berube who had served with the 4th Infantry Division during World War II. They had two children, Michele and author Claude Berube. Political career Berube first ran for office in 1970 for State Representative for one of six at-large seats in Lewiston, Maine. Predominantly a Democratic city, she face opposition from her own party leadership, especially local Democrat and House Appropriations Chairman Louis Jalbert who did not want a woman running for office. Despite this, she finished sixth in the Democratic primary, assuring her a place on the general election ballot. In November, she ranked first among the top six candidates, besting Jalbert by one vote. In 1978, she publicly urged the 2nd District Congressman, Bill Cohen, to run against the sitting Democratic Senator, Bill Hathaway. She continued to serve in the Maine State House of Representatives until 1982 when she ran in the Democratic primary for governor against an incumbent from her own party, Joseph Brennan. She lost by a three to one margin. In 1984, she challenged the incumbent Democratic State Senator in Lewiston, Carroll Minkowsky, defeating him in the primary and then winning handily in the general election. She served in the state senate until 1996 when she was term limited. After a term out of office, she ran again for the open seat in 1998 when John Jenkins decided not to run for re-election. She won the general election and served one term. With a total of 26 years, she has the most legislative service of any woman in Maine's state legislative history and ranks fourth overall among both men and women. For many years, she hosted a French radio show in Lewiston and served on the Diocesan Finance Council of the Catholic Diocese of Maine. In 2009 she was posthumously inducted into the Maine Franco-American Hall of Fame.

Plot In the time of the Arabian Nights, the city of Baghdad is ruled by Sultan Ali Bajazeth (Antonio Battistella) but actually controlled by the scheming Grand Vizier Ghamal (Daniele Vargas). The poor of Baghdad are aided by Karim, the Thief of Baghdad (Steve Reeves). Prince Osman (Arturo Dominici) is due to arrive at the palace to ask for the hand of Sultan Ali's daughter Amina (Giorgia Moll) in marriage. Karim sneaks into the palace, waylays Osman and impersonates the prince, using the opportunity to steal jewels from all of the assembled courtiers. When this is discovered Karim hides in Princess Amina's quarters. When her attendants leave, Karim reveals himself to her and the two are immediately drawn to each other (she believing that he is Prince Osman). The following night, Karim secretly returns to the palace. He meets with Amina, and they declare their love for each other. Climbing down into a courtyard to escape the guards, he lands in the middle of a group of prisoners who have been condemned to slave in the Desert Mills and is dragged off with them. Ghamal gives Osman a potion to make Amina fall in love with him, but she falls dangerously ill after drinking it. An old man appears and says that the only way Amina can be cured is for her to be given a blue rose by someone who truly loves her and whom she truly loves. The blue rose can only be found by passing through the Seven Doors. The sultan proclaims that the quest for the blue rose is open to all. At the Mills, Karim learns of Amina's illness and escapes. Returning to Baghdad, he is told by the old man about the quest. He tries to join the assembled suitors, but is recognized. Karim steals a horse and sets off. The suitors make camp for the night. Karim camps nearby and slips into the camp to steal food and water. Osman secretly slits the waterbags of the other suitors. The next day, the other suitors are beginning to die of thirst. Karim shares his water with them, and the First Door appears. They ride through and find themselves in a forest. That night, the trees come to life and attack them. Most of the suitors flee, but Karim uses a torch to fight off the trees, after which the Second Door appears. It leads to a plain of sulphurous geysers that erupt into a ring of fire. Karim realizes that this is an illusion and uses a rock to smash through, finding the Third Door. The Third Door leads to the Palace of Kadeejah (Edy Vessel), a beautiful woman who tempts Karim to give up the Quest and remain with her. Karim realizes that Kadeejah and her palace are a trap and finds the Fourth Door in a seaside cave. Meanwhile, Osman attacks Baghdad, and Ghamal turns traitor and joins Osman. The Fifth Door leads Karim to a winged horse, on which he travels to a castle in the clouds, where he finds the blue rose. He is immediately transported back to the desert, where the old man is waiting with Karim's horse. The man gives Karim a magic jewel, telling him it will grant him one wish. Osman demands that Sultan Ali surrender Baghdad, threatening Amina. Karim arrives and uses the magic jewel to create an army of Karims which, although armed only with clubs, defeats Osman and his army. Unfortunately, during the battle Osman's sword destroys the Blue Rose. Osman and his army flee. Karim rescues Amina and returns her to her father. The Blue Rose is destroyed, but Karim plucks a white rose and gives it to Amina, telling her that if she truly loves him then it is blue. She takes the rose and tells him that it is blue, and it immediately turns blue, curing her. The sultan welcomes Karim as his son-in-law and successor. Karim sees a bust of the mysterious old man, but the sultan tells him that it is a bust of his late uncle, the great Sultan Achim I.

Diabolique magazine said the film \\"has bright colours and Tunisian locations but is hurt by a wonky screenplay and uncertainty how much fantasy to put in.\\" Novelization A novelization of the film was written by Richard Wormser and published by Dell Paperbacks in 1961. The novelization is told in the first person from the point of view of Abu Hastin, the jinni of Baghdad (who takes the place of the old man from the film and is more involved in the novelization than his counterpart in the film). The novelization creates new characters such as The Lady Jinni of the Rocky Sands (who helps the Jinni of Baghdad create the Quest's tests and is the Jinni of Baghdad's love interest), Karim's scholarly but crippled older brother Malek and The Hairy (or evil) Jinni of Mossul (identified as Osman's home city). The novelization also alters some of the film's characters, making Amina's father more foolish that he is in the film, Karim younger and more reckless, and Amina less of the traditional helpless heroine. Some of the film's Quest tests, Amina's kidnapping, and Osman's siege of Baghdad were eliminated from the novelization.

The lead role was played by Humberto Almaz√°n, an actor who left the industry to become a priest and returned to acting for this film. The movie was the final feature film of director Arthur Lubin. Plot In 1917 Mexico, the new government has commenced a war against the Church. Priests are rounded up and executed, churches burned down and religion outlawed. A carefree happy priest has to go on the run but returns to his nation to perform his priestly duties. Reception Diabolique magazine later wrote \\"this is sometimes called a spaghetti Western, but it isn‚Äôt really‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs more a priest-on-the-run story, where a guitar-playing man of the cloth tries to escape army prosecution during the 1917 Mexican Revolution.

Before joining Lincoln, he spent a season with Aberdeen, a predecessor of the modern Aberdeen F.C. He played mainly as an inside left. Career During the 1897‚Äì98 Scottish season, Clarke (who was then referred to as Billy Clark) scored 4 goals from 8 appearances for Aberdeen in the Northern League. He signed for English Second Division club Lincoln City in July 1898. Upon his move to Lincoln he was described as \\"playing a grand game when in the humour\\" by Aberdeen's Bon-Accord newspaper. Clarke was signed to play as an outside left and it was noted that he could also play as a centre forward and at inside left. According to the Lincolnshire Echo, \\"a considerable sum was paid for his transfer.\\" Clarke was a regular in Lincoln's team in his first season, appearing in 30 of the 34 Second Division matches. He began at outside left, with George Fern inside him, but after five matches the two changed places. He was ever-present in the side until a match against Manchester City at Hyde Road in February 1899: with the scores level at half- time, Lincoln's defence held out for much of the second half, but the hosts scored twice late on, provoking \\"a degree of unpleasantness, which led to Clarke fouling an opponent badly and being ordered off the field.\\" During April, he played four times in the half-back line. He appeared infrequently in the first half of the 1899‚Äì1900 season, and had taken his totals to 7 goals from 35 league appearances by January 1900, when Lincoln cancelled his contract and paid his train fare back to the Scottish borders where he had been working over the summer. The Echo described him as a \\"rather erratic forward\\" who \\"could play when he liked, but the trouble was that he so rarely liked\\".

Background On November 5, 2007, United States Senator Chuck Grassley announced an investigation into the tax-exempt status of six ministries under the leadership of Benny Hinn, Paula White, Eddie L. Long, Joyce Meyer, Creflo Dollar, and Kenneth Copeland by the United States Senate Committee on Finance. In letters to each ministry, Grassley asked for the ministries to divulge specific financial information to the committee to determine whether or not funds collected by each organization were inappropriately utilized by ministry heads. By the December 6, 2007 deadline, only three of the ministries had shown compliance with the Finance Committee's request. On March 11, 2008, Grassley and Finance Chairman Max Baucus sent follow-up letters to Kenneth Copeland, Creflo Dollar and Eddie Long, explaining that the Senate reserved the right to investigate the finances of their organizations under federal tax laws. The Associated Press reported that Grassley said the investigation was a response to complaints from the public and news media. Grassley stated, \\"The allegations involve governing boards that aren't independent and allow generous salaries and housing allowances and amenities such as private jets and Rolls Royces.\\" IRS guidelines require that pastors' compensation be \\"reasonable\\" and net earnings may not benefit any private individual. Responses from these Ministers included Constitutional arguments about Congressional power to oversee such matters. They claim that only the IRS has the authority to request such information, and should the IRS request it or pursue an investigation, the ministries involved would gladly comply. Investigation Benny Hinn Ministries In a letter to Benny Hinn Ministries, Grassley asked for the ministry to divulge financial information to the Senate Committee on Finance to determine if Hinn made any personal profit from financial donations, and requested that Hinn's ministry make the information available by December 6, 2007. On December 6, 2007, Hinn told the Associated Press that he would not respond to the inquiry until 2008. Hinn's ministry has since responded to the inquiry, and Senator Grassley commented that, \\"... Benny Hinn [has] engaged in open and honest dialogue with committee staff. They have not only provided responses to every question but, in the spirit of true cooperation, also have provided information over and above what was requested.\\" Bishop Eddie Long Ministries Long did not cooperate with the investigation, including refusing to disclose his salary. The outcome of the three-year investigation was that there was no definitive findings of wrongdoing, and the pastors who refused to cooperate received no penalties. Paula White Ministries When CBS News reported the story, White's ministry denied any wrongdoing, and on March 31, 2008, the Senate Finance Committee received a joint financial report from Without Walls International Church and Paula White Ministries. Without Walls International Church was one of four ministries that refused to provide the full information Senator Grassley requested. White interpreted the conclusion of the investigation to mean that Without Walls International Church was cleared. Creflo Dollar Ministries Grassley asked for financial information to determine whether Dollar made any personal profit from financial donations and requested that Dollar's ministry make the information available by December 6, 2007. Dollar contested the probe, arguing that the proper governmental entity to examine religious groups is the IRS, not the Committee on Finance. Kenneth Copeland Ministries Grassley asked for the ministry to divulge financial information to the committee to determine if Copeland made any personal profit from financial donations, and requested that Copeland's ministry make the information available by December 6, 2007. The Copelands responded with a \\"Financial report from Kenneth Copeland Ministries.\\"\\"Financial Accountability\\", Kenneth Copeland Ministries KCM created a website to help explain their side of the inquiry.The investigation found no evidence of the Copelands making personal profit from financial donations. The three-year investigation found no definitive findings of wrongdoing and assessed no penalties for the pastors in question. Joyce Meyer Ministries Grassley asked Joyce Meyer Ministries to divulge financial information to the committee to determine if Meyer made any personal profit from financial donations, asking for a detailed accounting for such things as cosmetic surgery and foreign bank accounts and citing such expenses as the $23,000 commode. He also requested that Meyer's ministry make the information available by December 6, 2007. Meyer's ministry was one of two that complied with the Senate's requests for financial records and made commitments to future financial transparency. =Commode controversy= In her November 29 response to Grassley, Meyer notes that the commode is a chest of drawers. Meyer writes that it was part of a 68-piece lot of items totaling $262,000 that were needed to furnish the ministry's headquarters purchased in 2001. She said the commode's price tag was an \\"errant value\\" assigned by the selling agent and apologized for \\"not paying close attention to specific 'assigned values' placed on the pieces.\\" =Financial reports= Joyce Meyer Ministries responded with a newsletter to its e-mail list subscribers on November 9, 2007. The organization referred to its annual financial reports, asserting that, in 2006, the ministry spent 82 percent of its total expenses \\"for outreach and program services toward reaching people with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as attested by independent accounting firm Stanfield & O'Dell, LLP.\\" The message also quoted an October 10, 2007, letter from the Internal Revenue Service which stated, \\"We determined that you [Joyce Meyer Ministries] continue to qualify as an organization exempt from federal income tax under IRC section 501(c)(3).\\" The same information was also posted to the ministry website. Review On March 16, 2009, Grassley, now only an individual Senator on the committee, stated \\"My staff and I continue to review the information we've received from the ministries that cooperated, and we continue to weigh our options for the ministries that have not cooperated,\\" noting that two of the ministries, Hinn's and Meyer's, gave full financial disclosure. Conclusion On January 6, 2011, Senator Grassley concluded the three-year investigation with no penalties and no definitive findings of wrongdoing. Aftermath Donations to Eddie Long Ministries dropped significantly following the controversies surrounding Long's salary and church finances. The Alliance Defending Freedom protested the investigation and the National Religious Broadcasters said the questions Senator Grassley asked were too broad. The Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability made plans to create a national commission in response to the Grassley report to lead a review on accountability and policy.

On the other side were three elected national representatives; Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tan Cheng Lock and David Marshall. The talks took place in the Government English School at Baling on 28 December 1956. However, the talks were unsuccessful because the surrender terms were not acceptable to the Malayan Communist Party and because of disagreement over the legalising of CPM as a political party in Malaya. A few weeks after the Baling talks, Tan Siew Sin, the president of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) received a letter from Chen Tien, requesting a resumption of peace talks and the repeal of the emergency regulations, which he rejected. In 1960, when the emergency was officially declared at an end, Chen Tien, Chin Peng and other communists continued their rebellion.  Later life  After the talks, Chen Tien then left the party while Chin Peng remained. He moved to China and spent his later life in the country where he married Lee Meng in 1965, the female notorious leader of the CPM who had been banished a year before.

The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean‚Äîthe Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories. An average of four to six storms form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November. Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45¬∞E and 100¬∞E are included in the season by the IMD. Systems Cyclonic Storm One Cyclonic Storm One developed in the Bay of Bengal on May 6. It moved east-northeastward and eventually curved northeastward. The system made landfall in Burma before dissipating on May 9. Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Two Under the influence of the ongoing onset of the southwest monsoon, a trough of low pressure developed over the Arabian Sea off the coast of Karnataka on June 6. It slowly moved northwards, and consolidated into a depression by the morning of June 9. The next morning, while the storm was moving northwestwards, the India Meteorological Department upgraded it to a Cyclonic Storm. Over the following days the storm intensified further into a very severe cyclonic storm, recurved northeastwards and crossed the coast of Gujarat near Naliya at a peak intensity of . The system rapidly degenerated inland and dissipated into a low pressure area on June 13. 27 deaths were reported due to the cyclone in India. Prolonged rains associated with the system triggered severe flooding in Pakistan that killed 450 people. Approximately 400,000 were affected by the floods and damage amounted to $4.1 million. Deep Depression Three A deep depression developed in the northern Bay of Bengal on July 3. It headed northwestward and soon struck the state of West Bengal in India. The storm persisted for a few days inland, before dissipating on July 6. Deep Depression Four Deep Depression Four developed in the northern Bay of Bengal on August 5. It moved westward and struck India before dissipating on August 6. Cyclonic Storm Five Cyclonic Storm Five briefly existed in the Arabian Sea from August 6 to August 7. Deep Depression Six Deep Depression Six developed in the northern Bay of Bengal on August 10. It later struck eastern India. The deep depression dissipated by August 12. Depression Seven Depression Seven developed in the Bay of Bengal on August 15 and soon made landfall in India. The depression dissipated on the following day. Land Depression Eight A land depression existed over India from August 23 to August 26. Deep Depression Nine Deep Depression Nine developed in the Bay of Bengal on September 23. It almost immediately moved inland over West Bengal. The deep depression persisted until September 25. Deep Depression Ten A few fishermen lost their lives off the coast of Kakinada. Deep Depression Eleven Deep Depression Eleven developed in the Bay of Bengal on October 4. It soon made landfall in the province of East Pakistan in Pakistan. The deep depression dissipated over eastern India on October 7. Deep Depression Twelve Another deep depression developed in the Bay of Bengal on October 17. It initially moved westward, before eventually re-curving northwestward. The deep depression eventually made landfall in eastern India. By October 21, the deep depression dissipated. Severe Cyclonic Storm Thirteen Severe Cyclonic Storm Thirteen Severe Cyclonic Storm Fourteen Severe Cyclonic Storm Fourteen developed in the Bay of Bengal on November 3. Initially heading northwestward, the storm eventually curved westward. Shortly before dissipating on November 8, the storm struck southern India. Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Fifteen Severe Cyclonic Storm Fifteen developed in the Bay of Bengal on November 16. It meandered there for several days and peaked with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph). Eventually, it weakened and dissipated on November 28. It was tied for the longest-lived cyclone on record in the basin. Super Cyclonic Storm Sixteen On December 15, an area of low pressure was identified over the southern Andaman Sea. Remaining nearly stationary, it gradually developed into a depression two days later. Despite being at a low latitude of 5¬∞N, favorable conditions allowed the system to steadily strengthen, attaining hurricane- force winds by December 19. Spanning approximately 965 km (600 mi), the cyclone reached its peak intensity on December 21 as it approached Ceylon. Based on satellite imagery, it was estimated that the storm had peak winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), with gusts as high as 280 km/h (175 mph). This ranked the system as a modern-day super cyclonic storm. Weakening somewhat, the system continued westward, moving over Tamil Nadu, before rapidly weakening. The system degenerated into a remnant low after emerging over the Arabian Sea on December 24 and dissipated two days later. Striking Ceylon as a super cyclonic storm, the storm wrought tremendous damage. Winds well in excess of hurricane- force battered the region for over six hours, destroying more than 5,000 homes. In eastern Rameswaram, a passenger train carrying 115 people was swept away by a surge, killing all on board. Nearly every structure in Dhanushkodi was destroyed. Press reports indicated that as many as 2,000 people died on Ceylon, including 350 fishermen offshore. In Tamil Nadu, an estimated 500 people were killed. Damage from the storm amounted to $150 million.

It contains fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid, and vilanterol, an ultra-long-acting Œ≤2 agonist (ultra-LABA). In 2013, the drug was approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration for long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and the European Medicines Agency approved it as a second-line therapy for the treatment of COPD and asthma. There were, however, concerns that LABAs such as vilanterol increase the risk of deaths due to asthma. In 2017 the FDA states that they were not justified.  Medical uses There is tentative evidence as of 2016 that it is better than placebo for asthma. Evidence is less strong in children.  History   Approval  This drug was approved by the FDA for use as a long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment in people with COPD in 2013. Labeling changed on April 30, 2015 to add an indication for a once-daily treatment of asthma in people 18 years or older.

According to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, it is \\"the U.S. government's global food security initiative.\\" The Feed the Future Initiative began as an effort \\"to combat the global food price spikes of 2007 and 2008.\\" In 2009 President Barack Obama committed $3.5 billion over a 3-year period to a global initiative with the intent of combating hunger and poverty; in May 2010 the United States Department of State launched the Feed the Future Initiative. The Initiative was developed by the Department of State and is coordinated primarily by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The main objectives of the initiative are the advancement of global agricultural development, increased food production and food security, and improved nutrition particularly for vulnerable populations such as women and children. Background It is estimated that globally almost one billion people currently experience chronic hunger. Most of these people live in Sub- Saharan Africa and South East Asia where health and social problems resulting from chronic hunger are compounded by poverty and other health issues. With a world population of over seven billion people, and a predicted population of 9 billion people by 2050 global hunger and chronic malnutrition/under nutrition are expected to increase in developing countries. Based on these estimates the demand for food worldwide will increase by 40%-70% by 2050 depending on income growth in developing countries most affected by poverty and chronic health issues. At the 2009 G8 Summit in L'Aquila, Italy, President of the United States Barack Obama announced a $10.15 billion commitment over 3 years to an initiative that would focus on reducing hunger and poverty in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. The United States and other G8 and G-20 countries committed a total of over 20 billion USD. The intent of the international commitment was to address food insecurity and poverty in a more comprehensive way; international efforts include supporting country-led plans for change, looking at root causes of food insecurity and poverty, increasing coordination with and the use of multi-lateral institutions, and approaching issues with the goal of increased sustainability and accountability The United States' State Department, the coordinating agency for the Obama Administration's initiative on global hunger and food security, released the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document on September 28, 2009. The document provided an overview of the initiative's priorities and strategy; in May 2010 the initiative was renamed \\"Feed the Future\\" and a new set of strategy documents and country and regional implementation guides were issued. Feed the Future's guide is based on five principles for sustainable food security that were first introduced at the 2009 G8 Summit and later endorsed at the 2009 World Summit on Food Security in Rome, Italy. In creating the guide the U.S. government received input through consultation with other countries, international foundations and institutions, private companies and farmers both nationally and internationally. The Feed the Future strategy guide includes three overarching themes throughout: gender/gender development, the environment/human ecology, and climate change. The two main objectives of the Feed the Future Initiative are: to accelerate agriculture sector growth, and to improve the nutritional status of people in the FtF focus and aligned countries. The Initiative specifically focuses on using locally-adapted technologies to increase agricultural productivity and improve local, national and international markets for commodities produced. According to Feed the Future's strategy guide, the Initiative's input and effects differ for each involved country due to FtF's policy of country- specific, country-owned implementation plans. Coordination of the Initiative is carried out by host country governments, the United States government's Global Health Initiative and other development partners to create a nutrition strategy for each country. The progress of each country's nutrition plan is measured by statistics collected; the decrease of stunted and wasted children as well as the prevalence of underweight women are indicators of improved nutritional status.  Focus countries and partnerships  The Feed the Future Initiative currently has 19 focus countries across three regions; three countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, twelve countries in Africa, and four countries in Asia: *Africa: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia. *Asia: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Tajikistan. *Latin America and the Caribbean: Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras. Feed the Future countries are chosen based on five criteria established by the U.S. State Department: *\\"Prevalence of chronic hunger and poverty in rural communities; *Potential for rapid and sustainable agricultural-led growth; *Opportunities for regional synergies through trade and other mechanisms; *Host government commitment, leadership, governance, and political will; *Resource availability and commitments by host country.\\" The 'Global Agriculture and Food Security Program' (GAFSP) multilateral funding mechanism associated with the initiative is \\"housed at the World Bank.\\" Partner companies include Monsanto and PepsiCo.  Assessment  A 2013 Government Accountability Office report indicated that \\"without ongoing assessments of risks on the ground .. American money, goodwill, and expertise could be squandered.\\" A critical article in Mother Jones Magazine in 2013 suggested that \\"it's not clear if Feed the Future is working as intended, or if its funds are falling through the cracks.\\" A June 2014 report released by the Feed the Future Initiative described \\"positive policy outcomes\\" in more optimistic terms, declaring that \\"the initiative has begun to truly establish 'a foundation for lasting progress against global hunger.'\\" References External links * Feed the Future Initiative * Feed the Future Initiative Animation This brief animation produced by Feed the Future and TechChange explores key accomplishments of the initiative to date. * United States Census * U.S. Agency for International Development * Category:United States Agency for International Development Category:Food security Category:Hunger relief organizations Category:Obama Administration initiatives Category:2010 in the United States Feed the Future ","title":"Feed the Future Initiative"},{"id":"39375842","text":"K√°roly Teppert (born 20 July 1891, date of death unknown) was a Hungarian cyclist.

Examples of political profiling controversies include cases in which IRS employees or government officials have allegedly used IRS resources to target individuals and groups for espousing or expressing particular political beliefs.  1930s  Use of the IRS for political targeting has been alleged as far back as the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. :‚ÄúMy father,‚Äù Elliott Roosevelt observed of his famous parent, ‚Äúmay have been the originator of the concept of employing the IRS as a weapon of political retribution.‚ÄùNew Deal Or Raw Deal?: How FDR's Economic Legacy Has Damaged America By Burton W. Folsom, Jr. Chapter 11:\\"The IRS, FDR's personal weapon\\".  1940s‚Äì1960s  The most famous Kennedy administration project allegedly deploying tax-related targeting was called the \\"Ideological Organizations Project\\". This was a project which allegedly investigated, intimidated, and challenged the tax-exempt status of right-wing foundations.Andrew, John A., III (2002) Power to Destroy: The Political Uses of the IRS from Kennedy to Nixon Many instances of alleged political profiling were coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), sometimes under COINTELPRO. The IRS provided the FBI with free access to tax returns, which the FBI used to investigate groups as ideologically varied as the John Birch Society, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the American Communist Party. Beginning in the 1950s and continuing into the 1960s, the IRS audited civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. numerous times. In addition to King himself, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and several of King's lawyers were subjected to audits. Nixon In 1974, a Bill of Impeachment against President Richard Nixon was approved by the House Judiciary Committee that included charges that his administration attempted to use the IRS in a discriminatory manner: : :RESOLVED, That Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanours... : :Using the powers of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States... : :He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavoured to... cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be initiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner.  Clinton  Conservative groups including the Heritage Foundation, the National Rifle Association, and Judicial Watch alleged that the Clinton administration subjected them to politically motivated audits. G. W. Bush  The NAACP was audited in 2004 after its chairman criticized then-President George W. Bush for failing to address the group, becoming the first president to do so since Herbert Hoover. The IRS informed the NAACP that the audit was prompted by then-NAACP-chairman Julian Bond's speech, which \\"condemned the administration policies of George W. Bush on education, the economy and the war in Iraq.\\" Although the IRS maintained that the audit was an attempt to determine whether the NAACP had involved itself in a political campaign, the NAACP and Democratic Party representatives characterized the audit as an attempt to stifle criticism of Bush, intimidate NAACP members, and harm the NAACP's get-out-the-vote campaign. According to the Huffington Post in 2004, the Wall Street Journal reported that the IRS audited the liberal group Greenpeace at the request of Public Interest Watch, a group funded by Exxon-Mobil. Exxon-Mobil said it was not aware of the IRS audit, nor did it have a role in initiating the audit. According to the Tampa Bay Times PolitiFact the allegation that the IRS during the Bush Administration targeted liberal groups is \\"Mostly False\\".  Obama  In May 2013, the IRS admitted it had subjected conservative political groups to closer scrutiny in their applications for tax-exempt status based on particular keywords in their names. The agency has maintained that low-level employees took it upon themselves to do this. However, Republicans argue that the refusal of Lois Lerner (at the time was Director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations Unit) to testify before Congress, twice citing her Constitutional right against self-incrimination, suggests involvement by higher-level employees. An internal report by the agency's Inspector General cited \\"ineffective management\\" as the cause and indicated that the IRS \\"will need to do more so that the public has reasonable assurance that applications are processed without unreasonable delay in a fair and impartial manner in the future.\\" Congress continues to investigate the possibility that Lerner or other high-level officials were involved in improper political targeting. Republican lawmakers say the IRS has improperly withheld and destroyed evidence, while Democrats argue that Republicans are attempting to keep the controversy alive for political purposes.

He assumed the throne at a time when Marinid authority was in decline, but during his rule managed to reverse this trend. After his death the kingdom returned to anarchy. Background Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz came to power at a time when the Moorish states of Granada, Morocco and Tlemcen were all weak, and were all prone to meddling in each other's affairs. Abu Faris was one of the sons of Abu al-Hasan ibn Uthman, and before coming to the throne was held captive in the palace of Fez. Rule In 1366 Sultan Muhammad II ibn Faris of Morocco tried to remove the vizier Umar bin Abdulla al-Yabani from office, and was killed in response. Abu Faris Abdul-Aziz came to the throne. Once he was firmly in control he had the vizier killed. Abu Faris was one of the more decisive of the Marinid rulers. He defeated the neighboring Zayyanid kingdom of Tlemcen, to the east. Abu Faris also reestablished control over Marrakesh, where a Marinid prince supported by the Hintata chief of the Atlas Mountains had seceded from the sultanate of Fez. When Abu Faris captured Tlemcen he took the diplomat Ibn Khaldun (1332‚Äì1406) prisoner, and enlisted him in his own service. Later Ibn Khaldun was to establish lasting fame for his great world history, which he started to write around 1372. Ibn Ridwan (1318‚Äì1381), author of a major treatise on political ethics, was another of Abu Faris's senior administrators. He gave asylum to Lisan ad-Din ibn al-Khatib, former vizier of Muhammed V of Granada. Abu Faris arranged for the Marinid forces in Gibraltar to help al-Khatib to escape to Morocco. He built the Muristan al-Azizi (Azizi Hospital) in Fez and an adjacent fountain that have both survived until modern times. Abu Faris died in 1372 and was succeeded by his infant son Muhammad abu Zayyan as-Sa√Æd II. The kingdom again descended into anarchy. In 1374 Muhammad V of Granada took control of Gibraltar.

He competed in the men's outdoor singles event at the 1912 Summer Olympics. He reached the quarterfinal in which he lost to South African Harold Kitson in straight sets. Salm-Hoogstraeten played in six ties for the Austrian Davis Cup team between 1924 and 1928 and compiled a record of four wins and eight losses. Early life and family Count Salm was born 24 February 1885 in Bad Homburg vor der H√∂he to Count Alfred von Salm-Hoogstraeten, a Prussian Cavalry officer in the Franco-Prussian War, and Baroness Adolphine von Erlanger. He had three brothers, Alfred, Otto and Alexander. The latter two were also tennis players and formed a doubles team, were Austrian champions and competed in the 1914 US Indoor Championships. His family held an estate at Reichenau, and as the oldest child, he was the first in line to inherit it. Tennis career 1910‚Äì1914 Ludwig von Salm was particularly successful in doubles competitions. His pre-World War I career included a mixed final in the Les Avants tournament with Miss Turner, which he lost to Eric Pockley and Miss Brook-Smith. In April 1911 he won the San Remo doubles together with Anthony Wilding after defeating the German duo of Curt Bergmann and Friedrich Rahe. The same month they split for the Croquet et Lawn-Tennis Club de Cannes championships, Wilding played with A. Wallis Myers, Salm chose Robert Kleinschroth, and the four of them met in the semifinal, which was won by Wilding and Myers. In 1912 he was a singles runner-up for the Biarritz Golf Club tournament, losing to Rahe; however, he was still successful in doubles, winning the inaugural Russian Championships doubles pairing with home favorite Mikhail Sumarokov-Elston. In 1913, he was a doubles semifinalist in the Monaco tournament with French netman Max Decugis but ceded the victory to Kleinschroth and Rahe in a straight two-set match. In 1914, pairing again with Wilding, they clinched the Cannes doubles title by beating Decugis and Gordon Lowe. At Nice, Wilding and Craig Biddle defeated Salm and Gordon Lowe. The same year, he was the finalist for the World Hard Court Championships mixed doubles and the French Championships doubles. In the former with Suzanne Lenglen, he was routed by Elizabeth Ryan and Max Decugis. In the latter, he and William Laurentz fell in the challenge round to title defenders Max Decugis and Maurice Germot. Although he only reached the second round of the Wimbledon singles in 1913, he did better in the All England Plate, a consolation tournament for losing participants, where he was eliminated by Horace Rice in the fourth round. In 1914, Salm achieved his biggest achievement in the French Championships by advancing to the All Comers' final of the tournament, where he was forced to give up the contest to Jean Samazeuilh at the fifth set due to fatigue. A week later he reached the final of the World Hard Court Championships, losing to Anthony Wilding in straight sets. 1920‚Äì1930, on-court controversies After the war, he made his comeback at the 1920 German International Tennis Championships, winning the doubles title with Oscar Kreuzer. In 1924, the French Riviera tennis clubs refused him entry to their championships for his lack of sportsmanship. In 1925, his playing license was suspended by the Austrian Lawn Tennis Federation for failing to show up at an international match in Breslau (this ban was lifted a couple of years later). During that season, he violated the attitude code on several occasions. In a Viennese doubles match, he insulted his recurring partner Suzanne Lenglen to the point that she dropped her racquet and quit the match. He also provoked Irish player Charles Scroope in a Davis Cup meeting by constantly questioning the umpire's decisions. In 1926, he reached the quarterfinals of the French International Hard Court Championship partnering B√©la von Kehrling; they were defeated by eventual victors Howard Kinsey and Vincent Richards. Also in 1926, he won the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin tournament, a victory which caused a major scandal. Count Salm verbally abused his 18-old opponent Herman Wetzel, who then walked off the court in the second set. The judges overruled the first decision and awarded the match to Salm, reasoning that Wetzel had voluntarily left the court. It was the second time within a year that Salm's misbehavior stirred international controversy, and as a result, an official ban was requested to deny him access to tournaments. On another occasion in 1928, while he was participating in the mixed doubles at Cannes, he drew attention when he walked off the court in outrage during a match after a ball flew in from outside, distracting him so that he lost the point. He came back when he heard the laughter of the spectators. His partner, Blanche Gladys Duddell, wife of Edward Murray Colston, 2nd Baron Roundway, was \\\\upset by the count's actions, and her husband officially protested during this interruption to ensure that the rules prevented the count from leaving the court again. In 1928 at New Courts Club tournament in Cannes, Salm partnered with Austrian champion Hermann von Artens and won the doubles without losing a set. In 1929, the Austrian team pushed to the semifinals of the South of France Championships, where they were stopped by Ren√© Gall√®pe and Charles Aeschlimann. In 1930, he claimed the Austrian International Championships doubles, teaming up with eventual world number one Bill Tilden. He was also runner-up in Ostend, Venice, and Merano with three different partners. In 1931, he earned a second place at the veterans' singles of the French Championships granting a flawless two straight sets victory to Briton Leighton Crawford. Personal life and death During World War I, Count von Salm-Hoogstraeten served as a dragoon officer in the Austrian Army and as a military aide to the governor of Vienna. After the war he settled in Vienna, where he lost much of his fortune and properties over card games held at the Jockey Club. He married his first wife, Anne-Marie von Kramsta, on 30 June 1909. His second marriage, on 8 January 1924, was to American heiress Millicent Rogers and produced one son, but the couple had divorced before he was born. Apart from playing tennis, he occasionally acted in movies because his friend Count Alexander Kolowrat, who was a film producer and owner of Sascha-Film. His director Mih√°ly Kert√©sz encouraged Kolowrat to offer Salm movie roles and hire him. He was cast in three feature films alongside Lucy Doraine, including the Masters of the Sea and A Vanished World. In 1929, he published a book dedicated to his son, Peter, titled Mein lieber Peter ... beichte eines vaters. While living in Austria, he gave private tennis etiquette and fair-play lessons to Viennese children. After his financial breakdown, Salm moved to Budapest and started a wine business. He rented and lived in a second-story room in the Hotel Dunapalota-Ritz. On 23 July 1944, he jumped off the hotel balcony onto the Danube Promenade and died immediately. According to the Winona Daily News, he did so because the Nazis had arrived on the scene to arrest him for his Jewish ancestry. According to his friend Sidney Wood, the root cause behind his suicide was that the Nazi regime pressured him to engage in espionage, which he refused to do and thus the SS wanted to hunt him down. On the contrary, according to the Jewish Criterion, he was a Nazi collaborator and avid anti-Semite and chose to end his life in fear of post-war reprisals. He was buried on 28 July; his funeral became social affair.

With his increasing involvement in regional politics after the Syrian Civil War began and his interaction with the media, he has become a notorious personality in Lebanon's current political landscape. Al-Assir is a Salafi. He frequently agitates against Iran and Hezbollah, whom he accuses of being a threat to the fragile sectarian balance and democracy of Lebanon. After being a wanted fugitive for years, Al-Assir was detained on 15 August 15, 2015 by Lebanese General Security officials while attempting to flee to Egypt using a forged passport in Beirut International Airport. Upon his capture, it was revealed that Al-Assir had undergone physical changes in appearance and attire; with a shaved beard and new clothing style and facial modifications suggesting the use of plastic surgery. On 28 September 2017, Al-Assir was sentenced to death. Background Al-Assir is from a mixed background - his mother is a Shia from the south of Lebanon, and his father is a Sunni from Sidon. He came from a non-religious artistic home, but later convinced his father not to play music. He has two wives and three children. According to one of his sisters, he was once a supporter of Hezbollah, but withdrew his support when Hezbollah and the Lebanese Shiite withdrew their focus from Israel and begun to exert excessive force on the delicate sectarian balance of Lebanon.Mansoor Moaddel, Jean Kors, Johan G√§rde \\"Sectarianism and Counter-Sectarianism in Lebanon,\\" Population Studies Center Research Report 12-757 (May 2012) Assir's notoriety increased after a series of sermons and public exhibitions criticizing Hezbollah, a once untouchable symbol in the Lebanese political landscape. He also caused controversy by openly criticizing figures within the militia such as secretary general and spokesperson Sayed Hassan Nasrallah. Many of his speeches are critical of Hezbollah's, Iran's and the Arab Baath Party's support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad. Assir has stated that he is only against Shias that follow the teachings of Khomeini. Assir has attempted to become a leader of the Sunnis of Lebanon, without success. Currently he is not considered a mainstream Sunni Scholar; however, his aggressive and emotional rhetoric against Hezbollah's intervention in Syria has gained him headlines and controversy, along with attracting many supporters and followers disillusioned with the traditionally Sunni Future Movement party and the leadership of Saad Hariri.Gary C. Gambill, ‚ÄúSalafi-jihadism in Lebanon,‚Äù Mideast Monitor 3.1 (2008) 2012 sit-ins In August 2012, Al-Assir and his supporters staged a sit in in the southern city of Sidon to protest against Hezbollah's weaponry. This led to tensions, and later clashes between Assir-supporters and members of the Popular Nasserist Organization. An AFP photographer was beaten by security forces during the clashes. The following day, counter-protests were held by members of the PNO. On 8 August, a gunfight between supporters and rivals of Assir wounded five, including two women. Access to the media Marcel Ghanem hosting Ahmed al-Assir in his political talk show Kalam El-Nas As Lebanon is a freedom of speech country, every Lebanese was able or obliged to hear Assir speech. Some media went far in hosting him in their studios in particular Marcel Ghanem who hosted him in his political talk show Kalam El- Nas. Some Lebanese criticized the fact that Assir was given a media platform despite his provocative speeches and referred to the fact that Bin Laden was not able to speech on CNN or Fox News despite that the United States is a freedom of speech country. Attacking other religions Assir has usually provocative speeches attacking Shias. His hate touched also other religions especially the Christians and he expressed it in a public preaching: Our mind is forgiveness and selves-control. How can an engineer pray for a cow or an atomic scientist worship rats or trees and this one worships Jesus and the other worships a rock and fire and hell. Where will they go when they die? This is our matter. Military Clashes 2012 Sidon clash On 11 November 2012, three people were killed and four others wounded after supporters of Assir clashed with supporters of Hezbollah in the southern city of Sidon. Assir stated \\"We have a blood score to settle with Hezbollah that can only be settled with blood\\", and that he considered forming an \\"armed resistance group\\" to defend Lebanon from Israel as he believed that Hezbollah's weapons had now been pointed internally. Syrian civil war In April 2013, Assir urged his followers to join the Syrian rebels by claiming that \\"There is now no other choice but to defend our (Sunni) people in Syria,\\" and assuring that \\"There is a religious duty on every Muslim who is able to do so... to enter into Syria in order to defend its people, its mosques and religious shrines, especially in Qusayr and Homs,\\" adding that \\"This fatwa (religious decree) affects us all, especially those who have military experience.\\" Assir also announced the establishment of \\"Free resistance battalions\\" in Sidon. Such announcements came after there was enough evidence that Hezbollah militias had been involved in Syria who were fighting alongside Bashar's army. 2013 Sidon clashes In June 2013, clashes broke out in an eastern suburb of Sidon after several people attacked, threw stones and shattered windows in a car belonging to Assir's brother, Amjad al-Assir. Assir then gave Hezbollah a one- week ultimatum to vacate apartments occupied by the group's supporters in the mostly Sunni city, as clashes broke out with gunmen wielding automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Officials stated that the gunmen fighting Assir's followers were believed to be Hezbollah sympathizers. Lebanese army troops deployed in the area of the fighting, which subsided after several hours. The military called on gunmen loyal to Assir to withdraw immediately from the streets whilst ignoring the presence of Hezbollah gunmen. A group of Assir's followers were believed to stage armed attacks on several civil apartments in Saida, which were reportedly identified as Hezbollah offices. Some Lebanese saw the attacks as highlights of a series of provocations initiated by Saudi and Qatar-backed Sunni fundamentalists whilst many others believed Iran was the real reason for the provocations. On 23 June 2013, according to news channels loyal to Hezbollah said that 10 Lebanese Army soldiers were killed and 35 wounded in a clash with armed men loyal to Assir, in Sidon at an Army post near the Abra complex that houses the Bilal bin Rabah Mosque. Other Lebanese news channels denied this and accused Hezbollah militias of being involved. Violence started with a deadly attack on an army checkpoint. Roads were later blocked in other parts of the country, and the army came under fire in the Ain el-Hilweh camp. During 23‚Äì24 June 2013, heavy street fighting erupted between the Lebanese Army and gunmen loyal to Assir in Sidon as they were accused of provoking the attack. Sixteen Lebanese soldiers, thirteen Assir supporters and approximately 4 Hezbollah militants were killed. A bodyguard of a cleric, who tried to reach the fighting to negotiate a ceasefire, also died. More than 100 Lebanese soldiers were wounded, as well as 13 pro-Assir militants. The Lebanese army requested for the country's politicians to intervene. On Monday June 24, 2013, Lebanese Army commandos seized a complex controlled by gunmen loyal to Assir in the southern city of Sidon, shortly after he fled the premises to an unknown destination. Assir reportedly fled the complex at around 10 a.m., shortly after the Army stormed the premises which the military gradually gained control over throughout the day. Sources said soldiers were still trading gunfire with snipers located on the rooftops of nearby buildings. Sixty-five gunmen, including several Palestinian and Syrian refugees, reportedly either surrendered or were captured by Army units during the raid on the complex. Lebanon's military prosecutor issued arrest warrants against Assir and 123 of his followers. The warrants also included the name of Assir's brother. The raid on the compound at noon came after an attempt by a group of Salafi preachers to mediate a truce reached a dead end, with the Army determined to continue its operations. There is no factual basis for the claim that Assir was captured and his followers crushed. His fate remains unknown, however, the army is treating the matter as a capture or kill operation on the basis that they believe it was only Assir that killed Lebanese soldiers in \\"cold blood\\", according to a military statement. Military Court prosecution In February 2014, it was reported that military courts were seeking the death penalty for Ahmed al- Assir, and prison terms for up to 20 of his followers. According to Lebanese authorities, al-Assir was arrested at Beirut airport in August 2015. Laila Bassam: \\"Lebanese authorities detain militant Islamist cleric\\" 15 August 2015 Reuters On 28 September 2017, the Lebanese Military Courts declared the verdict of death penalty for Assir.

It was established in the 16th century and is part of present-day Mustang District, Nepal. The village and the gompa are located on the historic salt trade route and the population of both Chhairo Monastery and Chhairo village fell into decline when China closed its border with Nepal in the 1960s to restrict movement by pro-Tibetan activists and again recently due to security concerns during the 2008 Summer Olympics... The last remaining monks left the monastery in the 1970s. and by 1981 only four nuns were taking care of the monastery.. At some time between 1981 and the 1990s the management of Chhairo Gompa was left wholly to Chhairo village. Since the mid 2000s efforts to reconstruct the main gompa complex have been made. This work is restricted to the monastery, shrine room to Padmasambhava and the main rooms that form a quad around these. The larger monastery complex of rooms for monks, visitors, pilgrims and their horses remain in ruins to the east. Name and location Tashi Shagagh Jyochen Chhoyokhor Monastery, known locally as Chhairo Monastery, Chandanbari Monastery and historically as Ts√©rok Monastery,. is situated in Mustang District, Marpha Village development committee (VDC), Ward No. 9, Chhairo village, in the Western Development Region, Nepal at . It is about 20 mins walk south from Marpha town on the Annapurna trekking route from Pokhara to Jomsom in the Dhaulagiri zone, on the left bank of the Kali Gandaki river reached by a small footbridge from the main road south of Marpha, and about 1.5hours walk north of Tukuche village, signposted to Chimang.. Influence of trade on the Thakali region This is the area of the Thakali, an ethnolinguistic group originated from the Thak Khola region. Chhairo Gompa is located on the historical salt trading route from Tibet to southern Nepal.. Customs offices were established in Nhechung near Rhyamdo, and thereafter in Jomsom, Mustang, Chhairo and Tukuche to serve the salt trade. The trade routes contributed to the rich political, social, religious and cultural activities of the late 1800s. The salt, grain and livestock trade enriched the economic and living standards of the local Thak communities, providing a conducive environment to establish the gompa which then served residents and traders alike. Founding The name of Chhairo village and the monastery is believed to originate from the name of a waterfall in the area, which is called chhahara in the Nepali language. The founder, Chhawang Thinlen (called sku shogs \\"The Illustrious\\"),The Thakalis, Bon dKar and Lamaist Monasteries along the Kali Gandaki: The Ancient Salt Route in Western Nepal, RK Rai (1994) Book Faith India is believed to have been a Thak resident having come from Kyirong Monastery. Alternative stories state that he was the younger of two brothers who migrated to Chhairo from Dhakartas Pandrasaya Khola of Rasuwa district. The Padmasambhava chapel, called Sanga Choling, is the smaller chapel to the northeast of the main shrine room. It is believed to have been built in the 18th century by Lama Sangye.. Spiritual provenance Gautama Buddha shrine at Chhairo Monastery The Monastery has its spiritual roots in the Northern Treasure () lineage, which was first taught at the three Nyingma Mother Monasteries of Dorje Drak, Katok Monastery and Palyul in Tibet. Chhairo monastery contributed to the expansion of the Nyingma teachings in Nepal and the Thak region in particular and was the first Nyingma monastery in Nepal. During the tenure of the second incarnation of Chhawang Thinlen, the monastery flourished and the extent of the physical infrastructure can still be seen outside the grounds of the current gompa. The footprint of the accommodation is visible for the lamas, monks and nuns who studied at the monastery contributing to the growth of the Nyingma school and the establishment of other monasteries in the region. Incarnations (Tulkus) The first incarnation was in the Sherchan family, but no further details are known. The second Lama reincarnation of Chhairo was the elder brother of Shanta Kumar Guachan. The Gauchan family and local people recall that five or six days after he was born, sun rays that touched him turned to a rainbow, identifying him as a reincarnation. Three years after the death, aged forty, of the second incarnation, Rajendra Bhattachan was born in Tukuche, the third reincarnation. The current incarnation has chosen not to become a lama. He has therefore delegated authority for the running of Chhairo Gompa to Shashi Dhoj Tulachan Reviving the Gompa in body and soul Inside Chhairo Gompa Body Responding to the first Tibetan rebellions against Chinese occupation, the Chinese government closed the Nepal‚ÄìTibet border at the Mustang passes. Changes in demand for goods and opening of alternative routes and modes of transport further affected the historic trade routes and Chhairo Gompa became less and less influential. Over time, community use of the gompa also declined as the local population moved away in search of alternative work and livelihood. As with many religious structures in the region, no monks remained at Chhairo, and it was given into the hands of local caretakers who were only able to maintain the core shrine rooms and courtyard. Recognising the wider importance of Chhairo Gompa in establishing the Nyngma sect in Thak, on the occasion of the 12 yearly Lhaphew, held in 2049 BS (Vikram Samvat) (approx. 1992 CE) a delegation from Chhairo visited Subba Tek Narsingh Bhattachan,. a wealthy family and long time patrons, in Tukuche to request assistance in restoring the gompa.. Inspired by their forefathers accounts of Tukche and Chhairo in their former glory and strong architectural and religious heritage, and stimulated and encouraged by Sashi Dhoj Tulachan, their religious leader, some of the younger generation is interested to repair and conserve the gompa complex, revitalising the community and rehabilitating the disintegrating fabric of Tukche through various activities associated with Chhairo Gompa.. The Chhairo Reconstruction and Maintenance Committee was formed who proceeded to collect information about the legal status of the gompa structures and property as well as determine the extent of the works that would be required. In 2045 BS (approx. 1997/98) funds had been raised and technical conservation advice was sought, enabling engagement of an architectural firm to undertake a preliminary survey and develop the reconstruction scope and estimate. Since 2004/5, the reconstruction has been supported by RWI, previously known as CRTP... Soul In 2012 the gompas became home to six young boys aged 7 to 11 from Jumla and Dolpa districts of the Mid-Western Development Region, Nepal who will train to be monks. From summer 2012 to autumn 2013 attended mainstream education at the primary school of the adjacent Tibetan camp, learning Nepali, Tibetan and English. Chhairo Gompa: Lama Shashi + young monks The local community continue to be involved in decisions regarding the direction and extent of the reconstruction efforts. The current Lama, Shashi Dhoj Tulachan leads the interaction with the architect and volunteer groups, together with his brother, Chakra Tulachan. Chhairo villagers are employed as masons, carpenters and labourers as well as caretakers for the lhakang and gyalpo and cook and caretaker for the 6 young monks in training. In the winter school break of 2013-2014 they began more regular monastic studies under the guidance of Lopen Sonam, during the winter to Pokhara to work towards a new generation of monks to serve Chhairo Gompa. Guru Nawang Chhogyall Tenzin (Shashi Dhoj Tulachan) Chhairo Gompa: Lama Shashi Dhoj Tulachan, Chhairo, Lower Mustang, Nepal Lama Shashi Dhoj Tulachan is the spiritual leader of Chhairo Gompa having been given responsibility for Chhairo Gompa by the current incarnation who is not a practicing lama. He is responsible for the physical reconstruction of the gompa as well as the teaching of the young monks from Mid West Region who have been brought to re-establish the gompa's monastic purpose.  Religious art  The original wall paintings in both chapels are blackened with dirt and smoke from centuries of burning butter lamps and incense and have also suffered significant damage from water seepage. (c) 2013 renovation to the interior of either chapel has not been undertaken.  Main gompa  Lama Chhiwang Thilen, Chhairo gompa's founder, is believed to have painted the original frescoes in sMon and Gya Bris styles. They are predominantly in the sMon Bris style with elements of U Birs and even Bal Bris. The original frescoes in the lhakang were washed off and redone by Kamal Dhoj Tulachan, Shashi Dhoj Tulachan's father in 1960. c)1981 the central altar statue was a Sakyamuni . (c)1994 the central figure at the gompa altar was a clay image of Sakyamuni, flanked by his disciples, Ananda and Sariputra. Numerous small statues of Chhairo Gompa's past lamas and benefactors are also found. A lifelike clay image of the founder, Chhiwang Thilen, sat on the right corner of the altar. The interior of the roof lantern was panelled with slate carvings.  Padmasambhava Chapel  Chhairo Gompa: Padmasambhava statue, Chhairo, Lower Mustang, Nepal A 3m clay and bamboo Padmasambhava statue dominates the room and is believed to have been created by Khaipa Chh'ekoup. The most recent wall paintings are attributed to Lama Kamal Dhoj Tulachan, a famous painter of Mustang and the father of Shashi Dhoj Tulachan. (c) 2013 the paintings that can be seen were completed in 1953 and are in the sMon Bris style. Architecture .. Chhairo Gompa, Chakra Tulachan painting in the new gyalpo The Chhairo Gompa complex follows the traditional flat roof structures of the Mustang region with stone walls and consists of a temple courtyard, head lama quarters, kitchen and the monks‚Äô quarters and stables. The main gompa courtyard The temple compound has two religious rooms; the main shrine room and the smaller adjacent Padmasambhava chapel; that face inward onto a slate paved courtyard that was bounded on the other three sides by two-story galleries where visiting guests could view ritual Cham dance. Only the northern verandas are still standing. The main shrine room rises above the remaining structures and is capped with a small central lantern providing the only natural source of light. Chhairo gompa Padmasambhava chapel + dalan gallery from courtyard, Chhairo, Lower Mustang, Nepal The Padmasambhava chapel (Sanga Choling) is immediately adjacent to the north east and is also capped by a small lantern. It is believed to have been constructed in the 18th century by Lama Sangye.. This shrine room currently also serves as the gyalpo since the original gyalpo collapsed. Two statues of the guardian deities are currently housed here. They will be relocated to the new gyalpo when it is completed ¬© 2013. The dry stone masonry walls are approximately a metre thick with a timber ring beam about one metre beneath the roof acts as a tie. The walls of the Lhakhang and the Shrine room facing the courtyard are mud plastered, reddish clay for the Lhakhang and white clay for the Chapel. view of Chhairo Gompa lhakang, Chhairo, Lower Mustang, Nepal The windows and doors are in a Newari style influenced by the craftspeople of the Thak area. They are modestly carved but have been heavily over painted. The three upper windows to the Lhakhang incorporate standard Tibetan details creating the lintels to the openings and painted black. The Lhakhang doors have embossed knobs and are decorated with Tibetan inscriptions. A pair of carved images fixed to the Lhakhang's inner doorjambs are said to be Dvarapala or guardians to the temple. The Head Lama's Quarters and Kitchen Structures housing the Head Lama's quarters and the gompa's original kitchen enclose the courtyard. The kitchen area, in the northeast corner of the courtyard was composed of three rooms: a cooking/eating area, a storeroom and a room for washing. The adjacent Head Lama quarters were on the same level but took advantage of a sloping site and were built as an upper floor above ground level stables. The outer walls remain generally sound, but the Lama's quarters had completely collapsed. Restoration work was completed in 2012 providing living, bathroom, kitchen quarters for the Lama, a sleeping area for the young monks as well as additional rooms for visitors. The new Gyalpo is located at the top of this structure, and is currently being decorated ¬© 2013. Since 2005 the kitchen has been located in a single storey room to the west of the courtyard. The Monks‚Äô Quarters and Stables The monks‚Äô quarters and stables are to the east of the lama's quarters and, for the most part have collapsed, although the foundation walls are largely intact. This part of the complex originally consisted of two open courtyards divided by a central spine wall running east-west. The wall divided the space into two separate, approximately square courtyards measuring 20 by 20 metres. The northern section is a single-story structure built on higher ground. An internal stone and earth walkway within the northern courtyard provided space for the occupants to sit outside their quarters. The southern courtyard complex is built on lower ground and is generally two stories, allowing space for livestock to be housed in the lower floor and space for living quarters on the upper level. The floors were rammed earth with timber joists and planking laid over. Although this section of the complex is the most dilapidated, it is the section that is most suitable for development and possible expansion. Restoration Plans .. There is a three- phase restoration plan: ‚Ä¢ Phase IA ‚Äìemergency repairs and rehabilitation of the temple compound ‚Ä¢ Phase IB ‚Äì recreate as near as possible the original layout and appearance of the head lama quarters and kitchens while improving and upgrading the accommodations ‚Ä¢ Phase II ‚Äì rebuild the monks‚Äô quarters and stables for development as a training centre for Buddhist arts. Long term plans anticipate converting the stable areas into habitable space, providing living quarters for monks. The structures around the northern courtyard could be used as classrooms and studios for Buddhist art training, Buddhist retreat or a crafts centre to help revitalize the local economy.

The family of Motswaletswale was the first to contact the Ministry of Safety and Security in order for this incident to be investigated.

This process led to an MK officer based in Zimbabwe of the time of the death of the combatants identifying Mandi as being Madi. However, the necessary information confirming the identity of the deceased was scarce. Andrew Mandi was not listed as an ANC operative dead in exile but Andrew Madi was one of them, registered as killed in Rhodesia in 1979. Complicating the matter, the two other combatants were listed as having been killed in August 1983 in Venda.African National Congress , List of ANC Members who Died in Exile, March 1960 - December 1993 Related to the case was a Human Rights Violation Testimony submitted by Matsutse Elias Madi living in Alexandra, Johannesburg.

However flawed, it allowed families to get closer to the truth of what happened to their loved ones and get some closure. The collaboration of the different branches of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission allowed for the family of Dikgope Andrew 'Magic Bones' Madi to get some closure with his exhumation and reburial. However, no one claimed responsibility for his murder. The exhumation process goes beyond this singular case and involved hundreds of cases, some of which are still pending.

Peel started life as a yeoman farmer but experimented with calico printing, eventually creating a parsley leaf pattern which would become his trademark. Despite losing a number of machines during riots, Peel's company became the largest in the textile sector by the time of his death, with 23 factories. Early life Robert Peele was born in 1723 at Peele Fold in Oswaldtwistle to William Peele and Jane Anne Walmsley. His family were traditionally yeoman farmers, until his grandfather Robert Peele abandoned the trade in favour of making woollen cloth. Parsley's father, William, attempted to return the family to farming and after his education at Blackburn Grammar School, he initially joined his father in this pursuit. He inherited the woodblocks his grandfather used for printing on wool and started experimenting with them. When his wife's brother, Jonathan Haworth, returned from an apprenticeship to a calico-printer in London, the pair attempted to set up a business in calico printing. They received financial backing from William Yates, the landlord of the local public house and formed Haworth, Peel and Yates in 1750, consisting of a factory in Blackburn and a warehouse in Manchester. By this point, Peel had dropped the final 'e' from his surname, his reason being that \\"it was of no use, as it did not add to the sound\\". Calico printing Parsley Peel's house in Fish Lane, a possible site of his experiments Peel had gained a reputation for trying new methods within the industry, being one of the first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him to use it as a pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it. The exact nature of the discovery made by Peel is unclear. It is likely that it was a new method for using the acetate of lead as a dye-fixer (mordant). Another possibility is the use of metal engraving rather than wooden blocks to create the pattern. However it came to be, the pattern was named \\"Nancy's pattern\\" after Peel's daughter and was very popular ‚Äì leading to Robert Peel's nickname of \\"Parsley Peel\\". The company went on to be one of the first calico printers in Lancashire. Cotton manufacture Peel worked with one of his weavers, James Hargreaves, to investigate new technologies. In 1762, Peel and Hargreaves set up a carding machine, but decided against using it. When Hargreaves went on to invent the spinning jenny in 1764, Peel was keen to use the technology. He set them up in his factory at Stanhill where Hargreaves worked. In the spring of 1768, the spinning jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for job losses. The factories and Hargreaves' nearby house were the targets of a riot, destroying the spinning jennies within ‚Äì along with some of Peel's own inventions. In reaction, Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire. He decided on Burton-upon-Trent where he built three mills, including cutting a canal for one. In 1779, Peel's mill in Altham was caught in series of riots against machinery, specifically the carding machines and spinning jenny. Peel came to see the destruction as fortuitous, as he then turned to Richard Arkwright's carding \\"engine\\". By 1795, Peel's family run company, Peel & Co., was the largest in the cotton industry with twenty-three mills around the north west of England, fourteen more than their closest competitor. Personal life Peel was described as \\"a tall robust man\\" with reddish hair, cautious but shrewd, who led the family to fortune through perseverance and resolve. He married Elizabeth Haworth on 28 August 1744 and they had eight children, including Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet. Sir Robert Peel went on to father Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, the future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who helped to create the modern concept of a police force. Young Robert would visit Parsley Peel and his wife at their home in Ardwick. Douglas Hurd noted that Parsley Peel was satisfied with his lot and did not expect to rise up the social ladder personally, though he hoped his children would. John Wesley said of him, \\"I was invited to breakfast at Bury by Mr Peel, a calico printer who a few years ago began with ¬£500 and is now supposed to have gained ¬£20,000. Oh, what a miracle if he lose not his own soul.\\" In 1794, Parsley Peel obtained the grant of a coat of arms, including a shuttle held by a lion, a bee signifying business and a new family motto Industria. Towards the end of his life, Peel started to lean heavily on a cane with a golden head. He lived out his final days in Ardwick Green, near his daughter. Peel died on 12 September 1795, and was buried in St John's Church, Manchester. His wife survived him by six months; one of her final wishes was to outlive her husband. He left his estate split equally between his eight children, valued at ¬£13,000 each (worth about ¬£1.1 million in 2013).Comparing standard of living between 1795 and 2013, the modern equivalent is about ¬£1,102,000 according to MeasuringWorth.com Notes References Notes Bibliography  * * Further reading * Category:English businesspeople Category:1795 deaths Category:1723 births Category:British textile industry businesspeople Category:People of the Industrial Revolution Category:People from Oswaldtwistle ","title":"Parsley Peel"},{"id":"39376267","text":"Parymenopus davisoni is an insect of the order Mantodea (mantises) from Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Thailand.

It was implemented in 2006 and was the highest windfall profits tax in the world. It was a tax on unsmelted copper and gold concentrate that was produced in Mongolia. The tax was repealed in 2009 and phased out over two years. Repealing the 68% tax law was considered essential to enable foreign mining companies to invest in mineral resources development of Mongolia.  Implementation  The tax was initially proposed to the State Great Khural (the Mongolian Parliament) in 2005, initially taxing copper and gold profits when their respective prices reach $2,600 per tonne and $500 per troy ounce. The bill passed in May 2006, a change to the law occurred in 2006 changing the gold price that would be taxed to $650 per ounce, and eventually to $850 per ounce. The tax rate was 68%, which was the highest in the world. The tax was implemented with the hopes that copper mining companies would smelt their copper within the country rather than shipping concentrate out as there would be no windfall tax if the material was smelted in Mongolia. The implementation of the tax was not anticipated by Vancouver-based Ivanhoe Mines, owners of the Oyu Tolgoi Project in Mongolia. Following the announcement by the government shares of Ivanhoe (traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange) dropped over 21% (or CA$2.22)). Opposition Ivanhoe made the case that addition of a smelter to the Oyu Tolgoi Project would increase the capital required to bring the project into production. Others suggested that the small scale independent miners would simply not report their full production to the government, or turn to smuggling to avoid the tax. There was opposition to the rate being established by the Mongol Bank by appointment of the government, and a claim that it was against the constitution. The Constitution Court of Mongolia later determined that this was not a violation. In 2009 the tax was repealed with a phase out period lasting until 2011. Repeal Rio Tinto and its partner Ivanhoe Mines made the scrapping of the tax a precondition to their signing an agreement to establish the Oyu Tolgoi mine, a major copper-gold mining project in the Gobi Desert. The government agreed to the removal of the tax in return for an increase in royalties from Oyu Tolgoi. The tax was repealed in early 2011, with Oyu Tolgoi commencing commercial production in 2013.

Early history The company was founded in 1787 by John Weiss, an Austrian, whose skill as master cutler and instrument maker were soon widely acknowledged. He received much recognition, including a Royal Warrant for his inventiveness and craftsmanship, being appointed ‚ÄúRazor Makers to the King‚Äù by William IV, and many of his instruments bore the Royal Arms on the handles. Weiss, born in 1773 in Rostock and baptised Johann Jacob Daniel Weiss, was the son of Georg Berend Jacob Weiss (1740‚Äì1803) and Anna Elisabeth Wamkross. Weiss married Mary Kirby on 5 May 1805 and they had two children Frederick Foveaux Weiss, baptised 10 May 1807, and Mary Weiss, baptised 21 January 1810. Weiss's father, Georg Berend Jacob Weiss, had served an apprenticeship in the cutlery trade and was admitted as Master Cutler to the Rostock Guild of Smiths in 1765. On moving to London, Weiss began making surgical instruments and in 1795 conducted business under the name of 'White'. The company's first catalogue was published in 1823 and listed a variety of greatly improved and newly invented instruments. By 1825, the catalogue had grown to 126 pages with detailed accounts of the instruments and recommendations by Benjamin Collins Brodie (1783‚Äì1862), Astley Cooper (1768‚Äì1841), Everard Home (1756‚Äì1832) and other notable surgeons. The catalogue also displayed a patented gastric pump described as a 'syringe for the extracting of poisons from the stomach'. The gastric pump was widely used in the first half of the 1800s and was acclaimed as a major development in the field. In 1826, Weiss visited relatives in Rostock and donated a collection of his instruments to the Rostock Town Council, together with a catalogue and gastric pump, all packed into two mahogany cases. The Rostock Council record of 25 August 1826 described Weiss as \\"the famous manufacturer\\" and resolved to designate him an honorary Freeman of Rostock. Weiss applied for British citizenship on 26 June 1826, having lived in England for some 31 years. He was granted the equivalent of 'permanent resident status' by King George IV on 11 October 1826, and later appointed 'Razor Maker to the King' under William IV. Weiss stamped the Royal Arms on many of the handles of his surgical instruments. Weiss' 1831 catalogue listed a novel limb saw designed to prevent clogging when amputating, and four types of spring fleam, part of his range of veterinary instruments. Weiss was a pioneer in producing veterinary instruments after the first veterinary colleges were established in London and Edinburgh. His son, Frederick Foveaux Weiss joined the company in 1831, which then became John Weiss & Son. On Weiss' death his considerable fortune took care of the needs of his widow, son, daughter, sister, stepsister, porter and coachman. Frederick Foveaux Weiss then took over management of the company. Weiss' original premises were at 42 Strand, London, and by 1836 at 62 Strand. By 1841 the business was styled John Weiss & Son, with Richard Williams being recorded as a partner. Another partnership of Frederick Foveaux Weiss, Alfred Markes, Henry Joseph Francis Hubert Foveaux, and Richard Williams dissolved in 1868-9, possibly because of Richard Williams' retirement or death. Markes and Foveaux both withdrew from the firm on 31 December 1871. Under the Patent Law Amendment Act of 1852, The London Gazette of March 15, 1861 page 1201, records \\"502. To Henry Joseph Francis Hubert Foveaux, of the Strand, in the city of Westminster, Surgical Instrument Manufacturer for the invention of improvements in specula, and in plugs used in connection therewith.\\", and again on January 19, 1872 page 205, \\"74. To Henry Joseph Francis Hubert Foveaux, of No. 62, Strand, in the county of Middlesex, Surgical Instrument Maker, for the invention of improvements in scissors.\\" The business in 1885, seemingly managed by Frederick Foveaux Weiss, moved to 287 Oxford Street in London and to 42 King Street in Manchester. In the 1980s the company's addresses were given as 11 Wigmore Street and 74 Banner Street, London. Death Weiss had a morbid fear of being buried alive, and to guard against this eventuality fashioned an instrument to penetrate his heart when the coffin was closed. Detailed instructions to this end were left in his will. John Weiss died on 26 December 1843 and was buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas' Church, Brighton with his surgeon Benjamin Vallance in attendance to carry out his wishes. Today The firm still operates under the name John Weiss & Son Ltd. and is based at Milton Keynes, forming part of the Haag- Streit Group of companies. In popular culture In \\"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\\" (1892), one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, a knife found on the crime scene is a surgical instrument marked Weiss & Co., London. Frederick's brother, the skin surgeon, Hubert Foveaux Weiss, died in 1892. In 1888, Weiss surgical knives were used by the serial killer, Jack the Ripper. Earlier, in 1882, they were the silent weapons of choice for the Phoenix Park assassins in Dublin.

Process Through the single virtual access point Science Gateway web portal, users login and access a ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù imaging laboratory. Here users can upload, use, and share algorithms for brain imaging analysis, have access to large neuroimaging datasets, and make computationally intensive analyses, all the time with specialized support and training. Thanks to distributed services and grid/cloud computational resources, analyses with neuGRID are much faster than traditional-style lab-based analyses. neuGRID's proof-of-concept was carried out in 2009 when an Alzheimer's disease biomarker (3D cortical thickness with Freesurfer and CIVET) was extracted from 6.500 MR scans in 2 weeks versus 5 years that it would have taken in a traditional setting.  History  neuGRID was first funded by the European Commission DG INFSO within the 7th Framework Program from 2008 to 2011. Here, the hardware and middleware infrastructure were developed. The second wave was funded in 2011 by the European Commission, now DG CONNECT, under the project neuGRID for you (N4U), with the main aim of expanding user services with more intuitive and graphical interfaces. N4U ended in April 2015.  Consortium  The initial neuGRID consortium involved 8 European partners from Italy, France, UK, Nederland, Sweden, Spain and Switzerland. N4U involved 9 European partners (6 of which already in neuGRID) and 2 North Americans. International partners have been involved thanks to a support action funded once more by DG INFSO (outGRID, http://www.outgrid.eu).

It was originally written as an open-source replacement for Cisco's proprietary AnyConnect SSL VPN client, which is supported by several Cisco routers. , the OpenConnect project also offers an AnyConnect-compatible server, ocserv,ocserv home page. and thus offers a full client-server VPN solution. The OpenConnect client added support for Juniper Networks' SSL VPN in version 7.05,. A fork then developed support for Palo Alto Networks' GlobalProtect VPN, which was included in the version 8.00 release. Protocols Cisco AnyConnect VPNs utilize TLS to authenticate and configure routing, then DTLS to efficiently encrypt and transport the tunneled VPN traffic, and can fall back to TLS-based transport where firewalls block UDP-based traffic. The DTLS protocol used by Cisco AnyConnect servers was based on a non-standard, pre-release draft of DTLS 1.0, until support for the DTLS 1.2 standard was added in 2018. OpenConnect and ocserv implement an extended version of the AnyConnect VPN protocol (which has been proposed as an Internet Standard), within an open- source project unaffiliated with Cisco. Both OpenConnect and ocserv strive to maintain seamless backwards-compatibility with Cisco AnyConnect servers and clients. The OpenConnect client also implements Juniper and GlobalProtect VPN protocols. These have a very similar structure to the AnyConnect protocol: they authenticate and configure routing over TLS, except that they use ESP for efficient, encrypted transport of tunneled traffic (instead of DTLS), but they too can fall back to TLS-based transport. Architecture The OpenConnect client is written primarily in C, and it contains much of the infrastructure necessary to add additional VPN protocols operating in a similar flow, and to connect to them via a common user interface: * Initial connection to the VPN server via TLS * Authentication phase via HTTPS (using HTML forms, client certificates, XML, etc.) * Server-provided routing configuration in a standard format that can be processed by a vpnc-script * Data transport phase via a UDP-based tunnel (DTLS or ESP), with fallback to a TLS-based tunnel ** Built- in event loop to handle Dead Peer Detection, keepalive, rekeying, etc. Platforms OpenConnect is available on Solaris, Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, MacOS, and has graphical user interface clients for Windows, GNOME, and KDE. A graphical client for OpenConnect is also available for Android devices, and it has been integrated into router firmware packages such as OpenWrt.

The Center is a partnership between the Russell Berrie Foundation and the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum). It operates as part of the Section for Ecumenism and Dialogue in the Theology Faculty of the Angelicum in Rome. Mission and history The mission of the John Paul II Center for Interreligious Dialogue is to build bridges between Christian and other religious traditions by promoting interreligious study and dialogue locally in Rome and on the global level through academic study and formation for religious leadership and dialogue in life and action. The Center was opened in 2010 after an agreement was reached between the Angelicum and the Russell Berrie Foundation, based on several years of close collaboration between two of the Angelicum faculty, Rev. Frederick M. Bliss, SM, then-director of the Ecumenical Section of the Theology Faculty, and Rabbi Jack Bemporad, director of the Center for Interreligious Understanding, in New Jersey. Dedicated to John Paul II The most famous alumnus of the Angelicum is Karol Wojty≈Ça ‚Äì Pope John Paul II ‚Äì who earned a doctorate of philosophy there in the late 1940s. As a child, Karol Wojtyla forged close relationships with Jewish families in his Polish hometown, witnessed first hand the horrors of the Second World War and Soviet communism, and was deeply influenced in his studies by Jewish philosophers Martin Buber and Emmanuel Levinas. All of these life events contributed to his commitment to interreligious bridge building. As bishop of Rome, Pope John Paul II was a tireless advocate for interreligious dialogue, and lead the Catholic Church in its implementation of the Vatican Council II documents Nostra aetate and Dignitatis humanae, including profound work for the healing of memories, outreach to the Jewish community, and establishing the Assisi interreligious day of prayer for peace. Pope John Paul II died on 2 April 2005, after nearly 27 years as bishop of Rome. He was beatified on 1 May 2011 at St. Peter‚Äôs Square in Rome, at a ceremony attended by approximately 2 million people, including representatives of the John Paul II Center. Programs The Center operates under the auspices of the Ecumenical Section in the Faculty of Theology, but serves as a resource for all faculty, students and guests of the university on interreligious issues and subjects. The Center provides support for the visiting faculty and students in its various programs, which include the following. Russell Berrie fellowship in interreligious studies The Russell Berrie Fellowship in Interreligious Studies is designed to provide current and future religious leadership with a comprehensive understanding of and dedication to interreligious ideas, issues, and concerns. The Fellowship invites religious leaders ‚Äì whether ordained, religious, or lay ‚Äì to spend a year in Rome studying at the Angelicum for a Certificate in Interreligious Studies, participate in a seminar and study tour in Israel, and in a number of specialized courses and extracurricular activities. The Fellowship is the only ‚Äúfull-ride‚Äù scholarship available for most students at the pontifical universities in Rome, as it covers tuition, room and board, books and travel expenses. As of the 2014-2015 academic year, seven cohorts of Fellows have been admitted to the program, which began with the 2008-2009 academic year. There have been 60 Fellows from 23 countries and all six inhabited continents.

Annual Pope John Paul II lecture on interreligious understanding One of the largest and most high-profile events of the Angelicum each year since 2008 has been the Pope John Paul II Lecture on Interreligious Understanding. Globally-recognized religious leaders and academics have been invited each spring to offer insights into contemporary developments in interreligious dialogue. * 2008: Archbishop Donald Wuerl, Washington, DC, USA ‚ÄúUnifying Threads among World Religions: The Common Ground in Search for World Peace‚Äù * 2009: Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich, Warsaw, Poland ‚ÄúA Rabbi‚Äôs Reflection on the Teachings of John Paul II‚Äù * 2010: Prof. Mona Siddiqui, OBE, University of Glasgow, Scotland ‚ÄúIslamic Perspectives on Judaism and Christianity‚Äù * 2011: Prof. David F.

The courses they offer are intensive, ranging from 1.5 ects 8-day courses, to 3.0 ects 15-day courses. The professors are chosen by the Center‚Äôs Academic Committee. Recent visiting professors have included: * Prof. Adam Afterman, Shalom Hartman Institute, Israel * Rabbi Prof. Jack Bemporad, Center for Interreligious Understanding, New Jersey * Prof. Marshall Breger, The Catholic University of America, Washington, DC * Prof. Moshe Idel, Hebrew University, Israel * Prof. Israel Knohl, Hebrew University, Israel * Prof. Menachem Lorberbaum, Tel Aviv University, Israel * Prof. Mona Siddiqui, University of Edinburgh, Scotland * Prof. Josef Stern, University of Chicago, Illinois Certificate in interreligious studies A postgraduate diploma, the Certificate in Interreligious Studies is offered through the Ecumenical Section of the Faculty of Theology at the Angelicum as an opportunity for students who do not qualify for regular admission to the STL program (usually because their education came from outside the pontifical system) to enroll as students in the field of Interreligious Studies, or as a post-doctoral or sabbatical year of study. The focus of the certificate is on methodological issues in dealing with the philosophy, theology, and sociology of religion, and the teaching of the Catholic Church in relation to interreligious dialogue and other religions. In total, the Certificate represents 14 lecture courses and two seminars totaling 50 ects, plus the redaction of an integrative final paper worth 10 ects, for a total of 60 ects. The program has four areas of study: * Introduction and methodology (philosophy, hermeneutics, social sciences, anthropology of dialogue, method) 3 courses * History (world religions, new religious movements) 2 courses * Systematic (biblical themes, ecclesiology, theology/philosophy of religion, ethics) 8 courses * Practical (spirituality/mysticism, ecumenical and interreligious commissions, catechesis) 1 course Sponsor organizations The Russell Berrie Foundation has as one of its primary philanthropic initiatives the support and promotion of a Jewish Renaissance. This commitment reflects a value of ‚Äúcreating a world where people of all faiths can respect each other‚Äôs differences and positively impact trans-denominational and interreligious understanding in future generations.‚Äù It states as one of its goals, in this regard, to ‚Äúfoster interreligious understanding between Jews, Catholic Christians and those of other faiths.‚Äù The Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome (Angelicum), as a pontifical university, is ‚Äúconcerned particularly with Christian revelation and questions connected therewith and which are therefore more closely connected with her mission of evangelization.‚ÄùPope John Paul II, Sapienza Cristiana, 3 This mission is a ‚Äúsingle but complex and articulated reality‚Äù that principally includes ‚Äúpresence and witness; commitment to social development and human liberation; liturgical life, prayer and contemplation; interreligious dialogue; and finally, proclamation and catechesis.‚ÄùPontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, The Attitude of the Church Towards the Followers of Other Religions: Reflections and Orientations on Dialogue and Mission, 1984 Proclamation and dialogue are thus both viewed, each in its own place, as component elements and authentic forms of the one evangelizing mission of the Church.Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, Dialogue and Proclamation, 2 The tasks of such an ecclesiastical university are to prepare students for pastoral ministry, teaching, and the ‚Äúmore arduous tasks of the apostolate‚Äù. This is accomplished through scientific research, the formation of students, and collaboration with the local and universal church in the whole work of evangelization.Pope John Paul II, Sapienza Cristiana, General Norms, Section I, Article 3 Leadership and staff The governing body of the John Paul II Center is a committee made of representatives of the Russell Berrie Foundation and of the Angelicum (usually the theology dean and the academic adviser), and the director of the center.

University courses on literature and environmental issues may include climate change fiction in their syllabi. This body of literature has been discussed by a variety of publications, including The New York Times, The Guardian, and Dissent magazine, among other international media outlets. History Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake series is an often cited dystopian novel in ecocriticism. The term \\"cli-fi\\" first came into use on April 20, 2013 when NPR did a five-minute radio segment by Angela Evancie on Weekend Edition Saturday to describe novels and movies that deal with human- induced climate change, and historically, there have been any number of literary works that dealt with climate change in earlier times as well. Dan Bloom has been an influential figure in the development of \\"cli-fi\\" as a distinct genre.Milner A and Burgmann JR. Cli-Fi Climate Fiction and Climate Change, Monash University https://www.monash.edu/mcccrh/projects/climate- fiction Jules Verne's 1889 novel The Purchase of the North Pole imagines climate change due to tilting of Earth's axis. In his posthumous Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1883 and set during the 1960s, the titular city experiences a sudden drop in temperature, which lasts for three years.Arthur B. Evans, \\"The 'New' Jules Verne\\". Science‚Äìfiction Studies, XXII:1 no. 65 (March 1995), pp. 35-46. and Brian Taves, \\"Jules Verne's Paris in the Twentieth Century\\". Science Fiction Studie no. 71, Volume 24, Part 1, March 1997. Several well-known dystopian works by British author J. G. Ballard deal with climate-related natural disasters: In The Wind from Nowhere (1961), civilization is reduced by persistent hurricane-force winds, and The Drowned World (1962) describes a future of melted ice-caps and rising sea-levels caused by solar radiation. In The Burning World (1964, later called The Drought) his climate catastrophe is human-made, a drought due to disruption of the precipitation cycle by industrial pollution..http://www.jgballard.ca/criticism/milicia_drought1985.html As scientific knowledge of the effects of fossil fuel consumption and resulting increase in atmospheric concentrations entered the public and political arena as \\"global warming\\", fiction about the problems of human-induced global warming began to appear. Susan M. Gaines's Carbon Dreams was an early example of a literary novel that \\"tells a story about the devastatingly serious issue of human-induced climate change,\\" set in the 1980s and published before the term \\"cli-fi\\" was coined.Wilson, Elizabeth K. \\"Novelist Combines CO2 and Romance\\", Chemical and Engineering News, June 4, 2001. Michael Crichton's State of Fear (2004), a techno-thriller portrays climate change as \\"a vast pseudo-scientific hoax\\" and is critical of scientific opinion on climate change.Slovic, Scott. \\"Science, Eloquence, and the Asymmetry of Trust: What‚Äôs at Stake in Climate Change Fiction\\" Green Theory & Praxis: The Journal of Ecopedagogy Volume 4, No. 1 (2008) ISSN 1941-0948 doi: 10.3903/gtp.2008.1.6 100 Margaret Atwood explored the subject in her dystopian trilogy Oryx and Crake (2003), The Year of the Flood (2009) and MaddAddam (2013). In Oryx and Crake Atwood presents a world where \\"social inequality, genetic technology and catastrophic climate change, has finally culminated in some apocalyptic event\\". The novel's protagonist, Jimmy, lives in a \\"world split between corporate compounds\\", gated communities that have grown into city-states and pleeblands, which are \\"unsafe, populous and polluted\\" urban areas where the working classes live.Publishers Weekly/ Cultural critic Josephine Livingston at The New Republic: \\"From Jeff Vandermeer‚Äôs Annihilation to Nathaniel Rich‚Äôs Odds Against Tomorrow, the last decade has seen such a steep rise in sophisticated 'cli-fi' that some literary publications now devote whole verticals to it. With such various and fertile imaginations at work on the same topic, whether in fiction or nonfiction, the challenge facing the environmental writer now is standing out from the crowd (not to mention the headlines).\\" Prominent examples The popular science-fiction novelist Kim Stanley Robinson focused on the theme in his Science in the Capital trilogy, which is set in the near future and includes Forty Signs of Rain (2004), Fifty Degrees Below (2005), and Sixty Days and Counting (2007). Robert K. J. Killheffer in his review for Fantasy & Science Fiction said \\"Forty Signs of Rain is a fascinating depiction of the workings of science and politics, and an urgent call to readers to confront the threat of climate change.\\" Robinson's climate-themed novel, titled New York 2140, was published in March 2017. It gives a complex portrait of a coastal city that is partly underwater and yet has successfully adapted to climate change in its culture and ecology. Kim Stanley Robinson's science fiction works frequently include society's response to climate change. Ian McEwan's Solar (2010) follows the story of a physicist who discovers a way to fight climate change after managing to derive power from artificial photosynthesis. The Stone Gods (2007) by Jeanette Winterson is set on the fictional planet Orbus, a world very like Earth, running out of resources and suffering from the severe effects of climate change. Inhabitants of Orbus hope to take advantage of possibilities offered by a newly discovered planet, Planet Blue, which appears perfect for human life. Barbara Kingsolver's novel, Flight Behavior (2012), employs environmental themes and highlights the potential effects of global warming on the monarch butterfly. Devolution of a Species by M.E. Ellington focuses on the Gaia hypothesis, and describes the Earth as a single living organism fighting back against humankind. Other authors who have used this subject matter include: * British author J. G. Ballard used the setting of apocalyptic climate changes in his first science fiction novels. In The Wind from Nowhere (1961) civilisation is reduced by persistent hurricane-force winds. The Drowned World (1962) describes a future of melted ice-caps and rising sea- levels, caused by solar radiation, creating a landscape mirroring the collective unconscious desires of the main characters. In The Burning World (1964) a surrealistic psychological landscape is formed by drought due to industrial pollution disrupting the precipitation cycle. * Mother of Storms (1994) by John Barnes describes a catastrophic, rapid climate and weather change brought on by a nuclear explosion releasing clathrate compounds from the ocean floor, based on the clathrate gun hypothesis. * The Carbon Diaries: 2015 by Saci Lloyd is set in a future where power is scarce and the UK has just begun carbon rationing. The story is told in diary form by Laura Brown, a teenager living in London in the aftermath of The Great Storm. * Far North (2009) by Marcel Theroux, in which the world is largely uninhabitable due to climate change. However, the novel implies that scientists got it wrong and that it was our actions combating global warming that irrevocably altered the climate. * Arctic Drift (2008) by Clive Cussler and Dirk Cussler.

Influence  Many journalists, literary critics, and scholars and have speculated about the potential influence of climate fiction on the beliefs of its readers. To date, two empirical studies have examined this question. One found that readers of climate fiction \\"are younger, more liberal, and more concerned about climate change than nonreaders,\\" and that climate fiction \\"reminds concerned readers of the severity of climate change while impelling them to imagine environmental futures and consider the impact of climate change on human and nonhuman life. However, the actions that resulted from readers‚Äô heightened consciousness reveal that awareness is only as valuable as the cultural messages about possible actions to take that are in circulation. Moreover, the responses of some readers suggest that works of climate fiction might lead some people to associate climate change with intensely negative emotions, which could prove counterproductive to efforts at environmental engagement or persuasion.\\" Another empirical study, focused on the novel The Water Knife, found that cautionary climate fiction set in a dystopic future can be effective at educating readers about climate injustice and leading readers to empathize with the victims of climate change, including environmental migrants. However, its results suggest that dystopic climate narratives might lead to support for reactionary responses to climate change. Based on this result, it cautioned that ‚Äúnot all climate fiction is progressive,‚Äù despite the hopes of many authors, critics, and readers.

During a dinner meeting the two begin to talk to each other, and soon begin a passionate affair, with Jess keeping it a secret from Sara. A week before Thanksgiving Jess and Alex meet at a hotel in Chicago and have sex, after which Alex admits that he has fallen in love with Jess, but has decided to go back to Atlanta where his children are, which breaks Jess' heart. During Thanksgiving, Jess begins to feel sick and secretly buys a pregnancy test from the pharmacy.

Sequel  A sequel to Sex and the Single Mom, entitled More Sex and the Single Mom, was released in 2005 with O'Grady reprising her role as Jess.

Her daughter Sara just turn 18 and will be heading to college soon.

The next night Alex, Jess, and Steve go out to dinner together at a restaurant to discuss Jake to which doesn't go well as Alex mentions he wishes he could sit next to Jess much to Steve's horror but eventually they come up with a shared custody agreement with Alex coming and taking Jake with him every month. A few days Later Jess takes Jake to a peting zoo and introduces Jake to Alex as his father and the 3 of them feed animals together and then afterwards Alex tells Jake he loves him and that he'll see him again next month. When Jess gets home she finds Steve who tells her he's furious about what happened at dinner a few nights ago and believes Jess is in love with Alex but Jess tells him that she's not in love with Alex but Steve doesn't believes her and also reveals that he somehow unknowingly found out that Jess and Alex had sex together in her bedroom. Jess tells Steve that it didn't mean anything to her but Steve still refuses to believe her and breaks off the engagement with her. The next day Jess tells Sarah about Steve breaking up with her but Sarah manages to comfort her by saying that she does think that Alex truly loves her and after some encouragement from Sarah Jess rushes to the airport and stops Alex from leaving to go back to Atlanta and the pair confess their love for each other as the film ends. In an interview with The Tuscaloosa News, O'Grady admitted that she had been \\"pleasantly surprised\\" when informed that there would be a sequel and stated that the ending of the second film left the door open for future sequels.

The book examines the nature of Christian theology as interpreted in Asia. Description In his book, Song examines the Chinese understanding of Christology in the Incarnation and the Paschal Mystery, which are the foundations of Christian faith. He attempts to expand the horizons of western theology through the use of the thoughts and experiences of people in Asia, and to decrypt the life of Asians in order to see the saving presence of God in their history and culture. According to Song \\"if you want to engage in theological decoding these codes, signs, and symbols ... we need to deepen our theological imagination and enhance its power.\\" Song uses poetry, traditional stories, symbols and rites to show how the peoples of Asia formulate the questions of life as well as socio-political and religious issues. Using these forms of communication, he shows the history of a compassionate God in Jesus. Asian theology is based on the terms of the relationship between God and the suffering of humanity. Using this vision of theology Song leads his readers through the kingdom of God, the Lord's Supper, and the God of mercy. Yeow Choo Lak, writing in a review of Theology from the Womb of Asia, called it \\"A breath of fresh air to liven up traditional theology,\\" noting Song's use of original reflections and observations of life in close relationships traditional theological.

A. Russell is the historic US army base bachelor officer quarters, officers club, and grand ballroom near Marfa, Texas; it was active from 1911 to 1946. Building 98 is Located at Fort David A. Russell's central fort complex. It is a project of the International Woman's Foundation and it is the home of the World War II German prisoners of war POW murals. Murals The murals were painted in the state dining room and in the base library. They encompass over 3,048 square feet of wall space, making them a unique historic national treasure. The murals were completed in 1945 by Hans J√ºrgen Press and Robert Humpel, both German prisoners of war held at the base. The artist and writer Hans J√ºrgen Press was a sailplane (glider) pilot based in France during the war, and departed Building 98 in 1945; While there he created two west Texas watercolors of local residents ‚Äî one performing a Spanish dance and another playing the Spanish guitar. Building 98 stands as a testimony to Marfa's long standing history in the arts. West Texas regionalism has a history in Texas dating back to the cattle drive, of which Marfa had many. History In 1911 the United States Cavalry occupied the building where it served as the Bachelor Officer Quarters (BOQ) and as an entertainment center for West point Officers during World War I and the Mexican Revolution. The fort was established to protect local ranches and town citizens during dangerous times along the Texas and Mexico border. Building 98 also faced the main fort parade grounds and was the location of the original camp Albert's command headquarters. Also housed at Building 98 was the fort officer's mess which had a full-time chef and large dining room. Building 98 also features a World War II ASM-N-2 BAT Glide Bomb cart from the original air base. In 1949, the historic base was sold to J. Alfred Roosevelt. The International Woman's Foundation was responsible for placing Fort D. A. Russell on the National Register of Historic Places and for listing the base at the Texas Historical Commission, a long time dream of Roosevelt who had lived at the complex. The International Woman's Foundation has operated an artist in residency program and Camp Marfa fort museum since 2002. In 2002 Mona Blocker Garcia took on the task of creating the foundation for mature woman artists and healthful aging thus preserving the important history of Fort D. A. Russell to its exact state when the fort closed. The George Sugarman courtyard is a permanent installation highlighted at the Building 98 metal sculpture garden Renovations The International Woman's Foundation has been authentically restoring the building to its original integrity and is responsible for Fort D. A. Russell being placed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Texas state historical society register of historic places. Major renovations began in 2002 with the complete replacement of the structures roof and outside integrity of the walls. Imphasis on floors, furnishings and ceilings are maintained with original features negating intrusive damages caused from modernization after 1949. The building also had serious damage that occurred after the great depression. Today the restored Building 98 museum is open to the public and a guided tour is available. Building 98 is one of Marfa's most important historic places with a rich history that has been brought back to life within its unique complex. Preserving the history of the original army camp for future generations allows Building 98 stand as an important resource to understand and appreciate the significant roles Texas has played during times past.Executive and founding director of the International Woman's Foundation Mona Blocker Garcia Art galleries Building 98 requires an artist in residence to exhibit their works and the foundation provides the Studio 98 galleries as a venue and hosts a reception in the historic officers club.

When formal diplomatic relationship ended, the Philippines decided to take over in managing the Chinese schools. As of now, the People's Republic of China has no intervention of local Chinese schools, except for bilaterial partnerships. However, the two countries established representative offices as de facto embassies, with Taiwan informally represented by the Pacific Economic and Cultural Center in Manila and the Philippines by the Asian Exchange Center in Taipei.The International Law of Recognition and the Status of the Republic of China, Hungdah Chiu in The United States and the Republic of China: Democratic Friends, Strategic Allies, and Economic Partners, Steven W. Mosher, Transaction Publishers, 1992, page 24 In December 1989, the Pacific Economic and Cultural Center was renamed the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines and the Asian Exchange Center was renamed the Manila Economic and Cultural Office. In August 2016, Taiwan's new government, headed by Tsai Ing- wen since May 2016, announced its New Southbound Policy shall focus on relations with the Philippines. Among the focal points for the Taiwan- Philippines cooperations are trade and investment, agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture, SMEs, ICT, climate change, education, and culture. The new policy was welcomed by the newly-elected government in 2016, amidst the new government's policy to pivot towards mainland China.https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3008642/how- philippine-president-rodrigo-dutertes-stubborn-pivot-china In 2017, the Philippines and Taiwan inked an updated investment deal in Makati, the Philippines‚Äô financial hub. The deal expanded to include the financial sector, infrastructure, and intellectual property of the two countries, far from a similar agreement in 1992 that only included the manufacturing sector. The two sides also signed six other deals as part of ministerial trade and economic consultations, including memoranda of understanding on ‚Äúgreen‚Äù energy, insurance industry supervision, and professional training. The PRC government filed protests against the Philippines to stop the agreements, nonetheless, the agreements were signed on schedule. A poll in 2017 noted a huge increase in Filipino support towards Taiwanese independence from mainland China. The Philippines also supports the membership of Taiwan in UNESCO, in recognition of Taiwan's holistic conservation of heritage sites. In January 2018, Taiwan provided aid to the Philippines to rehabilitate war-torn Marawi in Mindanao. Taiwan also sent its legislative speaker and numerous parliamentarians to the Philippines to further promote parliamentary exchanges and relations between the two nations. Bilateral relation The strong Taiwanese economy, particularly in the manufacturing industries, attracts cheap manual labor from the Philippines. Most Filipinos working in Taiwan work as factory workers, domestic workers, construction workers, fishermen and professionals, and they send a large part of their earnings to their families in the Philippines.Inquirer - Global Nation: Filipina for Filipinas in Taiwan Many Taiwanese men have also chosen Filipino women as brides through arranged marriages. An estimated 7,000 Filipino women now live there with their Taiwanese husbands. Filipino laborers in Taiwan are usually vulnerable to exploitation by their employers, a situation common to unskilled migrant workers all over the world. The Taiwanese government has been receptive to the cases involving mistreatment of Filipino workers in Taiwan. Filipino migrant caretakers in Taiwan have to go through a broker system that collects most of their monthly earnings, demands long work hours without overtime pay, and offers no days off. Some caretakers have to work for 24 hours a day. Home caretakers typically receive monthly salaries much lower than the standard set by the government because they are not covered by Taiwan's Labor Standards Act. Labor Rights for the Filipino workers have been recently improved in a very substantial manners by the Taiwanese government by pressuring their employers to offer increased wages. Nowadays, a high portion of Filipinos residing in Taiwan receive higher amount of wages in comparison with the local Taiwanese residents and the Taiwanese government has been providing excellent quality education to all Filipino children residing in the country. Taiwan- Philippines bilateral trade volume reached US$12 billion in 2013. In 2013, Taiwan's export to the Philippines totaled US$9.78 billion while Taiwan's import from the Philippines reached a total of US$2.2 billion.

The mutual interactions and exchanges in other areas like culture, education, agriculture and aquaculture are vibrant. Filipinos enjoy a visa-waiver from entering Taiwan for tourism and business purposes up to 14 days. This took effect November 1, 2017 and due to expire July 31, 2018 but was extended until July 31, 2019.

In May 2019, the Philippines constructed Filipino fishermen shelters on Mavulis Island, the northernmost island of the Philippines, to aid Filipino fishermen stranded during storms and to safeguard the area from poachers and illegal fishermen coming from foreign lands.https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1123967/fishers-shelter-unveiled-in- philippines-northernmost- islehttps://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/05/31/1922414/afp-mavulis-island- secure-foreign-poachers In September 2019, the officers involved in the 2013 incident between the two sides were convicted by court, ending the 7-year row.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/filipino-coastguards-convicted- killing-taiwanese-fisherman-190918053858625.html Spratly Islands, Scarborough Shoal, and United Nations Tribunal ruling The Philippines claims Scarborough Shoalhttps://www.rappler.com/thought- leaders/244680-analysis-scarborough-shoal-threat-centers-gravity-philippines and portions of the Spratly Islands through the 1734 internationally-published Velarde map recognized by a United Nations Tribunal,https://globalnation.inquirer.net/124398/to-support-claim-ph-to- submit-1734-maphttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/rare-map-that- bolstered-philippines-case-in-territorial-dispute-with-china-sold-for while Taiwan claims the entire South China Sea via the internationally- invalidatedhttps://globalnation.inquirer.net/140985/chinas-nine-dash-line- historic-rights-are-invalid-tribunalhttps://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo- way/2016/07/12/485666758/beijings-claims-to-south-china-sea-are-invalid- international-tribunal-says nine-dash line in a 1947 ROC-published map.Wu, Shicun (2013). Solving Disputes for Regional Cooperation and Development in the South China Sea: A Chinese Perspective. Chandos Asian Studies Series. Elsevier Reed. . In January 2013, the Philippines formally initiated arbitration proceedings against China's claim on the territories within the \\"nine-dash line\\" that includes Spratly Islands, which it said is \\"unlawful\\" under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). An arbitration tribunal was constituted under Annex VII of UNCLOS and it was decided in July 2013 that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) would function as registry and provide administrative duties in the proceedings. On 12 July 2016, the arbitrators of the tribunal of PCA agreed unanimously with the Philippines. They concluded in the award that there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources, hence there was \\"no legal basis for China to claim historic rights\\" over the nine-dash line. Accordingly, the PCA tribunal decision is ruled as final and non-appealable by either countries. The tribunal also criticized China's land reclamation projects and its construction of artificial islands in the Spratly Islands, saying that it had caused \\"severe harm to the coral reef environment\\". It also characterized Taiping Island and other features of the Spratly Islands as \\"rocks\\" under UNCLOS, and therefore are not entitled to a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. China however rejected the ruling, calling it \\"ill-founded\\". Taiwan, which currently administers Taiping Island and bases its claims on the invalidatedhttps://www.verafiles.org/articles/ph-wins-arbitral-court- invalidates-chinas-9-dash-line nine-dash line also rejected the ruling, while numerous countries supported the ruling & positively acknowledged it.

The acropolis is located near the centre of the city and is one of the most studied of Maya architectural complexes. Excavations were carried out from 1957 to 1969 by the University of Pennsylvania, directed by Edwin M. Shook and William Coe.Martin and Grube 2000, p. 43. The first traces of human activity at the site date to approximately 800 BC, with the first structures being built about 350 BC. Around 250 AD the complex underwent a major redevelopment with the construction of a massive basal platform that supported a cluster of temples; this was followed around AD 450 by the addition of a row of four pyramids on a terrace to the south of the main platform. A number of royal tombs have been excavated that have been identified with named kings, including the tombs of Yax Nuun Ayiin I (ruled AD 379- c. 404), Siyaj Chan K'awiil II (ruled 411-456), Wak Chan K'awiil (ruled 537-562) and \\"Animal Skull\\" (ruled c. 593-638).Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 32, 34, 38-40. An early tomb in the North Acropolis has been tentatively identified as that of the dynastic founder Yax Ehb' Xook (ruled c. 90). A large number of stone monuments were placed in the North Acropolis. By the 9th century AD these included 43 stelae and 30 altars; 18 of these monuments were sculpted with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits. A number of these monuments show the influence of the great city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. Development Map of the North Acropolis The earliest traces of working of the limestone bedrock under the basal platform of the acropolis date to about 800 BC, consisting of deep cuts into the rock associated with refuse from domestic and ceremonial activity.Loten 2003, p. 233. The first structures in what became the North Acropolis were built around 350 BC, towards the end of the Middle Preclassic period (c. 1000-300 BC).Martin and Grube 2000, p. 43. Coe 1999, p. 10. Late Preclassic period During the Late Preclassic (c. 300 BC - AD 250), a wide causeway was built to unite the North Acropolis with the Mundo Perdido complex to the southwest.Laporte 2003, p.288. Martin and Grube 2000, p. 24. The earliest dated architecture in the North Acropolis was built in the second century BC and consisted of a low basal platform to the north with two smaller platforms immediately to the south, which were forerunners of the triadic pyramid complex formed by the later Temples 22, 23 and 24.Loten 2003, pp. 233-235. These were not the first structures to be built since the remains of earlier versions of the platforms have been identified underneath but these suffered such extensive destruction prior to the building of the 2nd century BC version that no physical sequence can be reconstructed.Loten 2003, p. 234. In the 1st century AD the complex underwent a major expansion.Martin and Grube 2000, p. 26. At this time there was a gradual shift in focus from the major Preclassic Mundo Perdido complex to the North Acropolis, which was marked out as the new ceremonial centre of the city and received the first royal burials, so far not conclusively identified with named rulers.Fitzsimmons 2009, p. 112. Classic period During the Classic period (c. AD 250-900) the royal dynasty of Tikal developed the complex into a royal necropolis, with each successive ruler superimposing new temples over earlier structures. Around AD 250, the pre-existing architecture was demolished and a new basal platform was built, supporting four corbel-vaulted structures.Coe 1967, 1988, p. 43. Around AD 400 the complex was expanded southwards from its original basal platform with the addition of a row of tall pyramids that divided the original architecture from Tikal's main plaza. Towards the end of the 7th century, King Jasaw Chan K'awiil I ordered the construction of a new version Temple 33, possibly to house the remains of Nuun Ujol Chaak, his father. This new building completely blocked the entrance to the North Acropolis, formerly ending its role as the preferred burial ground of Tikal's kings.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 390-391. Around AD 734 king Jasaw Chan K'awiil was entombed in Temple I on the east side of the plaza, ending the tradition of interring rulers within the North Acropolis. Postclassic period Funerary activity continued as late as the Postclassic (c. 900-1525). Towards the end of Tikal's dwindling occupancy, during the 10th or 11th centuries, squatters were mining the North Acropolis in search of jade grave goods in the elite tombs; some of the easier-to-find burials were located and looted at this time.Martin and Grube 2000, p. 53. Structures View across the North Acropolis. At back: Temples 23, 20 and 22. Temple 26 is in the centre; Temple 32 dominates the foreground, with Temple 33 to its left. The North Acropolis closes off the Great Plaza on the north side.Harrison 2006, 2011, p. 221. The basal platform of the North Acropolis covers an area of just under ; measuring approximately .Drew 1999, p. 186. It stands above its bedrock foundation and above the Great Plaza, and is accessed by a number of stairways on its south side. During the Preclassic period, the facades of many of the temples were decorated with brightly coloured stucco ornamentation, including giant masks flanking some of the access stairways.Coe 1967, 1988, p. 41. By the Early Classic, eight temple- pyramids stood upon the platform, each with an access stairway flanked by masks, a small summit shrine and an elaborate roof comb. Basal platform Most of the structures upon the basal platform underwent two consecutive construction phases during the Early Classic, except Temple 22 which underwent three phases of construction. The structures upon the basal platform all date to the Early Classic period and were laid out in a symmetrical arrangement over the course of three centuries. This forms the greatest concentration of pure Early Classic architecture at Tikal, using construction methods distinct from that of the major Late Classic temples around the Great Plaza. The Early Classic construction involved the complete finishing of the basal platform as a distinct architectural unit before the additional structures were built upon it.Coe 1967, 1988, p. 44. Temple 20 (Structure 5D-20) is located upon the northwest corner of the basal platform and looks outwards to the north. It is estimated to date to approximately AD 550. Temple 21 (Structure 5D-21) forms a pair with Temple 20; it is located upon the northeast corner of the basal platform and also looks outwards to the north; it is thought to date to around AD 550. Temple 22 (Structure 5D-22) is a south-facing building located centrally on the north side of the basal platform.Coe 1967, 1988, pp. 42, 44. Temple 22 underwent three principal phases of construction. The earliest version of this structure was built around AD 250; a second version of the temple was built over it around AD 350; this version was decorated with giant stucco masks. The final version of the temple dates to the 5th century AD. Temple 22 has been extensively investigated by archaeologists with portions of the 5th-century architecture being stripped away to expose the earlier versions.Coe 1967, 1988, pp. 42-44. A tomb in the Temple 22 was looted at some point during the Postclassic period. Temple 22 Temple 23 (Structure 5D-23) has been partially restored and dates to the middle of the 3rd century AD. It is situated on the centre of the west side of the basal platform, facing east. Temple 24 (Structure 5D-24) dates to around AD 250. It forms a pair with Temple 23, being located on the east side of the basal platform, facing west. Temple 24 has not been explored by archaeologists. Temple 25 (Structure 5D-25) is located on the southwest corner of the basal platform; it was first built around AD 250 and underwent a second Early Classic construction phase that completely covered the earlier version. Temple 26 (Structure 5D-26) is the central building in the North Acropolis, located centrally on the south side of the basal platform overlooking the terrace; the earliest version of this structure dates to approximately AD 250. Temple 26 has been fully excavated and restored. A tomb in the structure was looted at some time during the Postclassic period. The northern portion of the structure stood over a Late Preclassic tomb (Burial 85) dated to around AD 100, which has been tentatively identified as that of dynastic founder Yax Ehb' Xook.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 302, 308. Temple 27 (Structure 5D-27) forms a pair with Temple 25. It is situated on the southeast corner of the basal platform. Archaeologists presume that this structure underwent the same two Early Classic construction phases as its twin. It was built around AD 250. Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is an unusual building at the top of an access stairway on the east side of the basal platform. It appears to have been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have become important when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access stairway from the Great Plaza.Coe 1990, p. 449. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).Coe 1964, p. 412. Terrace Giant mask from earliest version of Temple 33 (sub-3). This example adorned the pyramid base to the west of the stairway.Casta√±eda et al. 2009, pp. 362-363 A trio of small Early Classic temples (Temples 29 to 31) stand upon a common platform at the east end of the terrace, facing west.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 37, 43. Coe 1990, pp. 583-584. Coe 1962, p. 481. It is likely that the platform was purposely built to support the three temples that were built more-or-less simultaneously. Neither the platform nor the temples have been investigated; it is therefore possible that an early version of the central temple (Temple 30) was built first, then decommissioned with the platform being built to cover the early version, followed by the construction of a new version plus the two additional flanking temples. Temple 29 (Structure 5D-29) is located at the east end of the terrace of the North Acropolis, facing west. Stela 40 was excavated at its base in 1996.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 37, 43. Temple 29 is one of a trio of similar structures, with Temples 30 and 31. Temple 29 has not been excavated; the corbel vaulting and roof has collapsed to fill the three chambers of the superstructure with rubble. Of the trio of temples, Temple 29 is the only one to display traces of red paint. The basal platform of the temple stands high and the superstructure walls measure high. The building is believed to date to the Early Classic period (c. AD 250‚Äì600).Coe 1990, pp. 583-584. Temple 30 (Structure 5D-30) is at the east end of the terrace of the North Acropolis; it is one of a trio of similar structures. The roof and vaulting has collapsed, filling the three summit chambers with rubble.Coe 1990, p. 583. Temple 30 is estimated to date from the Early Classic (c. AD 250‚Äì600), based upon a stylistic comparison with other structures at Tikal. As with the other temples of the trio, the basal platform of the temple stands high and the superstructure walls measure high. Temple 31 (Structure 5D-31) is one of a trio of similar structures at the east end of the terrace, together with Temples 29 and 30. As with the other two temples of the trio, the summit superstructure had three chambers; these have been buried under the rubble resulting from the collapse of the vaulting and roof. The temple is believed to date to the Early Classic (c. AD 250‚Äì600). The height of the temple is identical to those of the other temples in the trio, with a basal platform measuring high and superstructure walls standing high. Temple 32 (Structure 5D-32) stands immediately to the east of Temple 33. It was partially investigated in the mid-1960s and dates to the first half of the 7th century AD. The temple shrine contained three large chambers, which were looted soon after the abandonment of the city in the 10th century.Coe 1967, 1988, pp. 48-49. Archaeologists discovered a tomb cut into the bedrock under the pyramid, which contained a royal burial (Burial 195). The pyramid was built over the tomb soon after the king's burial and consisted of a single construction phase.Coe 1967, 1988, p. 49. Temple 33 (Structure 5D-33) was the funerary pyramid of 5th-century king Siyaj Chan K'awiil II.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 34, 36, 43. It was centrally situated between Temples 32 and 34, in the front row of structures facing onto the Great Plaza;Coe 1967, 1988, p. 45. Martin and Grube 2000, p. 43. it is one of the most thoroughly explored temples in the entire Maya area.Coe 1967, 1988, pp. 45‚Äì46. Over the course of two centuries the temple underwent three construction phases; the final phase of development took place during the Tikal Hiatus, which lasted from AD 562 to 692.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 36, 40. The last construction phase of Temple 33 served as a prototype for Temple I on the Great Plaza.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 391. This final version of Temple 33 was controversially dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction.Coe 1967, 1988, p. 46. Berlin 1967, p. 241. Mesoweb. Temple 34 Temple 34 (Structure 5D-34) was the first pyramid to be built along the front terrace of the North Acropolis;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 33. it dates to the Early Classic period. The pyramid was built by Siyaj Chan K'awiil II over the tomb of his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin I. It was topped by a three chambered shrine with the rooms situated one behind the other.Miller 1999, p.32. Archaeologists cut a trench across Temple 34 in 1959 and discovered the tomb cut into the bedrock underneath, with two previous versions of the temple built over it. Stela 26 originally stood at the foot of this temple but was broken, probably at the beginning of the Late Classic period, and dragged up the temple steps and placed under a masonry altar within the summit shrine. The shrine was looted in the Postclassic period and the altar was broken at this time.Coe 1967, 1988, p. 45. Ceremonial fires for the burning of inanimate sacrifices were lit directly above Yax Nuun Ayiin's tomb well into the Late Classic period and may be indicative of continued ancestor worship centuries after the king's death.Fitzsimmons 2009, p. 135. Temple 35 (Structure 5D-35) was a tall Late Classic temple backing against the southwest corner of the basal platform.Coe 1967, 1988, p. 48. It is the westernmost of the row of pyramids facing south onto the Great Plaza; it has not been explored by archaeologists and is considered to be one of two likely locations for the tomb of 7th-century king Nuun Ujol Chaak.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 24, 42-43. Monuments Stela 4 depicts Yax Nuun Ayiin I in central Mexican-style costumeMartin and Grube 2000, pp. 32-33. A great many stelae were erected in the North Acropolis; by the 9th century AD there were a total of 43 stelae and 30 altars. Eighteen of these monuments were sculpted with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits. Stela 4 was erected by king Yax Nuun Ayiin I to celebrate the k'atun-ending of AD 396. It is one of two stelae from Yax Nuun Ayiin I's reign and was re-erected at the base of his funerary pyramid, Temple 34.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 33-34. The stela displays a mix of Maya and Teotihuacan qualities, and deities from both cultures. It has a portrait of the king with the Underworld Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexican Tlaloc under the other. His helmet is a simplified version of the Teotihuacan War Serpent. Unusually for Maya sculpture, but typically for Teotihuacan, Yax Nuun Ayiin is depicted with a frontal face, rather than in profile.Miller 1999, p.95. Stela 18 was one of two stelae erected by Yax Nuun Ayiin I to celebrate the k'atun- ending of AD 396. It was re-erected at the base of Temple 34, his funerary shrine. Stela 26 was found in the summit shrine of Temple 34, underneath a broken masonry altar. The monument had originally been erected at the base of the temple during the Early Classic period and was later broken, probably at the beginning of the Late Classic. Its remains were then interred within the temple shrine. Stela 31 is the upper portion of a monument that was broken and interred above the tomb of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II in Temple 33.Martin and Grube 2000 p. 36. Coe 1962, p. 495. It was dedicated in AD 445 and bears images of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II and his father Yax Nuun Ayiin I, who is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior on the sides of the monument. The back of the stela is sculpted with a long hieroglyphic text legitimising Siyaj Chan K'awiil II's dynasty.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 34-35. Stela 40 was found at the base of Temple 29. It has been dated to AD 468 and depicts 5th-century king K'an Chitam. He is holding up a Teotihuacan-style headdress in one hand. The sides of the monument are sculpted with depictions of his father, Siyaj Chan K'awill II, and his mother, Lady Ayiin. A lengthy hieroglyphic text on the back details his birth in 415, his promotion to a junior rank in 434 and his accession to the throne in 458, as well as a brief description of his father's reign.Martin and Grube 2000, p. 37. Altar 19 was buried in the fill of the final version of Temple 33, immediately in front of the second version of the summit shrine. It was badly damaged and was broken into several pieces, and the majority of a sculpture depicting a seated person was chipped away. The three fragments were buried together in a way that paired the altar with the buried Stela 31; this may have maintained a relationship between the monuments that existed when they were originally on public display. The altar was crafted from limestone and is now in the site museum at Tikal. It has been dated to approximately AD 445.O'Neil 2009, p. 127. Burials Ceramic effigy censer, representing a deity, found in Burial 10 Burial 10 was the tomb of late 4th-century king Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The tomb consists of a large chamber carved out of the bedrock beneath Temple 34. The remains of the king were interred upon a wooden bier and he was accompanied by nine human sacrifices and a headless caiman. The tomb contained a large quantity of grave goods, including an impressive array of ceramic vessels, many decorated with Teotihuacan-linked imagery. One ceramic drinking vessel bore the writing \\"the drinking vessel of the son of Spearthrower Owl\\". Five turtle shells of assorted sizes, some still attached to a rack, were the remains of a musical instrument similar to a marimba. A small jade ornament was also found, sculpted into the form of a caiman's head with a curled snout. The skull of the king was dyed red.Fitzsimmons 2009, p. 82. The association of caimans with the king's remains related to an element of the king's name; ayiin means \\"crocodile\\" and the animal may have been the king's way (spirit companion).Fitzsimmons 2009, p. 96. Burial 23 was a royal tomb inserted by destroying the second version of the access stairway of Temple 33. The individual interred within the tomb has not been identified but the tomb is one of two proposed locations for the burial of the late 7th-century king Nuun Ujol Chaak.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 36, 40, 43. The tomb was cut into the bedrock under the temple, to the south of the burial of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The king appears to have been hastily interred in a tomb that was still being prepared while the burial took place, since plaster from the walls was splashed on some of the grave goods and a flint pick was accidentally left behind by a workman.Fitzsimmons 2009, p. 74. The body of the king was laid upon a litter painted with cinnabar and overlain with jaguar-pelts; the corpse was laid out on the pelts and covered in layers of marine shells.Fitzsimmons 2009, p. 84. Burial 24 was an elite status burial inserted into the rubble core of Temple 33 during the final phase of the pyramid's construction. The tomb contained painted ceramic dishes that appear to name Nuun Ujol Chaak's father and grandfather, who both preceded him as rulers of the city.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 379. Effigy of K'awiil from Burial 195 Burial 48 was carved from the bedrock under the terrace, upon the central north-south axis of the North Acopolis directly under Temple 33;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 34-36. Shook and Kidder 1961, p. 2. it has been identified as the tomb of king Siyaj Chan K'awiil II.Martin and Grube 2000, p. 36. The remains of the king were flanked those of two juvenile human sacrifices; one of these was a child and one was an adolescent.Martin and Grube 2000, p. 35. Reents-Budet et al. 2004, p. 782. Shook and Kidder 1961, p. 2. The walls of the tomb were coated in stucco, onto which were painted hieroglyphs indicating that the tomb was sealed in March 457, a year after the king had died.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 35-36. Shook and Kidder 1961, p. 2. The king was interred bundled in a seated position and his remains lacked the skull, hands, and femurs.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 35-36. Fitzsimmons 2009, p. 167.

Burial 85 dates to the 1st century AD, in the Late Preclassic, and was enclosed by a platform, with a primitive corbel vault.Drew 1999, p.187. Coe 1999, p.75. It was the first royal burial that characterised the shift in ceremonial focus from the Mundo Perdido complex to the North Acropolis. The tomb was centrally located upon the north-south axis of the North Acropolis, under what would later become Temple 26, and contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its thighbones.Drew 1999, p.187. Coe 1999, p.75. Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 302, 308. The dynastic founder of Tikal, Yax Ehb' Xook, has been linked to this tomb, which lies deep in the heart of the North Acropolis.Drew 1999, p.187. The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle.Coe 1999, pp.75-6. The missing head was replaced by a small greenstone mask with shell-inlaid teeth and eyes and bearing a three-pointed royal headband.Drew 1999, p.187. Coe 1999, p.76. This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait of a king.Miller 1999, p.89. Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine, a spondylus shell and twenty-six ceramic vessels.Coe 1999, p.76. Burial 125 is another tomb that has been tentatively identified as that of dynastic founder Yax Ehb' Xook. It has been dated to around 90 AD. A cache was interred to the east that may contain the grave goods associated with this burial, since the remains themselves had no directly associated artefacts. The cache contained high status ceramics and jade, shell and bone artefacts.Fitzsimmons 2009, pp. 85, 112. The interment of this burial established a new central axis for the acropolis that was used as a point of reference for most of the royal burials up to the 8th century AD. Burial 195 was a corbel-vaulted chamber cut into the bedrock under Temple 32. It was the tomb of the ruler nicknamed \\"Animal Skull\\" by archaeologists, who ruled from the end of the 6th century AD through to at least 628. The remains of the king had been wrapped in cloth that had been dyed red. The tomb was flooded soon after it was sealed, leaving a thick layer of mud that dried to preserve the hollow forms of the king's burial offerings long after the wooden artefacts had rotted away. Archaeologists filled these hollows with plaster of Paris and were thus able to reconstruct many of the perishable items from the tomb, including four large carved panels depicting the king, a small throne decorated with hieroglyphs, a ballgame yoke and four stucco figurines of the deity K'awiil.Martin and Grube 2000, p. 41. Burial 200 was the 6th-century tomb of king Wak Chan K'awiil. It was a masonry tomb contained within Temple 22.Fitzsimmons 2009, pp. 192-193.

It is Uzbekistan's main cash crop, accounting for 17% of its exports in 2006.Uzbekistan in Numbers 2006, State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Tashkent, 2007 . With annual cotton production of about 1 million ton of fiber (4‚Äì5% of world production) and exports of 700,000-800,000 tons (10% of world exports), Uzbekistan is the 8th largest producer and the 11th largest exporter of cotton in the world. Cotton's nickname in Uzbekistan is \\"white gold\\" (oq oltin). The industry is state-controlled on a national level. Over one million public servants, employees of private businesses and children are involved in the harvesting of cotton. Many of these individuals are forced to labor in the cotton fields, receiving little or no pay. In an economy which is the 82nd largest in the world, the role of cotton is crucial for Uzbekistan. But its production has declined over the years. Cotton production peaked in 1988 to 8,000 bales and as of 2012 is around 4500 bales (1 million tons). The reason for this downward trend is attributed to the precedence given to cultivate food crops, an essential requirement. Its cotton exports are mainly to China, Bangladesh, Korea and Russia. Uzbekistan has launched a development effort to many manufacture cotton textiles through enhancing cotton processing chains and mills. The Uzbekistan cotton industry has also been affected by the boycotting of its cotton by many global companies after human rights reports revealed the working conditions in the country, child labor, and forced labor.http://www.triplepundit.com/2014/12/forced-labor-occuring-now- uzbekistans-cotton-fields/ History A man volunteering to harvest cotton, 2012 Cotton grown on Uzbekistan land was recorded nearly 2000 years ago by the Chinese. Production of cotton dramatically increased under Soviet Russian and the Uzbek SSR, with the Uzbek SSR accounting for 70% of Soviet production. The government strictly controlled the industry and introduced quotas to ensure efficient production at collective farms (kolkhozes). Between 1976 and 1983, the country's leadership defrauded the Soviet central bank by falsely inflating Uzbek cotton harvest yields, characterizing the \\"cotton scandal\\" as the most notorious scandal during the tenure of Sharof Rashidov; it resulted in discrediting the political elite of Uzbekistan. Since independence, the Soviet-style quotas have remained intact and the Uzbek government still dominate the national industry. Because of the risks associated with a one- crop economy as well as from considerations of food security for the population, Uzbekistan has been moving to diversify its production into cereals, while reducing cotton production. Thus, the area sown to cotton was reduced from 1.8 million hectares in 1990 to 1.4 million hectares in 2006, while the area under cereals increased from 1.0 million to 1.6 million hectares (in part at the expense of areas allocated to feed crops).Agriculture in Uzbekistan 2006, State Statistical Committee of Uzbekistan, Tashkent, 2007 . Another cause behind moves to diversify may be environmental, because the large quantities of irrigation and fertilization needed to produce cotton have contributed to the drying up of the Aral Sea and to the severe pollution of the soil in the surrounding areas. Farming Cotton is planted during April- early May and harvested in September. The plantation are concentrated in the periphery of Aydar Lake (near Bukhara) and also to some extent in Tashkent along the Syr Darya, and along the Amu Darya in the border area with Turkmenistan. During the year 2010‚Äì11, the area under cotton plantation was about 1.3 million hectares and the yield of lint reported was 752 kg/hectare. Okdare 6, Namangan 77 and Tashkent 6 are the common varieties of cotton planted in the country. However, while appreciating the need to introduce better high yielding and early maturing cotton, new varieties have been adopted since 2009; these varieties are: Bukhara 102, Bukhara 8, Andijan 35 and Khoresm 150. Most of cotton farms are irrigated but there is need to rehabilitate the water supply system to reduce water loss. Pests are suitably controlled with biological methods. Forced labour Forced child labour in cotton production is a practice in Uzbekistan, and the Uzbek government has long employed children as young as 9 in the industry. From a very young age, children are reared to look forward to harvest time, known as \\"pahta\\" and to enjoy harvesting the cotton as an \\"opportunity for them to contribute to their nation's prosperity\\". Many farmers are forced to produce cotton but the state reaps the profits for exporting it. If government workers and professionals refuse to work they can be penalised with a lower income and the child workers can be beaten. Anti-Slavery International describes the conditions of the cotton industry in the country as \\"appalling\\". The Cotton Campaign was established to improve human rights in Uzbekistan. They allege that the Karimov administration \\"detains, tortures, and exiles Uzbek citizens who call for recognition of human rights, violating their human rights and denying freedoms of speech and the press\\" and that the forced labour system in the country \\"violates the human rights of Uzbek citizens and condemns future generations to a cycle of poverty\\" and \\"blatantly violates the international convention against trafficking in persons and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\" The Cotton Campaign actively seeks for government change in respecting human rights and to permit the International Labour Organization to monitor production in the country. As a result of the human rights reports of misconduct in Uzbekistan, several companies such as H&M;, Tesco, IKEA, Adidas and Marks & Spencer have detached themselves and have proclaimed that they are doing all they can to avoid and boycott the use of Uzbekistani cotton in their products. Josefin Thorell, a spokeswoman for IKEA said \\"We do all we can to ensure that Uzbek cotton is not used in our products, but the traceability process for the cotton industry is not robust. In the case of, for example, Bangladesh, where much of the cotton used in manufacturing is traditionally from Uzbekistan, IKEA suppliers are required to buy from India.\\" In October 2014 Tesco signed the Responsible Sourcing Network's pledge not to source cotton from Uzbekistan. Giles Bolton, Responsible Sourcing Director at Tesco, said: \\"Tesco was one of the first retailers to ban the use of Uzbek cotton in the supply chain in 2007, and we are now very proud to be a signatory to the Cotton Pledge. Eliminating cotton picked with forced labor is a critical step in the responsible sourcing process.\\" In response to international pressure and the threat to the industry from the boycotting of its cotton, conditions in the country are gradually improving. In early 2012, Uzbekistani Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyayev (who has since succeeded Karimov to the presidency of Uzbekistan) issued a decree banning children from working in the cotton fields. However, many professionals including teachers, college lecturers, doctors and nurses are still forced to work in the fields at times of harvest. Now outlawed, the defoliant Butifos is responsible for exceptionally high infant mortality and birth defect rates among children born to women who work in the cotton fields. In December 2014, the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor issued by the U.S. Department of Labor reported that the cotton industry is still employing underage children and indentured labourers. Uzbek human rights activist Elena Urlaeva, who was arrested and detained in psychiatric hospitals in 2015, 2016 and 2017 for shedding a light on forced labour in the cotton industry, played a major role in the campaign to boycott Uzbek cotton.

He gave the first complete public performance of Ives's Concord Sonata in 1939, which became a turning point in the composer's public recognition. At the time of his death Kirkpatrick was a professor emeritus at Yale University, where he had also been the curator of the Charles Ives archives.Barron (11 November 1991) Life and career Early years Kirkpatrick was born on 18 March 1905 to John and Marguerite (n√©e Haviland) Kirkpatrick in New York City, where his father had a jewelry business.The Jewelers' Circular (1928). \\"Death of John Kirkpatrick\\", Vol. 92, p. 59 He was educated at Lawrenceville School before entering Princeton University in 1922 where he studied classics and then art history.Princeton Alumni Weekly (20 February 1953) p. 21; The John Kirkpatrick Papers, MSS 56 (At the time, Princeton did not have a music department.) In the summer of 1925 he traveled to France to study piano under Nadia Boulanger at The American Conservatory in Fontainebleau. He returned to Princeton for his final year but abandoned his studies in February 1926 to return to France.Perlis (2002) p. 58. He would remain there for the next five years, attending the √âcole normale de musique de Paris and studying piano with Boulanger, Camille Decreus, and Isidor Philipp at Fontainebleau and Louta Nouneberg in Paris.Slonimsky and Kuhn (2005) Kirkpatrick returned to the United States in 1931, living at first in Greenwich Village and supporting himself by teaching piano.The John Kirkpatrick Papers, MSS 56 He and Aaron Copland had been fellow students at Fonatainbleau, and on his return Kirkpatrick became part of the composer's artistic circle. He performed at the first Festival of Contemporary Music, organized by Copland at the Yaddo artists' colony in 1932 and went on to perform at Yaddo for the next 20 years, playing new works by Copland, Charles Ives, Robert Palmer, and Carl Ruggles.Page (2008) p. 37 The Concord Sonata Throughout the 1930s, and in addition to his performances at Yaddo, Kirkpatrick gave many recitals and lecture-recitals of 20th-century American composers' works, many of them world premieres. The most significant of these was on 20 January 1939, when he gave the first complete public performance of Charles Ives's Concord Sonata at Town Hall in New York City, playing the notoriously difficult and idiosyncratic piece entirely from memory.Block (1992) p. 1; Slonimsky and Kuhn (2005) Before the New York premiere, Kirkpatrick had tried out a complete performance at a semi-private lecture-recital in Cos Cob, Connecticut (also playing from memory). Paul Rosenfeld had written a favourable review of the Cos Cob performance in the journal Modern Music. Elliott Carter's was more mixed, but neither was widely circulated outside the relatively narrow readership of the journal. However, the New York performance marked the first time that Ives's work was reviewed by a prominent critic in the mainstream press, Lawrence Gilman of the New York Herald-Tribune. Gilman was unstinting in his praise of Ives, writing: > This sonata is exceptionally great music‚Äîit is, indeed, the greatest music > composed by an American, and the most deeply and essentially American in > impulse and implication.Quoted in Block (1992) p. 13 When Kirkpatrick gave a further performance of the sonata at the Town Hall the following month, it was reviewed by multiple mainstream publications, including Time, The New York Sun, and The New Yorker. It marked a turning point in the public recognition of Ives and his works.Block (1992) p. 13 It also marked a turning point in Kirkpatrick's own career, much of which was subsequently devoted to collaborating with Ives and documenting his work.  Marriage and the Cornell years In January 1940 Kirkpatrick met his future wife, the soprano Hope Miller, when he was engaged to replace her accompanist for a recital tour. The couple married in June of that year and in the early years of their marriage continued to give joint recitals. One of the most notable of these took place January 1943 at Town Hall in New York, when they gave the New York premieres of Aaron Copland's Piano Sonata and Roy Harris's \\"Evening Song\\" juxtaposed with works by Purcell, Bach and Beethoven.Perlis (2002) p. 64; New York Times (10 January 1943), p. 45 The recital was reviewed by Virgil Thomson in the New York Herald Tribune who wrote: > The beauty and variety of tone, the impeccable mechanism, and the noble, > architectonic conception were great pianism and great musicianship. It is > not customary to compare the work of local artists favorably with that of > the foreign-born great, but I cannot refrain from doing so in this case, > because it seemed to me that Mr. Kirkpatrick was playing the piano as it is > not often played by anybody.Quoted in Princeton Alumni Weekly (12 February > 1943), p. 16 From 1942 until 1943 Kirkpatrick was the head of the music department at Monticello College in Illinois (now Lewis and Clark Community College). He then served as an associate professor at Mt. Holyoke College until 1946 when he joined the faculty in the music department of Cornell University. He remained at Cornell until 1968, serving as the head of the music department from 1949 until 1953 and becoming a full professor in 1950. During his time there, he also continued his musical career, conducting the Sage Chapel Choir, (which he led from 1953 to 1957), in a performance of Arthur Honegger's Le roi David in a translation and arrangement by Kirkpatrick, giving recitals, and making several recordings of works by Charles Ives and other 20th-century American composers, including the premiere recordings of Ives's Concord Sonata and Carl Ruggles's Evocations.

The open source firm Defense Distributed designed the gun and released the plans on the Internet on May 6, 2013. The plans were downloaded over 100,000 times in the two days before the United States Department of State demanded that Defense Distributed retract the plans. The plans for the gun remain hosted across the Internet and are available at file sharing websites like The Pirate Bay and GitHub. On July 19, 2018 the United States Department of Justice reached a settlement with Defense Distributed, allowing the sale of plans for 3D-printed firearms online, beginning August 1, 2018. On July 31, 2018 President of the United States Donald Trump posted on Twitter about the decision to allow the online publication of the Liberator's files: ‚ÄúI am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn‚Äôt seem to make much sense!‚Äù On the same day the tweet was posted, a federal judge stopped the release of blueprints to make the Liberator due to it being an untraceable and undetectable 3D-printed plastic gun, citing safety concerns. Namesake and concept The pistol is named after the FP-45 Liberator, a single-shot pistol that George Hyde designed and that the Inland Manufacturing Division of the General Motors Corporation mass-produced for the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in World War II. The OSS intended to air drop the gun into occupied Europe for resistance forces to use. A project of the OSS, it is thought the Liberator was equally purposed as a tool of psychological warfare. Occupying forces in Europe would have to weigh evidence of distributed pistols as a factor in planning against civilian resistance, which would complicate their strategy and affect morale. However, though used in France, there is little proof that the pistols were ever dropped into occupied Europe in large quantities. The physible Liberator's release to the Internet can be understood as Defense Distributed's attempt to more successfully execute the historical psychological operation, and as a symbolic act supporting resistance to world governments. Withdrawal of plans and The Pirate Bay hosting Digital Liberator pistol by Defense Distributed Days after their publication, the United States Department of State's Office of Defense Trade Controls issued a letter to Defense Distributed demanding that it retract the Liberator plans from public availability. The State Department justified this demand by asserting the right to regulate the flow of technical data related to arms, and its role in enforcing the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. However, soon thereafter the design appeared on The Pirate Bay (TPB), which publicly stated its defense of the information. Quoted on TorrentFreak: \\"TPB has for close to 10 years been operating without taking down one single torrent due to pressure from the outside. And it will never start doing that.\\" The site would go on to issue a statement on its Facebook page: Reception Original copies of the Liberator have been permanently acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum, and a copy of the gun is on display at London's Science Museum. Writing in The Register, Lewis Page ridiculed the Liberator, stating \\"it isn't any more a gun than any other very short piece of plastic pipe is a \\"gun\\"\\", and comparing it with a 1950s zip gun. Usage history ATF test of 3-D printed firearm using ABS material ATF test of 3-D printed firearm using VisiJet material In May 2013, Finnish Yle TV2 current affairs programme Ajankohtainen kakkonen produced a Liberator handgun under the supervision of a licensed gunsmith and fired it under controlled conditions. During the experiment, the weapon shattered. It was later found that an error was made concerning the settings of the 3D printer. Israeli Channel 10 reporters built and tested a Liberator with a 9 mm cartridge, successfully hitting a target at a distance of several meters. On June 24, 2013, the reporters smuggled the gun (without barrel and ammunition) into the Israeli house of parliament, coming within a short distance of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. A Japanese man built five copies of the Liberator, and on or about April 12, 2014, he uploaded video evidence of his possession of the weapons to the internet. Authorities arrested him on May 8, 2014, and found that at least two of the copies possessed lethal power. Cody Wilson, a founder of Defense Distributed, stated on the incident that the man \\"performed his work in the open, without suspicion, fear or dishonor\\".

History  The origins of the band lay in the meeting of double bass player Ville M√§kinen (future \\"Mr. Willy\\"), native of Tampere, and two punk rock musicians, Nicky Rothen and Petri Torkell (future \\"Peter Cordell\\"), from the Northern Finnish town of Kemi in 2010 in Tampere. The decision to form a psychobilly band had been taken by the next year, and therefore Flesh Roxon had been formed by January 2012. During the first year of their existence, Flesh Roxon has been refining their act at live shows as well as in the studio. The band also performed at the 2012 Cosmic Puffin Festival on Mersea Island. The band's name had been chosen by vocalist and guitar player Nicky Rothen.  Style  Flesh Roxon's style combines psychobilly, metal and the tradition of horror punk, using morbid or violent imagery and lyrics influenced by horror films or science fiction B-movies. They had described their style as \\"zombie rock\\" and have professed their admiration for B-movies and George A. Romero's work. The video \\"Back From Your Grave\\" from their album Flesh to the Bone is inspired by the black and white horror films of the 1920-1940 period. In early October 2013, the latest version of the iOS and Android arcade game Zombie Road Trip by Noodlecake Studios featured a special Flesh Roxon bundle, consisting of a branded vehicle and chainsaw launcher gun and the songs \\"Lonely Rider\\" and \\"Suck My Chainsaw\\" from the debut album Flesh to the Bone. The update has been also advertised on the band's Facebook page and is available for free. On November 1, 2013, there was also released the Android arcade game Flesh Roxon‚Äôs Zombie Rock in which the three band members appear as enemy zombie characters with songs from the \\"Flesh To The Bone\\" album playing as background music.

The album got a very favorable review from Fearnet for their fast and muscular punk attitude, melodic purity and vocal harmonies. The video for the Lonely Rider song also got favorable reviews as a modern interpretation of the theme and style of B-grade horror films.

Nevertheless, the short-lived relationship had consequences that went beyond Le Corbusier's time in the USSR. Before his trip to Moscow, Le Corbusier was already an influential figure within the Soviet architecture profession. In 1922, Moisei Ginzburg, founder of the Constructivist movement, published materials from Le Corbusier's ‚ÄúTowards a New Architecture.‚Äù Corbusier's projects were frequently published and analyzed as examples for young Soviet architects. When Le Corbusier died in 1965, the official newspaper of the Soviet Union, Pravda, stated in its obituary, ‚ÄúModern architecture has lost its greatest master.‚Äù 1928 trip Tsentrosoyuz building In 1928, Le Corbusier was invited to participate in a closed competition, which included Peter Behrens, Max Taut, and the Vesnin brothers, for the new headquarters of the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives in Moscow. After winning the competition, Le Corbusier in October 1928 traveled to the Soviet Union to inspect the site for the Tsentrosoyuz building. Before his trip, Le Corbusie frequented the ‚ÄúAmis de Spartacus‚Äù film club, which projected banned Soviet avant-garde films, like Sergei Eisenstein‚Äôs Battleship Potemkin. When he arrived, Pravda heralded his arrival on its front page. It announced, ‚ÄúTo Moscow has come Le Corbusier, the most brilliant representative of today‚Äôs advanced architectural thought in Europe.‚ÄùCohen, 41 In Moscow, Le Corbusier gave a lecture at the Polytechnic Museum. He would later write of his trip in his diary, ‚ÄúMy works have passed the blockade. I am very well known, very popular. My lectures are held before a packed assembly.\\"Cohen, 42 While in the USSR, Le Corbusier had a young Moscow architecture student named Sergei Kozhin, a former assistant to Ivan Zholtovsky, as his official guide. Besides assisting the Swiss architect with the work for the commission of the Tsentrosoyuz, Kozhin would also introduce Le Corbusier to Russian society. Kozhin took Le Corbusier to the Russian countryside, to a village sixty-five kilometers from Moscow, where Le Corbusier had a first hand account of the conditions of the peripheries of Soviet society as well as traditional Russian wooden architecture. This face- to-face contact would later allow him to write off Soviet society as incapable and unprepared to appreciate modern architecture when his design for the Palace of the Soviets was rejected in 1932.Starr, 211 The Atmosphere of Moscow Le Corbusier left Moscow in 1928 with a positive view of the Soviet Union. Indeed, his time there would prove influential in the development of his own theories on architecture and urban planning. In 1930, in his Precisions on the Present: State of Architecture and City Planning, Le Corbusier included a report on his observations of Moscow, written en route back to Paris from Moscow. In this report, Le Corbusier reflects on the Five Year Plan and the ‚Äúgreen city‚Äù plan that the Constructivist architects had developed. The Five Year Plan required the development of many industrializing projects. Le Corbusier stated that it presented a battery firing modern technology. Moscow, as he saw it, was a factor for making plans. In his eyes, the development of plans for new buildings in the Soviet Union were being done through whatever means brought progress. Reflecting on the difference between the profession of architecture in Paris and Moscow, Le Corbusier highlights the superfluous involvement of the youth in the Soviet Union, while in France and other parts of Europe, academicism prohibited the youthful from the competitiveness of invention. With such youthful, inventive spirit, as Le Corbusier analyzes, the constructivist developed innovative planning schemes. The ‚Äúgreen town,‚Äù as he analyzes in ‚ÄúAtmosphere of Moscow,‚Äù was born out of the necessity of a rest period, introduced by the USSR as a response to the constant labor. The rest period would come on the fifth day of the week, in this way suppressing Sunday's traditional role. The green town was then created to provide the space in which such rest would be carried out. Capable of housing 100,000 people at once, the green town would in 15 days provide rest for the entire population of Moscow, (1.5 million), in accordance with the rotation of the rest period every 5 days. Additionally, the town would also house for periods of two weeks to a month city officials or workers taking their annual vacation. The city would also be a space for the ill ‚Äúfrom work‚Äù to find sanatoria. Beyond this, Le Corbusier also elaborates on the collaborative living that such a city requires: a collective farm would provide food for the entire city; people would live in hostel-type program with common rooms; people would be separated by age, providing different recreational programs for each group. These observations would later serve as the basis for his ‚ÄúResponse to Moscow,‚Äù as well as his elaboration of the Radiant City. Response to Moscow In 1931, Soviet officials inquired Le Corbusier's opinion on the reconstruction of the city of Moscow. While in Moscow in 1928, he had taken some quick, hidden (it was prohibited to draw in the streets for fear of espionage) sketches on the city and noted that its plan was ‚Äúthat of the age of the horse.‚Äù{Cohen, 127 At the packed conference held at the Polytechnic Museum, he had discussed the significance of city planning and the city's future, yet at the time Le Corbusier had not been interested in Moscow itself. After his trip, the Soviet Union seemed a central preoccupation. Le Corbusier responded with a 59-page report, ‚ÄúResponse to Moscow,‚Äù in which he sketched his ideas for the city. Unfortunately, his initial response is not yet available, hidden in private Russian collections. Nevertheless, his response to such inquiry produced the theoretical basis for Ville Radieuse, the Radiant City. That such an important concept for urbanism derived from Le Corbusier's answer to the Soviet questionnaire suggests the important imprint of the Soviet Union in his career. In his response, Le Corbusier developed a plan similar to that proposed by the constructivists for the Green Town. The collectivist spirit that the constructivist had envisioned for their own instantly seduced Le Corbusier, and he in turn implemented these to his own ideas of planning. Much like the Green Town of the Constructivists, in this radiant city for Moscow Le Corbusier utilized services communes, or communal facilities. In it, he also proposed the radical destruction of much of the historic center of Moscow, and advocated the creation of separate cities with separate functions, an idea he had already presented in Moscow during his 1928 trip there. Envisioning the new city with a ruthlessness that Haussmann would have envied, Le Corbusier placed upon the radial plan of the ancient city a roughly rectilinear organization comparable to his earlier tabula-rasa program of Villa Contemporaine. His ‚ÄúResponse to Moscow‚Äù was not fit for Soviet society, the authorities that reviewed the response believed. In the end, such a plan for Moscow was never carried out. Despite this, Le Corbusier did not abandon the project all together but rather used his documents on the project for his own personal ends. He later presented a modified version of his study to the CIAM, removing all references to the Soviet city, labeling it ‚ÄúVilla Radieuse.‚Äù Le Corbusier‚Äôs Palace of the Soviet Le Corbusier submitted designs for the competition for the Palace of the Soviets in 1931, which he lost and in effect would end his relationship with the Soviet Union. After he submitted his design for the first entry, Le Corbusier was informed that his submission had caused considerable stir. No winner was announced for this first round, but he was notified that as a formidable contestant in first entry his project would go on to the second round of the competition. With this, Le Corbusier had reasonable grounds to believe that his project would be among the finalists, if not the winner. But on February 28, 1932, when Boris Iofan‚Äôs neo-classical entry was announced as the winner of the second public competition by the Soviet judges, Le Corbusier was unprepared. Le Corbusier was outraged by the decision, and wrote letters illustrating such feelings, in effect only showing to the Soviet judges his great egotism. But, with the winner announced, it was evident that Le Corbusier‚Äôs modernist style was losing ground in the Soviet Union. Even the national newspaper, which only a few years earlier heralded his first visit to the city of Moscow, now mocked his design entry as a ‚Äúcongress hangar.‚ÄùNeumeyer The high modernism that young Soviet architects aspired to only a few years earlier was being replaced by a socialist realism best illustrated by neo-classical architecture. Le Corbusier's failure in this project, which in the eyes of the world marked a spectacular reversal in soviet architectural style, would prove to be his final dream and ultimate humiliation in his Moscow adventure.Cohen, 166 In the end, Le Corbusier's relationship with Russia would end in disappointment.

Formed by vocalist and guitarist Jared Mullins, the band released two albums, two EP's, one single, and three music videos. History Drummer Jared Mullins moved from Cleveland, Ohio to San Diego and began posting ads on Craigslist looking for a bass player. Joe Brooks responded. After Jared switched from playing drums to playing guitar and singing, the two formed Heavy Glow along with drummer Dave Rollans. At this time Mullins also began doing in-studio guitar tech work in Los Angeles. A chance meeting landed a role as guitar tech for Stevie Salas during recording sessions for Justin Timberlake and T.I. After hearing early demos Stevie Salas brought the band to Matt Sorum's private studio in Los Angeles to produce the band's first EP. The band shortly thereafter signed to Australian record label StockXChange Music Group/Sony Australia. FOX's television series The Good Guys used the track ‚ÄúGrinning in the Dark‚Äù in its second episode. StockXChange Music unexpectedly disbanded in early 2010 without compensating the band for EP sales. The band then independently recorded \\"The Filth & The Fury\\" in one, six-hour live studio recording session. Classic Rock Magazine UK distributed the song ‚ÄúHot Mess‚Äù in a sampler CD for its July issue. The Filth & The Fury was nominated for Best Rock Album of the Year at the 2010 San Diego Music Awards. After which time Mullins became a part-time spokesperson for RockStar Solos and did a promotional video with Stevie Salas and Ron Blair. In 2011 the band released their debut album Midnight Moan. In 2012 the band recorded a follow-up album with producers Michael Patterson Production Credits and Nic Jodoin. In July 2013, CBS used \\"Headhunter\\" in the second episode of the Stephen King series \\"Under The Dome.\\" The band's follow-up album, Pearls and Swine and Everything Fine, was released in 2014.

Pierre Hugo et autres, 04-15.543 Arr√™t n¬∞ 125 (Jan. 30, 2007) is a decision by the First Civil Chamber of the Cour de Cassation (the high court in France) which ruled that Fran√ßois C√©r√©sa's adaptations/sequels of Les Mis√©rables do not per se violate the droit moral of its author Victor Hugo and his estate. Droit moral originated in France,Rigamonti, Cyrill P. Deconstructing Moral Rights. 47 Harv. Int'l Law J. 353, 353-412 (2006). this case serves to limit the scope of that right and expand the public domain in French copyright law. This overruled and remanded to the lower appeals court, the Cour d'Appeal de Paris, which had declared a symbolic 1 Euro penalty, declaring that \\"no sequel can ever be added to so great a work as Les Mis√©rables\\".Sur l'arr√™t de la Cour d'appel de Paris du 31 mars 2004 : RIDA, oct. 2004, p.292, F.Pollaud-Dulian ; Com. com. √©lec. 2004, n¬∞50, C.Caron.  Background of the case  Ceresa wrote Cosette (titled ‚ÄúCosette ou le temps des illusions‚Äù in French) and Marius (French title ‚ÄúMarius ou le Fugitif‚Äù) in 2001, 136 years after Victor Hugo's death, and 149 years after the original publication of Les Mis√©rables. While the presumptive duration of copyright rights had expired, there remained a question of whether Hugo's heirs were entitled to rights under the theory of droit moral.Droit moral allows for rights to the author or their estate even after some rights have been assigned (Hugo's work was liberally assigned as evidenced by the numerous plays, movies and books based on the original work). Betsy Rosenblatt, Moral Rights Basics, Harvard Law School Cyber Law http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/moralprimer.html (last accessed May 13, 2013) This case was brought by Victor Hugo's great-great grandson Pierre Hugo (heirs are severally capable of bringing actions for droit moral under French law) and Soci√©t√© des gens de lettres alleging infringement by the publisher of both books Plon and their author C√©r√©sa. Hugo claimed damages of 675,000 Euro.\\"Les Miserables\\" la suite va √™tre rejug√©e en appel, Le Nouvel Observateur, http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/culture/20070130.OBS9636/les- miserables-la-suiteva-etre-rejugee-en-appel.html (last visited May 14, 2013). The droit moral, codified in French law under article L111-1 of the Intellectual Property code, provides for a non-marketable right enforceable against all by the author, corresponding with the embodiment of the self that is contained within each respective work. While the term of economic copyright in France was relatively settled, a conflict within this case was the duration of these non-economic rights which under a literally reading of L121-7-1 are indefinite. Distinguishing the economic from non-economic even outside the context of the Anglo-American IP construct is difficult.See http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6317941.stm (Pierre Hugo calling the sequels \\"money makers,\\" as if the problem were in fact the profits derived). This issue may even further complicate as the suit is brought by Hugo's great- great grandson, how pure are his artistic intentions towards his great-great grandfather's work? But see http://williampatry.blogspot.com/2007/02/two-from- europe.html  The Court's Decision  In a characteristically short opinion the Cour de Cassation addressed three issues. Whether (1) there was breach under typical copyright law or standing to bring the suit, (2) soci√©t√© des gens des lettres had standing as a voluntary third party to join the suit, and (3) Hugo's droit moral was violated (under L111-1, L121 & Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights) The court straightforwardly accepted that Pierre Hugo has the right to bring suit under French law but not under traditional copyright because those rights had expired in 1957 and grants Soci√©t√© des Gens des Lettres status. The Court made two rulings about Hugo's droit moral. First, since all of his rights under copyright had expired his estate's monopoly on the right of adaptation had expired and that while any adaptation may prejudice the droit moral of Victor Hugo to some extent, that was necessary because the term had expired. Second, that the appellate court failed to identify the specific mechanism by which Hugo's image was tarnished. The latter ruling (while it is explained below that on remand the court found no such tarnishing) leaves the possibility that if a specific injury could be identified there could be damages.  Right of Attribution  During the course of litigation, Pierre Hugo, trying to define his claim in layman's terms, stated \\"I don't mind adaptations and many are very good but this book is not an adaptation. I have read it and it is not badly written but the publishers used Victor Hugo's name and the titleLes Miserables as a commercial operation ... It was nothing to do with literature, they were just trying to make money.\\"Kim Willsher, The Guardian January 31, 2007 available at http://williampatry.blogspot.com/2007/02/two-from-europe.html (last visited May 13, 2013). While droit moral certainly extends beyond the US right of attribution this statement conflates the two. The Court's opinion provides a better distinction, although not entirely clear by ruling, \\"altering the vision of Hugo/alt√©r√© l'oeuvre de Victor Hugo\\" or giving birth to \\"a confusion as to the origin or the work/une confusion sur leur paternit√©\\".  Quality of the Work  Throughout the litigation the French Courts cite the importance of Hugo's work.\\"une v√©ritable monument de la litt√©rature mondiale, (... n'√©tant) pas un simple roman en ce qu'elle proc√®de d'une d√©marche philosophique et politique\\"/A vertiable monument of wordly literature, not an average piece of literature... Sur l'arr√™t de la Cour de cassation du 30 janvier 2007 : RIDA, avr. 2007, p.249, P.Sirinelli ; JCP-G, 2007, II, 10025, C.Caron ; GP, 2007, J, T.Lancrenon.\\" The only connection made, however, between the importance of the work and the scope of the protection that it deserved was the Cour d'Appel's concession that delineating the points of personality from the work was difficult. This analysis would be useful for more ordinary works, even ones which still enjoy protection from economic exploitation.  Transformativeness  Both parties argued that the sequels were transformative at the trial and first appellate level. Whereas Hugo's estate argued that the transformative nature diluted the protected essential personality of the work, Plon argued that the transformative nature was made it less likely that the work borrowed the essential, protected personality. While this issue was not addressed by the Cour de Cassation, it is an argument which may bear fruit in subsequent droit moral litigation.  Subsequent developments  Upon reexamination after the high court's remand the Appeals court concluded that C√©r√©sa's work did not interfere with Hugo's. The court further imputed that Hugo was not hostile to adaptations of his work,Sur l'arr√™t de la Cour d'appel de Paris du 19 d√©cembre 2008 : L√©gipresse, mars 2009, III, P.Allaeys. leaving open the possibility that a hostile author might have more rights. Representatives for Plon were quoted saying, ‚ÄúThis is a great success, and because of this books will continue to appear freely.\\" (\\"Les livres pourront continuer √† para√Ætre tout √† fait librement, c'est un grand succ√®s pour nous\\") As of May 2013, no subsequent suit has been filed with either the European Court of Human Rights or the European Court of Justice. Either court would have the power to overrule the French national courts, but it is unlikely either would find reason (either factual or legal) to do so.  Implications  Scholars believe this case opens the door in French courts for an inquiry into droit moral for any derivative work, whether or not is otherwise in the public domain.Roberta Kwall, The Soul of Creativity 43-44 (Stanford University Press 2010) However, the decision aids writers, filmmakers and playwrights in that it does serve to protect the public domain.Willsher, http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jan/31/books.france  See also  * * *  References  Category:French case law Category:Public domain Category:Copyright case law Category:2007 in France Category:2007 in case law Category:French copyright law Category:Les Mis√©rables ","title":"Soci√©t√© Plon et autres v.

It is the sequel to Story's 2012 film Think Like a Man, based on Steve Harvey's book Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man. The script was written by David A. Newman and Keith Merryman, with Will Packer returning as producer but now under his Will Packer Productions banner. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Michael Ealy, Meagan Good, Regina Hall, Terrence J, Taraji P. Henson, Romany Malco, Gabrielle Union, Jerry Ferrara, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Gary Owen and Kevin Hart, with Jennifer Lewis and La La Anthony in supporting roles. Think Like a Man Too was released on June 20, 2014 by Screen Gems. It grossed $70.2 million against a $24 million budget. Plot Cedric (Kevin Hart) begins by saying how Las Vegas has always been a place for casinos and showgirls, and is the perfect place for couples to get married. Cedric and his friends are all in Las Vegas for the wedding of Michael (Terrence J) and Candace (Regina Hall), with her son Duke (Caleel Harris) and mother (Angela Gibbs) joining them. Zeke (Romany Malco) and Mya (Meagan Good) arrive, with Zeke's womanizing past constantly being brought up by old friends and former flames, including the concierge at the hotel, who throws her drink in his face. Bennett (Gary Owen) and his wife Tish (Wendi McLendon-Covey) are trying to get a spark back in their marriage. Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and Kristen (Gabrielle Union) have married and are now trying for a baby. Dominic (Michael Ealy) and Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) are reunited after spending time away from each other, and they make out in the limousine. Finally, Cedric pulls up to the hotel in a gaudy sports car, happily getting away from his wife Gail (Wendy Williams). The men and women separate to enjoy their day. Cedric books himself a lavish suite and intends to go all out for a wild weekend. Michael's overbearing mother Loretta (Jenifer Lewis) doesn't approve of his engagement with Candace, still thinking no woman is good enough for her son. Loretta even takes over the bachelorette party duties, even though Lauren is the maid of honor. The women start to have a party for Candace, complete with their own blow-up doll (named Idris), until Loretta makes up her own party, which is boring. This, along with Candace's desire to have the perfect wedding, heaps on the stress. Among other problems plaguing the couples include Lauren being called by her boss Lee (Kelsey Grammer), who tells her she is being considered for a COO position in New York, meaning she will be separated from Dominic. Kristen tries to get Jeremy to have sex with her by roleplaying \\"Game of Thrones\\" characters, but Jeremy has reservations about becoming a father. He's also not thrilled about having to give up smoking weed, and he instead brought weed breath strips. Mya is ready to marry Zeke, but Zeke shows hesitation. While the ladies have to deal with Loretta, Lauren and Candace conspire to set her up with Candace's Uncle Eddie. Loretta takes the ladies out to dinner, and after plans to take Candace to see Dionne Warwick. Uncle Eddie (Dennis Haysbert) shows up and begins flirting with Loretta. The ladies leave them to go see Dionne Warwick together, so they can leave to have fun. Elsewhere, the guys are hitting the casinos, with Cedric trying to score as much as he can. They run into Michael's old frat brothers Isaac (Adam Brody) and Terrell (David Walton), who just want to party. Dominic is then pulled aside by a chef who offers him a position there in Vegas, which could possibly jumpstart his career. The ladies gives Tish a makeover and Mya giving her a black suit (complete with a montage) to undo her frumpy housewife look to a more alluring style. They then take the guys' party bus to the club, forcing the guys to either take a Chippendale-type bus, or walk. They choose the latter. On the bus, the ladies find Jeremy's weed strips and take them, while Lauren gets a call from her boss who officially makes her COO. Cedric finds himself in trouble when Gail finds out that he's been using her card to pay for his expenses, running her up to $40,000 in charges. He tries to win it back at the casino, putting it all on his \\"lucky number\\" 15. While his back turned, Zeke pulls the chips away to leave only one to spare Cedric the loss. However, the ball does land on 15, and Cedric is angry at Zeke. Meanwhile, the ladies start to feel the effects of dance clubs, and they end up making an impromptu video to Bell Biv DeVoe's \\"Poison\\". As a last resort, Cedric takes the guys to the club (the same one the ladies are at) for amateur's night, dressing in various costumes to try and win some money. This, however, turns into a disaster when Michael sees Candace getting a lap dance; he charges to attack the dancer, leading to an all-out fight between the guys, the ladies, and the dancers. They are all put in jail for the night. Realizing that the wedding is in a few hours, they all try to call someone for help, but with no luck: Loretta is busy spending the night with Eddie in her room; Gail is already shacking up with Drake (who appears as himself); Bennett's mother has gone to pick up his kid. Jeremy sees the way he talks to his child, and is influenced to become a father. The guys blame Cedric for getting them into this mess. Loretta sees the messages on her phone and rushes to bail them out. Everybody rushes to the venue for the wedding, but they are too late, and their spot has been taken; Candace runs away crying, and Michael leaves without a word. The couples decide to resolve their problems, except for Bennett and Tish. Jeremy decides that he's finally committed to being a father, and Kristen reveals she might be pregnant (though she claims to be a week late), bringing the two closer. Dominic and Lauren admit that they were considered for good jobs, but they each turned them down so they could be together. Zeke explains and apologizes to Mya for everything that's been going on, and finally proposes to her; Mya accepts. Loretta is unable to find Michael and looks for him in Candace's room. She tells Candace maybe it was for the best and that if she really loves her son, she would finish packing and leave him, making Candace more overwhelmed and fed up. Michael walks in on this and has become fed up with his mother and decides to show tough love and tells his mother that she must apologize to Candace, but she refuses. Michael declares that he will marry Candace whether she likes it or not, and that she will no longer be invited to the wedding. Candace disagrees with Michael, saying that he needs to apologize to Loretta, because as a mother herself, she would be heartbroken if her own son did not let her go to his wedding. Loretta, recognizing her mistakes, makes the first move and finally apologizes; the three reconcile. Cedric, feeling like a failure as a best man, packs his bags to leave Vegas; however, with the help of his personal butler, Declan (Jim Piddock), he finds another venue. Candace and Michael are married, and everybody, including Loretta, cheers and celebrates. In the end, Cedric becomes fed up with Vegas, and as the group leaves the hotel, he lets Bennett have his last dollar. Bennett then wins $100,000 on a slot machine. Cedric tries to claim the prize as it was his dollar, though everybody else tries to hold him back from fighting Bennett.

During this time, the relationship between film and poetry was debated. James Peterson in Dreams of Chaos, Visions of Order said, \\"In practice, the film poem label was primarily an emblem of the avant-garde's difference from the commercial narrative film.\\" Peterson reported that in the 1950s, overviews of avant-garde films \\"generally identified two genres: the film poem and the graphic cinema\\". By the 1990s, the avant-garde cinema encompassed the term \\"film-poem\\" in addition to different strains of filmmaking. Film-poems are considered \\"personal films\\" and are seen \\"as autonomous, standing apart from traditions and genres\\". They are \\"an open, unpredictable experience\\" due to eschewing extrinsic expectations based on commercial films. Peterson said, \\"The viewer's cycles of anticipation and satisfaction derive primarily from the film's intrinsic structure.\\" The film-poems are personal as well as private: \\"Many film poems document intimate moments of the filmmaker's life.\\" David E. James and Sarah Neely are two academics who have sought to explore the relationship between poetry and film. James writes of the idea of the poet ‚ÄòIn the modern world, poet designates a preferred medium; but the word also implies a mode of social (un)insertion. It bespeaks a cultural practice that, in being economically insignificant, remains economically unincorporated, and so retains the possibility of cultural resistance.‚Äô Of Stan Brakhage, David E. James writes ‚ÄòThe installation of the filmmaker as a poet had, then, both theoretical and practical components. It involved the conceptualization of the film artist as an individual author, a Romantic creator-a conceptualization made possible by manufacturing a tradition of such out of previous film history; and it necessitated a working organization, a mode of production and distribution, alternative to the technology, labour practices, and institutional insertion of Hollywood.‚Äô In his essay Poetry-Films and Film Poems in Film Poems, William C. Wees differentiates between poetry-film using a film to ‚Äòillustrate‚Äô a poem, and film poems in which ‚Äòa synthesis of poetry and film that generates associations, connotations and metaphors neither the verbal nor the visual text could produce on its own.‚Äô Examples of a film that fits in to the first is Manhatta (1921) by Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand using the poem by Walt Whitman, while in the second is Meshes of the Afternoon (1943) by Maya Deren and Alexander Hammmid. Film Poems was a touring programme of films exploring the relationship between films and poetry curated by film maker Peter Todd and screened at the National Film Theatre London in February 1998 and which screened the following year as a touring programme at various venues supported by The Arts Council of England and the BFI Touring Unit (and would be followed by a further three Film Poems programmes). This programme included two films by film maker and poet Margaret Tait which displayed the range and texture of her work with one film Hugh MacDiarmid A Portrait (1964) featuring the poet MacDiarmid reading his own work, while the other Aerial (1974) is without words and which author Ali Smith described as ‚Äòa tiny poem‚Äô. Sarah Neely also writes of this film ‚ÄòFor this film, Tait moved away from the inclusion of spoken word on the soundtrack: instead the film‚Äôs poetry comes wholly from image and sound‚Äô emphasising ‚ÄòAerial seems a perfect distillation of Tait‚Äôs idea of a film poem. Sophie Mayer in How British Poetry Fell In Love With Film said Margaret Tait created her largely self-made films where she lived and would be described as ‚Äòthe only British artist truly making film poems‚Äô.

Locally trivial fibered manifolds are fiber bundles. Therefore, a notion of connection on fibered manifolds provides a general framework of a connection on fiber bundles. Formal definition Let be a fibered manifold. A generalized connection on is a section , where is the jet manifold of . Connection as a horizontal splitting With the above manifold there is the following canonical short exact sequence of vector bundles over : where and are the tangent bundles of , respectively, is the vertical tangent bundle of , and is the pullback bundle of onto . A connection on a fibered manifold is defined as a linear bundle morphism over which splits the exact sequence . A connection always exists. Sometimes, this connection is called the Ehresmann connection because it yields the horizontal distribution : \\\\mathrm{H}Y=\\\\Gamma\\\\left(Y\\\\times_X \\\\mathrm{T}X \\\\right) \\\\subset \\\\mathrm{T}Y of and its horizontal decomposition . At the same time, by an Ehresmann connection also is meant the following construction. Any connection on a fibered manifold yields a horizontal lift of a vector field on onto , but need not defines the similar lift of a path in into . Let :\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathbb R\\\\supset[,] i t&\\\\to x(t)\\\\in X \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbb R i t&\\\\to y(t)\\\\in Y\\\\end{align} be two smooth paths in and , respectively. Then is called the horizontal lift of if :\\\\pi(y(t))= x(t)\\\\,, \\\\qquad \\\\dot y(t)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{H}Y \\\\,, \\\\qquad t\\\\in\\\\mathbb R\\\\,. A connection is said to be the Ehresmann connection if, for each path in , there exists its horizontal lift through any point . A fibered manifold is a fiber bundle if and only if it admits such an Ehresmann connection. Connection as a tangent-valued form Given a fibered manifold , let it be endowed with an atlas of fibered coordinates , and let be a connection on . It yields uniquely the horizontal tangent-valued one-form on which projects onto the canonical tangent-valued form (tautological one-form or solder form) : \\\\theta_X=dx^\\\\mu\\\\otimes\\\\partial_\\\\mu on , and vice versa. With this form, the horizontal splitting reads : \\\\Gamma:\\\\partial_\\\\lambda\\\\to \\\\partial_\\\\lambda\\\\rfloor\\\\Gamma=\\\\partial_\\\\lambda +\\\\Gamma^i_\\\\lambda\\\\partial_i\\\\,. In particular, the connection in yields the horizontal lift of any vector field on to a projectable vector field :\\\\Gamma \\\\tau=\\\\tau\\\\rfloor\\\\Gamma=\\\\tau^\\\\lambda\\\\left(\\\\partial_\\\\lambda +\\\\Gamma^i_\\\\lambda\\\\partial_i\\\\right)\\\\subset \\\\mathrm{H}Y on . Connection as a vertical-valued form The horizontal splitting of the exact sequence defines the corresponding splitting of the dual exact sequence : 0\\\\to Y\\\\times_X \\\\mathrm{T}^*X \\\\to \\\\mathrm{T}^*Y\\\\to \\\\mathrm{V}^*Y\\\\to 0\\\\,, where and are the cotangent bundles of , respectively, and is the dual bundle to , called the vertical cotangent bundle. This splitting is given by the vertical-valued form : \\\\Gamma= \\\\left(dy^i -\\\\Gamma^i_\\\\lambda dx^\\\\lambda\\\\right)\\\\otimes\\\\partial_i\\\\,, which also represents a connection on a fibered manifold. Treating a connection as a vertical-valued form, one comes to the following important construction. Given a fibered manifold , let be a morphism and the pullback bundle of by . Then any connection on induces the pullback connection : f*\\\\Gamma=\\\\left(dy^i-\\\\left(\\\\Gamma\\\\circ \\\\tilde f\\\\right)^i_\\\\lambda\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\lambda}{\\\\partial x'^\\\\mu}dx'^\\\\mu\\\\right)\\\\otimes\\\\partial_i on .

It is an affine bundle modelled on a vector bundle There are the following corollaries of this fact. Curvature and torsion Given the connection on a fibered manifold , its curvature is defined as the Nijenhuis differential : \\\\begin{align} R&=\\\\tfrac12 d_\\\\Gamma\\\\Gamma\\\\\\\\\\\\&=\\\\tfrac12 [\\\\Gamma,\\\\Gamma]_\\\\mathrm{FN} \\\\\\\\\\\\&= \\\\tfrac12 R_{\\\\lambda\\\\mu}^i \\\\, dx^\\\\lambda\\\\wedge dx^\\\\mu\\\\otimes\\\\partial_i\\\\,, \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_{\\\\lambda\\\\mu}^i &= \\\\partial_\\\\lambda\\\\Gamma_\\\\mu^i - \\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\Gamma_\\\\lambda^i + \\\\Gamma_\\\\lambda^j\\\\partial_j \\\\Gamma_\\\\mu^i - \\\\Gamma_\\\\mu^j\\\\partial_j \\\\Gamma_\\\\lambda^i\\\\,. \\\\end{align} This is a vertical-valued horizontal two-form on .

Bundle of principal connections Let be a principal bundle with a structure Lie group . A principal connection on usually is described by a Lie algebra-valued connection one-form on . At the same time, a principal connection on is a global section of the jet bundle which is equivariant with respect to the canonical right action of in . Therefore, it is represented by a global section of the quotient bundle , called the bundle of principal connections. It is an affine bundle modelled on the vector bundle whose typical fiber is the Lie algebra of structure group , and where acts on by the adjoint representation. There is the canonical imbedding of to the quotient bundle which also is called the bundle of principal connections.

It was introduced on February 14, 2013 by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC). The bill would amend the Securities Act of 1933 to set a new deadline regarding domestic securities for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. H.R. 701 would amend the Securities Act of 1933 to set October 31, 2013, as the deadline for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to add a class of domestic securities to those already exempted from regulation under the Securities Act of 1933. This would have to be done in accordance with a few specified terms and conditions. First, that the aggregate offering amount of all securities offered and sold within the prior 12-month period in reliance on the new exemption shall not exceed $50 million. Second, that the securities may be offered and sold publicly. Finally, that they shall not be restricted securities under federal securities laws and regulations.

There are only two companies that produce copper concentrate, Erdenet Mining Corporation, a Mongolian-Russian joint venture, and the Oyu Tolgoi mine, a joint venture between Rio Tinto Group, Turquoise Hill Resources, and the Government of Mongolia. Until 2010 copper was Mongolia's largest export. Reserves Mongolia is ranked 12th in the world for copper reserves. The south Gobi Desert alone has an estimated of 35 million tonnes of copper. Operations Erdenet Erdenet has been operation since 1978 as a joint project between Mongolia and Russia. The mine produced copper concentrate with molybdenum. Over the years the output of grade copper decreased with increasing depth of the mine. This was proposed to be compensated by manufacturing copper cathode which was priced higher. The estimated ore reserve was 1.54 billion tons. The copper concentrate production rate of 130,000 tons was envisaged by Erdent. Erdenet was still Mongolia's sole producer of copper, and accounted for 14% of Mongolia's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007. Copper from Erdenet was Mongolia's largest export until 2010 until it was bypassed by coal. While the mine has been exporting copper concentrate since production began, there are plans to create industry within the country to manufacture finished products (such as copper wire) from concentrate from the mine. Oyu Tolgoi From right to left, Shaft #1, #2, and #5 at Oyu Tolgoi In 2001 Canadian-based Ivanhoe Mines (now known as Turquoise Hill Resources) discovered the gold-copper ore deposit of what would be developed into the Oyu Tolgoi mine. The deposit is in the Gobi Desert in an area known as Oyu Tolgoi (Mongolian for Turquoise Hill), where in the time of Genghis Khan outcropping rocks were smelted for copper. By 2003 there were 18 exploration drill rigs on the property employing approximately 200 people, and Oyu Tolgoi was the \\"biggest mining exploration project in the world.\\" In January 2013 Oyu Tolgoi started producing concentrate from the mine. Its location in the South Gobi province, is 50 miles away from the border with China and is termed as a mega-mine in Mongolia. Its mining operations are a joint venture of Rio Tinto (a UK-based mining transnational), Turquoise Hill and the Mongolian government. As of 2010, the estimated cost of bringing the Oyu Tolgoi mine into production was US$4.6 billion, making it (financially) the largest project in Mongolian history; however, by 2013 costs had increased to $10 billion. When in production Oyu Tolgoi will account for more than 30% of Mongolia's GDP. The copper production from this mine (the investment was reported to be of the order of US$5 billion) has been projected at 450,000 tonnes of copper for the next 50 years; the mining reserves are reported to extend up to 20 miles beneath the Gobi Desert and is also estimated to yield 330,000 ounces of gold annually. In January 2013 Oyu Tolgoi started producing concentrate from the mine.

It is best known for the mysterious disappearance of its keepers in 1900. History The remains of the Flannan lighthouse railway as of 2012; this view is looking approximately west-south-west from the lighthouse. The site of \\"Clapham Junction\\" is just visible at left centre. The lighthouse was designed by David Alan Stevenson for the Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB). Construction, between 1895 and 1899, was undertaken by George Lawson of Rutherglen at a cost of ¬£1,899 inclusive of the building of the landing places, stairs and railway tracks. All of the materials used had to be hauled up the cliffs directly from supply boats, no trivial task in the ever-churning Atlantic. A further ¬£3,526 was spent on the shore station at Breasclete on the Isle of Lewis.\\"Flannan Isles Lighthouse \\" Northern Lighthouse Board. Retrieved 23 March 2008. It was first lit on 7 December 1899. The purpose of the railway tracks was to facilitate the transport of provisions for the keepers and fuel for the light (paraffin, at that date; the light consumed twenty barrels a year) up the steep gradients from the landing places by means of a cable- hauled railway. This was powered by a small steam engine in a shed adjoining the lighthouse. A track descended from the lighthouse in a westerly direction and then curved round to the south. In the approximate centre of the island it forked by means of a set of hand-operated points humorously dubbed \\"Clapham Junction\\"; one branch continued in its curvature to head eastwards to the east landing place, on the south-east corner of the island, thus forming a half- circle, while the other, slightly shorter, branch curved back to the west to serve the west landing, situated in a small inlet on the island's south coast. The final approaches to the landing stages were extremely steep. The cable was guided round the curves by pulleys set between the rails, and a line of posts set outside the inner rail prevented it from going too far astray should it jump off the pulleys. The cargo was carried in a small four-wheeled bogie. In 1925, the lighthouse was one of the first Scottish lights to receive communications from the shore by wireless telegraphy. In the 1960s, the island's transport system was modernised. The railway was removed, leaving behind the concrete bed on which it had been laid to serve as a roadway for a \\"Gnat\\" ‚Äì a three-wheeled, rubber-tyred cross-country vehicle powered by a four-stroke engine, built by Aimers McLean of Galashiels. This had a somewhat shorter working life than the railway, becoming redundant in its turn when the helipad was constructed. On 28 September 1971, the lighthouse was automated. A reinforced concrete helipad was constructed at the same time to enable maintenance visits in heavy weather. The light was produced by burning acetylene gas at the focal point of a 4th order lens being rotated at 2rpm to give a character of flashing twice (white) every 30 seconds and producing a range of . It was monitored from the Butt of Lewis and the shore station converted into flats.Perrot, D. et al. (1995) p. 132. In the 1980s the light source was converted to electric being powered from NiCd batteries charged from photovoltaic panels with a diesel generator back-up. The Lighthouse currently has an array of thirty-six 38 Watt photovoltaic panels, two NiCd batteries: one 1434Ahr and one 1290AHr, an auxiliary Diesel Generator made up of a Lister TS3 engine and a Newage International 10KW alternator. The main light source is a 35 Watt CDM-T Metal Halide lamp; three of which are mounted on a motorised lamp changer ‚Äì which automatically changes the lamp in the event of detecting a reduced current flowing through the lamp. The lens is electrically rotated on a Pelangi PRL600 gearless pedestal. The lighthouse also hosts a Kannard AIS transponder. The condition of the light, batteries, generating set and AIS is remotely monitored by Northern Lighthouse Board staff via telemetry. Disappearances in 1900 Discovery Flannan Isles Lighthouse The first record that something was abnormal on the Flannan Isles was on 15 December 1900 when the steamer Archtor, on a passage from Philadelphia to Leith, noted in its log that the light was not operational in poor weather conditions. When the ship docked in Leith on 18 December 1900, the sighting was passed onto the Northern Lighthouse Board. The relief vessel, the lighthouse tender Hesperus, was unable to sail from Breasclete, Lewis, as planned on 20 December due to adverse weather; it did not reach the island until noon on 26 December. The lighthouse was manned by three men: James Ducat, Thomas Marshall, and William MacArthur, with a rotating fourth man spending time on shore. On arrival, the crew and relief keeper found that the flagstaff had no flag, all of the usual provision boxes had been left on the landing stage for re-stocking, and more ominously, none of the lighthouse keepers were there to welcome them ashore. James Harvey, the captain of Hesperus, attempted to reach them by blowing the ship's whistle and firing a flare, but was unsuccessful. A boat was launched and Joseph Moore, the relief keeper, was put ashore alone. He found the entrance gate to the compound and the main door both closed, the beds unmade, and the clock stopped. Returning to the landing stage with this grim news, he then went back up to the lighthouse with Hesperus second-mate and a seaman. A further search revealed that the lamps had been cleaned and refilled. A set of oilskins was found, suggesting that one of the keepers had left the lighthouse without them. There was no sign of any of the keepers, neither inside the lighthouse nor anywhere on the island.\\"Transcripts from documents related to the Flannan Isles mystery.\\" Museum of Scottish Lighthouses/Wayback. Original retrieved 3 September 2008, Wayback version retrieved 7 December 2013. Moore and three volunteer seamen were left on the island to attend the light and Hesperus returned to Lewis. Captain Harvie sent a telegram to the Northern Lighthouse Board dated 26 December 1900, stating: > A dreadful accident has happened at the Flannans. The three keepers, Ducat, > Marshall and the Occasional have disappeared from the Island... The clocks > were stopped and other signs indicated that the accident must have happened > about a week ago. Poor fellows they must have been blown over the cliffs or > drowned trying to secure a crane. On Eilean M√≤r, the men scoured every corner of the island for clues as to the fate of the keepers. They found that everything was intact at the east landing but the west landing provided considerable evidence of damage caused by recent storms. A box at above sea level had been broken and its contents strewn about; iron railings were bent over, the iron railway by the path was wrenched out of its concrete, and a rock weighing more than a ton had been displaced. On top of the cliff at more than above sea level, turf had been ripped away as far as from the cliff edge. Speculation and conjecture No bodies were ever found, but there have been some mysterious sights resulting in \\"fascinated national speculation\\" in newspapers and periodicals of the era.Bathhurst (2000) p. 249. Implausible stories ensued, such as a sea serpent (or giant seabird) had carried the men away; they had arranged for a ship to take them away and start new lives, they had been abducted by foreign spies; or they had met their fate through the malevolent presence of a boat filled with ghosts (the baleful influence of the \\"Phantom of the Seven Hunters\\" was widely suspected locally). More than ten years later, the events were still being commemorated and elaborated on. The 1912 ballad Flannan Isle by Wilfrid Wilson Gibson refers erroneously to an overturned chair and uneaten meal laid out on the table, indicating that the keepers had been suddenly disturbed.Munro (1979) p. 171. > Yet, as we crowded through the door, We only saw a table spread For dinner, > meat, and cheese and bread; But, all untouch'd; and no-one there, As though, > when they sat down to eat, Ere they could even taste, Alarm had come, and > they in haste Had risen and left the bread and meat, For at the table head a > chair Lay tumbled on the floor.Quotation from Nicholson (1995) p. 178. However, in a first-hand account made by Moore, the relief keeper, he stated that: \\"The kitchen utensils were all very clean, which is a sign that it must be after dinner some time they left.\\" Northern Lighthouse Board investigation Northern Lighthouse Board Ensign On 29 December 1900, Robert Muirhead, a Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB) superintendent, arrived to conduct the official investigation into the incident. Muirhead had originally recruited all three of the missing men and knew them personally. He examined the clothing left behind in the lighthouse and concluded that James Ducat and Thomas Marshall had gone down to the western landing stage, and that Donald McArthur (the 'Occasional') had left the lighthouse during heavy rain in his shirt sleeves. He noted that whoever left the light last and unattended was in breach of NLB rules. He also noted that some of the damage to the west landing was \\"difficult to believe unless actually seen\\". > From evidence which I was able to procure I was satisfied that the men had > been on duty up till dinner time on Saturday the 15th of December, that they > had gone down to secure a box in which the mooring ropes, landing ropes etc. > were kept, and which was secured in a crevice in the rock about above sea > level, and that an extra large sea had rushed up the face of the rock, had > gone above them, and coming down with immense force, had swept them > completely away.Munro (1979) pp. 170‚Äì71, although Nicholson (1995), > Bathhurst (2000) and Haswell-Smith (2004) quote the same report using > somewhat different language: \\"After a careful examination of the place.... I > am of the opinion that the most likely explanation of the disappearance of > the men is that they had all gone down on the afternoon of Saturday, 15 > December to the proximity of the west landing to secure the box with the > mooring ropes etc. and that an unexpectedly large roller had come up on the > island, and that a large body of water going up higher than where they were > and coming down upon them, swept them away with resistless force.‚Äù Whether this explanation brought any comfort to the families of the lost keepers (Ducat left a wife and four children; MacArthur a wife and two children) is unknown. Later theories and interpretations Over time, a story has developed of the existence of unusual log book entries. They supposedly have Thomas Marshall saying on December 12 that there were \\"severe winds the likes of which I have never seen before in twenty years\\". He also is said to have reported that James Ducat had been ‚Äòvery quiet‚Äô and Donald MacArthur had been crying. MacArthur was a veteran mariner with a reputation for brawling, and thus it would be strange for him to be crying in response to a storm. Log entries on the 13th of December were said to have stated that the storm was still raging, and that all three men had been praying. This was also puzzling, as all three men were experienced lighthouse keepers who knew they were in a secure structure 150 feet above sea level and should have known they were safe inside. Furthermore, there had been no reported storms in the area on the 12th, 13th and 14th of December. The final log entry is said to have been made on the 15th of December, stating ‚ÄòStorm ended, sea calm. God is over all‚Äô. An investigation by Mike Dash for the Fortean Times, revealed that the logbooks were later additions to the story not based on fact. The westernmost of the Flannan Isles: Eilean a' Ghobha and Roareim with Brona Cleit in the distance Subsequent researchers have taken into account the geography of the islands. The coastline of Eilean M√≤r is deeply indented with narrow gullies called geos. The west landing, which is situated in such a geo, terminates in a cave. In high seas or storms, water would rush into the cave and then explode out again with considerable force. It was possible MacArthur may have seen a series of large waves approaching the island and, knowing the likely danger to his colleagues, ran down to warn them only to be washed away as well in the violent swell.Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests these events are \\"very rare\\". Recent research by James Love discovered that Marshall was previously fined five shillings when his equipment was washed away during a huge gale. It is likely, in seeking to avoid another fine, that he and Ducat tried to secure their equipment during a storm and were swept away as a result. The fate of MacArthur, although required to stay behind to man the lighthouse, can be guessed to be the same. Love speculates that MacArthur probably tried to warn or help his colleagues and was swept away too. This theory also has the advantages of explaining the set of oilskins remaining indoors and MacArthur's coat remaining on its peg, although perhaps not the closed door and gate. Another theory is based on the first-hand experiences of Walter Aldebert, a keeper on the Flannans from 1953 to 1957. He believed one man may have been washed into the sea but then his companions, who were trying to rescue him, were washed away by more freak waves. A further proposal is based on the psychology of the keepers. Allegedly MacArthur was a volatile character; this may have led to a fight breaking out near the cliff edge by the West Landing that caused all three men to fall to their deaths. Another theory is that one of the men went insane, murdered the other two, threw their bodies into the sea, and then jumped in to his own death. Among modern theories are those connected to paranormal activity, such as abduction by aliens. Fictional use of this premise was featured in the Doctor Who serial Horror of Fang Rock. The mystery also was the inspiration for the composer Peter Maxwell Davies's modern chamber opera The Lighthouse (1979). The British rock group Genesis wrote and recorded \\"The Mystery of Flannan Isle Lighthouse\\" in 1968 while working on their first album, but it was not released until 1998 in Genesis Archive 1967‚Äì75. The 2018 film The Vanishing is also based on the same story. The 2019 film directed by Robert Eggers titled The Lighthouse also loosely references this tragedy.

The board incorporates a compass, an inclinometer, a ruler, a roll of paper and an arm buckle. Description The board was designed to be strapped to the arm of a cavalryman on the arm that he held the horses bridle with. The board is attached to the leather buckle with a swivel joint. This means that the user can twist the whole board on their arm to ensure that the compass alignment is clear. The board incorporates a compass for this purpose. The user can then use the supplied ruler. In earlier versions this was attached with rubber bands but later versions had the ruler permanently attached. The paper was about long and was rolled around one of the side rollers. As a sketch was completed then the paper roll was advanced to supply more clear paper. On the back of the board is an Inclinometer to allow the severity of ascents to be recorded. History The board was originally designed by Colonel W H Richards, who taught military surveying at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in about 1880 before he went on to teach in India. The board was improved by Major (later Colonel) William Willoughby Cole Verner who had briefly Professor of Topography at the Sandhurst. He patented improvements in 1887 and 1891 and the board became known as Verner's. Verner published his own guide to the sketching board in 1889.Verner, William Willoughby Cole.

It is based on the 2009 novel of the same name by Jonathan Tropper, who also wrote the film's screenplay. This is Where I Leave You tells the story of four grown siblings who are forced to return to their childhood home after their father passes away, and live under the same roof for seven days, along with their over-sharing mother and an assortment of spouses, exes, and might-have beens. The film was released on September 19, 2014, and grossed $41.3 million against a $19.8 million production budget. Plot Judd Altman (Jason Bateman) finds out his wife Quinn (Abigail Spencer) has been having an affair with his boss Wade (Dax Shepard) for a year. After he moves out, his sister Wendy (Tina Fey) calls to tell him their father Mort has died. The Altmans gather for the funeral at their mother's home where they reconnect with Wendy's ex-boyfriend Horry Callen (Timothy Olyphant), who suffered a brain injury years before, and his mother Linda (Debra Monk). Wendy is unhappy because her workaholic husband Barry (Aaron Lazar) neglects her. Judd reunites with his older brother Paul (Corey Stoll) and Paul's wife Annie (Kathryn Hahn), who had once been Judd's girlfriend. The youngest brother, Phillip (Adam Driver), arrives late with his new, older girlfriend Tracy (Connie Britton). The Altmans' mother Hilary (Jane Fonda) tells her children their father, though an atheist, wanted them to sit shiva, presided over by the Altmans' childhood friend, Rabbi Charles \\"Boner\\" Grodner (Ben Schwartz). Wendy is the only one in the family who knows about Judd's marital problems. Judd also reunites with Penny Moore (Rose Byrne), a woman who had a crush on him in high school. During a family gathering, Wendy drunkenly badgers Judd to tell the truth about Quinn. Phillip laments being seen as the family screw-up, while flirting with another woman in front of Tracy. Judd blurts out that Quinn was cheating on him and he plans to divorce her. Quinn shows up the next day and reveals she's pregnant with Judd's child. Phillip finds out about the pregnancy and reveals this to the family. Judd spends the night with Penny, and then spends the day with her. Wendy visits Horry in his backyard, and expresses remorse over causing the accident that caused Horry's brain injury. The family goes to temple, where the brothers sneak out to smoke joints Judd found in his father's suit. Annie, upset that she and Paul haven't conceived, tries to seduce Judd in hopes that he will impregnate her, but he rejects her. A few days later, after Barry leaves for a conference, Wendy sleeps with Horry, with whom she is still in love. Quinn calls Judd out of fear that she is having a miscarriage, and he admits to Penny that Quinn is pregnant. Judd gets to the hospital to be with Quinn where Wade also shows up. The baby, which is revealed to be a girl, survives. Judd and Wade get into a fight in the waiting room. When Philip and Wendy arrive, Wendy punches Wade in the face, and Judd gets a group of young men who witnessed the confrontation to flip Wade‚Äôs car. As he leaves, Wade tells Judd he's not ready to be a step-dad and leaves Quinn. The next day, Tracy talks with Judd and decides to break up with Phillip. Judd drives to Penny's house to talk to her, but she won't listen. Later, Annie apologizes to Judd, tearfully confessing that she is frustrated that she can't get pregnant. Judd replies that she should focus on what she and Paul do have. Paul sees Judd hugging her and assumes Judd is hitting on her. Paul attacks Judd as Tracy leaves Phillip, resulting in the three brothers fighting. Hilary silences everyone by kissing Linda passionately. She informs them that she and Linda are in love and that they had Mort's blessing. She admits the shiva was her idea, in order to come out to her children and get them to reconnect. The siblings are shocked, but see their mother is happy and accept it. One night, when the power goes out in the basement, Judd attempts to fix the fusebox, only to receive an electric shock and be knocked out. He dreams of a childhood memory of falling off his bike and of Mort comforting him. Judd wakes up crying, finally mourning his father. Judd apologizes to Penny for not being honest and promises to call her. Wendy leaves with her two children, tearing up as she again leaves Horry. The brothers reconcile and Paul offers Phillip a job at their father's sporting goods store. Judd quietly slips out, steals Phillip's Porsche, and drives up the highway to Maine, where he had dreamed of going. Cast * Jason Bateman as Judd Altman, the middle boy of the four Altman siblings.

Life  Edgar Meyer's creation: Welfenstein Castle circa 1905Meyer's painting of Welfenstein Castle Professor Edgar Meyer was born on 5 September 1853 in Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria. His parents were Martin Meyer (1821‚Äì1897),(a prosperous businessman, painter, poet and compiler of folksongs) and Theresia Megucher (1826‚Äì1905). He studied at the Akademie der Bildenk√ºnste in Munich and from 1874 to 1877 at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf under the direction of Eugene D√ºcker. He extended his studies by visiting Rome and Venice. In D√ºsseldorf between 1880‚Äì1881 he was a member of an association of artists and academics called Malkasten (also known as Paintbox). He lived in Weimar and was also Professor at Charlottenburg-Berlin. Meyer's preferred medium was watercolour and his impressionist styled landscapes, mountain scenes and castles were popular, particularly in Germany where they sold well. Meyer's paintings can be found at the Tiroler Landesmuseum (Ferdinandeum), Innsbruck and in private collections around the world. Towards the end of the nineteenth century the progression of Revolutionary Art caused his work to lose favour and he returned to the Tyrol. He bought the medieval ruins of Welfenstein Castle near Sterzing in South Tyrol. During the period 1893‚Äì1897 he rebuilt the castle transforming it into a romantic edifice complete with numerous towers, ramparts and battlements. Meyer furnished the castle with antiques and works of art collected from throughout the Tyrol. In November 1918 a devastating fire burnt down the castle destroying most of its contents including a collection of forty thousand books. In 1910 Meyer co-founded the Tiroler Volkskunst museum (Museum of Tyrolean Folk Art). He died at Aldrans near Innsbruck on 21 February 1925, aged 71.  Political life  Edgar Meyer was a proponent of the germanisation of Trentino, and the corridor beyond leading to the Adriatic Sea. These areas contained a string of German-speaking communities. This was against a backdrop of rising Italian nationalism or irrendentism. In 1905 Meyer co-founded the Tiroler Volksbundes (Tyrolean Popular League). Financed with German money it promoted Austrian culture and German teaching in South Tyrol and Trentino. In 1907 Meyer was the key player in a notorious episode that became known as \\"Zweite Schlact von Calliano* (The Second Battle of Calliano). At the time Austro-German nationalist associations promoted their visions of national identity by organising tours and hiking parties. Meyer had already organised several controversial tours, then in the summer of 1907 he led a hiking party of German and Austrian nationalists through the Trentino. This provocative excursion had been given advance publicity in the press. As they passed through Italian speaking villages they were met by hostile crowds. On reaching Calliano an angry mob overwhelmed the protecting police and attacked the party resulting in some serious injuries. There was outrage‚Äîanti-Italian demonstrations took place in Innsbruck, the incident was widely reported in the Austrian and German newspapers and Austrian and German government officials lodged official complaints with the Italian government. On the 5 August 1907 Meyer, with a bandaged head, spoke to an enthusiastic crowd in Innsbruck. In 1916‚Äì1917 Meyer founded the Ausschuss f√ºr volkische Belange und deutsche Besiedlung S√ºdtirols (Committee fot National Affairs and German Colonization of the Trentino) With his castle in ruins and following the annexation of South Tyrol by Italy in 1918, Meyer turned his attention towards the Jewish community in Austria. In 1919 the Tyrolese Anti-Semitic Association was formed. Meyer was one of the main speakers at its inaugural meeting in Innsbruck. He cited Jewish subversion as one of the reasons for the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 12, 2013. Plot Linda and Gene are excitedly showing off Gene's new baseball uniform at the restaurant. Everyone is impressed to various degrees and Bob is quick to show off something of his own; a new espresso machine. Bob offers a cup to Teddy who vehemently declines, so Tina drinks it. She quickly acquires a taste for it, bringing a thermos full of coffee along to Gene's first baseball game and rapidly chattering about anything that comes to mind, much to Louise's amusement. After an abysmal first game where Gene causes his team to lose, Linda resolves to help Gene. First she has Bob train him but their little game of catch dissolves into garbage throwing and injuries. Linda finds an ad for a pricy baseball camp online, run by \\"The Deuce\\", and filled with obvious editing that faked good results. Bob is against spending over $400 for the obviously fake camp but Linda decides to sell something to raise the cash. When Linda's little baby figurines don't fetch much at a pawn shop, Louise convinces her to sell Bob's espresso machine. The next day, Teddy decides to try a cup of espresso after all, and not having thought he'd actually make a sale, Louise and Linda play dumb about Bob's missing espresso machine. Jimmy Jr. stops by and spills the beans about Gene being at the expensive baseball camp because his little brothers, Andy and Olly, are there too. Tina, in a caffeine withdrawal craze, breaks some of her mom's baby figurines to try and force a confession out of her. It works and an angry Bob drags the family down to the baseball field to get their money back. When he finds the field empty, they use information in The Deuce's abandoned duffel bag and stumble upon Gene and the campers hitting a motel soda machine with bats at the instruction of The Deuce who was getting revenge for getting evicted from his motel room. Bob immediately accuses The Deuce of being a fraud but Linda defends him and they ultimately decide to set up a game in a nearby vacant lot; if Gene really has improved, then The Deuce can keep their money. On the first throw, Gene manages to hit the ball and despite Bob's disbelief and anger, it counts. In the end, The Deuce drives off and Bob reluctantly admits he's glad Gene's happy with his improvement. All the baseball camp kids celebrate in Bob's car by spraying a soda can around while Tina's left behind at the motel, chugging out of an old, communal coffee pot, still feeling the need for caffeine. Reception Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, saying \\"For most of the episode Bob is, as Linda so eloquently puts it, ‚Äúsuch a dick.‚Äù It was a little odd watching him enthusiastically root against his son but it made watching him eventually lose‚Äîand watching Linda really hold her own in an argument‚Äîthat much funnier. By the end of the day, Linda and Bob are screaming each other, their car is soaked in soda, and Tina is chugging coffee and cigarette butts straight out of the pot because hey, they're not a family that's known for quiet dignity. It's a weird and great ending to a weird and great season.\\" The episode received a 1.6 rating and was watched by a total of 3.38 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show but losing to Family Guy with 4.82 million.

NatureServe Explorer: An Online Encyclopedia of Life [web application]. and its maximum lifespan is around 7 years. It is brown, gray, or olive green on its upper parts and white or yellowish ventrally. There are dark spots or bars on the back and dark bars on most of the fins. The breeding male is darker in color than the female and nonbreeding male.Rickard, N. A. (1980). Life history and population characteristics of the prickly sculpin (Cottus asper Richardson) in Lake Washington. (Thesis). University of Washington. Both sexes develop an orange coloration along the edge of the first dorsal fin during breeding. The pectoral fins are large and fan-shaped. The body of the fish is prickly; inland-dwelling fish tend to be more prickly than those at the coast. Biology There are two main forms of the species. The inland form lives in lakes, while the coastal form lives in rivers and swims down into brackish estuaries to breed. A catadromous species, it is tolerant of high and low salinities. It is generally a bottom-dwelling species. It is nocturnal, feeding at night. The diet of the fish includes water invertebrates, insects and their larvae, salmon eggs, fish larvae, especially those of the Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis), and zooplankton, especially Daphnia spp.Merz, J.

It occurs in reservoirs such as Pyramid Lake. It was likely introduced to many of these places from farther north via the California Aqueduct. Uses The fish is said to be edible by humans, at least the larger individuals. It also makes a good bait fish.

History I Indian Brigade, RHA I Indian Brigade, RHA was formed on 12 December 1914 for the 1st Indian Cavalry Division in France. It commanded * A Battery of I Brigade, RHA at Ambala, India * Q Battery of VIII Brigade, RHA at Peshawar, India * U Battery of XI Brigade, RHA at Lucknow, India * I Indian RHA Brigade Ammunition Column Each battery was armed with six 13 pounder guns. The brigade served with the 1st Indian Cavalry Division on the Western Front and the brigade commander acted as Commander Royal Horse Artillery (CRHA). In practice, the batteries were permanently assigned to the cavalry brigades, viz: * A Battery with 3rd (Ambala) Cavalry Brigade then 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade from 15 September 1915 when it arrived from 2nd Indian Cavalry Division * Q Battery with 2nd (Sialkot) Cavalry Brigade * U Battery with 8th (Lucknow) Cavalry Brigade Other than the Battle of Cambrai when it helped to told the German counter-attack, the division was not involved in battle. Instead, it was held in reserve in case of a breakthrough, although it did send parties to the trenches on a number of occasions. They would hold the line, or act as Pioneers; such parties were designated as, for example, the Mhow Battalion. XVI Brigade, RHA On 26 November 1916, 1st Indian Cavalry Division was renamed 4th Cavalry Division. Consequently, on 24 February 1917, the brigade was redesignated as XVI Brigade, RHA. In March 1918, the 4th Cavalry Division was broken up in France. The British units remained in France and the Indian elements were sent to Egypt to help constitute 1st Mounted Division. The brigade became XVI Army Brigade, RHA. About this time the brigade's 13 pounders were replaced by 18 pounders. At the Armistice, it was serving as Army Troops with the Fourth Army commanding A, Q, and U Batteries, RHA (eighteen 18 pounders). The brigade moved to Germany as part of the Army of Occupation. Dissolved The brigade was broken up in Germany in April 1919 and the batteries returned to England.

Nares makes paintings and films (most notable being the No Wave Cinema Rome 78) and played guitar in the no wave group James Chance and the Contortions and with Jim Jarmusch in the Del- Byzanteens and was a founding member of Colab. Art education Nares attended the Chelsea Art School in London from 1972 to 1973. He later studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York from 1974 to 1976. Painting Nares is best known as a contemporary art painter. His method involves repeated strokes that eventually create a precise representation. He is known for employing single but intricate gestural brush strokes in most of his works. Grace Glueck, New York Times art critic, described the effect of Nares's paintings as a combination of Japanese calligraphy and the 1960s cartoon works of Roy Lichtenstein. Nares's paintings have been featured in films and videos focusing on a wide variety of artistic concepts such as, movement, artistic repetition, and rhythm. His work is exhibited in various museums in the United States, such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, NY, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Some of his solo exhibitions include 1976: Films and Other Works at Paul Kasmin Gallery, in New York in 2012, and Mixed Use, Manhattan: Photography and Related Practices 1970s to the present in 2010 at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, Spain. Nares's other solo exhibitions include New Paintings in 2004 at the Hamiltons Gallery in London, UK, and the New Paintings and Chronophotographs exhibition in 2005 at the Goss Gallery in Dallas, TX. His works were also featured in the Painting and Sculpture exhibition at the Lehman Maupin Gallery in New York City, in 2010. Rizzoli, an American publication, published a monograph dedicated to Nares's works in 2013 that focuses on his contributions to the world of art in the past four decades. When speaking on his work, Nares once stated: > I try to embody the nature and combine the forms‚Äîit's like one and one > making three‚Äîto expose a metaphor of some kind. It's searching for > metaphors, for likeness, like a breeding ground. It seems to me, that's how > a language develops.

He made a series of short sculptural- related minimal art films. In 1978 he released a no wave 82-minute color Super-8 film entitled Rome 78, his only venture into feature-length, plot- driven film.

In addition to variations from individual to individual, the size and shape of a single woman's vagina can vary substantially during sexual arousal and intercourse. Carrying a baby to term, or parity, is associated with a significant increase in the length of the vaginal fornix. The potential effect of parity may be the result of a stretching and elongation of the birth canal at the time of vaginal birth. There are a number of studies that have been done into the dimensions of the human vagina, but it has not been as intensively researched as penis size.  Dimensions in the baseline state  A 1996 study by Pendergrass et al., using vinyl polysiloxane castings taken from the vaginas of 39 Caucasian women, found the following ranges of dimensions: * lengths (measured using rods): ; * widths: ; * introital diameters: A second study by the same group showed significant variations in size and shape between the vaginas of women of different ethnic groups. Both studies showed a wide range of vaginal shapes, described by the researchers as \\"Parallel sided, conical, heart, [...] slug\\" and \\"pumpkin seed\\" shapes. Barnhart et al., however, weren't able to find any correlation amongst the race and the size of vagina. They were also unable to characterize the vaginal shape as a \\"heart, slug, pumpkin seed or parallel sides\\" as suggested by the previous studies. A 2003 study by the group of Pendergrass et al. also using castings as a measurement method, measured vaginal surface areas ranging from with a mean of and a standard deviation of . Research published in 2006 by Barnhart et al., gave the following mean dimensions, based on MRI scans of 28 women: * Mean length from cervix to introitus: . * Mean width: ** at the proximal vagina: ; ** at the pelvic diaphragm: ; ** at the introitus: A 2006 U.S. study of vagina sizes using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) on 28 volunteers between 18 and 39 years old, with heights ranging from 1.5 to 1.7 metres, and weights between 49.9 and 95.3 kilograms, revealed a greater than 100 percent variation between the shortest (40.8 millimetres) and the longest (95.0 millimetres) vagina length.  Medical devices used in the vagina  Given the large range in vaginal dimensions noted in studies such as the above, many fitted vaginal devices, for example pessaries, do not adhere to a \\"one-size-fits-all\\" mentality.  Sexual arousal  Lawrence, citing Masters and Johnson's Human Sexual Response (1966), states that pages 73 and 74 of that book show that typical vaginal depth in Masters and Johnson's participants ranged from 7‚Äì8 cm (2.8‚Äì3.1 in) in an unstimulated state, to 11‚Äì12 cm (4.3‚Äì4.7 in) during sexual arousal with a speculum in place.  Surgically created neovaginas  The depth of the typical neovagina created by male-to-female sex reassignment surgery is generally limited by the length of Denonvilliers' fascia, and is reported to be between 11 and 12 cm (4.3‚Äì4.7 in), within the range of the natural female vagina.

His professional career was closely associated to C√°diz, as both a player and manager. Playing career Born in Vimianzo, Province of A Coru√±a, Blanco moved to Argentina at an early age, as his parents were in search of better working opportunities. He joined Sportivo Italiano at the age of 13, making his senior debuts with the first team in Primera B Nacional only four years later. Again in his country of birth, Blanco signed for RCD Mallorca in Segunda Divisi√≥n, moving to La Liga with Real Betis in 1974. He saw out his two-year contract with the latter, in spite of limited playing opportunities; he made his debut in the main category of Spanish football on 5 January 1975, coming on as a late substitute in a 3‚Äì0 home win against H√©rcules CF. Blanco joined Andalusia neighbours C√°diz CF in summer 1976, achieving promotion in his first year and being part of the squad that reached the top flight for the first time ever. Under manager Enrique Mateos, other than in his natural position, he played also as a right winger and a centre forward. Blanco scored his first and only goal in the top division on 29 January 1978, in a 1‚Äì2 home loss to Valencia CF. The season ended in immediate relegation back and, after a further two years with the club in the second level, he left after a contract dispute to Recreativo de Huelva. Blanco retired in 1987 at the age of 35, after several spells in lower league and amateur football, mainly with Racing Club Portuense as he wanted to remain close to C√°diz. Coaching career Blanco started working as a coach immediately after retiring, beginning with C√°diz's youth teams and occasionally aiding first-team manager V√≠ctor Esp√°rrago. After being in charge of the reserves and also assisting several coaches, he was appointed at the helm of the main squad late into the 1990‚Äì91 campaign, and managed to save the side from top flight relegation in the playoffs, with a penalty shootout win over CD M√°laga; the feat was repeated again the following year, after disposing of UE Figueres 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. After the Gaditanos eventually suffered relegation in 1993, Blanco left and signed with CA Marbella in division two, being sacked early into the 1995‚Äì96 season. He returned to C√°diz in the following campaign, with the team now in Segunda Divisi√≥n B; not being able to help it promote he left in June 1998, going on to work in the same category with UD Almer√≠a, CD San Fernando (two spells), Granada CF and Torredonjimeno CF. After an extended period away from football, and also working as a sports commentator, Blanco returned to his beloved C√°diz 14 years later, with the club still in the third tier. He left after only three games in charge, however, for medical reasons. Death Blanco died on 9 May 2013 in C√°diz at the age of 61, after not being able to overcome a stroke.

Duncan served as series producer with, among others, star Greg Kinnear, Peter Tolan, and Richard Roxburgh, on this version for Fedora Entertainment, Essential Media, and Sony Pictures Television. On May 8, 2013, the series was added to the Fox network's 2013‚Äì14 schedule as a mid-season entry. The series premiered on January 23, 2014, originally airing Thursdays on the network, before moving to Fridays late in the first season and eventually to Saturdays for the final two episodes. On May 7, 2014, Fox canceled the series after one season, but ultimately aired the produced episodes. Premise The series follows Keegan Deane, a criminal defense lawyer whose personal problems and self-destructive behavior have him battling wits and owing money to everyone around him, including his ex-wife, judges, an assistant district attorney, his bookie, a brothel owner, and the IRS.  Cast and characters * Greg Kinnear as Keegan Deane, the titular rake * Miranda Otto as Maddy Deane, Keegan's ex-wife and a psychiatrist * John Ortiz as Ben Leon, Keegan's best friend from law school * Necar Zadegan as Scarlet Leon, Ben's wife and an ADA for Los Angeles * Bojana Novakovic as Michaela \\"Mikki\\" Partridge, a $500-an-hour prostitute, with whom Keegan develops a romantic interest, who disappears and then turns up as a law student. * Tara Summers as Leanne Zander, Keegan's personal assistant * Jeffrey Nordling as Bruce Mangan, Maddy Deane's new boyfriend * Ian Colletti as Finn Deane, Keegan's teenage son * Omar Dorsey as Roy, Keegan's creditor who routinely beats him on behalf of the loan shark to whom Deane owes a considerable amount of money. Keegan holds no grudges and the two men are otherwise friendly. * Anne Gee Byrd as Frances Leon, Ben's mother, who despises Deane * Cedric Yarbrough as Jules, Mikki's flamboyant former pimp * Elizabeth Ho as Debbie Lee, daughter of a creditor to whom Deane owed money. She has inherited the family business and forces Keegan to rent an apartment her aunt owns in Echo Park and has threatened to have her cousins break his legs if he doesn't pay up. * Damon Gupton as Mayor of Los Angeles Marcus Barzmann * Kim Hawthorne as Gloria Barzmann Production The early episodes were aired out of order, as the original pilot, written by Peter Duncan and directed by Sam Raimi, had \\"an overload of not drama ... but maybe a little sadness,\\" according to producer Peter Tolan. He added, \\"[it] worked against the episode. And so we refigured it, sort of toning that down\\". The episode originally portrays Keegan Deane (Greg Kinnear) in an unhealthy mental and physical state. Episode 13, \\"Mammophile\\", should be viewed after episode 5, \\"Bigamist\\", to maintain continuity. Critical reception Rake scored 62 out of 100 on Metacritic based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable\\" reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the show a rating of 66%, based on 38 reviews, with the site's consensus stating: \\"Rake's smart blend of comedy and drama makes it the perfect vehicle for Greg Kinnear's offbeat charm and dry humor\\".https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/rake/s01/ Hank Stuever (The Washington Post) gave it a B+ grade, positing that \\"House comparisons will surely abound, but Rake is easily one of the more confident network dramas to come our way of late. It's a procedural ... but it's just unorthodox enough to make me eager to see more.\\" The Los Angeles Times Mary McNamara stated \\"Rake owes more to the increasingly humane tone of family and female-based comedies like Modern Family and Parks and Recreation than Rescue Me, which could (fingers crossed) indicate a similar journey to the light for the ever-popular tortured white male.\\" Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly awarded the series a B grade, stating \\"Rake is yet another show that tries to entertain us with a boorish, morally sketchy protagonist. Comparisons have been made to House or cable drama cads like Don Draper, but it's the differences from the 'Unlikeable Antihero' archetypes of current TV that define the show.\\" Not all reviews were favorable: James Poniewozik of Time stated \\"You get the sense that the show ... is vacillating. Maybe it wants to be the kind of raw indictment/worship of reckless masculinity we've seen on cable. Or maybe it wants to be a more picaresque version of House, with a little less genius and a little more self-degradation.\\" The Huffington Posts Maureen Ryan said \\"Part of the problem is Rake's diffidence about how bad a guy Keane is supposed to be. He's clearly a raging narcissist, yet the show deflects that aspect of his personality and tries to make him seem a little bit adorable. If we're supposed to fear that the worst aspects of his personality will land him in serious trouble, the tidy resolutions of various story points in the pilot seem to preclude that possibility ... Rake isn't a bad show, it just doesn't appear to have the courage of its convictions.\\" Episodes References External links * * * Category:2010s American black comedy television series Category:2010s American comedy-drama television series Category:2010s American legal television series Category:2014 American television series debuts Category:2014 American television series endings Category:American television series based on Australian television series Category:English- language television shows Category:Fox Broadcasting Company original programming Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television Category:Television shows set in Los Angeles ","title":"Rake (American TV series)"},{"id":"39378743","text":"Chumani Booi (born 15 February 1980) is a former South African rugby union player and currently a coach with the in Pro14 and head coach of the in the Currie Cup and in the Rugby Challenge.

In 1990 temporary construction trailers were erected to house the community meditation hall, administrative offices and caretaker residences. Construction for permanent replacement facilities began in 2014. and in 2016, a new Community Meditation Center, staff village and administrative buildings were completed. The residential retreat center opened in July 1998. The majority of the center‚Äôs land is protected by an open space easement and kept in conservation.  Teachings  The teachings at Spirit Rock focus on the practice of vipassanƒÅ as taught in the Theravada tradition. Teachings focus on training and quieting the mind, on the teachings of Gautama Buddha as found in Buddhist texts, and on incorporating the Dharma into daily life.Ashley, Beth, \\"He‚Äôs the Father of Spirit Rock,\\" Marin Independent Journal, March 22, 1998, D1 Retreats are modeled on those held for lay people in the Thai Forest Tradition, including sitting and walking meditation, meetings with the teachers and the observation of silence by practitioners. In addition to vipassana teachings, Spirit Rock hosts teachers from Zen, Tibetan and nondual traditions as guest teachers throughout the year. Visiting teachers have included the 14th Dalai Lama, Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh, , Preah Maha Ghosananda, Anagarika Munindra, Kalu Rinpoche, Ram Dass, Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n, Tsoknyi Rinpoche, Huston Smith, Adyashanti, Tara Brach, Alice Walker, Zoketsu Norman Fischer and others.  Programs  A portion of the classes, daylongs and retreats at Spirit Rock are organized as community-specific programs to promote diversity. These programs are referred to as Kindred Sangha and include self-identified people of color, women, LGBT- IQ community, families, young adults, and elders. Class offerings also address the application of Buddhist teachings to modern issues such as addiction and trauma. Spirit Rock offers scholarships to make classes and retreats available to those who cannot otherwise afford them.  Organization  The center is supported by fees charged for classes and retreats, and by donations. The paid staff runs the day-to-day operations of Spirit Rock Meditation Center with support from volunteers. Residential retreat managers are volunteers who rely on voluntary dƒÅna (donations) from participants to support their work. Teachers on residential retreats are supported by donations from the students, as is the practice in the Buddhist tradition. but on non-residential retreats, daylong retreats, events and classes teachers are supported by fees paid by attendees to Spirit Rock. Spirit Rock‚Äôs teaching programs are developed by the Teachers Council, a collective of teachers. A volunteer Board of Directors, composed of teachers and community members, is the central decision-making body for Spirit Rock. The work of the Board is supported by a number of committees. Current Spirit Rock teachers (as of 2017) include Ajahn Amaro, Ayya Anandabodhi; Sally Armstrong; Guy Armstrong; James Baraz; Sylvia Boorstein; Eugene Cash; Debra Chamberlin-Taylor; Howard Cohn; Mark Coleman; Dana DePalma; Anna Douglas; Andrea Fella; Anushka Fernandopulle; Gil Fronsdal; Robert Hall; Will Kabat-Zinn; Jack Kornfield; Phillip Moffitt; Wes Nisker; Mary Grace Orr; Sharda Rogell; Donald Rothberg; Tempel Smith; John Travis; Spring Washam; Julie Wester; Diana Winston; and Larry Yang.

The recreation area, maintained by the Bureau of Land Management, is east of Austin along U.S. Route 50. The site, at above sea level, is on the west edge of the Monitor Valley in the Great Basin. The park features a self-guided tour along a trail with multiple petroglyph panels, high-desert flora, and views of the Toquima and Toiyabe mountain ranges and the Big Smoky Valley.\\"Hickison Petroglyph Recreation Area\\" (brochure distributed at the site), Battle Mountain Field Office, Bureau of Land Management. Amenities include 16 campsites, a day-use area, toilets, grills, picnic tables, and trash cans but no water. Name Hickison Summit is named for ranch owner John Hickerson. (Hickerson is an alternate spelling for the summit.) The road to the Hickerson ranch passes over the summit. History In the general vicinity of Hickison Summit are multiple prehistoric hunting and living sites dating to 10,000 B.C. as well as more recent sites such as mining camps and ranches. Trails used by mid-19th-century explorers John C. Fr√©mont and James H. Simpson pass through the area as do the routes of the Pony Express and the Overland Stage. At the time of the earliest prehistoric sites, the Great Basin contained large lakes, including Lake Toiyabe and Lake Tonopah in the Big Smoky Valley west of the summit. As the climate became drier, the lakes evaporated, and the former lake-dependent cultures were replaced by hunter-gatherers. When the first European-Americans arrived in about 1850, Western Shoshone people lived in the region.

He has been a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan, since August 2018. Previously, he served as Minister of State for States and Frontier Regions from 11 September to 18 September 2018. Previously, he was a member of the National Assembly from June 2013 to May 2018. Early life and education Saeed was born on 17 August 1986 at Kabal, Swat. Reportedly, Saeed holds a Bachelor of Science (Hons) degree in Environmental Sciences from University of Peshawar. Fake degree issue In 2015, Bachelor of Science degree of Saeed was challenged after a student group accused him of passing three papers in one hour. Following the controversy, Saeed approached the Peshawar High Court and told that he had attended University of Peshawar from 2005 to 2009 for his undergraduate degree and passed all his courses. The University of Peshawar found marks certificate to be incorrect and fake and said that Saeed's marks certificate does not have its official stamp and the three papers still needed to clear to get degree to obtain his BSc Environmental Sciences degree. It was reported that committee formed to resolve the issue later recommended to remove the vice chancellor of the University of Peshawar. In 2015, the University of Peshawar asked the Peshawar High Court to disqualify Saeed from his National Assembly seat for making a false declaration of his Bachelor of Science degree while filing nomination papers for the 2013 general elections. Following which Saeed obtained stay order from the court. In March 2018, the Peshawar High Court dismissed the petition. Political career Saeed was the founder of Insaf Student Federation, the student wing of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and remained its central president for four years. Saeed was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan as a candidate of PTI from Constituency NA-29 Swat in 2013 Pakistani general election.

Saeed reportedly attempted to assault Javed Latif outside the National Assembly building after Latif made lewd remarks in the assembly about Imran khan and called him a betrayal and rebel. Latif later apologized for his lewd remarks. The issue was resolved later by the National Assembly Jirga.

He was re-elected to the National Assembly as a candidate of PTI from Constituency NA-4 (Swat-III) in 2018 Pakistani general election. He received 71,600 votes and defeated Saleem Khan, a candidate of Awami National Party (ANP).

While nearly all summer squash are cultivars of Cucurbita pepo, tromboncino is a cultivar of Cucurbita moschata. The vining growth habit is similar to many winter squashes, but unlike most other summer squash. It is more tolerant to some common summer squash pests, including squash vine borer, squash bugs, and powdery mildew, than the more commonly grown, bushy, C. pepo summer squash cultivars. The plants are slower to start producing than some C. pepo types. The fruit color is usually pale green, fading to beige upon maturity, and it is picked around one foot long for summer squash. It is an heirloom, originally from Liguria, and remains popular throughout Italy and abroad. Tromboncino squash can be left to mature into a winter squash; such is often compared to a watery butternut squash. If left to ripen, the fruits can grow over three feet in length. Tromboncino is known by many common names, including: zucchetta rampicante, zucchino rampicante, climbing zucchini, climbing crookneck, trombolino d'albenga, trombetta and serpentine squash.

The goal of the program is to answer the most famous open problem in computer science ‚Äì whether P = NP ‚Äì by showing that the complexity class P is not equal to the complexity class NP. The idea behind the approach is to adopt and develop advanced tools in algebraic geometry and representation theory (i.e., geometric invariant theory) to prove lower bounds for problems. Currently the main focus of the program is on algebraic complexity classes. Proving that computing the permanent cannot be efficiently reduced to computing determinants is considered to be a major milestone for the program. These computational problems can be characterized by their symmetries. The program aims at utilizing these symmetries for proving lower bounds. The approach is considered by some to be the only viable currently active program to separate P from NP. However, Ketan Mulmuley believes the program, if viable, is likely to take about 100 years before it can settle the P vs. NP problem.. The program is pursued by several researchers in mathematics and theoretical computer science. Part of the reason for the interest in the program is the existence of arguments for the program avoiding known barriers such as relativization and natural proofs for proving general lower bounds.

Printed pamphlets had been a popular and longstanding tradition, but in London in the late 16th century, with the urban population booming, and literacy becoming widespread, they flourished.Greenblatt, Stephen. ‚Äò‚ÄôWill in the World; How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare‚Äô‚Äô.

Such was the case with Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis and Nashe's Pierce Penniless, which were both written and published when the theatres were closed from 1592‚Äì1593.Duncan-Jones, Katherine. '‚ÄôShakespeare an Ungentle Life.'‚Äô Methuen Drama 2001 p. 64 As Nashe says in his introductory \\"Private Epistle of the Author to the Printer\\", the first edition of Pierce Penniless was published in London, while Nashe was out of town, because \\"the fear of infection detained me with my Lord [his patron Lord Strange] in the country.\\" The plague is an underlying motive for the story itself‚Äîthe seven deadly sins that Nashe's tale describes were said at the time to be the cause of the disease.Duncan-Jones, Katherine. '‚ÄôShakespeare an Ungentle Life'‚Äô. Methuen Drama 2001 p. 66 Indeed, the last words that Pierce addresses to the Devil in his supplication express the wish that certain souls will be accepted into Hell, and thus will \\"not let our air be contaminated with their sixpenny damnation any longer\\".  Pamphlet war  The text of Pierce Penniless contains an attack on both Richard Harvey, the astrologer and the Marinists, who, as part of the Marprelate Controversy, had been waging a pamphlet war attacking the episcopacy of the Anglican Church.The Oxford Companion to English Literature. Edited by Margaret Drabble. 1985 Oxford University Press Near the midpoint of the story, Nashe's salvo begins: ::Gentlemen, I am sure you have heard of a ridiculous ass that ... wrote an absurd Astrological Discourse ... I have read over thy sheepish discourse of The Lamb Of God And His Enemies, and ... I could not refrain, but bequeath it to the privy, leaf by leaf as I read it, it was so ugly, dorbellical, and lumpish.  The preface  In the ‚ÄúPrivate Epistle of the Author to the Printer‚Äù, which prefaces the second edition of Pierce Penniless, Nashe refers to another pamphlet entitled Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit (1592), which contains this well known attack on William Shakespeare: ::... there is an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his tiger's heart wrapped in a player's hide supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you, and being an absolute Johannes factotum is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country\\"Greene‚Äôs Groatsworth of Wit\\" Full text online From the moment Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit was published, people disbelieved that Robert Greene actually wrote it, let alone wrote it from his deathbed, as is purported in the pamphlet.Duncan-Jones, Katherine. '‚ÄôShakespeare an Ungentle Life'‚Äô. Methuen Drama 2001 p. 48 But the two who are then suspected of writing it, Thomas Nashe and Henry Chettle, each denied being the author. Among other reasons for considering that Nashe may be the author is Nashe's denial, which at first glance seems adamant, but is immediately followed by a kind of rueful confession that seems to have left a door open for interpretation:Duncan-Jones, Katherine. ‚Äò‚ÄôShakespeare an Ungentle Life‚Äô‚Äô. Methuen Drama 2001 p. 51 ::... a scald trivial lying pamphlet called Greene's Groatsworth of Wit is given out to be of my doing. God never have care of my soul, but utterly renounce me, if the least word or syllable in it proceeded from my pen, or if I were any way privy to the writing or printing of it. I am grown at length to see into the vanity of the world more than ever I did, and now I condemn myself for nothing so much as playing the dolt in print. Nashe's character, \\"Pierce\\", occasionally has some harsh words for his unnamed fellow authors, which has led to speculation about who they might be. Nashe refers to them variously as sonnet-composing ‚Äúupstarts‚Äù, who are not as well-born or as well educated as himself, who have little Latin, but who are enjoying popular success in the theatre.Sams, Eric. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Real Shakespeare; Retrieving the Early Years, 1564‚Äì1594.‚Äô‚Äô Yale University Press. 1995. P. 75 Nashe then, in the ‚ÄúPrivate Epistle of the Author to the Printer‚Äù, threatens anyone who might suggest his satire has particular victims: ‚ÄúLet the interpreter beware,‚Äù he says, ‚Äú...they shall know that I live as their evil angel to haunt them world without end.‚Äù However, Nashe‚Äôs satire would have no point unless it could be seen to be striking an actual target.Sams, Eric. The Real Shakespeare; Retrieving the Early Years, 1564‚Äì1594. Yale University Press. 1995. p. 68 Nashe ends his epistle to his printer by mentioning that he would be available ‚Äú... before the third impression [to] come and alter whatsoever may be offensive to any man.\\"  The story  The story of Pierce Penniless is told by Pierce himself, who is a scholar, author and poet. He begins his story by bewailing his own lack of good fortune, saying \\" ... have I more wit than all these (thought I to myself)? Am I better born, am I better brought up, yea, and better favoured, and yet am I a beggar?\\" He sees no solution and finds that wickedness prevails. \\"Divines and dying men may talk of hell,\\" he says, \\"but in my heart her several torments dwell.\\" Having heard that a person might pawn his soul to the Devil for a thousand pounds, Pierce decides to seek a solution in that direction and appeal to the Devil, reasoning that if the Devil were to remove certain souls from the land of the living and recruit them into his domain where they belong, it would liberate and make available the wealth that they've been hoarding: Gold‚Äîthat ‚Äúmighty controller of fortune and imperious subverter of destiny, delicious gold, the poor man's god, and idol of princes.‚Äù Pierce searches for the Devil, first in Westminster, then in the Exchange, and then in St. Paul‚Äôs, where he finds a Knight of the Post, (i.e. whipping post) ‚Äì a term for a professional perjurer.Harrison, G. B. ‚Äò‚ÄòThomas Nashe, Pierce Penilesse, His Supplication to the Divell.‚Äô‚Äô Corwen Press. 1924 P.vi This man claims he can get a message to the devil. Pierce hands him what he has written, a supplication addressed to ‚ÄúThe Prince of Darkness‚Äù from Pierce Penniless who ‚Äúwisheth increase of damnation and increase of malediction eternal.‚Äù The supplication is based on the medieval theme of the Seven Deadly Sins, and enumerates each vice one after the other: Greed, and his wife Dame Niggardise; Pride and his mistress, Lady Swine-Snout; gluttony; sloth; etc. Each vice is personified in the manner of a prosopopoeia, and provides an opportunity for the story to introduce various sinners, who are described with rich detail‚Äîas though they are costumed to appear onstage. The section devoted to the sin of \\"sloth\\" contains Nashe's \\"defense of Playes\\", which finds that plays are not slothful, but virtuous. Pierce especially appreciates historical plays and gives Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 1 as an example. As Pierce says: ::How would it have joyed brave Talbot (the terror of the French) to think that after he had lien two hundred years in his tomb, he should triumph again on the stage, and have his bones new embalmed with the tears of ten thousand spectators at least (at several times), who, in the tragedian that represents his person, imagine they behold him fresh bleeding.Nashe, Thomas. ‚Äò‚ÄôPierce Peniless‚Äô‚Äô. 1592. full text online A notable passage occurs when Nashe describes the various types of drunkards one encounters in pubs and taverns. Pierce signs this supplication: ‚ÄúYour devilship's bounden execrator, Pierce Penilesse‚Äù. He then asks the Knight of the Post a question that was of interest to Elizabethan Londoners: what is the nature of Hell and the Devil? The Knight begins to answer, but digresses into a story: the allegory of the wickedness of the bear, \\"a right earthly devil\\", which is seen as a reference to the Earl of Leicester.Harrison, G. B. '‚ÄòThomas Nashe, Pierce Penilesse, His Supplication to the Divell.'‚Äô Corwen Press. 1924 P.vii Nashe's tale ends abruptly with the praises of a nobleman named Amuntas, who is believed to be the Earl of Southampton.

It was Margheriti's third collaboration with actor Lee Van Cleef, after previously directing him in The Stranger and the Gunfighter and Take a Hard Ride. Synopsis Retired safe-cracker Chris Gretchko is coaxed out of comfortable retirement by Jeff Olafson, the impulsive son of a former accomplice, who begs him to help steal an undocumented shipment of diamonds to satiate Van Stratten, a New York City crime boss whose mistress, Jessica, has been seeing Jeff on the side. Chris subsequently recruits his old friend, pawn shop owner Sam, who agrees to fence the diamonds afterward. When they learn Van Stratten intends to cut them out of the deal, Chris and Jeff plot a countermeasure, resulting in Jeff getting thrown in jail to give him plausible deniability, and Chris convalescing in a safe house after getting shot during the heist. Clarisse, an eccentric neighbor in the building, discovers Chris, and agrees to help tend his injuries and lie to police who come looking for him. However, Captain Donati begins to piece together the events, and all the involved parties find their lives in danger.

The Udasi differed from their mainline Sikh congregants, and due to differences in theology (such as syncretic Hindu practises) as well as some instances of malfeasance were seen as allowing or committing behaviours unsuitable for a gurdwara. By the 1920s, resentment of this perceived corruption led to the foundation of the Akali Movement which negotiated or forced Udasi mahants (religious heads) out of control of key gurdwaras. Legislation Among the issues addressed by the legislation: * Identification as a Sikh was defined by the attestation: One who professes the Sikh religion - I solemnly affirm that I am a Sikh, that I believe in the Guru Granth Sahib, that I believe in the Ten Gurus, and that I have no other religion. This definition was to stand until 1945. * Custody of historic Sikh shrines would pass to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, a Sikh-led committee. * The SGPC, formed in 1920, was defined as consisting of 120 practicing Sikhs, the heads of the Panj Takht (five primary Sikh gurdwaras), 12 appointees from the Princely States, and \\"14 co-opted members\\".

She was in charge of communications with the provinces and with those revolutionaries who had been imprisoned. She was arrested in 1875.

As a lawyer, he practised at the Supreme Court of India and Delhi High Court. He was elected as the AAP candidate for the Malviya Nagar constituency in the 2013 Delhi state assembly elections and was Minister of Law, Tourism, Administrative Reforms, Art & Culture in the Government of Delhi, from 28 December 2013 to 14 February 2014, at which time the AAP government resigned. He has served as MLA from Malviya Nagar Constituency from February 2015 - February 2020. He served as Chairman, Committee ON Privileges of Delhi Legislative Assembly for the year 2016-17. On 10th August 2018, Delhi Legislative Assembly appointed him as chairman, Committee to examine the Stray Dog and Monkey Menace in Delhi. He won the 2020 Delhi Elections by 18,144 votes. Early life Bharti was born in Baranwal Bania family at Hisua Bazar in Nawada. He was educated firstly at a local school and went to Patna for intermediate education. After completing his post-graduate M.Sc. from IIT Delhi, Bharti pursued a degree in law at Delhi University. He served IIT Delhi Alumni Association as its Secretary for 2007-08 and 2011‚Äì12 and as IIT Delhi Senator in 2008.Early life and background  SomnathBharti.com  Business career  In the 2000s, Somnath Bharti ran a Delhi-based IT firm. Madgen Solutions. The Spamhaus Project accused him of spamming on behalf of TopSites LLC, naming him in Register of Known Spam Operations (ROKSO) as one of the top spam operators in the world. According to Bharti, he was listed in ROKSO after an Open Directory Project editor Conrad Longmore ran a story on him. Responding to a PCQuest investigation in 2005, he insisted that all the e-mails sent by his company complied with the laws and regulations. PCQuest found that he had been sued in a California Superior Court for spamming by Daniel Balsam. Balsam's attorney Timothy Walton revealed that in 2004, Bharti and two others had paid Balsam in damages apart from making a court declaration agreeing to use only confirmed opt-in e-mail addresses when sending commercial e-mails. Bharti defended himself by saying that he chose to settle because defending the case in the United States would have been costlier for him. Bharti also claimed that he was in touch with SpamHaus, but the SpamHaus CEO Steve Linford denied this to PCQuest.  Activism  In June 2012, Bharti was involved in a campaign against the alleged interference of the then Minister of Human Resources and Development, Kapil Sibal, in the Joint Entrance Examination process for admission to Indian Institutes of Technology. In 2010-2013, he appeared in news for defending the rights of homeschooled children and subscribers of alternate education system in view of the binding provision of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act through Public Interest Litigations filed in Delhi High Court thrice. In response to his PILs, the Ministry of Human Resources and Development, through an affidavit, clarified that they are not against homeschooling.  Law career  In 2009, Bharti represented Vikram Buddhi. He led a movement against the abeyance of sentencing of Buddhi in the USA. Patiala House Court had in 2013 indicted Bharti for \\"tampering with evidence\\" along with his client, Pawan Kumar, in a corruption case. He was asked by the Bar Council of Delhi to explain why he should not be disbarred.  Political career  Bharti was the Aam Aadmi Party candidate for the Malviya Nagar constituency in the Delhi state assembly elections, 2013. Bharti won the seat, defeating Arti Mehra of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the incumbent Kiran Walia of the Indian National Congress. Walia had won the seat in 1999, 2003, and 2008 and had been education minister in the earlier government, while Mehra, who has represented the neighbouring Hauz Khas constituency for many years, had been Mayor of Delhi in 2007-2009. In contrast, Bharti was new to politics. Bharti was briefly Minister of Law, Tourism, Administrative Reforms, Art & Culture in the Government of Delhi. He was appointed on 28 December 2013 and left office on 14 February 2014 when the government of which he was a part resigned due a failure to enact a Jan Lokpal bill. In January 2014, during his time in office, Bharti revealed the identity of a Danish tourist who had been raped, despite such identification being illegal in India. The government's resignation, led by Arvind Kejriwal, pre-empted a personal resignation by Bharti in response to accusations of vigilantism. Some residents in the Khirkee Extension area of Delhi had complained to Bharti about a drug and prostitution racket allegedly being run by African nationals. In January 2014, he and some AAP workers, together with television camera crews, visited the area. Bharti and his supporters asked the police to raid the homes rented by Africans. When the police refused to do so, citing a lack of a warrant, a group led by Bharti allegedly caught four women and forced them to give urine tests. The tests conducted at AIIMS did not find any drug traces in their system. The women alleged that they had been threatened and molested by the mob. The AAP supported Bharti, calling the women's allegations false and stating that his actions were not racist and that residents had long complained of criminal activities by Africans in the area. Kejriwal demanded suspension of the police officers who had refused to conduct the raid. A court directed the police to lodge a First Information Report against the mob, and the Delhi Commission for Women also opened an investigation into the matter. Kejriwal's government had come under increasing political pressure to act against Bharti in the hours preceding its resignation. An independent judicial enquiry conducted on behalf of the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi announced on 28 February 2014 that the police had been correct not to accede to Bharti's demands and that Bharti should not have then taken the law into his own hands by leading the raid. He was elected again by the people of Malviya Nagar constituency in Feb 2015 by double the margin than the last time when Delhi gave mandate of 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi assembly to AAP. He was sent to Delhi Development Authority as a member of the Board which controls Land and development of Delhi. His work can be gauged from the fact that his efforts and continuous efforts made DDA claim their unclaimed and open to encroachers over 65000 pieces of lands across Delhi. Domestic abuse allegations On 10 September 2015, Bharti was arrested on a domestic abuse case after his wife alleged he beat her for a prolonged period. A non-bailable warrant was also issued against him by a Delhi High Court. The Delhi High Court rejected his anticipatory bail plea and he finally surrendered at the Dwarka Police Station late at night on 29 September 2015 under directions from the Supreme Court. Bharti obtained conditional bail. On 07.05.2019 Delhi High Court quashed the FIR and dropped all the proceedings against Bharti in domestic violation case and since then they have been living together References External links Category:1974 births Category:Indian Institute of Technology Delhi alumni Category:Living people Category:People from Delhi Category:Aam Aadmi Party politicians from Delhi Category:Delhi MLAs 2013‚Äì2015 Category:Delhi MLAs 2015‚Äì2020 Category:Aam Aadmi Party candidates in the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election ","title":"Somnath Bharti"},{"id":"39379236","text":"Ahmadabad-e Harandi (, also Romanized as A·∏©madƒÅbƒÅd-e Harandƒ´; also known as A·∏©madƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Sharifabad Rural District, Koshkuiyeh District, Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran.

Rob Bishop (R-UT). The law outlines a swap in the ownership of mineral rights of certain pieces of land located in Utah. The United States federal government, Utah's School and Institutional Trust Land Administration (SITLA), and the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation are all involved in the exchange. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on information provided by the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office, both public domain sources. The Hill Creek Cultural Preservation and Energy Development Act would authorize the state of Utah to relinquish for the benefit of the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation certain of its school trust or subsurface mineral lands south of the border between Grand County and Uintah County, Utah, in exchange for certain federal subsurface mineral lands north of that border. The bill sets out the details of a mineral rights swap between Utah's School and Institutional Trust Land Administration (SITLA), the federal government, and the Ute Indian Tribe. The Hill Creek Cultural Preservation and Energy Development Act establishes a framework under which this switch can take place. According to the Congressional Budget Office, about 18,000 acres are being considered in exchange for 18,000 different acres. In setting up the conditions for the swap the bill directs the Department of the Interior to reserve an overriding interest in a portion of the land being exchanged, namely that portion of the mineral estate composed of minerals subject to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act in the mineral lands conveyed to Utah. The bill also requires Utah to reserve, for the benefit of its school trust, an overriding interest in that portion of the mineral estate composed of minerals subject to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act in the mineral lands it relinquished to the federal government. Procedural history The Hill Creek Cultural Preservation and Energy Development Act was introduced into the House by Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT) on January 23, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and then to two of its subcommittees, the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. On April 24, 2013, it was ordered to be reported by Unanimous Consent by the House Committee on Natural Resources. The House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced on Friday May 10, 2013 that H.R. 1580 would be considered the following week. On May 15, 2013, the House voted in a voice vote to pass the bill. The bill was sent to the United States Senate and referred to the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. On July 9, 2014, the Senate voted to pass the bill with unanimous consent. On July 25, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. Debate and discussion Senator Orrin Hatch supported the bill, arguing that it \\"gives Utahns greater opportunity to manage the specified lands and structures as they see fit.\\" Hatch argued that the bill \\"creates an important new opportunity for energy in our state.\\" The Wilderness Society supported the bill. A spokesman said that \\"this legislation will help protect one of the most ecologically critical and culturally sensitive lands in the country\\".

DJH Niehaus appeared for the accused, at the request of the court; EA Logie appeared for the Crown. Judgment came down on August 30. The case revolved around a charge of malicious injury to property, where the accused, endeavouring to escape from a room into which he had broken, broke in a two a locked door. Since the accused had also been charged and convicted of housebreaking with intent to commit a crime to the prosecutor unknown, the question arose: Was there a splitting of charges? The court held that breaking into a room and breaking out of it are two separate and distinct incidents. There had, therefore, not been a splitting of charges.  Facts  The accused had been charged and convicted on two counts: # housebreaking with intent to commit a crime to the prosecutor unknown; and # malicious injury to property. The evidence showed that he had broken into a room where there were a number of persons sleeping, and that, when they were aroused by his presence, the accused, apparently in an effort to escape, had broken in two the door, which had been locked.  Judgment  On a review, the court held that the accused's conduct amounted to malicious injury to property, and that there had not been a splitting of charges, as the accused's breaking out was separate from the breaking-in in point of time and motive; they were separate and distinct incidents.

Feminism in the Netherlands began as part of the first-wave feminism movement during the 19th century. Later, the struggles of second-wave feminism in the Netherlands mirrored developments in the women's rights movement in other Western countries. Women in the Netherlands still have an open discussion about how to improve remaining imbalances and injustices they face as women. History Renaissance and Enlightenment The Republic of the Seven United Provinces, known as the Netherlands, was created through the Dutch War of Independence, which began in 1568 and ended with the Treaty of Westphalia. Women had a limited number of rights, including the right to enter contracts and the right to control their own dowries. Though they were still legally subordinate to men, widows such as Volcxken Diericx, an Antwerp publisher, and Aletta Hannemans, a Haarlem brewer, were allowed to continue their husband's business. Girls had no right to an education, and before widowhood, women were not allowed to own property or to participate in government. Early to Mid-19th century Industrialization in the Netherlands brought jobs to both men and women. Labour unions began organizing by the mid-19th century. In 1841, Barbera van Meerten-Schilperoort founded Hulpbetoon aan Eerlijke en Vlijtige Armoede, the first women's organization in the Netherlands. Middle- class women began to find paid employment, first in nursing. The first department store in the Netherlands opened in 1860, and women began finding jobs as retail clerks. Kindergartens, which had been pioneered in Germany, spread quickly in the Netherlands and needed a workforce of trained young women to staff them. To train young women to teach primary school, middle schools for girls were established in 1867. Young women with academic promise could petition for the right to be admitted to an all-male secondary school. Universities were closed to women until 1871, when Aletta Jacobs gained admittance to study medicine. She graduated as Europe's first modern woman physician. Jacobs also became prominent in the women's suffrage movement in the Netherlands. She opened the first women's birth control clinic in Amsterdam in 1882. First-wave feminists In the 1883 Dutch parliamentary elections, Aletta Jacobs petitioned for the right to vote, pointing out that she met all the legal criteria, but she was rejected from voting. This event triggered the women's suffrage movement in the Netherlands. The immediate result was an amendment to the voting rights of the Constitution in 1887, to specify \\"male\\" inhabitants of the Netherlands had the vote, adding another barrier to the women's suffrage. In 1888, the Vrije Vrouwenvereeniging (Free Women's Movement, or VVV) was founded. This was soon followed in 1894 by the creation of a sub-group within the organization, the Vereeniging vor Vrouwenkiesrecht (Organization of Women's Suffrage). Wilhelmina Drucker was less concerned about women winning emancipation‚Äîwhich she saw as easily attainable‚Äîthan women winning equal opportunity in the workplace, a struggle she saw as facing much more resistance from men. Yet, where other feminists in the country pressed for labour laws addressing the specific needs of women workers, Drucker was opposed. In Drucker's view, \\"The state should not interfere with men or with women, nor invent a fictive competition between men and women. It should solely recognize people; members of society.\\" Drucker was firmly on the radical edge of feminism in the Netherlands, but she gave speaking tours and published a popular feminist journal, Evolutie (Evolution). In 1899, she spearheaded a campaign to stop legislation that would ban women under 40 from jobs as teachers or civil servants; after a decade-long campaign, the bill was \\"crushed\\". Aletta Jacobs co-founded the International Women's Suffrage Alliance in 1902. File:Aletta Jacobs.jpgAletta Jacobs, physician and suffragette.

This was relatively early compared to most other European nations; only Finland and Sweden had given women the vote earlier. Women had in part gained the vote to a political compromise \\"package deal\\" between socialists, liberals, and \\"confessionalist\\" parties. The confessionalists supported state funding for private schools, typically belonging to a religious denomination. This compromise system in Dutch politics was known as Pillarisation. In the years after women's emancipation, the confessionalists came to dominate moral discourse in the Netherlands, and legislation in support of confessionalist moral views was enacted (prostitution banned, 1912; abortion prohibited, 1911; advertising for contraception criminalized). A healthy economy and a rising standard of living characterizes life in the Netherlands during the 1920s. Women, however, faced a backlash against women's rights which reached into the workplace. Women's rights groups multiplied. The international feminist organizations gained larger memberships as women worldwide continued to struggle for emancipation. Dutch women were active in such international organizations as: * League of Nations; * International Labour Organization; * International Council of Women; * IWSA/IAW, the International Women's Suffrage Alliance, after 1926 called the International Alliance of Women. Women were praised for their resilience throughout the Hunger Winter of 1944-5 when food and fuel were blocked by the Nazi military. A period of conservatism followed for several years, but two notable legal milestones were achieved during the 1950s: in 1955, the law changed so that women could no longer be forced from civil service jobs after marrying, and in 1956, married women became legally competent. The marriage bar was removed in 1957.The Economics of Imperfect Labor Markets: Second Edition, by Tito Boeri, Jan van Ours, pp. 105Dutch gender and LGBT-equality policy, 2013-162015 Review BPFA Report of the Netherlands Government Second-wave feminism A costume demonstration by the feminist group Dolle Mina (Mad Mina), 1970. A 1967 essay by Joke Kool- Smits, \\"The Discontent of Women\\", was published in De Gids and is credited with launching second-wave feminism in the Netherlands.http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/js/werk/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw.pdf The next year, a group of feminist men and women banded together to create the activist group Man-Vrouw-Maatschappij (Man-Woman society, or MVM). Its dual- gender composition made it rare among Western Second-wave feminist organizations, but it was similar to others in that its membership was predominantly middle or upper class and well-educated. Dissatisfied with the lobbying efforts of the MVM, a more radical group was inspired. The all-female Dolle Mina society was founded in 1969, naming itself \\"Mad Mina\\" after pioneering Dutch feminist Wilhelmina Drucker. Dolle Mina had success as a consciousness-raising force during the 1970s, mainly through its use of imaginative protests, such as an outdoor \\"Discrimination Fair\\" to draw attention to the issue of equal pay for equal work. The 1976 publication of Anja Meulenbelt's novel De Schaamte Voorbij (The Shame is Over) was another important piece of second-wave feminist writing in the Netherlands. The novel was confessional in tone, and made the connection between the body and language politics overt. In the late 1970s, the fight for access to abortion, rape crisis centres, and women's shelters became a dominant focus of the feminist movement. In 1980, the government was financially supporting 30 rape crisis centres in the Netherlands. During the 1970s, feminist periodicals multiplied, such as Dolle Mina, Vrouwen, Opzij, Serpentine, Vrouwenkrant, and Lover, and there were several feminist publishing houses in Amsterdam, the best known being De Bonte Was (1972) and Sara (1976). In 1982, an estimated 160 feminist groups were active in the Netherlands, covering 25% of Dutch towns. The 1980s saw many victories for the feminist movement, including the disintegration of the male breadwinner logic as the Netherlands began to prioritize re-gearing the welfare state in favor of incorporating women into the workforce. The Abortion Bill was passed in 1981, and came into force in 1984. In 1984 married women also obtained full legal equality in family law - prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband's opinion prevailed over the wife's regarding issues such as decisions on children's education and the domicile of the family.https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045ae0ehttp://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/Gender/publication/Netherlands_2015_Review_BPFA_Report_of_the_Netherlands_Government.pdf In 1991, the Netherlands removed the marital exemption form its rape law.http://www.bjutijdschriften.nl/tijdschrift/lawandmethod/2012/1/ReM_2212-2508_2012_002_001_005 In 2000, in a move which remains controversial, the Netherlands overhauled its legislation on prostitution, liberalizing the laws and legalizing regulated brothels (although prostitution in brothels had been de facto tolerated throughout the second part of the 20th century). Third-wave feminism Despite having won many legal and social battles over the course of the 20th century, Dutch feminists are not ready to claim victory. Feminist activity continues in the Netherlands, and gender equality continues to be a topic of discussion in organizations, and in the media. Areas of concern remain the low participation of women in full-time employment and their low presence in top executive positions,https://www.government.nl/topics/gender- equality/contents/womens-labour-force-participation violence against women,https://www.government.nl/topics/gender-equality/contents/safety-of- girls-and-women and discrimination against ethnic minority women.http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-NLD-CO-5.pdf From the 1970s onwards, the Netherlands has started promoting policies based on gender equality; and has once been described as having \\"the most extensive and comprehensive [sex equality apparatus] in Europe\\"; this is largely due to the appointment of a State Secretary to oversee an Emancipation Council launched in 1977, and its implementation of policies at the local level with help from feminist activists recruited into government positions. Women of colour have seen the need to create new organizations to advance gaps in meeting their needs: a Moroccan women's group was formed in 1992, and a Surinamese women's group was formed in 1996. Despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues, women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries. In the early 1980s, the Commission of the European Communities report Women in the European Community fount that \\"it is in the Netherlands (17.6%) and in Ireland (13.6%) that we see the smallest numbers of married women working and the least acceptance of this phenomenon by the general public\\". (pg 14).http://aei.pitt.edu/4560/1/4560.pdf In the following years the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but with most of the women working part time. Despite the government identifying this as a social problem in the 1990s, and introducing tax incentives to encourage women to find more paid employment, the opposite happened, and women found a way to use the tax incentives to reduce their working hours. In terms of balancing work and home life, parental leave is much more generous in Sweden, for example. There is currently a great deal of debate in the Netherlands over whether women simply prefer to care for their children themselves and work reduced hours, or if higher costs are holding women back from seeking further employment. Economist, lawyer and journalist Helen Mees wrote a book exploring the issue of women's low employment rate, called Weg met het deeltijdfeminisme (Away with Part-time Feminism) in 2005. She identified differences between Dutch and American culture that partially explain the discrepancy in working hours between women in the two nations. In her book, Mees discusses the American \\"marketization\\" of much of women's former household duties, such as using businesses for laundry, eating out, having groceries delivered, and other services, which are rarely available in the Netherlands. Childcare is the largest expense for two-income families in the Netherlands, and since it is customarily paid by the hour, this may provide an incentive for families to reduce childcare costs by having the mother do more child-minding and less paid employment. According to The Economist, fewer men had to fight in the World Wars of the 20th century, and so Dutch women did not experience working for pay at rates women in other countries did. The wealth of the country, coupled with the fact that \\"[Dutch] politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s\\" meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce.https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist- explains/2015/05/economist-explains-12 In 2011, the Netherlands, together with Germany and Austria, were identified by the European Commission as countries with a poor integration of women in the workforce; Jose Manuel Barroso stated \\"Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries.\\"http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-persistently-low- birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0 As of 2014, the Netherlands had the highest percentage of part-time women workers in the OECD. There has been criticism that the Netherlands has constructed a policy focused on emphasizing the alleged difference between 'liberated' ethnic Dutch women and 'oppressed' immigrant women, creating a discriminatory dichotomy of \\"us vs. them\\". The CEDAW committee stated that \\"[t]he Committee remains concerned about the persistence of gender-role stereotypes, in particular about immigrant and migrant women and men, both of which are portrayed as being backward and having traditional views about women, denying their right to full development.\\"http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-NLD- CO-5.pdf Violence against women remains a problem in the Netherlands: according to a 2014 study published by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, the Netherlands had the fourth highest prevalence rate of physical and sexual violence against women in Europe, with 45% of women having experienced such violence, which is well above the European average of 33%. The Netherlands was condemned by the European Court of Human Rights in 1985 in the case of X and Y v. the Netherlands, for inadequate prosecution of sexual violence.http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-57603#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-57603%22]} In 2015, the Netherlands ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention).http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full- list/-/conventions/treaty/210/signatures An important (and controversial) contemporary activist is Ayaan Hirsi Ali a Somali-born Dutch-American dual citizen activist, author, and politician.

Image geometry correction compensates for the distortion created by off-axis projector or screen placement or non-flat screen surface, by applying a pre-compensating inverse distortion to that image in the digital domain. Usually, Image geometry correction is applied such that equal areas of projection surface are perceived by the viewer map to equal areas in the source image. It can also be used to apply a special effect distortion. The term ‚ÄúImage‚Äù Geometry Correction, implying a static image, is slightly misleading. Image geometry correction applies to static or dynamic images (i.e. moving video). Overview Image geometry correction is generally implemented in 2 different ways: # Graphics Processing # Signal Processing Both techniques involve the real time execution of a spatial transformation from the input image to the output image, and both techniques require powerful hardware. The spatial transformation must be pre-defined for a particular desired geometric, and may be calculated by several different methods (more to follow). In Graphics Processing, the spatial transformation consists of a polygon mesh (usually triangles). The transformation is executed by texture mapping from the rectilinear mesh of the input image to the transformed shape of the destination image. Each polygon on the input image is thus applied to an equivalent (but transformed in shape and location) polygon in the output image. Graphics Processing based Image Geometry Correction, may be performed with inexpensive PC-based graphics controllers. The sophisticated software that uses the texture mapping hardware of a graphics controller is not standard, and is available only through vendors of specialty software (i.e. Mersive Technologies and Scalable Display Technologies). Graphics Processing based image geometry correction is very effective for content that originates in the PC. Its major drawback is that it is tied to the graphics controller platform, and cannot process signals that originate outside the graphics controller. In Signal Processing based image geometry correction, the spatial transformation consists of spatially defined 2-dimensional image re-sampling or scaling filter. The scaling operation is performed with different scaling ratios in different parts of the image, according to the defined transformation. Special care must be taken in the design of the scaling filter to ensure that spatial frequencies remain balanced in all areas of the image, and that the Nyquist criterion is met in all areas of the image. Signal Processing based image geometry correction is implemented by specially designed hardware in the projection system (i.e. IDT, Silicon Optix or GEO Semiconductor), or in stand-alone Video Signal Processors (i.e. Flexible Picture Systems). Signal Processing based image geometry correction is the most flexible form of this technology, enabling the correction of images that originate from ANY graphics controller platform. The drawback of Signal Processing based Image Geometry Correction is the extra expense of the hardware that is used to perform it. This extra expense can be mitigated by the inclusion of additional features (such as switching and Edge Blending in the Signal Processing based image geometry correction system). Calculation of the image geometry correction transformation The image geometry correction transformation can be calculated by predictive geometry (i.e. calculating exactly where an image should land on a regular surface such as sphere or a cylinder), or by an automatic optical feedback system (i.e. a camera can be used to evaluate the alignment of test images), or by user iteration (i.e. movement of points by an operator). In all methods, the transformation is generally described as a 2-dimensional array. The number of points in the 2-dimensional array that are required to do an accurate Image Geometry Correction depends on the surface involved. In the case of Keystone Correction, 4 points are all that are required to completely describe any projection situation. Applications The simplest application of image geometry correction is a specific case known as keystone distortion correction derived from Keystone effect. Keystone distortion gets its name from the symmetric trapezoidal distortion resulting from misaligned projector placement in the vertical dimension (although the term is generally applied to the non- symmetric quadrilateral shape that occurs from an off-axis projection in both dimensions). Keystone correction capabilities are now included in most projectors currently available on the market, allowing users to move the image both vertically and horizontally. Even with this feature, the degree of adjustment available is limited, and image quality may suffer. Keystone correction is ideal for simple business (i.e. conference room) adjustments. For more complex distortion correction, an external processor is required. Projector Stacking is an advanced form of keystone correction. In this application, two or more projectors are projected onto exactly the same surface. Since the two projectors cannot occupy exactly the same space, the output of each must be at least slightly corrected for Keystone Distortion. Passive 3D Projector Stacking provides precise alignment for 2 synchronized projectors that are supplying the left eye and right eye of a 3D application. Image Geometry Correction onto regular surfaces (such as spheres and cylinders) is the next level of complexity. Both these regular shapes are encountered frequently in Professional Audio Video (Pro AV) situations, in the form of domed or curved wall theatres. Other commonly encountered regular- shaped surfaces are subway walls and pillars. Image Geometry Correction onto irregular surfaces is the most advanced form. This type of projection is common in architectural installations such as casinos. Edge Blending is a companion application to image geometry correction. Edge blending enables the seamless projection of a large image using several overlapping projectors. Since Keystone Distortion (and frequently the requirement of projection onto a non-flat surface) is a built-in requirement of almost all Edge Blending systems, the pairing of Edge blending and image geometry correction in the same video signal processor is a natural one.

Her husband died in 1871 and she continued to act and sing before coming to America in 1875. After starring in German theatres around the United States she joined McCaull's Comic Opera Company in New York. Though English was her second language Mathilde was never hampered by her German accent. In reviewing her first Broadway performance in English (Oct. 1882) The New York Times stated \\"Her mastery of the adopted tongue is complete,\\" and a reviewer for the New York Sun (Dec. 1882) wrote \\"considering her nationality [Cottrelly] talks amazingly good English.\\" She became McCaull's leading comedian and wore many hats while with his company being a stage director, costume designer and, at times, handled the company's finances. McCaull made her a partner in the organization and musical comedy became her forte in the 1880s. In the 1890s and reaching her forties, Cottrelly settled into being a character actress which she remained for the rest of her career.Mathilde Cottrelly: North American Theatre Online Her talent and versatility kept her in demand (more than 30 productions between 1895 and 1926) and while many of her roles called for German or Yiddish accents she also won critical praise for portrayals of French, Spanish, and Swedish characters.

The march became more famous after its arrangement by who merged the march with the folk song about Doroshenko and Sahaidachny ().  Authenticity  It is widely accepted that the author of the famous ¬´Zaporizhia march¬ª alone is the Romny kobzar Yevhen Adamtsevych, a student of Musiy Oleksiyenko. In particular, it is confirmed via the correspondence of the researcher of kobzar performance O.Pravdyuk with the bandurist. In one letter to him Yevhen Adamtsevychwrote: In addition the Yevhen Adamtsevych first performed it in public - to the general public march became known in 1969 thanks to the performance of the blind bandurist. Subsequently, the march for orchestra was arranged by the chief conductor of the State Orchestra of National Instruments, Viktor Hutsal. The main theme of the composition consists of syncopation and descending melodies which in the technique national bandurists played with fingers sliding on the strings that was first used by a bandura player Hnat Khotkevych in instrumental accompaniment for his composition of folk song about Baida (¬´Poem of Baida¬ª, 1912), which he orchestrated in 1930.  Hypotheses regarding the origin of the work  # According to some assumptions, this work has been in the repertoire of teachers of Yevhen Adamtsevych , a respected expert on creativity and heritage of the artist's performance believed that this march was co-authored with Musiy Oleksiyenko, and that the learning student picked up the first part of march from his teacher and further continued the melody creation. This, in particular, is according to the memoirs of M.Oleksiyenko children. # Also, some sources mention Prokop Mormilya, a native talent from the village Yaduty, Borzna Raion, Chernihiv Oblast whom Yevhen Adamtsevych visited.Donchenko, A. History of Prokop Mormilya, a creator of the \\"Zaporozhian March\\". Chernihiv portal. August 17, 2009.  History  At first Yevhen Adamtsevych performed the march publicly in 1969 at a concert in the Kyiv Opera Theater of Taras Shevchenko. Eyewitnesses described the concert so: Yevhen Adamtsevych performed the march very expressively, vigorously, putting all his skills and emotional imagery. But the fact that he played by pinching lacked sonority. The conductor of State Orchestral Viktor Hutsal recollected: On April 12, 1970 the orchestra performed the remake of the march at first. The artistic director and conductor repeated the piece ou bis several times. Thus until 1974 the ¬´Zaporozhian March¬ª was performed at all concerts several times. The public always welcomed musicians standing. The composition became more famous after it was included in the soundtrack of the Borys Ivchenko film ¬´Propala Hramota¬ª (Vanished Document) in 1972. After performing the march at the Bolshoi Theatre (Moscow), it became an interest of party leaders who worried about a very heightened spiritual atmosphere among the audience. Communists have carefully studied the notes checking them with songs of Sich Riflemen. Although nothing was found, the march was banned. While V.Hutsal had to resign and join another group.  Performance  * Since 1984 the Zaporizhian March was allowed to be performed. It became to sound at rallies during the struggle for independence in the late 1980s. The sounds of the march assemble deputies in the Verkhovna Rada. * Under S.Tvorun arrangement it is also one of the main marches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine named ¬´Cossack march¬ª.

The app allows smartphone users to have a phone number that is anonymous and can be thrown away, for purposes such as online ads, while traveling, for business projects, or for dating profiles. Burner is a product of Ad Hoc Labs, an Atwater Village, Los Angeles-based software startup. The application's name is a reference to so-called \\"burner phones,\\" prepaid mobile phones that are replaced frequently. Burner phones have been used to control costs, reduce contractual obligations, and provide a degree of privacy in mobile phone use. They have been used in popular culture by drug dealers on The Wire and Breaking Bad, spies on Burn Notice, and agents in Mission: Impossible. The company has stated it would comply with law enforcement requests but would require valid search warrants.  History  The Burner application launched in August 2012 with angel investors including Techstars founder David Cohen and super angel Dave McClure in October 2012. Its iPhone application was released in August 2012, followed by an Android version in April 2013. In October 2013, Ad Hoc Labs raised an institutional funding round led by Founder Collective and Venrock, with participation from 500 Startups, Miramar Digital Ventures, TenOneTen Ventures and others. In an interview with Ars Technica, CEO Greg Cohn stated \\"we definitely think that communications, and telephony specifically, have been left behind by the wave of social innovation that‚Äôs been happening. The network should be smarter, it should be more socially aware and more privacy-aware.\\" He has also stated that the long- term vision for Burner is to build technology where phone numbers are smarter and act more like software.  Features  Burner allows users to make phone calls and VoIP calls and send SMS and MMS messages via phone numbers issued through the app. Users can purchase credits for temporary numbers or add an additional line for an ongoing subscription fee. The Burner Connections features, launched in October 2015, allow users to integrate their Burner numbers with third-party applications like Slack, Google Sheets, Dropbox, Evernote and SoundCloud. This functionality allows people to automatically archive SMS messages and images, program auto-responses, sync voicemails and more. In November 2015, Burner launched a way for developers to connect the app with various applications, like IFTTT, or create new custom integrations through the use of webhooks.  Finances  During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the group received between $350,000 and $1 million in federally backed small business loans from First Republic Bank as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The organization stated it would help them retain 86 employees.

Intended to offer structural simplifications when compared with monoplanes, it had a disappointing performance and was soon abandoned. Design and development In a long series of single-engine fighters built by Dewoitine from the D.1 of 1922 to the 1940 D.521, the Dewoitine D.15 was the only biplane. An attempt to design a competitive but structurally less complicated machine, it was a single bay biplane with wings of unequal span mounted without stagger, braced by pairs of outward sloping parallel interplane struts, cross wire bracing and N form cabane struts. Ailerons were fitted only on the longer, upper wing. In plan the unswept wings had constant chord and straight edges, ending in angled tips. They were metal structures, entirely fabric covered. The D.15's tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage was similar in plan and structure to the wing. The fin and rudder were triangular; the latter, mounted on a rudder post only just ahead of the tailplane trailing edge, extended down to the keel. The D.15's flat-sided fuselage had steel longerons and Duralumin tube cross members; the sides were fabric covered but the curved ventral and dorsal decking was metal. The front of its single seat open cockpit was at the wing trailing edge, though there was a small wing cut-out to assist his forward and upper vision. The fighter was powered by an upright Hispano-Suiza 12Ha liquid- cooled V-12 engine, driving a two-blade propeller. It had a fixed conventional undercarriage with a single axle enclosed within a wing-like fairing which was mounted on to the fuselage with forward, near vertical shock absorbing legs, torsionally strengthened by sloping, rearward struts. There was a tailskid. Two synchronised Vickers machine guns mounted on the fuselage fired through the propeller arc and two Darne machine guns were placed on the upper wing centre-section, firing over the propeller. The D.15 first flew on 13 August 1924 and demonstrated a lack of both lateral (yaw) and longitudinal (pitch) stability.

The house was built with an E-shaped floor plan, which may have been in honour of Queen Elizabeth I, who had recently died. The grounds were originally extensive, and included the whole of what is called Decoy (so named, because wildfowl were decoyed there to extend the house's larder), as well as a deer park. On 15 September 1625 King Charles I stayed at the house overnight on his way to Plymouth,O'Hagan, p. 35. to inspect the fleet. He returned a few days later and stayed for a further two nights. During the Civil War, Forde House gave shelter to Oliver Cromwell and Colonel Fairfax on 24 January 1646 before the second Siege of Exeter.O'Hagan, p. 45.

Both the 1st baronet and his wife Margaret Waller were buried at Wolborough. William of Orange stayed at the house in 1688 on the way to his coronation in London, having landed in Brixham a few days earlier. The Courtenays soon moved back to a restored Powderham Castle, where in particular William Courtenay, 1st Viscount Courtenay (1711-1762), the great-grandson of Margaret Waller,Vivian, pp.247-9 effected a major remodelling.Pevsner, p.694, esp. his remodelling and sub-division of the Great Hall to incorporate a grand staircase 1754-6 Forde House however remained a possession of the Courtenays until 1762 when the house was let to a succession of occupiers. =Tenants post 1762= Wise \\"Ford House near Newton Bushel, the residence of Ayshford Wise Esq.\\"; Engraving by J.

De-extinction, also known as resurrection biology, or species revivalism, is the process of generating an organism that is either an extinct species or resembles an extinct species. There are several ways to carry out the process of de-extinction. Cloning is the most widely proposed method, although genome editing and selective breeding have also been considered. Similar techniques have been applied to certain endangered species, in hopes to boost populations. The only method of the three that would provide an animal with the same genetic identity is cloning. There are both pros and cons to the process of de-extinction ranging from technological advancements to ethical issues. Methods Cloning Pictured above is the process used to clone the Pyrenean ibex in 2003. The tissue culture was taken from the last living, female Pyrenean ibex named Celia. The egg was taken from a goat (Capra hircus) and the nuclei removed to ensure the offspring was purely Pyrenean ibex. The egg was implanted into a surrogate goat mother for development. Cloning is a commonly suggested method for the potential restoration of an extinct species. It can be done by extracting the nucleus from a preserved cell from the extinct species and swapping it into an egg, without a nucleus, of that species' nearest living relative. The egg can then be inserted into a host from the extinct species‚Äô nearest living relative. It is important to note that this method can only be used when a preserved cell is available, meaning it would be most feasible for recently extinct species. Cloning has been used in science since the 1950s. One of the most well known clones is Dolly, the sheep. Dolly was born in the mid 1990s and lived a normal life until she experienced health complications that led to her death. Other animal species known to have been cloned include dogs, pigs, and horses.  Genome editing  Genome editing has been rapidly advancing with the help of the CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system. Viral DNA that was injected into the bacterium became incorporated into the bacterial chromosome at specific regions. These regions are called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, otherwise known as CRISPR. Since the viral DNA is within the chromosome, it gets transcribed into RNA. Once this occurs, the Cas9 binds to the RNA. Cas9 can recognize the foreign insert and cleaves it. This discovery was very crucial because now the Cas protein can be viewed as a scissor in the genome editing process. By using cells from a closely related species to the extinct species, genome editing can play a role in the de-extinction process. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. This results in a hybrid between the two species, since it is not completely one animal. Because it is possible to sequence and assemble the genome of extinct organisms from highly degraded tissues, this technique enables scientists to pursue de-extinction in a wider array of species, including those for which no well-preserved remains exist. However, the more degraded and old the tissue from the extinct species is, the more fragmented the resulting DNA will be, making genome assembly more challenging.  Back breeding  Back breeding is a form of selective breeding. As opposed to breeding animals for a trait to advance the species in selective breeding, back breeding involves breeding animals for an ancestral characteristic that may not be seen throughout the species as frequently. This method can recreate the traits of an extinct species, but the genome will differ from the original species. Back breeding, however, is contingent on the ancestral trait of the species still being in the population in any frequency. Iterative evolution A natural process of de-extinction is iterative evolution. This process occurs when a species becomes extinct, but then reappears after some amount of time. An example of this process occurred with the white-throated rail. This flightless bird became extinct approximately 136,000 years ago due to an unknown event that caused sea levels to rise, which resulted in the demise of the species. The species reappeared about 100,000 years ago when sea levels dropped, allowing the bird to evolve once again as a flightless species on the island of Aldabra, where it is found to the present day.The bird that came back from the deadExtinct species of bird came back from the dead, scientists findThis Bird Went Extinct and Then Evolved Into Existence Again Also see Elvis taxon.  Advantages of de- extinction  The technologies being developed for de-extinction could lead to large advancements in scientific technology and process. This includes the advancement of genetic technologies that are used to improve the cloning process for de-extinction. The technologies could be used to prevent endangered species from going extinct. The study of reintroduced species could also lead to advancements in science. By studying previously extinct animals, cures to diseases could be discovered. Revived species may support conservation initiatives by acting as \\"flagship species\\" to generate public enthusiasm and funds for conserving entire ecosystems. If de-extinction is prioritized it would lead to the improvement of current conservation strategies. Conservation would be necessary in order to reintroduce a species into the ecosystem. Conservation efforts would be taken initially until the revived population can sustain itself in the wild. De-extinction could also help improve ecosystems that had been destroyed by human development by introducing an extinct species back into an ecosystem to revive it. It is also a question of if revive species that humans drove to extinction is required to right humanity‚Äôs wrong in driving a species into extinction to begin with.  Disadvantages of de-extinction  The reintroduction of extinct species could have a negative impact on extant species and their ecosystem. Reintroducing an extinct species into its former ecosystem could now be seen as classifying it as being an invasive species. This could lead to the extinction of living species due to competition for food or other competitive exclusion. It could also lead to the extinction of prey species if they have more predators in an environment that had few predators before the reintroduction of an extinct species. If a species has been extinct for a long period of time the environment they are introduced to could be wildly different from the one that they can survive in. The changes in the environment due to human development could mean that the species may not survive if reintroduced into that ecosystem. A species could also become extinct again after de-extinction if the reasons for its extinction are still a threat. The woolly mammoth would be hunted by poachers just like elephants for their ivory and could go extinct again if this were to happen. Or, if a species is reintroduced into an environment with disease it has no immunity to the reintroduced species could be wiped out by a disease that current species can survive. De-extinction is a very expensive process. Bringing back one species can cost millions of dollars. The money for de-extinction would most likely come from current conservation efforts. These efforts could be weakened if funding is taken from conservation and put into de-extinction. This would mean that critically endangered species would start to go extinct faster because there are no longer resources that are needed to maintain their populations. Also since cloning techniques will never produce a species completely identical to the extinct one the reintroduction of the species may not have the environment benefits that conservationists hope it would. They may not have the same role in the food chain that they did before and therefore cannot restore damaged ecosystems.  Current candidates for de-extinction  The woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is a candidate for de-extinction using either cloning or genome editing.  Woolly mammoth  The existence of preserved soft tissue remains and DNA from woolly mammoths has led to the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Two methods have been proposed to achieve this. The first would be to use the cloning process, because even the most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough DNA intact to guide the production of an embryo. The second method involves artificially inseminating an elephant egg cell with preserved sperm of the mammoth. The resulting offspring would be an elephant‚Äìmammoth hybrid. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth could be produced. However, sperm cells of modern mammals are typically potent for up to 15 years after deep-freezing, which could hinder this method. In 2008, a Japanese team found usable DNA in the brains of mice that had been frozen for 16 years. They hope to use similar methods to find usable mammoth DNA. In 2011, Japanese scientists announced plans to clone mammoths within six years. In March 2014, the Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists reported that blood recovered from a frozen mammoth carcass in 2013 would now provide a good opportunity for cloning the woolly mammoth. Another way to create a living woolly mammoth would be to migrate genes from the mammoth genome into the genes of its closest living relative, the Asian elephant, to create hybridized animals with the notable adaptations that it had for living in a much colder environment than modern day elephants. This is currently being done by a team led by Harvard geneticist George Church. The team has made changes in the elephant genome with the genes that gave the woolly mammoth its cold-resistant blood, longer hair, and extra layer of fat. According to geneticist Hendrik Poinar, a revived woolly mammoth or mammoth-elephant hybrid may find suitable habitat in the tundra and taiga forest ecozones. George Church has hypothesized the positive effects of bringing back the extinct woolly mammoth would have on the environment, such as the potential for reversing some of the damage caused by global warming.Church, George. \\"George Church: De-Extinction Is a Good Idea.\\" Scientific American. Scientific American, a Division of Nature America, Inc., 1 Sept. 2013. Web. 13 Oct. 2016. He and his fellow researchers predict that mammoths would eat the dead grass allowing the sun to reach the spring grass; their weight would allow them to break through dense, insulating snow in order to let cold air reach the soil; and their characteristic of felling trees would increase the absorption of sunlight. In an editorial condemning de-extinction, Scientific American pointed out that the technologies involved could have secondary applications, specifically to help species on the verge of extinction regain their genetic diversity.  Pyrenean ibex  The Pyrenean ibex was a subspecies of Spanish ibex that lived on the Iberian peninsula. While it was abundant up to the Medieval times, over-hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries led to its demise. In 1999, only a single female named Celia was left alive in Ordesa National Park. Scientists captured her, took a tissue sample from her ear, collared her, then released her back into the wild, where she lived until she was found dead in 2000, having been crushed by a fallen tree. In 2003, scientists used the tissue sample to attempt to clone Celia and resurrect the extinct subspecies. Despite having successfully transferred nuclei from her cells into domestic goat egg cells and impregnating 208 female goats, only one came to term. The baby ibex that was born had a lung defect, and lived for only 7 minutes before suffocating from being incapable of breathing oxygen. Nevertheless, her birth was seen as a triumph and has been considered to have been the first de- extinction. In late 2013, scientists announced that they would again attempt to recreate the Pyrenean ibex. A problem to be faced, in addition to the many challenges of reproduction of a mammal by cloning, is that only females can be produced by cloning the female individual Celia, and no males exist for those females to reproduce with. This could potentially be addressed by breeding female clones with the closely related Southeastern Spanish ibex, and gradually creating a hybrid animal that will eventually bear more resemblance to the Pyrenean ibex than the Southeastern Spanish ibex. The aurochs, with a human for scale.  Aurochs  The aurochs was widespread across Eurasia, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent during the Pleistocene, but only the European aurochs (Bos primigenius primigenius) survived into historic times. This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings, such as Lascaux and Chauvet cave in France, and was still widespread during the Roman era. Following the fall of the Roman empire, overhunting of the aurochs by nobility caused its population to dwindle to a single population in the Jaktor√≥w forest in Poland, where the last wild one died in 1627. However, because the aurochs is ancestral to most modern cattle breeds, it is possible for it to be brought back through selective or back breeding. The first attempt at this was by Heinz and Lutz Heck using modern cattle breeds, which resulted in the creation of Heck cattle. This breed has been introduced to nature preserves across Europe; however, it differs strongly from the aurochs in both physical characteristics and behavior, and modern attempts have tried to create an animal that is nearly identical to the aurochs in morphology, behavior, and even genetics. The TaurOs Project aims to recreate the aurochs through selectively breeding primitive cattle breeds over a course of twenty years to create a self-sufficient bovine grazer in herds of at least 150 animals in rewilded nature areas across Europe. This organization is partnered with the organization Rewilding Europe to help restore balance to European nature. A competing project to recreate the aurochs is the Uruz Project by the True Nature Foundation, which aims to recreate the aurochs through a more efficient breeding strategy and through genome editing, in order to decrease the number of generations of breeding needed and the ability to quickly eliminate undesired traits from the new aurochs population. It is hoped that the new aurochs will reinvigorate European nature by restoring its ecological role as a keystone species, and bring back biodiversity that disappeared following the decline of European megafauna, as well as helping to bring new economic opportunities related to European wildlife viewing.  Quagga  The quagga (Equus quagga quagga) is a subspecies of the plains zebra that was distinct in that it was striped on its face and upper torso, but its rear abdomen was a solid brown. It was native to South Africa, but was wiped out in the wild due to overhunting for sport, and the last individual died in 1883 in the Amsterdam Zoo. However, since it is technically the same species as the surviving plains zebra, it has been argued that the quagga could be revived through artificial selection. The Quagga Project aims to recreate the animal through the selective or back breeding of plains zebras. It also aims to release these animals onto the western Cape once an animal that fully resembles the quagga is achieved, which could have the benefit of eradicating non-native trees.  Thylacine  The last known thylacine, named \\"Benjamin\\", died from neglect in the Hobart Zoo in 1936. The thylacine was native to the Australian mainland, Tasmania and New Guinea. It is believed to have become extinct in the 20th century. The thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the Australian mainland before British settlement of the continent. The last known thylacine, named Benjamin, died at the Hobart Zoo, on September 7, 1936. He is believed to have died as the result of neglect‚Äîlocked out of his sheltered sleeping quarters, he was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian weather: extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night.Paddle (2000), p. 195. Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced on July 10, 1936, roughly 59 days before the last known specimen died in captivity. In December 2017 it was announced in Nature Ecology and Evolution that the full nuclear genome of the thylacine had been successfully sequenced, marking the completion of the critical first step toward de-extinction that began in 2008, with the extraction of the DNA samples from the preserved pouch specimen. The Thylacine genome was reconstructed by using the genome editing method. The Tasmanian devil was used as a reference for the assembly of the full nuclear genome. Andrew J. Pask from the University of Melbourne has stated that the next step toward de-extinction will be to create a functional genome, which will require extensive research and development, estimating that a full attempt to resurrect the species may be possible as early as 2027.  Passenger pigeon  Martha, the last known passenger pigeon The passenger pigeon numbered in the billions before being wiped out due to commercial hunting and habitat loss. The non-profit Revive & Restore obtained DNA from the passenger pigeon from museum specimens and skins; however, this DNA is degraded because it is so old. For this reason, simple cloning would not be an effective way to perform de-extinction for this species because parts of the genome would be missing. Instead, Revive & Restore focuses on identifying mutations in the DNA that would cause a phenotypic difference between the extinct passenger pigeon and its closest living relative the band-tailed pigeon. In doing this, they can determine how to modify the DNA of the band- tailed pigeon to change the traits to mimic the traits of the passenger pigeon. In this sense, the de-extinct passenger pigeon would not be genetically identical to the extinct passenger pigeon, but it would have the same traits. The de-extinct passenger pigeon hybrid is expected to be ready for captive breeding by 2024 and released into the wild by 2030. Future potential candidates and their proxy for de-extinction A ‚ÄúDe-extinction Task Force‚Äù was established in April 2014 under the auspices of the Species Survival Commission (SSC) and charged with drafting a set of Guiding Principles on Creating Proxies of Extinct Species for Conservation Benefit to position the IUCN SSC on the rapidly emerging technological feasibility of creating a proxy of an extinct species.

Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (the 'BABY-DRY' case)Procter & Gamble Company v. Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, Case C-383/99 P, 2001 Eur. Ct. Rpts. 0000 (Eur. Ct. Just. 20 September 2001) is a case before the European Court of Justice about the registration of 'BABY-DRY' as a trademark for baby diapers. OHIM refused the registration of the brand as a community mark saying that 'BABY-DRY' wasn't distinctive, but instead that it was descriptive without a secondary meaning. The Court ruled that trademarks consisting of certain word combinations not used in a common phraseology may be deemed creations, bestowing distinctive power on the trademark. If the relevant goods or services or their essential characteristics are so formed, then they may be refused registration on the grounds that such marks are solely descriptive and non-distinctive.  Background  Procter & Gamble filed an application to OHIM to re-register 'BABY-DRY' as trademark of baby diapers. The OHIM examiners refused the registration on the terms that 'BABY‚ÄìDRY' was too descriptive a name. Procter & Gamble argued that the purpose of diapers is to keep babies dry, therefore this name would be suitable in trademark. OHIM insisted that 'BABY-DRY' was also devoid of distinctive character and thereby could not be registered under Article 7(1)(b) and (c) of Regulation number 40/94. The Court of First Instance confirmed this decision and agreed that 'BABY-DRY' \\"merely conveyed to consumers the intended purpose of the goods but exhibited no additional feature to render the sign distinctive.\\" In reversing the Court of First Instance, the ECJ first noted that Article 7(1) and Article 12 of Regulation No. 40/94 should be read together and adopted a very narrow interpretation of descriptiveness in evaluating the suitability of registered marks. Procter & Gamble claimed that marks composed of signs or indications satisfying that definition [of descriptiveness] should not be refused registration unless they lack additional signs and indications, and the purely descriptive signs or indications of which they are composed are not presented or configured in a manner that distinguishes the resultant whole from the usual way of designating the goods or services concerned, or their essential characteristics. Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM) said that descriptiveness must be determined not only in relation to each word taken separately but also in relation to the goods. Any perceptible difference between the combination of words submitted for registration and the terms used in common parlance of the relevant class of consumers to designate the goods or services or their essential characteristics is apt to confer distinctive character on the word combination enabling it to be registered as a trade mark.  The court‚Äòs decision  The ECJ held that while the mark is registered based on a ‚ÄúSyntactical change,‚Äù and each of the two words in the combination may form part of expressions used in everyday speech to describe the function of diapers, their juxtaposition is not a familiar English expression with respect to diapers and that the \\"BABY-DRY\\" mark was sufficiently distinctive and could be trademark subject matter. Article 7(1)(c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community trademark (OJ 1994 L 11, p. 1) in adopting its decision of 31 July 1998 (Case R 35/1998-1)  Related case  Chiemsee Produktions v. BootsWindsurfing Chiemsee Produktions - und Vertriebs GmbH (WSC) v. Boots- und Segelzubeh√∂r Walter Huber & Franz Attenberger, Cases C 108/97 and C 109/97 (ECJ, May 4, 1999) is an ECJ trademark decision, ruling that geographic marks can be registered, as long as the public relates that mark to the trademark owner rather than the geographic area. In some international systems of trademark law, the mark that has a geographic place as a trademark is insufficiently distinctive.

She acquired her bachelor's degree at the University of Ibadan in Ibadan, Nigeria and went on to pursue her graduate degree in Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. Oyewumi's interdisciplinary work foregrounds an African vantage point that remains largely underrepresented in academia. Much of her academic research and writing has used African experiences to illuminate theoretical questions pertinent to a wide range of disciplines including sociology, political science, women studies, religion, history, and literature, all in an effort to broaden scholarly understanding to include non-Western cultures. In all of her work, Oyeronke Oyewumi attempts to provide a more nuanced understanding of these societies, thereby avoiding reductionist formulations. In her 1997 monograph, The Invention of Women: Making an African Sense of Western Gender Discourses, she offers a postcolonial feminist critique of Western dominance in African studies. She explains that in spite of vast amounts of academic research claiming otherwise, the stratification of gender in Yoruba culture is entirely a colonial legacy. The book won the American Sociological Association's 1998 Distinguished Book Award in the Gender and Sex category.  The Invention of Women  In the Invention of Women, Oyewumi presents modern Yoruba gender stratification as a Western colonial construct. Through this deconstruction, she introduces an alternate method of understanding both Western and Yoruba cultures. She begins by naming biological determinism as central to Western understanding of gender. This idea that biological differences serve as an organizing principle for societies is a Western philosophy that doesn't transfer to Yoruba societies which do not use the body as the basis for any social roles. Nonetheless, Oyewumi explains how colonial institutions went onto impose this biological understanding of gender onto the Yoruba. Additionally, she tackles the incongruities in feminist theory that assert gender as a social construct and the subjugation of women as universal. Oyewumi argues to the contrary that gender was never socially constructed in Yoruba society and relative age was instead the main organizing principle. > 'If anything, my work is the ultimate evidence about the fact that gender is > indeed socially constructed. It didn't come from heaven, it didn't come from > nature, there are these categories that are created, historically and > culturally. What my work actually does is to affirm the idea that gender is > socially constructed'. According to Nigerian writer Bibi Bakare-Yusuf, while Oyewumi's work rightfully challenges gender stratification as a Western import, her conclusion is based on the faulty reasoning of language determinism. Oyewumi heavily relies on the lack of gendered expressions and the overwhelming presence of age expressions in Yoruba language to prove that these categorizations are respectively familiar and unfamiliar to this society. However, Bakare-Yusuf argues that the threat of mistranslation works both ways. Just as there are less systems of gendering among the Yoruba, there could be less systems of ageing in Western cultures. Oyewumi's work should serve as a naming of culturally specific systems but not as a testimony that these systems cannot be exchanged and translated.

Pope holds the record of the longest sitting justice in Texas Supreme Court history, having served for 38 years. At the time of his 100th birthday, he was the oldest living former Chief Justice of any supreme court in the United States, as well as the longest living chief justice of any supreme court of any state in United States history.  Early life  Pope was born in Abilene, Texas to Dr. Andrew Jackson Pope Sr., a physician, and Ruth Adelia Taylor, a native of Nebraska. He is a descendant of Andrew Jackson Berry, who fought at the Battle of San Jacinto in the Texas Revolution. After completing high school in Abilene in 1930, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Abilene Christian College (now Abilene Christian University) in 1934, where he had served as Students' Association President. Pope then served as a student editor of the Texas Law Review at the University of Texas School of Law, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws degree and in 1937 was licensed by the bar. In 1938, he married Allene Nichols, an elementary school teacher and graduate of the University of Texas whom he met while attending law school; the couple had two sons.  Career   Early legal career  After obtaining his license to practice law in Texas in 1937, Pope \\"joined his uncle, former state representative Walter E. Pope,\\" at his law firm in Corpus Christi. His practice consisted of both civil and criminal matters, such as creditors' rights, oil and gas, personal injury, and family law. He went on to manage his uncle's business, the Highway Transportation Company, a passenger \\"bus line which operated between Houston, Corpus Christi, and San Antonio.\\" During this time, he was engaged in the legal interpretation of the new transportation regulatory laws, as well as New Deal labor laws. When the United States entered World War II, Pope joined the Naval Reserve in 1944. He served on the legal staff of the Naval Air Training Station in Corpus Christi, as well as on stations in Washington, D.C. and San Diego, until his discharge in 1946.  Judge and legal scholar  = District Judge = In late 1946 Pope was appointed by Democratic Governor Coke R. Stevenson to fill the unexpired term of Judge Allen Wood of the 94th District Court. Governor Stevenson's successor, Beauford H. Jester, then appointed Pope to Judge Wood's four-year term, which began January 1, 1947. He became Texas' youngest district judge at the time when he sat on the bench at 33 years of age. During his time on the district court bench, Pope began writing for and lecturing at legal institutes and before bar associations across South Texas. His concerns included legal ethics, trial administration, best practices for presenting and excluding evidence, and the Texas jury system. On several occasions he was appointed to other regional courts to assist when another judge was recused from presiding. = Court of Appeals Justice = In 1950 the Nueces County Bar Association prepared a resolution urging him to campaign for the 4th Court of Civil Appeals in San Antonio. Since 1892, of the fifteen judges who had served on that court, all but five had come from San Antonio. The legal community of Nueces County and the Rio Grande Valley counties hoped to change that trend by nominating and actively campaigning for the young judge., After winning the primary in July, Pope was appointed to the 4th Court of Appeals' bench by Governor Allan Shivers to replace Justice Lorenz Broeter, who had resigned. Pope sat on the court until 1950, whereupon he began serving his own six-year term, with voters subsequently re-electing him to an additional two terms, for a total of 14 years., In 1961 Pope's judicial review of water rights derived from Spanish and Mexican land grants in the case State v. Valmont Plantations set a legal precedent which would thereafter set the standard for the adjudication of Texas water law. = Supreme Court Justice = In December 1963, Pope declared his intention to run for a vacancy position on the Texas Supreme Court, after receiving 80 petitions from 55 Texas counties with over 2,000 signatures of attorneys pledging their support, and in 1964 he was elected an associate justice. During his tenure as an associate justice, he spearheaded an initiative with the State Bar of Texas to institute a program for continuing statewide judicial education, and to develop judicial ethics rules. His efforts resulted in both compulsory continuing judicial education and the Court's adoption of The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct in 1974. He was also directly involved in the creation of the Texas State Law Library in 1971, and served on the Friends of the State Law Library Board of Directors. = Supreme Court Chief Justice = When Joe R. Greenhill resigned as Chief Justice in October 1982, Governor William P. Clements appointed Pope to succeed Greenhill. As a Republican, Clements had crossed party lines to appoint Pope, a lifelong Democrat. However, when Democrat Mark White was elected governor that November, a group of 14 Democratic legislators in the Texas Senate publicly stated that they would \\"bust\\" all lame-duck appointments by the outgoing Republican governor regardless of qualifications. The Democratic senators attempted to negotiate terms to keep true to their statement of blocking all of the Republican's appointments, while also preserving the power of the Chief Justice position for the Democratic party. However, Pope refused to promise a retirement or interim-only judgeship, saying: \\"The citizens of Texas do not want their Chief Justice, or any judge, to make a deal to get a job. If he'll make a deal to get a job, he may keep on making deals to keep that job.\\" At a news conference in early 1983, Governor White stated that he did not oppose Pope's confirmation; and in February the Senate voted 29‚Äì2 in approval. After federal cuts to legal-assistance financing in the early 1980s, as Chief Justice he advocated a way for Texas to guarantee income to finance legal assistance for the poor by using pooled trust-account interest. This program, known as Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (IOLTA), is now used in every U.S. state.  Later life and death  Upon his 1985 retirement Pope had written over 700 opinions for the Supreme Court, with an additional 500 opinions as a district judge and court of appeals justice. Although he had served as a judge for over 38 years, 21 of those years on the Texas Supreme Court, nearing the Court's mandatory retirement age in 1985 Chief Justice Pope wryly commented: \\"Just about the time I was getting the hang of being a judge, I had to retire.\\" In 1989 Abilene Christian University established the Jack Pope Fellows Program \\"to offer scholarships to ACU students pursuing public service careers.\\" The interdisciplinary program gives students with \\"good minds and character\\" public service educational opportunities in and out of the classroom. Also in 1989, Pope co-founded the non-profit Texas Center for Legal Ethics with other former Chief Justices Joe R. Greenhill and Robert W. Calvert. Its mission is to promote the values contained in the Texas Lawyers‚Äô Creed of Professionalism.> In 2011, at age ninety-eight, he wrote a memoir called My Little United Nations: A Team Approach to Growing Older and Wiser and Having Fun Along the Way‚Äî an account of staying physically and emotionally healthy, despite increasing age and the death of his wife in 2004, with the help of a diverse team of caregivers from around the world. On May 28, 2013, Governor Rick Perry signed into law House Bill 1445, which raised the limit on civil penalties and restitution collected by the Attorney General's Office eligible for supporting legal assistance for the indigent to $50 million per year. The Legislature called the law the Chief Justice Jack Pope Act, in honor of his earlier work championing the IOLTA program which provides legal assistance for the poor. The Act came as a response to shrinking returns under that program. Pope died on 25 February 2017 at the age of 103. He was survived by his two sons, three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.CHIEF JUSTICE JACK POPE, 1913-2017 By the time of his retirement in 1985, Pope had written more than a thousand legal opinions. Upon Pope's passing, Texas Chief Justice Nathan Hecht, a Republican, called him \\"a judicial icon. His hard work, scholarship, common sense, humor, and integrity are legendary. No Texas judge has ever been more committed to serving the rule of law and the cause of justice. He was my mentor, role model, counselor, and most especially my friend. Texas has lost a great, great man.\\"\\"Former Texas chief justice dies at 103\\", San Antonio Express-News, February 26, 2017, p. A2.  Awards  In 2009 he received the TCLE's inaugural Chief Justice Jack Pope Professionalism Award, \\"presented annually to both an appellate judge and an appellate lawyer who 'epitomize the highest level of professionalism and integrity.'\\" On September 22, 2010 the judicial section of the State Bar of Texas presented him with its inaugural Judicial Lifetime Achievement Award at its Annual Judicial Conference in Corpus Christi. On April 18, 2013 Pope was honored with a ceremony recognizing his 100th birthday in the Texas House of Representatives within the Texas State Capitol. The House passed a resolution in his honor and \\"heard words of praise from four U.S. presidents, as well as the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices.\\"  References  Category:1913 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Abilene Christian University alumni Category:American centenarians Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:Chief Justices of the Texas Supreme Court Category:People from Abilene, Texas Category:Texas Democrats Category:Texas lawyers Category:Texas state court judges Category:Justices of the Texas Supreme Court Category:United States Navy reservists Category:University of Texas School of Law alumni Category:Writers from Texas ","title":"Jack Pope"},{"id":"39380015","text":"Khaleqabad (, also Romanized as KhƒÅleqƒÅbƒÅd; also known as KhƒÅleqƒÅbƒÅd-e Razavƒ´) is a village in Bahreman Rural District, Nuq District, Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran.

The play is about five women whose jobs at a County Donegal, Ireland, shirt factory are under threat. It features only two male characters, and these only appear in two scenes. The Factory Girls was first performed at the Abbey Theatre in 1982 and was the play that brought McGuinness to prominence.  Characters  Ellen, in her fifties Rebecca, in her late twenties Rosemary, sixteen Una, in her sixties Vera, in her early thirties Bonner, in his forties Rohan, in his late twenties  Synopsis  Scene One The show starts on a Wednesday morning with ‚ÄúEllen, Vera, Rebecca and Una seated on their benches working‚Äù (McGuinness 7). They are set in the inspection room of the factory with at least enough desks, chairs, and lamps for the five women. As for the geography of the factory, the inspection room is below Rohan's office and little else is known as to the layout. The women begin the show complaining about Rosemary's consistent tardiness. Among the complaints we see a transition of focus from Rosemary to the factory's many labor injustices. The dialogue among the women teaches us of the poor lighting, the cheap material and the unachievable work rate imposed by the factory's manager, Rohan, under which the factory employees are forced to work. Rosemary finally arrives and is greeted by sharp words of correction. Despite the effort to reprimand Rosemary the women fall quickly back into a lighter air with one another. Throughout scene one we see a consistency of playful jests among the women. The teasing and prodding brings a familial nature among the group. We learn about each woman's current or past love lives, with particular mention on Vera's current abusive relationship with her husband. The scene closes with Ellen and Una jabbing at one another and discussing the lengths the women go to guide Rosemary. Scene Two Scene two opens at lunchtime later that day. Rosemary is alone combing her hair while sitting on Ellen's stool (McGuinness 21). Ellen enters with prompt instruction for Rosemary to remove herself from Ellen's workspace. Rosemary and Ellen engage in dialogue as Ellen teases Rosemary about losing her hair. Ellen offers the only possible solution to prevent hair loss is to wash her hair in ‚ÄúOld maid‚Äôs piss‚Äù (McGuinness 22). After a few joking lines between the two, Rosemary takes the initiative to ask Ellen about redundancies and pay-offs. The audience learns that the labor union isn‚Äôt supporting the factory workers and will turn a blind eye toward the unrealistic work rate put upon the women. Despite the expansive potential for redundancies, Ellen falsely comforts Rosemary and uses Rosemary's concern to threaten her to arrive on time to work. She also counsels to say her prayers for necessary strength. The other women enter the stage and begin working. Upon Vera's entrance she informs Ellen that Rohan has requested Ellen in his office and that she ‚Äúbetter go up. It was urgent.‚Äù The audience is told that when Rohan wants to see Ellen ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs on the cards‚Äù (McGuinness 26). While Ellen is in with Rohan the other women fret and hypothesize the implications of Ellen's visit. The women work themselves up to receive the worst news. Ellen returns from visiting with Rohan and informs the room, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having a meeting with him and Bonner from the union tomorrow at eleven. I know no more, so ask no more‚Äù (McGuinness 29). Ellen closes the scene by having a private conversation to warn her of what will soon take place. She tells her, ‚ÄúYou better start saying your prayers‚Äù (McGuinness 29). Scene Three The scene begins just a few minutes prior to 11 AM on Thursday. The women are anxious about the upcoming meeting. They make a brief plan of attack with Vera starting off and Ellen guiding the conversation among the group (McGuinness 31). Andy Bonner and Rohan enter with brief pleasantries. Rohan addresses Ellen by confronting her about not meeting in the office. Ellen explains that she will have any necessary conversation among all of the inspection women so that they can ‚Äúspeak to all of [them] or none of [them]‚Äù (McGuinness 32). Rohan dives into declaring the factory's problems: Needing to get twice the work in half the time, losing client contracts, having a flooded market, and dealing with the recession (McGuinness 33). The interaction escalates as Rohan declares he needs a dozen shirt in thirteen minutes. The women explode in disgust and outrage. They boldly protest the unrealistic expectation and reject the responsibility to fulfill such a standard. Through all of the tension Ellen offers escape by demanding the women receive the work break that is being withheld due to this disastrous meeting. Bonner and Rohan allow the women to leave. The audience will see a brief interaction between Bonner and Rohan in that Bonner makes certain that Rohan will not attack his authority and helps Rohan understand that Bonner's position is guaranteed, whereas Rohan's position can change quite easily. Bonner offers a bit of advice on how to deal with the women and leaves Rohan to his factory. The scene closes with Rohan floundering while considering his options. Scene Four Scene four begins with a change of pace from the previous ending by having Rosemary once again alone on stage; this time reading Bunty. Rebecca enters, acknowledges Rosemary's lack of attention, and sneaks up behind her to scare her. Among teasing and joking Rebecca learns of Rosemary's love of horse stories (McGuinness 43). Rebecca counsels Rosemary to mind her own business, take the money the company will offer and ‚Äústeal a horse [to] release the gypsy in [her] soul‚Äù (McGuinness 45). Una enters and shifts the dialogue towards Ellen's and Vera's absence. Rebecca, Rosemary, and Una determine they are going to go to Una's for some tea. They are not up to working amidst the morning's events. Just before they are able to leave Vera enters, quite apparently, under the influence of some alcohol. Vera tells the group that she and Ellen were at a pub in-the-which secrets were established that would eventually be shared with the group by Ellen. Upon Ellen's entrance we see her in an unnatural frivolity despite the morning's events. Ellen clearly has a plan in the works. She invites the girls to leave with her where they‚Äôll ‚Äúall be moving up in the world.‚Äù They all exit singing ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre off to see the wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz‚Äù (McGuinness 49). Scene Five Frank McGuinness in his instruction has the set changed to feature: > The office. Two doors. One leads to a toilet. Another leads to the factory > floor. Two desks. On each a telephone. Behind each a swivel chair. Near to > the door leading to the factory floor a large filing cabinet. On the smaller > desk a call system apparatus. On the wall, framed, Mr. Rohan‚Äôs B. Comm. (49) Ellen is first to enter the room on this Friday afternoon. She surveys the office, exits to prompt the other women to follow, and reenters with suitcases and other items to sustain several nights‚Äô stay. Una is the excessively prepared as she's brought a steamer trunk full of all assortments of supplies. With all of the women and supplies in the room they move the filing cabinet in front of the factory entrance door and blockade it from exit or entrance capacity. Ellen takes a prepared statement and announces over the intercom system: > Good afternoon, ladies. This is the representative of the action committee, > consisting of the examiners and their message girl. We have decided to take > action over proposed unfair working conditions. Our first step is the > takeover of the office until such times as better conditions are offered. > This is our last communication with the outside world until then. Good > afternoon and good luck. (51) > The women then continue unpacking ‚Äúfood, clothes, cigarettes, crockery, cutlery, pots, a kettle, two small gas canisters and a stove‚Äù (52). They don‚Äôt get far before Rohan interrupts them with banging on the door. Despite his best efforts to negotiate with them, the women refuse to open the door or continue discussion. The women end scene five with slight bickering towards one another. Scene Six Saturday morning is filled with phone calls establishing relationships between Vera and her husband, Una and her sister Susan, and Ellen and Father Mitchell. Vera's husband calls to reprimand her for being with the women, instead of at home. He expects Vera to tend to their children and clean his clothes. She defies his wishes and keeps her stance by staying with the factory women. Una speaks with Susan and the audience learns that Susan in a pub with a priest home from the foreign missions (McGuinness 63). Una shows great stress that Susan is out and about drinking with a priest. It shows the difficulty the women will go through in separating themselves from the needs of the world to overcome the injustices of the company. Ellen finishes the scene by calling Father Mitchell requesting for mass to be brought to the women. Father Mitchell rejects them by telling them they ‚Äúshould go home where [they] belong and be down on [their] knees thanking God [they] have a job, seeing the times [they‚Äôre] in‚Äù (McGuinness 66). Scene Seven Tensions are high Saturday night as the women are preparing for bed. Vera expresses frustration at Ellen's attempt to empathize because she references Ellen's dead children. Vera takes that as a personal attack that her children might get what Ellen's had (McGuinness 69). Vera's response to Ellen causes Ellen to discourse on giving up her connection to her weans. She offers validation to ‚Äúwhy [they‚Äôre] locked in here. For once they can‚Äôt put [them] out. [They] put them out‚Äù (McGuinness 72). The audience sees Vera and Rebecca sing about Nigel. They share an intimate moment teaching the audience about the former soldiers. They illustrate the struggle of dating and interacting with soldier. The women participate in drinking and festivities. Rosemary is allowed to consume some of the alcohol. The alcohol doesn‚Äôt do her well and the scene ends with her in the bathroom. Ellen and Rebecca sit on stage as the Una and Vera tend to Rosemary. Rebecca calls out Ellen on trying to distract the group with song and a dance (McGuinness 78). Scene Eight Ellen is found alone in the dawn light. Una, who wakens, looks to her and acknowledges she's still awake. The women engage in a whispered conversation. The room is interrupted and awakened by a telephone call with no one on the other end. This pattern of the phone ringing with no one answering is repeated. The women become frantic with possibilities of who could be on the other end. Rebecca takes the lead in these final moments by reprimanding Vera for wanting to return to her man and addressing Ellen's control of the other women. She's defies Ellen's false claims to leave the room. Rebecca closes the  References  Category:Plays by Frank McGuinness Category:Plays set in Ireland ","title":"The Factory Girls"},{"id":"39380106","text":"Hoseynabad-e Eslami (, also Romanized as ·∏®oseynƒÅbƒÅd-e EslƒÅmƒ´; also known as ·∏®oseynƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Koshkuiyeh Rural District, Koshkuiyeh District, Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran.

The district encompasses 158 contributing buildings in the town of Accomac, mainly grouped into two periods of construction. From its founding in 1786 through the second quarter of the nineteenth century, several residential, commercial, governmental, and religious structures were built in the core of Accomac, representing both high-style and vernacular examples of late Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles. Notable structures surviving from this period include the rectory of St. George's Episcopal Parish (1798, 1811); the Seymour House (1791-1815); Roseland (1750-1850); Seven Gables (1786-1905); Rural Hill (1816, 1835), and the Francis Makemie Presbyterian Church (1840). The second period of construction reflected in the town dates to the last-quarter of the nineteenth century when the arrival of the New York, Philadelphia, and Norfolk Railroad spawned renewed growth and economic prosperity in Accomack County following the Civil War. These buildings also display both high-style and vernacular expressions of Victorian Era styles, including Second Empire, Italianate, Gothic Revival, and Romanesque. Notable structures from this time period include Bayly Memorial Hall (a former Baptist Church built in 1870 and later moved), the County Clerk's Office (1887), the Accomack County Courthouse (1899), and houses found in the Lilliston Avenue extension of the town built in the 1880s-1890s. There are also contributing structures dating from the first quarter of the twentieth century, including the Drummondtown Baptist Church (1914), Drummondtown United Methodist Church (1920), and the former hotel at the town square (1925). There are three structures within the Accomac Historic District which are listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places. They are the Debtors' Prison, the Bank Building, and St. James Episcopal Church. The Accomac Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History The Virginia General Assembly in its October 1786 session enacted \\"that ten acres of land, the property of Richard Drummond, adjoining to Accomack courthouse...are hereby established a town, by the name of Drummond.\\" The act establishing Drummondtown came over a century after the court of Accomack County has begun meeting at the site, first in the home or tavern of John Cole and then in a brick courthouse completed in 1756.

He was a Knight Templar and a patron of the order. The first record of Robert is his witnessing a document in 1161. He was probably at least sixteen years old at the time. He soon obtained the office of chamberlain. He was not always the exclusive holder of the office, the functions of which are somewhat obscure. It has been likened to a treasurer, the count's personal financial manager or even a minister of the county's finances. In 1190, Robert joined the Third Crusade. In preparation he donated ten arpents of land and a family of serfs at Trilbardou to the Templars of Moisy and in exchange he was taken into the order as a confrater (lay brother), his mother was to be commemorated at Moisy and his sister Amelia and her husband, Manasses, were to receive spiritual benefits from the Templars. This donation was made on the condition that he die without heirs, yet by 1203 he had two daughters. He must have renewed the gift, for the Templars eventually built a house at Trilbardou. He also leased some meadows at Orgeval to the Templars of Coulommiers for an annual rent of ten measures of grain, a fact confirmed by Count Theobald III of Champagne in a charter 1198. He also leased the mills of Montceaux to the Templars, sparking a dispute with the monks of Montier-la-Celle, which was not settled until 1216. In 1227, for forty sous, he exempted the Templars from rent for the grange at Champfleury, near Montceaux. In 1203, Robert gave six pounds in annual tolls to the Oratory of the Paraclete. The donation was earmarked for the benefit of his daughters, who were living there, for the duration of their lives. In 1205, he was with the court of the child count, Theobald IV. In 1213, as a veteran of the Crusade, he was questioned concerning the legality of the marriage of Isabella I of Jerusalem to Count Henry II of Champagne, since she had previously been married to Lord Humphrey IV of Toron‚Äîwho was still alive‚Äîand to the late Margrave Conrad of Montferrat. In 1214, following the Battle of Bouvines, he served as a guarantor for the release of a prisoner taken by the French king, Philip Augustus, even though the knights of Champagne had fought on the French side at the battle. At that time, Robert held the rank of a banneret. This rank, coupled with his high position in witness lists, indicate an unusually high profile for a chamberlain. In 1221, on the eve of his retirement from public life, he signed a document recognising that the office of chamberlain was not hereditary. He was still living in 1238, and was almost certainly in his nineties.

To have encyclopedic knowledge is to have \\"vast and complete\\"Encyclopedic on vocabulary.com knowledge about a large number of diverse subjects. A person having such knowledge is called a human encyclopedia or a walking encyclopedia.Walking encyclopedia on The Free DictionaryWalking encyclopedia on vocabulary.com The concept of encyclopedic knowledge was once attributed to exceptionally well-read or knowledgeable persons such as Plato, Aristotle, Hildegard von Bingen, Leonardo da Vinci, Immanuel Kant, or G. W. F. Hegel. Tom Rockmore described Hegel, for example, as a polymath and \\"a modern Aristotle, perhaps the last person to know everything of value that was known during his lifetime.\\" Such persons are generally described as such based on their deep cognitive grasp of multiple and diverse fields of inquiry‚Äîan intellectually exceptional subset of philosophers who might also be differentiated from the multi-talented, the genius, or the \\"Renaissance man.\\"  References in popular culture  External Sources below). The idea of encyclopedic knowledge has made many appearances in popular culture, being especially widespread in detective fiction. In 1887, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle introduced his fictional master sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, who applied his keen deductive acumen and prodigious range of knowledge to solve his cases. Encyclopedia Brown is a series of books by Donald J. Sobol featuring the adventures of boy detective Leroy Brown, nicknamed \\"Encyclopedia\\" for his intelligence and range of knowledge that was first published in 1963. One of the most celebrated is the fictional Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by the late Douglas Adams which began its evolution through numerous mediums as a British radio program in 1978. In 2004, NPR contributor A. J. Jacobs published The Know-It-All, about his experience reading the entire Encyclop√¶dia Britannica from start to finish.  Domain-specific  While deep encyclopedic knowledge across numerous fields of inquiry by a single person is no longer feasible, encyclopedic knowledge within a field of inquiry or topic has great historical precedent and is still often ascribed to individuals. For example, it has been said of Raphael Lemkin that \\"his knowledge of the logic behind the Nazi war machine was encyclopedic.\\" In 1900, Alexander Graham Bell, who set out to read the entire Encyclop√¶dia Britannica himself, served as the second president of the National Geographic Society and declared the Society should cover \\"the world and all that is in it.\\" While this goal sounds all-encompassing, it is in fact a statement towards comprehensive geographic knowledge, meaning the scope of the National Geographic Society's enterprise should attempt to be terrestrially unbounded. In an era of specialization, be it academic or functional or epistemological, obtaining domain-specific encyclopedic knowledge as an expert is typically celebrated and often rewarded by institutions in modern society. (This appreciation for having extensive niche knowledge, however, should not be confused with the historical experimentation and debate surrounding the division of labor which has been argued to limit the knowledge of workers compelled to perform repetitive tasks for the sake of an overall increase in economic productivity.) Views Mural honoring Edward Said, Palestinian American author of Orientalism. Edward Said, in his seminal postcolonial work, Orientalism, examines the encyclopedic endeavor in great detail, revealing it to be an historically hegemonic enterprise. Orientalists' \\"unremitting ambition was to master all of a world, not some easily delimited part of it such as an author or a collection of texts.\\" Tim Chambers, an early wikipedian who proposed the name \\"wikipedia\\", has a page of historical interest in the Wikimedia archives entitled \\"The Value of Encyclopedic Knowledge\\" in which he describes a new model for growing encyclopedic knowledge \\"powered by numerous scholars around the world.\\" The idea of encyclopedic knowledge being re-constellated as a community of knowledge is central to the theory of Connectivism as established by George Siemens and Stephen Downes.

It was an attempt by Royal Navy Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) to stop the from reaching Gironde, France. Stier made it through the English Channel and reached Gironde, but MTBs sunk the German fleet torpedo boats Iltis and Seeadler. MTB 220 was sunk by the German ships. Background Stier was an auxiliary cruiser, a former merchant ship armed with hidden weapons and designed to be used as a merchant raider. The German plan was for Stier, disguised as the minesweeper Sperrbrecher 171, to be escorted through the English Channel to Gironde, France. From there, Stier was to break out into the Atlantic to attack Allied merchant ships. The escort for Stier was the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, consisting of the torpedo boats Seeadler, Kondor, Falke, and Iltis as well as 16 R-boat minesweepers. The torpedo boats were all of the Raubvogel or Raubtier class. Stier left Rotterdam with the escort on 12 May, heading into the channel. The battle The German ships began picking up British MTBs on radar around two hours after midnight on 13 May. Crew on some of the German ships reported hearing motor noises, but the MTBs could not be seen. The German ships were shelled by British coastal batteries in the Strait of Dover, but the batteries scored no hits. At around 3:30 am, the MTBs began their attack. German gunners hit and sunk MTB 220, and damaged several other MTBs. Around 4:00 am, one of the MTBs fired a torpedo at Stier that missed and hit Iltis instead, breaking Iltis in two. Less than fifteen minutes later, Seeadler was also hit by a torpedo, rolled over, split, and sank. As Stier and its remaining escorts neared German shore batteries at Boulogne, the MTBs withdrew. Around 118 German sailors lost their lives in the battle. Aftermath Stier and its escort did not encounter any other Royal Navy forces after 13 May. However, on 15 May RAF aircraft attacked the German ships. The minesweeper M 26 was sunk off Cap de la Hague and M 256 was badly damaged. On 19 May Stier reached Gironde, and broke out into the Atlantic on 20‚Äì21 May.

He was the first Albanian novelist to write and publish an original novel in the Albanian language, Shkodra e rrethueme () of 1905. Biography Born in Shkod√´r on 9 March 1864, Nikaj was educated in the Albanian Pontifical Seminary and ordained as a priest in 1888. Along with Preng Do√ßi he was the creator of the Lidhja e Msheh√´t (), which aimed at overthrowing the Ottoman Empire and the creation of an independent Albania. Such league inspired the Albanian Revolt of 1910. Nikaj was one of the founders of the literary society Society for the Unity of the Albanian Language, mostly known in Albanian as Shoqnia Bashkimi. Nikaj established in 1909 his own printing press, \\"Shtypshkronja Nikaj\\" () and also founded two newspapers: Koha () in 1910 and Besa Shqyptare () in 1913. Besa Shqyptare lasted until 1921. The cultural and literary magazine Hylli i Drit√´s was printed there. Nikaj is remembered for the two history collections of 1902, \\"History of Albania\\" and \\"History of Turkey\\" which pushed toward the consolidation of the Catholic identity between Albanians, focusing on Scanderbeg and his wars against the Ottomans. His work was criticized as inexact and tendentious by the Austrian diplomat and historian Theodore Ippen. Nikaj was arrested in 1921 for unknown reasons, and little is known about him until the end of World War II. He was arrested by the communists in 1946 and died in prison in 1951.

This led to wide condemnation of the agency and triggered several investigations, including a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal probe ordered by United States Attorney General Eric Holder. Initial reports described the selections as nearly exclusively of conservative groups with terms such as \\"Tea Party\\" in their names. According to Republican lawmakers, liberal-leaning groups and the Occupy movement had also triggered additional scrutiny, but at a lower rate than conservative groups. The Republican majority on the House Oversight Committee issued a report, which concluded that although some liberal groups were selected for additional review, the scrutiny that these groups received did not amount to targeting when compared to the greater scrutiny received by conservative groups. The report was criticized by the committee's Democratic minority, which said that the report ignored evidence that the IRS used keywords to identify both liberal and conservative groups. In January 2014, James Comey, who at the time was the FBI director, told Fox News that its investigation had found no evidence so far warranting the filing of federal criminal charges in connection with the controversy, as it had not found any evidence of \\"enemy hunting\\", and that the investigation continued. On October 23, 2015, the Justice Department declared that no criminal charges would be filed. On September 8, 2017, the Trump Justice Department declined to reopen the criminal investigation into Lois Lerner, a central figure in the controversy. In late September 2017, an exhaustive report by the Treasury Department's Inspector General found that from 2004 to 2013, the IRS used both conservative and liberal keywords to choose targets for further scrutiny. In October 2017, the Trump Administration agreed to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of more than four hundred conservative nonprofit groups who claimed that they had been discriminated against by the Internal Revenue Service for an undisclosed amount described by plaintiffs' counsel as \\"very substantial.\\" The Trump Administration also agreed to settle a second lawsuit brought by forty-one conservative organizations with an apology and an admission from the IRS that subjecting them to \\"heightened scrutiny and inordinate delays\\" was wrongful.  Background   Tax exemption and donor anonymity  United States federal tax law, specifically Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code (), exempts certain types of nonprofit organizations from having to pay federal income tax. The statutory language of IRC 501(c)(4) generally requires civic organizations described in that section to be \\"operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare\\". Treasury regulations interpreting this statutory language apply a more relaxed standard, namely, that the organization \\"is operated primarily for the purpose of bringing about civic betterments and social improvements\\".26 CFR 1.501(c)(4)-1(a)(2)(i) As a result, the IRS traditionally has permitted organizations described in IRC 501(c)(4) to engage in lobbying and political campaign activities if those activities are not the organization's primary activity. Internal Revenue Service rules also protect groups organized under Section 501(c)(4) as nonprofit organizations dedicated to social welfare from having to reveal the names of their donors or the amount of funds the individual donors have contributed. This protection dates back to the United States Supreme Court's 1958 ruling in NAACP v. Alabama, when the Court held that disclosure of names could render private donors vulnerable to retaliation. Exterior of an Internal Revenue Service office. Nonprofit organizations dedicated to social welfare are not required to apply for IRS certification in order to operate under Section 501(c)(4) tax exemption rules. However, being certified by the IRS can help organizations attract more donations and provide some protection against further scrutiny. In 2013, examples of 501(c)(4) groups included Organizing for Action, organized to promote President Obama's legislative priorities, and the conservative advocacy organization Crossroads GPS, founded in part by Karl Rove.  Citizens United ruling & Congressional requests for 501(c) investigations  On January 21, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which overturned many previous restrictions on political campaign spending and allowed nearly unlimited and often anonymous spending by corporations and other groups to influence elections. Some Tea Party leaders began forming political action committees as offshoots of their 501(c)-tax-exempt organizations. By late September 2010, tax-exempt non-profit groups had spent in excess of $100 million on the mid- term elections, more than double the expenditure from a similar point in the election cycle four years earlier. Public-interest advocacy groups such as Public Citizen and Democracy 21 complained that the IRS and Federal Election Commission were failing to provide adequate oversight for 501(c) nonprofit organizations that were pouring money into political campaigns. As The New York Times reported at the time: > Almost all of the biggest players among third-party groups, in terms of > buying television time in House and Senate races since August, have been > 501(c) organizations, and their purchases have heavily favored > Republicans.... They include 501(c)(4) \\"social welfare\\" organizations, like > Crossroads, which has been the top spender on Senate races, and Americans > for Prosperity, another pro-Republican group that has been the leader on the > House side; 501(c)(5) labor unions, which have been supporting Democrats; > and 501(c)(6) trade associations, like the United States Chamber of > Commerce, which has been spending heavily in support of Republicans. Shortly thereafter, Senator Max Baucus, Democratic chair of the Senate Finance Committee, referring to The New York Times and other media reports, asked the IRS to investigate to ensure that nonprofit organizations engaged in political activity were complying with IRS rules and not abusing their tax-exempt status. Republican senators on the finance committee Orrin Hatch and John Kyl responded to Baucus' request by writing to the IRS that they were worried this kind of investigation would violate First Amendment rights, and they asked that a Treasury Department inspector general conduct a review of any such investigation to ensure its impartiality. Senate and House Democrats in early 2012 continued to press the IRS to investigate abuses of 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status by organizations engaged in political activity. In a February 2012 letter to then-IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman, several Democratic senators led by Senator Chuck Schumer wrote, \\"We urge you to protect legitimate section 501(c)(4) entities by preventing non-conforming organizations that are focused on federal election activities from abusing the tax code.\\" The senators also urged the IRS to issue new rules to prevent this type of abuse. In a follow-up letter sent in March 2012, the senators asked the IRS to clearly define the amount of political activity that is permissible for \\"social welfare\\" groups under 501(c)(4) rules, to require the groups to document in their IRS filings the exact percentage of their activity that is dedicated to \\"social welfare\\", and to require the groups to notify their donors of what percentage of donations could be claimed for tax deductions. The senators promised to introduce legislation to accomplish these aims if the IRS did not do so itself by promptly issuing new administrative rules. None of these letters called for the targeting of groups on the basis of political ideology. Between 2010 and 2012, the number of applications the IRS received each year seeking 501(c)(4) certification doubled. During this period, budget cuts and personnel cuts reduced the IRS's ability to adequately perform its core duties. When the Obama administration requested in 2011 that Congress increase the IRS's $12.1 billion budget by $1 billion to allow the agency to hire 5,100 additional agents, Congress instead reduced the IRS budget to $11.8 billion, and the IRS offered buyouts to 5,400 of its 95,000 employees. The U.S. National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina E. Olson, told The New York Times in January 2012, \\"The overriding challenge facing the I.R.S. is that its workload has grown significantly in recent years, while its funding is being cut.... This is causing the I.R.S. to resort to shortcuts that undermine fundamental taxpayer rights and harm taxpayers‚Äîand at the same time reduces the I.R.S.'s ability to deliver on its core mission of raising revenue.\\" Controversial IRS conduct Controversial intensive scrutiny of political groups Beginning in March 2010, the IRS more closely scrutinized certain organizations applying for tax- exempt status under sections 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code by focusing on groups with certain words in their names. In May 2010, some employees of the \\"Determinations Unit\\" of the Cincinnati office of the IRS, which is tasked with reviewing applications pertaining to tax-exempt status, began developing a spreadsheet that became known as the \\"Be On the Look Out\\" (\\"BOLO\\") list. The list, first distributed in August 2010, suggested intensive scrutiny of applicants with names related to a number of political causes, including names related to the Tea Party movement and other conservative causes. Eventually, IRS employees in Ohio, California, and Washington, D.C. applied closer scrutiny to applications from organizations that: * referenced words such as \\"Tea Party\\", \\"Patriots\\", or \\"9/12 Project\\", \\"progressive,\\" \\"occupy,\\" \\"Israel,\\" \\"open source software,\\" \\"medical marijuana\\" and \\"occupied territory advocacy\\" in the case file; * outlined issues in the application that included government spending, government debt, or taxes; * involved advocating or lobbying to \\"make America a better place to live\\"; * had statements in the case file that criticized how the country is being run; * advocated education about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; * were focused on challenging the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act‚Äîknown by many as Obamacare; * questioned the integrity of federal elections. Over the two years between April 2010 and April 2012, the IRS essentially placed on hold the processing of applications for 501(c)(4) tax-exemption status received from organizations with \\"Tea Party\\", \\"patriots\\", or \\"9/12\\" in their names. While apparently none of these organizations' applications were denied during this period, only 4 were approved. During the same general period, the agency approved applications from several dozen presumably liberal-leaning organizations whose names included terms such as \\"progressive\\", \\"progress\\", \\"liberal\\", or \\"equality\\". However, the IRS also selected several progressive- or Democratic-leaning organizations for increased scrutiny. An affiliate of the liberal group Emerge America had its request for tax-exempt status denied, leading to a review (and the eventual revocation) of the larger Emerge America organization's tax- exempt status. The conservative National Review states that a November 2010 version of the IRS's BOLO list indicates that liberal and conservative groups were in fact treated differently because liberal groups could be approved for tax-exempt status by line agents, while tea party groups could not. Ryan Chittum of the Columbia Journalism Review reported in 2011 that a number of non-profit news organizations saw their applications delayed for years after being flagged for additional review. In 2013, Chittum linked that scrutiny to the investigation, reporting that non-profit news organizations and Tea Party groups were placed in the same \\"Emerging Issues\\" category by IRS reviewers, which was a category flagged for additional questioning. He stated that \\"Rather than the Nixonian conspiracy that George Will and The Wall Street Journal editorial page so darkly warned about‚Äîwith zero evidence‚Äîyou have a routine bureaucratic procedure meant to bundle potentially problematic applicants together for further review.\\" Media Trackers, a conservative organization, applied to the IRS for recognition of tax-exempt status, and received no response after waiting 16 months. When the organization's founder, Drew Ryun, applied for permanent tax-exempt status for an existing tax-exempt organization with what he said was a \\"liberal-sounding name\\" (\\"Greenhouse Solutions\\"), that application was approved in three weeks. Ryun has stated he believes that Greenhouse Solutions benefited from its name (although the quick approval might also be due to the fact that Greenhouse Solutions was already operating as a nonprofit and was already on-file with the IRS.) An investigation by The New York Times reported that several organizations selected for scrutiny by the IRS engaged in activities that could be construed as political. The Ohio Liberty Coalition, whose application was delayed in excess of two years, sent emails to their members regarding Mitt Romney presidential campaign events and handed out Romney \\"door hangers\\" while canvassing neighborhoods. Former IRS officials and tax experts say this type of behavior would provide a \\"legitimate basis\\" for additional scrutiny. Ohio State University law professor Donald Tobin said: \\"While some of the I.R.S. questions may have been overbroad, you can look at some of these groups and understand why these questions were being asked.\\" =Examples of questions from the IRS= Some flagged organizations were required to provide further documentation in requests that Rep. Bill Flores called \\"overreaching and impossible to comply with\\". Documentation requested varied among different groups but, in some cases, included copies of \\"any contracts\\" or \\"training material\\" the groups may have exchanged with Koch foundations. In one instance, the IRS asked for \\"summaries or copies of all material passed out at meetings.\\" Several letters asked for \\"copies of the groups' Web pages, blog posts and social media postings.\\" Organizations were informed that if they did not provide the information sought, they would not be certified as tax-exempt. Another question asked of some unidentified applicants was: > Provide the following information for the income you received and raised for > the years from inception to the present. Also, provide the same information > for the income you expect to receive and raise for 2012, 2013, and 2014. > a. Donations, contributions, and grant income for each year, which includes > the following information: # The names of the donors, contributors, and > grantors. If the donor, contributor, or grantor has run or will run for a > public office, identify the office. If not, please confirm by answering this > question \\"No\\". # The amounts of each of the donations, contributions, and > grants and the dates you received them. # How did you use these donations, > contributions, and grants? Provide the details. If you did not receive or do > not expect to receive any donation, contribution, and grant income, please > confirm by answering \\"None received\\" and/or \\"None expected\\". Another unidentified applicant was asked to \\"Please provide copies of all your current web pages, including your Blog posts. Please provide copies of all of your newsletters, bulletins, flyers, newsletters or any other media or literature you have disseminated to your members or others. Please provide copies of stories and articles that have been published about you.\\" The Coalition for Life of Iowa, a pro-life group, was asked to \\"Please explain how all of your activities, including the prayer meetings held outside of Planned Parenthood are considered educational as defined under 501(c)(3). Organizations exempt under 501(c)(3) may present opinions with scientific or medical facts. Please explain in detail the activities at these prayer meetings. Also, please provide the percentage of time your group spends on prayer groups as compared with other activities of the organization.\\" While questioning then-Acting Commissioner of the IRS, Steven T. Miller, on May 17, 2013, Congressman Aaron Schock (R-IL), referring to a report by the conservative, non-profit law firm, the Thomas More Society, misquoted one of the questions asked of the coalition as \\"please detail the content of the members of your organization's prayers.\\" Schock went on to ask, \\"Would that be an inappropriate question to a 501(c)(3) applicant? The content of one's prayers?\\" Miller replied, \\"It pains me to say I can't speak to that one either.\\" Upon further questioning by Schock, Miller stated that it would \\"surprise him\\" if that question were asked. Schock's characterization of the question was included in news reports and was repeated by conservative commentators. However, the Thomas More Society chose to publish the questions that were asked by the IRS. These included a question as to whether the group provided, \\"education on both sides of the issues,\\" and also a question to \\"please explain what you are [doing] during\\" 40 Days for Life and Life Chain vigils.\\" Public disclosure of tax information In November 2013, the investigative reporting organization ProPublica requested information from the IRS on 67 nonprofit groups that had spent money on the 2012 elections, including Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS. The IRS's Cincinnati office responded with the documents from 31 of the groups. Of the 31 groups, nine were confidential applications of conservative groups that had not yet been approved and therefore were not supposed to be publicly disclosed. ProPublica made six of these applications public, \\"after redacting their financial information, deeming that they were newsworthy.\\" ProPublica had made a records request to the office seeking only completed applications, which are public information. Gift tax enforcement In 2011, audit letters were sent to five donors to a now-defunct conservative 501(c)(4) group, Freedom's Watch, which were involved in the 2008 election cycle. The goal of the audit was to assess whether or not gift taxes needed to be paid on these donors' donations to Freedom's Watch. The Congressional Research Service said that the audit was legally well-founded, as tax law exempts only 501(c)(3) and 527 groups from gift taxes. However, Ari Fleischer, a board member of the group, alleged that the group was being singled out. According to tax experts, the IRS had not been enforcing that law, but tax lawyers had advised their clients that they might owe the tax, leading to a situation where some paid and some did not. The audit appeared to indicate a new emphasis on enforcing the law, but political opposition from Republicans in Congress led to the IRS dropping the audit and publicly announcing that it would not levy gift taxes on contributions to 501(c)(4) groups. Inspector General J. Russell George's report recommended that the IRS create clearer rules and conduct more training for employees on 501(c)(4) issues, including gift tax exemptions. Public release of information Audit report In early May 2013, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released an audit report confirming that the IRS used inappropriate criteria to identify potential political cases, including organizations with Tea Party in their names. On May 10, in advance of the public release of the audit findings, Director of the IRS Exempt Organizations division Lois Lerner answered what was later revealed to be a planted question by stating that the IRS was \\"apologetic\\" for what she termed \\"absolutely inappropriate\\" actions. (Lerner's superior, then-Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, later testified to Congress that he had discussed with Lerner how she was to make the revelation and apology using a planted question at a meeting of the American Bar Association rather than during an appearance two days earlier before the House Ways & Means Committee in Congress.) She asserted that the extra scrutiny had not been centrally planned and had been done by lower-level \\"front line people\\" in the Cincinnati office. Media reports soon revealed that IRS officials in two other regional offices had also been involved in scrutinizing conservative groups and that selected applicants said that they had been told their applications were being overseen by a task force in Washington, D.C. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report showed that Lerner herself had been informed of the affair at a meeting that she had attended on June 29, 2011. On May 12, Republican and Democratic lawmakers called for a full investigation of the Internal Revenue Service, while White House Press Secretary Jay Carney called the IRS's alleged actions \\"inappropriate\\". On May 13, The Washington Post reported that Marcus Owens, head of the IRS department examining tax-exempt groups in 1990‚Äì1999, said that the IRS routinely categorized similar groups that sought the status of social welfare organizations. At a May 13 press conference, President Obama called the charges \\"outrageous\\" if true, and said that anyone found to be responsible for such actions should be held accountable. On May 14, the Inspector General's audit report was made public. President Obama released a statement saying, \\"The IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity. This report shows that some of its employees failed that test. I've directed Secretary Lew to hold those responsible for these failures accountable, and to make sure that each of the Inspector General's recommendations are implemented quickly, so that such conduct never happens again. But regardless of how this conduct was allowed to take place, the bottom line is, it was wrong.\\" Attorney General Eric Holder announced that he had ordered the Justice Department to begin an investigation into whether the activities amounted to criminal behavior. Findings The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that inappropriate criteria had been used by IRS personnel to select certain applications for tax exemption status for further review and that inappropriate procedures were applied against organizations based on their names or policy positions. According to the audit, beginning early in 2010, front-line IRS agents violated IRS policy by failing to handle tax matters in an impartial manner that would promote public confidence: > The IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and > other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or > policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign > intervention. Ineffective management: 1) allowed inappropriate criteria to > be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months, 2) resulted in > substantial delays in processing certain applications, and 3) allowed > unnecessary information requests to be issued. Although the processing of > some applications with potential significant political campaign intervention > was started soon after receipt, no work was completed on the majority of > these applications for 13 months.... For the 296 total political campaign > intervention applications [reviewed in the audit] as of December 17, 2012, > 108 had been approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicant, none had been > denied, and 160 were open from 206 to 1,138 calendar days (some for more > than three years and crossing two election cycles).... Many organizations > received requests for additional information from the IRS that included > unnecessary, burdensome questions (e.g., lists of past and future donors). The Inspector General concluded, \\"although the IRS has taken some action, it will need to do more so that the public has reasonable assurance that applications are processed without unreasonable delay in a fair and impartial manner in the future.\\" The Washington Post described the audit report as having found that some IRS employees were \\"ignorant about tax laws, defiant of their supervisors and blind to the appearance of impropriety\\". =Criticism of the inspector general= J. Russell George, the Treasury Department Inspector General who had alerted lawmakers to the IRS's improper behavior, was criticized by Republican lawmakers, who said that because inspectors general are required to notify Congress via agency heads when wrongdoing is discovered‚Äîand in serious cases must do so within 7 days‚Äîhe should have notified Congress in 2012, prior to the election that year. Inspector General George, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, responded by saying that the audit had not been complete, and that in his view, \\"to ensure fairness and to ensure that we are completely accurate with the information that we convey to Congress, we will not report information until the IRS has had an opportunity to take a look at it to ensure that we're not misstating facts.\\" On June 24, 2013, new IRS commissioner Danny Werfel revealed that an internal investigation had discovered that the inappropriate screening was both broader and longer-lasting than had previously been known. The report found that words such as \\"Israel\\", \\"progressive\\" and \\"Occupy\\" were also used as red-flags for greater scrutiny, and that screeners were still using such lists up until May 2013. A spokesman for the Inspector General's office in charge of the IRS audit said they had been asked by House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) \\"to narrowly focus on Tea Party organizations\\". On June 27, 2013, responding to letters from Rep. Sander Levin, the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, Inspector General J. Russell George's office released a letter to Levin about the scrutiny of groups with \\"progressive\\" in their names. Contradicting earlier claims of George's office, the letter acknowledged that he knew that the word \\"progressive\\" had appeared in IRS screening documents. However, he said that the \\"Progressives\\" criteria was on a part of the \\"Be On the Look Out\\" (BOLO) spreadsheet labeled \\"Historical\\", and, unlike other BOLO entries, did not say how to refer flagged cases. While he had many sources confirming the use of \\"Tea Party\\" and related criteria described in the report, including employee interviews and e-mails, he found no indication in any of those other materials that \\"Progressives\\" was a term used to refer cases for scrutiny for political campaign intervention. The letter further stated that out of the 20 groups applying for tax-exempt status whose names contained \\"progress\\" or \\"progressive\\", 6 had been chosen for more scrutiny as compared to all of the 292 groups applying for tax-exempt status whose names contained \\"tea party\\", \\"patriot\\", or \\"9/12\\".  Second Inspector General's report  In late September 2017, an exhaustive report by the Treasury Department's inspector general found that from 2004 to 2013, the IRS used both conservative and liberal keywords to choose targets for further scrutiny, blunting claims that the issue had been an Obama-era partisan scandal. The 115 page report confirmed the findings of the prior 2013 report that some conservative organizations had been unfairly targeted, but also found that the pattern of misconduct had been ongoing since 2004 and was non- partisan in nature. In reaction, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, stated \\"After years of baseless claims and false accusations it is my hope Republicans will finally put an end to this witch hunt and admit that their attacks on the I.R.S. were nothing but political grandstanding on behalf of special interests at the expense of American taxpayers.\\" In contrast, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady of Texas, responded by saying that \\"this report reinforces what government watchdogs and congressional investigators have confirmed time and time again: Bureaucrats at the I.R.S., such as Lois Lerner, arbitrarily and haphazardly administered the tax code and targeted taxpayers based on political ideology.\\" Regardless of reaction, the release of the report brought to an end the last formal governmental investigation into the IRS practice.  Reaction  TEA Party members across the U.S. demonstrated at IRS offices on May 21, 2013. Protesters at IRS facility in Mountainside, New Jersey on May 21, 2013. Initial reaction Montana's then-senator Max Baucus said the allegations were an \\"outrageous abuse of power,\\" and West Virginia senator Joe Manchin called the IRS's actions \\"un-American.\\" From May 13 to 15, several senators and congressional representatives called for Acting Commissioner of the IRS, Steven T. Miller, to resign or be fired. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, said, \\"My question isn't about who's going to resign, my question is who's going to jail over this scandal?... There are laws in place to prevent this type of abuse. Someone made a conscious decision to harass and to hold up these requests for tax-exempt status. I think we need to know who they are and whether they violated the law. Clearly someone violated the law.\\" Later in the day on May 15, 2013, President Obama announced that his Treasury Secretary had requested and accepted Acting Commissioner Miller's resignation. Lawmakers also called for the resignation of Lois Lerner, who ran the IRS's section on tax-exempt organizations, as did Danny Werfel, after he was appointed Acting IRS Commissioner following Miller's resignation. When Lerner refused to resign, she was placed on administrative leave. Lerner retired effective September 23, 2013. Michael Macleod-Ball, chief of staff at the ACLU's Washington Legislative Office, said, \\"Even the appearance of playing partisan politics with the tax code is about as constitutionally troubling as it gets. With the recent push to grant federal agencies broad new powers to mandate donor disclosure for advocacy groups on both the left and the right, there must be clear checks in place to prevent this from ever happening again.\\" U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) said, \\"We should not only fire the head of the IRS, which has occurred, but we've got to go down the line and find every single person who had anything to do with this and make sure that they are removed from the IRS and the word goes out that this is unacceptable.\\" There were rallies by members of the Tea Party in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, as well as across the country protesting selective targeting by the IRS of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas released a video titled \\"A Culture of Intimidation\\" and a website called \\"IRS targeting Texans\\" with multiple stories from conservatives in Texas and elsewhere who had received intrusive questions from the IRS. Press reaction to the IRS's actions was intense. * MSNBC's Rachel Maddow said: \\"There is a reasonable fear by all of us, by any of us, that the kind of power the IRS has could be misused,\\" she further said that this scrutiny of Tea Party groups was \\"not fair.\\" * Comedy Central's Jon Stewart stated that the controversy had taken \\"the last arrow in your pro-governance quiver,\\" he further said that this threw doubt on President Obama's \\"managerial competence\\" and had proven correct \\"conspiracy theorists,\\" moving the burden of proof onto federal authorities. * ABC News' Terry Moran wrote that this was: \\"A truly Nixonian abuse of power by the Obama administration.\\" * NBC's Tom Brokaw stated: \\"It's time for action.\\" * NBC's White House correspondent Chuck Todd: \\"It didn't seem like they had a sense of urgency about it, a real sense of outrage,\\" and further; \\"This is outrageous no matter what political party you are.\\" * MSNBC's Joe Scarborough said: \\"This is tyranny,\\" and talked of \\"unspeakable\\" abuses by the IRS. \\"This time it's real.\\" A poll released by Quinnipiac University on May 30 revealed that 76% of registered voters‚Äîincluding 63% of Democrats‚Äîfavored the appointment of a special prosecutor to independently investigate the allegations of wrongdoing. Pollster Peter A. Brown said there was \\"overwhelming bipartisan support\\" for such an investigation. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted May 30 to June 2, 2013, found that 55% of respondents believed that the controversy raises questions about the Obama administration's honesty and integrity. This poll found 33% of respondents blamed Obama directly for the actions underlying the controversy. The poll also found the public's confidence in the IRS to be low, with just 10% of respondents expressing confidence in the agency. Subsequent reactions While conservatives and Republican politicians have generally continued to view the IRS's conduct as indicative of politically motivated targeting, many liberal commentators and Democratic politicians quickly came to believe that while the conduct was improper, it was not motivated by politics. Consequently, liberal reactions to the controversy have shifted considerably from the initial condemnation and calls for investigation to descriptions of the controversy as the \\"Vanishing I.R.S. Scandal,\\" and suggestions that subsequent revelations represent a \\"nail in the [controversy's] coffin\\" and the controversy's \\"fizzl[ing]\\". On June 9, 2013, less than a month after the initial revelation, House Oversight Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-MD) stated: \\"Based upon everything I've seen, the case is solved. And if it were me, I would wrap this case up and move on.\\" Following an investigation by the Senate Finance Committee, ranking member Ron Wyden stated: \\"You are not going to find a partisan political scandal or proof of life on Pluto.\\" Resignations * Steven T. Miller, Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue and Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement resigned on May 15, 2013 * Joseph H. Grant, commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division, retired on June 3, 2013 * Lois Lerner, the Internal Revenue Service official at the center of the controversy, retired effective September 23, 2013. Lawsuits Catherine Engelbrecht, founder of conservative group True the Vote, filed a lawsuit claiming that her organization's tax-exempt status was unfairly delayed for three years, and alleging that she and her family's small manufacturing business were chosen for retaliatory investigations by the IRS, OSHA, the ATF, and the FBI. In 2013, Chris Van Hollen filed a lawsuit against the IRS to stop the tradition of allowing groups engaged in politics to be registered under 501(c)(4). In October 2013, the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) filed a federal lawsuit, alleging that the IRS intentionally leaked its 2008 tax return, including donor lists, in violation of federal law. The lawsuit arose from the March 2012 disclosure of NOM's tax return information, including its 2008 IRS Form 990, Schedule B, which contains donor data, to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights advocacy group, and to the media. (The disclosure revealed that Romney had given $10,000 to NOM, an advocacy group which was created in support of California's Proposition 8 to ban same-sex marriage). Under U.S. federal law, \\"the IRS is required to provide the public with certain tax information for 501(c)(4) organizations upon request‚Äîbut personal identifying information of donors must be redacted by the agency.\\" In a June 2014 ruling, Judge James Cacheris of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia dismissed most of NOM's claims. While the IRS acknowledged that it had improperly made an unredacted copy of NOM's tax information public, NOM provided \\"no evidence that the information was willfully disclosed or the result of gross negligence.\\" In June 2014, the IRS reached a settlement over NOM's remaining claims of improper disclosure of confidential tax information, in which the IRS agreed to pay $50,000 to NOM. In October 2017, the Trump Justice Department settled two lawsuits filed by conservative groups that said they were targeted in the controversy. One of these lawsuits was filed on behalf of 428 groups, and the other was filed on behalf of 41 groups. The settlement included payments of $3.5 million to these groups, an apology, and an admission of wrongdoing from the IRS. Investigations Congressional investigations At least as early as mid-2011, higher-ranking IRS officials knew that conservative groups were being scrutinized. Selected groups complained to various members of Congress. In response, a congressional committee asked IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman about the allegations in 2012. Shulman told the committee that the agency was not targeting conservative groups. After Shulman denied that the IRS was unfairly targeting conservative groups, the congressional committee ended the 2012 phase of the investigation. Shulman resigned his post in late 2012, before the controversy came to light. Following the Inspector General's report, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform began an investigation into the IRS. Additionally, the House Committee on Ways and Means expanded its ongoing 2011 investigation into possible IRS political targeting to include the BOLO (\\"be on the lookout\\") keyword targeting allegations. On May 15, 2013, the House Oversight Committee requested that Holly Paz, John Shafer, Gary Muther, Liz Hofacre and Joseph Herraz be interviewed beginning May 20, 2013. On May 22, 2013, in her opening statement to the Oversight Committee, Lois Lerner stated: \\"I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations. And I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.\\" Lerner then invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination and refused to testify. Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa later asserted that Lerner had waived her Fifth Amendment rights by giving partial testimony and that he intended to call her back into the hearings. Congressman Trey Gowdy agreed with Issa. Gowdy stated: \\"She [Lois Lerner] just waived her Fifth Amendment right. You don't get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross examination‚Äîthat's not the way it works. She waived her right to Fifth Amendment privilege by issuing an opening statement. She ought to stand here and answer our questions.\\" Regent University law professor James Duane told New York magazine that Gowdy's assertion was \\"extremely imaginative\\" but \\"mistaken\\" because a person who is involuntarily summoned before a grand jury or a legislative body may selectively invoke the right to silence. Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz took a different view, arguing: \\"You can't simply make statements about a subject and then plead the Fifth in response to questions about the very same subject,\\" and asserting, \\"[o]nce you open the door to an area of inquiry, you have waived your Fifth Amendment right.\\" On May 22, 2013, former IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman testified that he had frequently visited the White House during 2010‚Äì2011, but he denied having discussed the targeting of conservatives with anyone in the White House. His testimony was criticized by several columnists. Some media outlets and lawmakers asserted that Shulman had visited the White House up to 157 times; however, The Atlantic reported that that represented the number of times Shulman was cleared by the Secret Service to visit the White House or the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, not necessarily the number of times Shulman actually arrived; visitor sign-in logs can confirm only 11 visits between 2009 and 2012, though the number is likely higher because the sign-in system does not capture every visitor, particularly at large events. Shulman was regularly scheduled for events like the biweekly health-care deputies meeting that would have had a standing list of people cleared to attend. On June 9, 2013, Rep. Cummings released portions of an interview transcript in which an anonymous IRS manager who described himself as a \\"conservative Republican\\" told Congressional investigators that he had initiated the selected reviews without any involvement from the White House and that the extra scrutiny was not politically motivated. In an appearance on CNN's State of the Union, Cummings said, \\"Based upon everything I've seen, the case is solved. And if it were me, I would wrap this case up and move on.\\" Oversight Committee Chairman Issa responded in a statement, \\"The testimony excerpts Ranking Member Cummings revealed today did not provide anything enlightening or contradict other witness accounts. The only thing Ranking Member Cummings left clear in his comments today is that if it were up to him the investigation would be closed.\\" On May 7, 2014, on a near party-line vote (with six Democrats joining all Republicans) the House of Representatives voted to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with the Congressional investigation. House Republicans dismissed Lerner's invocation of the Fifth Amendment as ineffective, with Issa stating: \\"You don't get to use a public hearing to tell the public and press your side of the story and then invoke the Fifth.\\" Democrats characterized the contempt proceeding as a \\"witch hunt\\" geared toward the 2014 midterm elections. On June 13, 2014, the IRS notified Republican congressional investigators that it had lost Lerner's emails from January 2009 to April 2011 because of a mid-2011 computer crash. The emails were under subpoena as part of the congressional investigation. On June 19, the IRS said that the damaged hard drive containing Lerner's missing emails had been disposed of more than two years prior. Some commentators have raised legal issues concerning how the IRS handled these federal records. A National Archives and Records Administration spokesperson said in an email communication that: \\"The Office of the Chief Records Officer for the U.S. Government has contacted the IRS to explore specifics of the situation.\\" On July 9, 2014, Republicans released an April 13, 2013 email from Lerner in which she cautioned colleagues to \\"be cautious about what we say in emails,\\" citing congressional inquiries. The email did not specify which congressional inquiries Lerner was concerned about and made no mention of the then-impending TIGTA report. Republicans said that this email suggested that Lerner tried to hide evidence from investigators. On September 5, 2014, the IRS said it lost additional emails of five workers under congressional investigation, blaming computer crashes. These five workers include two people based in Cincinnati who worked on Tea Party cases; according to the IRS the crashes all predate congressional investigations and had occurred between September 2009 and February 2014. On September 5, 2014, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released its report on the controversy. The subcommittee's majority report, authored by subcommittee chairman Senator Carl Levin and submitted for the subcommittee's Democrats, concurred with TIGTA's finding that inappropriate screening criteria were used but concluded that there was no intentional wrongdoing or political bias in the use of the criteria. The majority faulted TIGTA for omitting from its report that liberal groups were also selected for additional screening and that previous TIGTA inquiries found no indication of political bias at the IRS. The subcommittee's Republican minority submitted a dissenting report authored by ranking member Senator John McCain which broadly validated the TIGTA report and accused the majority of minimizing bias against conservative groups, noting that most of the groups targeted for additional scrutiny were conservative. On November 22, 2014, a spokesman for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's Republican majority stated that TIGTA investigators told Congress that they had recovered up to 30,000 emails to and from Lois Lerner. On December 23, 2014, Chairman Issa's staff released a new report that found that \\"[t]he IRS's inability to keep politics out of objective decisions about interpretation of the tax code damaged its primary function: an apolitical tax collector that Americans can trust to treat them fairly.\\" The report was criticized by Rep. Cummings as \\"cherry-picked\\" to support a political narrative. The report did not link the IRS's conduct to coordination with the White House, though Republicans stressed that the investigation is ongoing and will continue in the next Congress. In January 2015, the United States Senate requested that the White House produce all communications it has had with the IRS since 2010. Senate Finance Committee final report On August 5, 2015, the Senate Finance Committee released Senate Report 114-119, The Internal Revenue Service's Processing of 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) Applications for Tax- Exempt Status Submitted by \\"Political Advocacy\\" Organizations From 2010-2013. The Report runs 7,913 pages, and includes a 142-page \\"Bipartisan Investigative Report as Submitted by Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden.\\" The Committee concluded that management at the IRS had been \\"delinquent in its responsibility to provide effective control, guidance, and direction over the processing of applications for tax-exempt status filed by Tea Party and other political advocacy organizations\\" and that poor planning by the agency resulted in \\"predictable failure\\" in addressing those delinquencies.Bipartisan Investigative Report as Submitted by Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden, p. 6, from Senate Report 114-119, The Internal Revenue Service's Processing of 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) Applications for Tax-Exempt Status Submitted by \\"Political Advocacy\\" Organizations From 2010-2013 (August 2015). The Committee found that \\"IRS managers forfeited the opportunity to shape the IRS's response to the influx of political advocacy applications by simply failing to read reports informing them of the existence of those applications.\\" While the report contained many bipartisan findings, Republican and Democratic committee members offered separate reports differing sharply on the ultimate reason for the IRS's failures. The Republican report (entitled \\"Additional View of Senator Hatch Prepared by Republican Staff\\") stated that the IRS had targeted Tea Party groups for \\"politically motivated reasons,\\" while the Democratic report (entitled \\"Additional View of Senator Wyden Prepared by Democratic Staff\\") blamed the agency's failures on \\"gross mismanagement\\" that treated groups in the same poor manner regardless of ideology. FBI investigation In January 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it had found no evidence warranting the filing of federal criminal charges in connection with the affair. The FBI stated it found no evidence of \\"enemy hunting\\" of the kind that had been suspected, but that the investigation did reveal the IRS to be a mismanaged bureaucracy enforcing rules that IRS personnel did not fully understand. The officials indicated, however, that the investigation is continuing. DOJ investigation In October 2015, the Justice Department notified Congress that there would be no charges against the former IRS official Lois Lerner or against anyone else in the IRS. The investigation found no evidence of illegal activity or the partisan targeting of political groups and found that no IRS official attempted to obstruct justice. The DOJ investigation did find evidence of mismanagement and Lerner's poor judgement in using her IRS account for personal messages but said \\"...poor management is not a crime.\\"Letter dated October 23, 2015, from Peter J. Kadzik, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legislative Affairs, U.S. Department of Justice, to The Honorable Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives, and The Honorable John Conyers, Jr., Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives. In September 2017, the DOJ declined a request from the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means to reopen the investigation into Lerner's IRS activities. Impeachment resolution Four days after the Justice Department closed its investigation, 19 members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee led by the Committee's Chairman, Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), filed a resolution to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. Those sponsoring the impeachment resolution to remove Koskinen from office accused him of failing to prevent the destruction of evidence in allowing the erasure of back-up tapes containing thousands of e-mails written by Lois Lerner, and of making false statements under oath to Congress. In a statement released by the Committee, Chaffetz said Koskinen \\"failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress.\\" On October 27, 2015, the IRS stated that the agency did not have an immediate comment on the impeachment resolution. Representative Cummings said in a statement: \\"This ridiculous resolution will demonstrate nothing but the Republican obsession with diving into investigative rabbit holes that waste tens of millions of taxpayer dollars while having absolutely no positive impact on a single American. Calling this resolution a 'stunt' or a 'joke' would be insulting to stunts and jokes.\\" Deleted evidence Responding to a lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch, Thomas Kane, Deputy Assistant Chief Counsel for the IRS, wrote in a sworn declaration that Lerner's Blackberry was \\"removed or wiped clean of any sensitive or proprietary information and removed as scrap for disposal in June 2012.\\" In a USA Today opinion column, James S. Robbins wrote, \\"For a scandal that is frequently derided as 'fake,' it is amazing how often real evidence disappears. The disappearing act is so frequent, it is reasonable to wonder whether it is really a systematic attempt to destroy evidence of abuse of power.\\" An IRS IT official told the National Review that any personal folders containing Lerner's emails were unlikely to have been on the Blackberry as, if they had been, then IT employees \\"wouldn't have been jumping through all the hoops to recover data from [Lerner's crashed hard] drive\\" in June 2011.

Kiernan, set in Providence, Rhode Island. The story's protagonist and unreliable narrator, India Morgan Phelps (also known as Imp), is schizophrenic. It has been described as an \\"eerie masterpiece of literary horror and dark fantasy\\" containing elements of magical realism. It has also been described as semi-autobiographical. The novel has been translated into a number of languages, including French, German, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, and Turkish. Synopsis The Drowning Girl follows the story of India Morgan Phelps, an unreliable narrator struggling with hereditary mental illness. India states that she has decided to write down the bizarre events that occurred two years ago (the entirety of the novel is written as a fictionalized memoir). Early in the novel, she befriends her eventual roommate and lover, a transgender woman named Abalyn Armitage. India works at an art supply store, but she is also a painter and a writer. One night, India picks up a hitchhiker named Eva Canning, whom she finds stranded and naked on the side of the road, although India is unable to pinpoint whether she met Eva in July or November. Eva stays with India only for a short while (much to Abalyn's chagrin) before the mysterious woman takes off on her own, but apparently continues to stalk India. This sparks India's obsession with Canning and her past. India's obsession eventually causes Abalyn to leave her. India often deals with traumatic events by writing short stories. Some of them relate to Eva Canning, while others revolve around a mysterious artists Phillip George Saltonstall and Albert Perrault, as well as a painting titled \\"The Drowning Girl,\\" which India saw on display at a museum as a child. After running into Abalyn and her new girlfriend, India begins to lose her grasp on what is real and what isn't. As a result of her inability to tell fact from fiction, her growing obsession with Eva Canning, and Abalyn's abandonment, India suffers a mental breakdown. India stops taking her medication, stops eating, and neglects phone calls from concerned people such as Abalyn, her therapist, her boss (who fires her), and her aunt. India begins to paint and write obsessively until Abalyn finds her half-dead in her apartment. With the help of Abalyn, India discovers that Eva Canning's mother (also named Eva) was part of a cult lead by a woman known as Jacova Anjevine, who committed mass suicide with her followers by walking into the sea some years prior. Eva was apparently the only survivor of said mass suicide. India believes that Eva might be a ghost or a sea-dwelling creature of some sort in a human disguise, but the story is vague as to whether India actually encounters any supernatural phenomena. India eventually does meet Eva Canning, and the two have a bizarre sexual encounter during which Canning appears to morph into a fish-like creature. Eva confesses to India that she wishes to go to the sea to be with her mother, which India obliges by taking her to the beach, at which point Eva walks into the water. After India calls out to her, Eva looks back and tells her to \\"join the dance\\". India tells the reader that she doesn't know whether or not to run into the water after Eva. India reunites with Abalyn, and it is implied they are still together at the end of the novel. Eva's body washes up on the shore sometime after.

It was led by Ahmed Baba Misk√©. Foundation In July 1958, two months after the Aleg Conference which founded the party, the Mauritanian Regroupment Party expelled Ahmed Baba Misk√© and other youth leaders from the party because of their vocal opposition to Mokhtar Ould Daddah. meeting at Kaedi, where the party was formed on 25 September 1958. Ideology Unlike the cautious conservatism espoused by the PRM, Nahda was more radical, and wanted immediate and total independence from France, and closer relations with Morocco. The demand for a closer relationship with Morocco was interpreted by some as support for the concept of Greater Morocco espoused by Allal al-Fassi, which would either be on the basis of a federation or a unitary state. Initially intended to unite the opposition to Daddah and the PRM, the Arab nationalist nature of Nahda worried many Mauritanians, especially Black African in Southern Mauritanian, who saw Arab nationalism as synonymous with Moorish domination. Nahda was able to attract a lot of support, including from Mauritanian businesses, and also financial support from Morocco. Decline Factional infighting within Nahda and accusations of corruption exacerbated Nahda's decline, as it gave the PRM a pretext for banning all opposition activity, which it did so on the eve of the 1959 election. The PRM won every seat, and Nahda was left with no political or legal avenues to express opposition to the government. More radical members of the party, which was by now heavily fragmented, mounted a campaign of violence and civil unrest in Atar and Nouakchott in May 1960, including several bombings. In response President Daddah placed five Nahda leaders, including Miske, in detention in the remote Hodh Ech Chargui Region. They were held there until February 1961, three months after independence. Post-independence rapprochement Following Mauritanian independence, party leaders recognized the need to consolidate to ensure the establishment of a strong and independent government that also represented Mauritania's regional and ethnic diversity. Consequently, there was a tendency on the part of some to try to put aside their differences. President Moktar Ould Daddah was able gradually to gain the support of numerous opposition parties because of his demonstrated willingness to include in his government those who previously had opposed him. Thus, even after Daddah charged the Mauritanian National Renaissance Party (Nahda) with corruption, banned the party from participation in the elections to Mauritania's first National Assembly in May 1959, declared the party illegal, and placed five of its leaders under arrest, Nahda still responded to Daddah's urgent appeal to preserve unity and independence.Warner, Rachel. \\"Independence and civilian rule\\". In Handloff. In a new election, held in accordance with provisions of the new constitution in August 1961, Nahda campaigned for Daddah, who won the election with the additional support of the black party, the Mauritanian National Union. The new government formed in September 1961 included representatives of both Nahda and the Mauritanian National Union in important ministries. This electoral, then governmental, coalition was formalized in October 1961 with the consolidation of the Mauritanian Regroupment Party, Nahda, the Mauritanian National Union, and the Mauritanian Muslim Socialist Union into the Mauritanian People's Party (Parti du Peuple Mauritanienne, PPM). On December 25, 1961, the PPM was constituted as the sole legal party. Its policies included a foreign policy of nonalignment and opposition to ties with France.

There was a v√∂lkisch element in Ungewitter's ideas. Career Ungewitter was of working-class or lower middle-class origins and was trained as a gardener. He became a clerk in the office of a gardening company, then lived for two years in Norway. After returning to Germany, he was one of the founders of a bread manufacturing facility. After that went bankrupt, he worked as a sales representative. He was introduced to nudism (now known as naturism) by Heinrich Pudor, who published under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham (Shame). Today he is considered one of its early pioneers. In 1903 Ungewitter published a booklet entitled Wieder nacktgewordene Menschen (People naked again), which made him quite well known. Almost 100,000 copies were printed within a few years. His first book, Die Nacktheit (Nudity) appeared in 1906 under the full title Die Nacktheit in entwicklungsgeschichtlicher, gesundheitlicher, moralischer und k√ºnstlerischer Sicht (Nudity from the point of view of historical development, health, morality and art). It was reprinted several times. Repeated attempts at legal procedures against the book failed because the experts invited by the court testified in favor of Ungewitter. For example, Theodor Lipps, a professor at the University of Munich, stated in his report: In subsequent years, Ungewitter published further books advocating nudism. His best known work is the book Nackt (Naked), which appeared in 1908. In addition, in 1908 he founded the Vereinigung f√ºr hygienische, ethische und √§sthetische Kultur (Organization for hygienic, ethical and aesthetic culture). This was the second naturist group in Germany, after a club founded in Essen in 1898, and had approximately 50 members, primarily in South Germany. Both Nackt and his Nacktheit und Kultur (Nudity and Culture, published 1911) were the subject of legal disputes lasting several years, in which, however, he was largely able to obtain satisfactory judgements. Thus, in its session of April 24, 1912, Criminal Trial Chamber III of the Royal Regional Court in Stuttgart rejected the suit by the royal attorneys to suppress Nackt. This legal opinion of the court, under which illustrated naturist publications are permissible, was followed by all other democratic courts of justice in Germany and other countries. Ungewitter, like many Lebensreform theorists of the time, ascribed positive health benefits to nudity. He suggested that wearing clothing might be a cause of tuberculosis, and theorized that the rays of the sun were beneficial to health because they contained metals. By his own account, he had suffered from infections, weakness, and a recurring rash despite medical treatment, and only become healthy and strong after, under the influence of Louis Kuhne's theories, he gave up alcohol and smoking and became a vegetarian; ultimately he adopted a raw food diet in addition to exercising and writing in the nude. Ungewitter founded his first organization, the Vereinigung f√ºr hygienische, ethische und √§sthetische Kultur (Society for Hygienic, Ethical and Esthetic Culture) in Stuttgart around 1906. In 1907 Ungewitter founded the Loge des aufsteigenden Lebens (Lodge of Ascending Life or Rising Life), to which according to his statement on June 17, 1912, more than 800 people belonged. It may have been the first nationwide nudist organization in Germany. In its regular publication Vertrauliche Mitteilungen (Confidential Reports), members advocated naked bathing free of embarrassment, nudity without being disturbed, and to some extent, long-distance nude hiking. In 1914 the name of the lodge was changed to Treubund f√ºr aufsteigendes Leben (Brotherhood or Loyalty Club for Ascending Life, abbreviated Tefal). In 1923, Ungewitter, who dominated the organization, obtained an amendment to its constitution introducing a commitment to \\"racial hygiene\\" (v√∂lkisch eugenics) and also requiring a commitment to a political party. Many members objected to the alignment with eugenics, and large numbers therefore left the organization, which subsequently waned in importance. However, the move toward eugenics did not constitute an essential change in his theories. As early as 1910, he had written in Nacktheit und Kultur: He was specifically anti- Semitic, and was also associated with the v√∂lkisch journal Die Ostara. Ungewitter was unusual among naturists in making a close connection between nudism, marriage, and racialism, and advocated compulsory nudity (nude exercises three times a day) together with vegetarianism. In 1919 he had edited Der Zusammenbruch: Deutschlands Wiedergeburt durch Blut und Eisen, which lays out a program for Germany's recovery from the defeat of World War I in which compulsory nudity is an element. Ungewitter was also notably anti- feminist, arguing that girls should be educated only in things that would equip them to run a household and that they should be required to undergo a year's service including physical exercise, and notably hostile toward the rich, whom he attacked for \\"status arrogance\\" that extended to preferring fashionable ailments to health. After the Nazis came to power, Ungewitter did not find the expected support for his ideas. There was an initial crackdown on nudists in 1933, then those who advocated recreational nudity were accommodated, but Ungewitter, with his pronounced anti-urbanism and advocacy of rural naturist settlements (at least two Tefal settlements existed by the mid-1920s), was forced out. In 1938 he was sidelined with an honorary post. He died in Stuttgart in December 1958, on the evening before his 89th birthday.

These weapons were used for the first time against a British Army helicopter in June 1988, when an Army Air Corps Lynx was hit by 15 rounds and brought down by an IRA unit near Cashel Lough Upper.Harnden (2000), p. 361 Another incident occurred on 20 February 1990, when an IRA team composed of at least 20 volunteers attempted to attack a helicopter at Newtownhamilton, but their efforts were thwarted when a van, a car, and several masked men manning a light machine gun were spotted by an RAF Wessex on a reconnaissance mission. After a hot pursuit in which some vehicles and some IRA volunteers escaped, three of the men were tracked to Silverbridge, where the Wessex landed three soldiers and two Royal Ulster Constabulary constables. The men were arrested, but the security patrol was suddenly overwhelmed by a stone-throwing crowd of 40 residents, who forcibly released the suspects. One of the men arrested was Jim Martin, who had recently been part of a scheme to smuggle anti-aircraft missiles from the United States. He was still at large and living in the area at the time of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. In later searches in the area, security forces recovered two AK-47 and a Heckler & Koch rifles and two light machine guns. The AK-47s had been used in the killing of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan in 1989.Harnden (2000), pp. 396‚Äì397 On 13 February 1991 a Lynx helicopter was heavily damaged and brought down near Crossmaglen by an IRA unit using a heavy machine gun and two GPMG machine guns. The machine was hit by eight DShK rounds and two GPMG rounds, and eventually crash-landed near Silverbridge. The crew were rescued unhurt by a second Lynx. The battle On 23 September 1993,Harnden (2000), p. 397 approximately at 02:00 pm, members of the IRA's South Armagh Brigade deployed five armed trucks in different positions around the Crossmaglen barracks.An Phoblacht, 7 July 1994, p. 2 The targets were a troop-carrying RAF Puma helicopter lifting off from Crossmaglen's helipad and its escort of two British Army Lynx. Author Toby Harnden states that the IRA used two DShK heavy machine guns and three light machine guns and opened fire from near the St. Patrick's Church and the community centre. The IRA version is that they fired from a wooded area, and that their firepower became diminished when a number of weapons jammed. They claimed that the helicopters were in the process of landing when the shooting began. The Puma was hit by one round almost immediately, and the two escorts, Lynx 1 and Lynx 2, were also targeted from another firing point. Two other escorts, Lynx 5 and Lynx 7, came to support their colleagues. Lynx 2 avoided being hit by heading to the north at low level.Ashcroft (2012), pp. 355-356 The IRA acknowledge that the helicopters manoeuvred away from the stream of bullets directed at them and that they were joined by the other two helicopters. Two of the trucks headed east along Newry Road and a 12-mile chase ensued, amid a fierce exchange of gunfire; one of the helicopters was hit and forced to disengage, according to republican sources. Harnden says that, besides the Puma, one of the Lynx was also damaged in the action. The British helicopters initially spotted two trucks and one supporting car, but they lost track of the smaller vehicle, while one of the trucks turned off into a farmyard. Lynx 2 rejoined the battle by engaging the retreating trucks from the south. The aircraft tried to fire upon the truck's convoy twice, but the machine gun jammed in the first occasion and another Lynx crossed the line of fire in the second. The IRA claim that the helicopters fired 'indiscriminately' against civilian property and cars with 'rockets and machine gun fire'. The remainder lorry stopped in the main street of a village near Crossmaglen, and a number of men transferred weapons to a Transit van. At this point Lynx 1, which had come back to base to muster troops, landed eight soldiers in front of the van. Three masked men got out of the vehicle and hid in a bungalow. They later slipped away in another car, but the soldiers were powerless to intervene since they were not carrying weapons and the officer in charge of the operation was not sure whether the men were the same ones who had driven the van. Other troops were delivered near the farm where the other truck had been concealed, only to find that the vehicle and its occupants had vanished. The helicopters fired 200 rounds, while the IRA report put the number of rounds spent in the whole engagement in the thousands. The action lasted for 10 to 30 minutes, and was assessed by the British Army as the most intense gun battle ever in South Armagh. The authorities recovered a DShK, two light machine guns and an AK-47. There were no casualties on either side, and all the IRA volunteers got away. Aftermath According to author Nick Van Der Bijl, the Garda√≠ found two IRA trucks on the southern side of the border.Van Der Bijl (2009), p. 82 The next year, on 20 March and 12 July 1994, the IRA in South Armagh managed to shoot down one British Army Lynx and one RAF Puma with home-made mortars.Harnden (2000), pp. 398‚Äì399 After the incident, the British Army improved armour protection for their helicopter crews in Northern Ireland, as well as the machine gun mountings and sightings. There were plans to purchase a Skyship 600 Airship in the role of flying command post to improve co-ordination from a safe height. Within days of the gunbattle, Royal Navy's Sea King helicopters were deployed to the west of the country to release Army Air Corps and RAF helicopters to boost South Armagh's effort. On 26 April 1994, Staff Sergeant Shaun Wyatt, commander of Lynx 2, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his deeds during the battle.

It was located in Downtown Tacoma near Railroad Street according to a historical record. History In November 1885 disgruntled whites drove out the Chinese population and burned down Chinatown. According to a historical account, many who were driven out fled to Portland, Oregon or Canada. Two days after the Chinese were driven out, Tacoma's Chinatown was burned to the ground. According to another source, as many as six hundred Chinese were dragged out to the street in a raid and escorted to the train station. According to the article \\"Tacoma Chinese Riots\\" published by the Tacoma News Tribune, most of the Chinese had arrived at Tacoma looking for labor because the Pacific Railways had been completed and the gold rush era was taking place. In the book \\"A Narrative of Early Tacoma and the Southern Sound\\" it explains how after the completion of the Northern Pacific main line the Chinese would flood cities like Tacoma and would have negative impacts on American household incomes. The high population of Chinese labor would drive the wages of Americans down because the Chinese would work harder and for longer periods. Not only did the Chinese must worry about the unemployed Americans they also had to worry about the employed Americans. In an article \\"Investigating the causes of the Recent Riot\\" American minors would discuss how unfairly they were being treated in comparison to the Chinese. The Chinese were given the best mining rooms to work in and the mining bosses would use false weights when it came to paying Americans. It was argued that the Chinese had to pay a fee in order receive these benefits. Because of this and many other reasons, Americans wanted to drive out the Chinese from Tacoma. One of America's first Labor Union known as The Noble and Holy Order of the knights of Labor had gathered many business owners with the Mayor of Tacoma to orchestrate the expulsion of the Chinese. In the thesis of Robert Mack, it states that the Chinese expulsion was successful for many reasons. The government didn't want to cause violence, individuals who were against the expulsion stopped supporting the Chinese and the people who orchestrated the expulsion had a lot of power.

Contained within Ozark-St. Francis National Forest, the wilderness is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Contained in the wilderness is Hawksbill Crag (also called Whitaker Point), a very popular hiking destination. Description This infrequently visited wilderness is composed of second and third growth oak-hickory forest with intermittent portions of shortleaf pine. The headwaters of the Buffalo River are contained in the Wilderness, and the area has been uninhabited since 1948. Decaying houses, farm implements and roads can still be seen in countless valleys. There is only one official trail in the Upper Buffalo Wilderness, leading visitors to Hawksbill Crag. Visitors should expect difficult hiking conditions although water is extremely pure. Black bears are known to inhabit the wilderness, along with White-tailed deer, wild turkey, skunks, opossums, minks and pheasants. U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are usually allowed with a proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act.

Monsanto Co., 569 U.S. 278 (2013), was a United States Supreme Court patent decision in which the Court unanimously affirmed the decision of the Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission.. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought transgenic soybean crop seedsThe soybean crop is seeds that are the same as the seeds from which the crop was grown. from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. Monsanto originally sold the seed from which these soybeans were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting. The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local grain elevator, from which Bowman then bought them. After Bowman replanted the crop seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, the Supreme Court ruled that Bowman's conduct infringed Monsanto's patents and that the doctrine of patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds by planting and harvesting saved crop seeds without the patent holder's permission. The Court held that, when a farmer plants a harvested and saved seed, thereby growing another soybean crop, that action constitutes an unauthorized \\"making\\" of the patented product. The case garnered attention in part due to its potential impact on policy about genetically modified crops and self-replicating technologies, and due to the involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas, who previously served as a lawyer for Monsanto.John Danforth, then the attorney general of Missouri, hired Thomas out of Yale as a lawyer on his staff, and after a few years Thomas moved on to the legal department at Monsanto. Jeffrey Toobin, Unforgiven, (Nov. 12, 2007); see also 147-49 (2004). Commentators noted, however, that the Court's ruling was narrow in scope, and did not set a broad legal precedent with respect to the applicability of the doctrine of patent exhaustion to self-replicating technologies. Background Factual setting Monsanto developed patents for genetically modified soybeans that were resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup, the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants (weeds) would be killed.. Monsanto sold these soybeans under a limited-use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting. Different types of genetically modified soybeans being grown side by side In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, many of which were transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities. Monsanto stated that he was infringing its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman stated that he had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. Lower court rulings After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman argued that if Monsanto was allowed to continue its license past exhaustion, it would be able to dominate the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent. Bowman then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Bowman argued that the Monsanto license agreement allowed the sale of second- generation soybeans to both grain elevators and subsequent buyers and that this caused the patent rights to be exhausted per the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.. Monsanto argued that the license agreement specifically prohibited the use of second- generation seeds for planting. The Federal Circuit upheld the lower court's decision in favor of Monsanto. Petition to the Supreme Court Bowman sought review in the United States Supreme Court. Bowman argued that the Federal Circuit's decision conflicted with existing Supreme Court precedent on patent exhaustion. Bowman said that United States v. Univis Lens Co.United States v. Univis Lens Co., . showed that patent exhaustion applied even when the patent holder created post-sale restrictions. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created a judicial exception to patent exhaustion for Monsanto, allowing it to dominate the soybean seed market. Finally, Bowman argued that he was not \\"making\\" infringing new seeds merely by planting and reaping crops. Monsanto argued that the Federal Circuit's decision was correct because Bowman had created a new product that infringed on their patent. They further argued that this was not an appropriate case to hear, as the decision was not decided on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale. The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position. The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court Arguments Bowman argued that the authorized sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created an exception to the exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto argued that the second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement. He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were. A number of Amici Curiae also filed briefs on behalf of the parties.. For example, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, arguing on behalf of Monsanto, wrote that \\"[e]xhaustion of the right to control propagation of patented seed would disrupt the balance created by Congress between the Patent Act and the Plant Variety Protection Act.\\" The American Seed Trade Association, also arguing on behalf of Monsanto, wrote that \\"[p]atented seed technology benefits farmers, consumers and the environment\\". The National Farmers Union, arguing on behalf of Bowman, wrote that \\"[a] patent exhaustion exception for self-replicating technologies is inconsistent with this Court‚Äôs precedent and the competition policies reflected in the first-sale doctrine\\", and the Center for Food Safety wrote that \\"[f]arming is not genetic engineering\\". Commentary prior to the Supreme Court's ruling In the months leading up to the decision, commentators weighed in on several issues relating to the case. Because Justice Clarence Thomas had served as a lawyer for the Monsanto Company 34 years earlier, some critics questioned whether he would remain impartial.See, e.g., Other commentators noted that the case raised the \\"important question\\" of whether the exhaustion doctrine should include an exception for self- replicating technologies, which may one day include self-replicating robots. In SCOTUSblog, Ronald Mann wrote the case's \\"practical ramifications are substantial\\", and that the case was \\"one of the highest-stakes cases of the Term\\". However, Mann also predicted that \\"it seems most unlikely the Court will rule against Monsanto\\", and in his coverage of the case's oral arguments, he observed that \\"none of the Justices expressed any sympathy for [Bowman‚Äôs] position\\". Opinion of the Court On May 13, 2013, Justice Elena Kagan delivered the Court's unanimous opinion, which affirmed the judgment of the Federal Circuit. Justice Kagan stated that while an authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item, that exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder's permission. Justice Kagan stated that when a farmer plants a harvested and saved seed, thereby growing a further soybean crop, that action constitutes an unauthorized \\"making\\" of the patented product, in violation of section 271(a) of the patent code.. Section 271(a) gives the owner of a patent the exclusive right to make products that the patent covers. Justice Kagan concluded that Bowman could resell the patented seeds he obtained from the elevator, or use them as feed, but that he could not produce additional seeds (that is, crops). Commentary and analysis After the Court published its decision, analysts offered a range of opinions about the impact of the Court's ruling. An academic co-author of an amicus brief on behalf of Bowman filed by the American Antitrust Institute expressed relief that the loss was on a narrow basis rather than providing a broad affirmation of the lack of patent exhaustion for self-replicating technologies. Kevin Rodkey argued that an analysis under Quanta Computer leads to the conclusion that patent rights covering self-replicating seeds are exhausted on the first authorized sale, including subsequent generations, and that seed companies can only exclude subsequent replantings with carefully written license restrictions. Ronald Mann writing in SCOTUSblog noted: \\"The tenor of the Court came through most clearly when the Court ridiculed what it called Bowman‚Äôs 'blame-the-bean defense' ‚Äì the argument that Bowman did not make new seeds, because it was the seeds themselves that replicated.\\" Another academic, Richard H. Stern, did not take issue with the Court's refusal to shelter Bowman's conduct under the exhaustion doctrine, but criticized the Court's classification of the act of planting seeds and growing crops from them as an act of \\"making\\" a new patented article.Stern, Richard H., Bowman v Monsanto: Exhaustion versus Making, [2014] 255, 260‚Äì61. He argued that, because Congress has not addressed the issue whether the millennia-old practice of planting and growing a crop from harvested seeds constituted a \\"making\\" of a patented product, the Court should have left it to Congress to make the decision as to whether replanting patented seed should constitute infringement. Rochelle C. Dreyfus is also reported to have criticized the decision, noting that Bowman was attempting to obtain the benefit of the genetic modifications, while others, such as organic growers, fear being sued for inadvertent cross-contamination. Additionally, the Harvard Law Review wrote that \\"[t]he Court reached the correct outcome but via the wrong route\\" because its ruling \\"obfuscates the role of the licensing agreement\\" and because the \\"exhaustion doctrine is ill suited to address the challenges posed by self-replicating technologies\\".. Other commentators suggested the case will have broad-ranging impacts for other self-replicating technologies. Tabetha Marie Peavey suggested that the Court \\"appeared to be alert to the consequences of its ruling, not just for the value of Monsanto‚Äôs soybean patents, but also for technologies like cell lines, software, and vaccines\\".. Likewise, Christopher M. Holman wrote that the case \\"should be viewed as a bellwether for an oncoming wave of controversy around the patenting of self- replicating technologies that will challenge the ability of the patent system to respond effectively\\".. William J. Simmons also wrote that \\"more cases like this will probably be appealed to [the Supreme Court] as these technologies become more prevalent in society\\". Subsequent developments In a similar case, Organic Seed Growers & Trade Ass'n v. Monsanto Co., a coalition of farmers filed suit to challenge twenty-three of Monsanto's patents for glyphosate-resistant crops.718 F.3d at 1352. The plaintiffs argued that if their crops became \\"contaminated by transgenic seed, which may very well be inevitable given the proliferation of transgenic seed today, they could quite perversely also be accused of patent infringement\\".718 F.3d at 1353 (internal quotations omitted). The plaintiffs sued to declare Monsanto's patents invalid and asked Monsanto to \\"expressly waive any claim for patent infringement [Monsanto] may ever have\\" against the farmers and to \\"memorialize that waiver by providing a written covenant not to sue\\".718 F.3d at 1353 (internal quotations omitted) (alteration in Federal Circuit opinion). However, the case was dismissed for lack of a controversy. The suit did not demonstrate instances of current harm or future risk. Monsanto also gave assurances that it did not plan to sue in cases of inadvertent infringement when a grower was not also using glyphosate on their crop.The Federal Circuit said: \\"Monsanto has made binding assurances that it will not 'take legal action against growers whose crops might inadvertently contain traces of Monsanto biotech genes (because, for example, some transgenic seed or pollen blew onto the grower's land).'\\" See also Organic Seed Growers & Trade Ass'n v. Monsanto Co. (Fed. Cir. 2013), (July 4, 2011); Dennis Crouch, Monsanto Wins Again in Federal Circuit: Organic Farmers Have No Standing to Challenge Patent, (June 10, 2013). Monsanto's patent for the soybeans at issue in this case expired in 2014, prior to which Monsanto announced that it will no longer enforce the licenses associated with the soybeans.

Early years  Peter's parents, Ado and Marie, were peasants who lived on Saaremaa's Loona Manor. Saaremaa (known as Oesel in German), is Estonia's largest island (2,673 km2) and has numerous small, rocky, low-lying islands off its western coast. The largest of these is called Vilsandi. When Peter was one year old, Baron Hoyningen-Huene sent the family to live on Loonalaid, a small (1 km2.) uninhabited Baltic Sea island, so his father could look after the hay grown there that provided feed for the manor's livestock.Manors were landholdings owned by noble families since the Middle Ages. The medieval Loona Manor (called Kadvel in German) has undergone many changes and today houses the information centre for Vilsandi National Park. See (1) http://www.loonamanor.ee/history, (2) http://mois.ee/english/saare/loona.shtml, (3) http://www.baltische- ritterschaften-en.de/corporations/oesel/, and (4) http://www.visitestonia.com/en/vilsandi-national-park. The family survived primarily from fishing and farming. Peter grew up to be a large man (210 cm tall) and left home by 20 years of age to become a seaman. During the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856) Peter tried to run the Baltic Sea blockade with a cargo of salt from Sweden and his ship was seized.See article titled The Development of Estonian Maritime Shipping on pages 1-8 of the Baltic Military History Newsletter May 2014 http://www.baltdefcol.org/files/files/BalticMilitaryHistory/Newsletter_2014-05.pdf He was arrested by the British, his ship was burnt and he was jailed for 3 years. Photo of the All family's farmhouse on Loonalaid in the 1920s or early 1930s.  Farming  After being released from jail, Peter returned to Loonalaid and decided to plant potatoes not in the island‚Äôs rocky soil but in the near-shore kelp beds. He found that these potatoes ripened much faster than conventionally planted ones because the sun's rays heated the shallow waters. Demand for these early season potatoes was strong and they commanded a premium price at market in Riga, Latvia, more than 100 km by sea. Peter eventually bought Loonalaid from the Baron, and employed about a half-dozen farmhands who, when not working in the fields or with the small number of cows and many sheep, helped with the salvaging operations.  Salvaging shipwrecks  With his profits from selling potatoes Peter bought a diving helmet from Germany and began to salvage the numerous ships lying on the ocean floor that had been wrecked on the nearby shoals. It was rare for ships in the Baltic to carry precious cargo and All primarily salvaged coal, metals and antique porcelain, the sale of which helped him to move in social circles far above his standing. Peter All found that upper classes in St. Petersburg, Russia were prepared to pay handsomely for porcelain that was over one hundred years old and he did very well for himself, becoming one of the wealthiest Estonians of the time. In 1880 he was the first Estonian to have his photograph taken, a colored ferrotype that is on display at the Estonian Maritime Museum in Tallinn.Entry for Peeter All in the Estonian Maritime Glossary Mereleksikon, 1996, page 17, .Berendson, Risto, article in the September 8, 2008 Postimees newspaper whose title translates as \\"In the footsteps of a Saaremaa farmer who became rich selling antiques salvaged from shipwrecks to Russians\\".

By 1867 this vessel was registered only in Peter All's name. In 1869 All built another vessel named ‚ÄúRichard‚Äù.

Peter received some medals for his rescues of both seaman and ships. In 1861, at the christening of his first child, British captain Robert Davies, officer Greit Batschets and seaman William Poole were in attendance.

The Nasrid ruler Muhammed V of Granada sent two Marinid princes to Morocco whom he had been holding captive in Granada: Ahmad Abu al-Abbas and Abdul Rahman bin Yaflusin, and supported them in taking control of northern Morocco. Ahmad became the Sultan of Fez in 1374, while Abdul Rahman became the independent Sultan of Marrakesh. Ibn al-Khatib, a former vizier of Granada and distinguished man of letters, had taken refuge in Morocco. Abu Abbas had him executed as Muhammed V wished, and handed over Sabta (Ceuta) to Muhammad V. Abu Abbas was temporarily replaced in 1384 by Musa ibn Faris al-Mutawakkil. His deposition was engineered by the Nasrids. Musa ibn Faris Abu Faris al-Mutawakkil was a disabled son of the former Sultan Abu Inan Faris. Musa Ben Faris ruled until 1386, and was replaced by Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Wathiq, who ruled until 1387. Abu Abbas then regained the throne. After his restoration, Abu Abbas began to give more power to the vizirs. While Morocco was at peace, Abu Abbas reconquered Tlemcen and Algiers. Abu Al-Abbas died in 1393 in Taza, and Abd al-Aziz II ibn Ahmad II was designated the new sultan. During the troubles that followed, the Christian sovereigns carried the war into Morocco.

Volkan was the first fine arts student from Turkey to be granted this scholarship. In 2003, at the age of 20, he participated in the VIII Istanbul Biennale in collaboration with Galeri Binyil and presented a parallel project. In 2004 Volkan exhibited in Sala Naranja in Valencia. At that time Sala Naranja was one of Spain's most important alternative exhibition spaces. In the following years Volkan collaborated with Sala Naranja on many projects. In 2005, his paintings were exhibited in the VI Observatori Festival in the Principe Felipe Museum in Ciudad de las Artes y Ciencias of Valencia, together with artists like Gary Hill, Gordon Matta-Clark, Paul McCarthy, Dennis Oppenheim and others. In 2006 he was invited to Paris, France, to prepare an exhibition in Abbaye de Maubuisson. In 2007 he presented an exhibition called ‚ÄúDecalages‚Äù, as part of the Tram Project. The exhibition was held at Abbaye de Maubuisson. The same year Volkan‚Äôs biggest exhibition was set up by Sala Naranja in Forja Arte Contemporaneo in Valencia. Shortly after that he was awarded an Cite International des Arts Scholarship in Paris, France. In 2008 he won the Spanish XXXV Bancaja Painting, Sculpture and Digital Art Prize. He exhibited in IVAM Museum. He was elected 3 times as one of the top ten artists of Saatchi Gallery. In 2009 his work was presented at the Saatchi Gallery in Dubai. The same year Volkan represented Turkey at an event called Turkish Culture Season in France. In 2011 he was included in Sotheby‚Äôs Contemporary Turkish Art Auction in London, UK. By 2013 his work had been presented at 15 individual exhibitions, his shows had been held in 8 museums, in 10 different countries, and he had been awarded 6 scholarships. His works were auctioned at five different auction houses. Volkan‚Äôs paintings are in many private, gallery, foundation and corporate collections.

Background  It is not known when or where Zheng Jue was born. He was a grandnephew to the Tang Dynasty official Zheng Qi, who served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. Zheng Jue's father Zheng Hui (ÈÑ≠ÂæΩ) served as an assistant to the late-Tang warlord Zhang Quanyi, who served as the mayor of and controlled the Tang eastern capital Luoyang during those years. Zheng Jue passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class during Emperor Zhaozong's Guanghua era (898-901).Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 58. (It was said that previously, he had failed the Jinshi examinations repeatedly, but Zhang, whom he was depending on (suggesting, but not conclusively indicating, that his father Zheng Hui was deceased by this point), interceded with him with the testing authorities, such that he was given a pass.)New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 54. For the rest of Tang Dynasty, he served successively as a copyeditor at Hongwen Pavilion (ÂºòÊñáÈ§®), an assistant at Jixian Institute (ÈõÜË≥¢Èô¢), and an imperial censor with the title Jiancha Yushi (Áõ£ÂØüÂæ°Âè≤).  During Later Liang  After Tang fell and was succeeded by Later Liang, Zheng Jue served initially as a Bujue (Ë£úÈóï, a low- level consultant in the imperial government), then an imperial chronicler (Ëµ∑Â±ÖÈÉé, Qiju Lang), then an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi), then the deputy minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). It was said that throughout Zheng's career, Zhang Quanyi exerted his influence to aid Zheng in his promotions. Zheng was also known for writing beautifully and elegantly. In 916, during the reign of Later Liang's third and final emperor Zhu Zhen, Zheng Jue was made Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)) and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. In 923, as the Later Liang capital Daliang was left defenseless as Later Liang prepared a massive four-prong attack against its rival north of the Yellow River, Later Tang, Later Tang's emperor Li Cunxu launched a surprise attack on Daliang itself. When Zhu realized it and summoned his officials for a last-ditch strategy session, Zheng suggested that Zhu give him the imperial seal and let him head toward the Later Tang camp, claiming to be surrendering, to see if that would slow the Later Tang advance. Zhu himself was skeptical as to whether this would work, and Zheng then admitted that there was no likelihood for success, drawing laughter from others. With Li Cunxu's army approaching Daliang, Zhu committed suicide, ending Later Liang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272.  During Later Tang  After Later Tang's conquest of Later Liang, Li Cunxu, who saw himself as the legitimate successor to Tang, exiled a number of Later Liang officials who were from Tang aristocratic families, to punish them for, he reasoned, betraying Tang. As part of these exiles, Zheng Jue was sent to Lai Prefecture to serve as its census officer. Shortly thereafter, he was slightly promoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of Cao Prefecture (ÊõπÂ∑û, in modern Heze, Shandong). Nevertheless, Zhang Quanyi, who had become an honored Later Tang official after submitting to Later Tang, was interceding for him with Li's chief of staff Guo Chongtao, trying to get him made chancellor again; instead, though, he was made an advisor to the Crown Prince ‚Äî an honorary position as there was no crown prince at that time. In 926, Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at then-capital Luoyang. His adoptive brother Li Siyuan, who had previously rebelled against him, arrived at Luoyang shortly after and became emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Shortly after, the general Ren Huan returned from a campaign against Former Shu, and was expected to be made chancellor. Li Siyuan's chief of staff An Chonghui, not wanting Ren to serve as chancellor alone, sought to have someone else serve with Ren. An's close associate Kong Xun recommended Zheng, claiming that during Zheng's service as Later Liang chancellor, he was cautious and lenient, capable of writing, and capable of judging character. An thus recommended Zheng to Li Siyuan. Subsequent, Li Siyuan made Ren and Zheng chancellors. Meanwhile, as shortly after two other chancellors that Li Cunxu had commissioned, Doulu Ge and Wei Shuo, were removed from their offices, there were talks of more chancellor commissions. Kong recommended Cui Xie to An, while Ren recommended Li Qi. However, both Zheng and Kong disliked Li Qi, which led to disputes between them and Ren. Eventually, Li Siyuan commissioned Cui and Feng Dao as chancellors. In 928, Zheng, who was then, in addition to being chancellor, also serving as Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng)) and minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu), requested retirement. Li Siyuan gave him the title of Zuo Pushe (Â∑¶ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ) and allowed him to retire.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. Li Siyuan also gave him the honorary title of Kaifu Yitong Sansi (ÈñãÂ∫úÂÑÄÂêå‰∏âÂè∏) and granted him an estate at Zheng Prefecture (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan). He died early in Li Siyuan's Changxing era (930-933) and was given posthumous honors.

It merged into the National Socialist Party of Australia, originally a splinter group, in 1968. Formation The Australian National Socialist Party was launched in 1962 by University of Adelaide physics student Ted Cawthron and Sydney council worker Don Lindsay. They were vigorously anti-communist, and argued for the perpetuation of the White Australia policy, a defensive approach to Asia and the total annexation of New Guinea.A brief history of Nazism in Australia The ‚Äúparty‚Äù consisted entirely of Cawthron and Lindsay until they were joined in July 1963 by Arthur Smith, known for his outward anti-Semitism and aggressive tactics. He was a prominent figure in the Australian Nationalist Workers' Party, an attempted continuation of the \\"Australian Party\\" founded in September 1955 by right-wing journalist Frank Browne and disbanded in September 1957. Browne's party never had a serious following, though the party received some media attention and generally advocated far right positions. Smith was the party's first leader, who managed to slightly increase membership by merging with a host of other motley white supremacist groups in Melbourne. In 1964 a tiny Victorian group, the Australian National Renaissance Party, was incorporated into the ANSP. Its total membership remained very small, although it received substantial publicity from a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Four Corners, which broadcast the proceedings of a general meeting and prompted calls for National Socialism to be banned. Decline The ANSP's headquarters were raided by police on 26 June 1964, during which Smith and four other party members were arrested. The five were charged with a variety of offences, with Smith convicted of possessing unlicensed firearms and explosives and possession of stolen goods; he served a six-month gaol term. While Smith was imprisoned, Robert Pope, who had led the Australian National Renaissance Party, became acting leader, but the party's membership had collapsed following the raid. Attorney-General Billy Snedden told parliament that the party was under surveillance and probably had a membership of fewer than 100. Pope had Smith expelled from the party while he was in prison, and by late 1964 the party was essentially moribund.Harcourt, pp. 16-19. Throughout 1965, Smith was engaged in re- launching the ANSP. In early 1966, Smith attracted media attention when he collapsed while speaking at the Domain. Several poorly frequented demonstrations were held in support of the Vietnam War. The party again went into remission when Smith returned to his native Tasmania, but it re-emerged in June 1967 with anti-communist and anti-Semitic demonstrations. At this point, Cawthron and several other defectors formed the competing National Socialist Party of Australia (NSPA), which rejected the radicalism of the ANSP.Harcourt, pp. 20-25. In May 1968, Smith resigned from the party and retired from politics, leaving the leadership to Eric Wenberg, a long-term party member and militarist. Wenberg made overtures to Cawthron, and the ANSP was merged into the NSPA.Harcourt, pp. 30-31.

Dunn was most recently the president of Southern Illinois University. He formerly served as president of Youngstown State University and Murray State University. Both of his previous presidential terms ended in controversy. Dunn submitted his resignation as the president of Southern Illinois University on July 13, 2018 amidst controversial actions within the university's system. Early life and career Randy Dunn graduated from Westmer High School in Mercer County, Illinois in 1976. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in teacher education from Illinois State University in 1980. He also completed his master's degree in educational administration and foundations from Illinois State in 1983. Dunn received his doctorate in educational administration from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1991. Randy Dunn began his career as a fourth-grade elementary teacher at Gibson City, Illinois Grade School, where he worked from 1980 to 1983. He moved into educational administration when he took the position of principal at Paw Paw, Illinois Grade School for the 1983-84 school year. He then moved on to Roanoke-Benson Middle School in Benson, Illinois, where he served as principal from 1984 to 1989. Dunn worked as superintendent of schools in Argenta, Illinois from 1989 to 1991. He then served as superintendent of schools in Chester, Illinois from 1991 to 1994. After leaving Chester, Dunn worked as an assistant professor at Memphis State University for one year before taking a position as an associate professor at Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1995. Dunn later became a department chair at SIU in 2000. In 2004, Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich handpicked Randy Dunn be the interim Illinois State Superintendent of Education. Soon after his appointment to the position, Dunn affirmed his allegiance to Blagojevich, stating \\"I am a member of the governor's leadership team, and I didn't come on board to take a position that is at odds with the governor's stated positions.\\" In Dunn's first move as superintendent, he hired two high level employees, a new budget director and a new general counsel, who had been pre-selected for the positions by the Blagojevich administration. In August 2005, the Illinois State Board of Education made Dunn's appointment permanent, by removing \\"interim\\" from his title and extending his contract through January 2007.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-09-21/news/0409210374_1_board- members-schiller-rod- blagojevichhttp://www3.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=3&RecNum;=3406http://www.isbe.state.il.us/news/2005/aug11_05.htmhttp://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/iteam&id;=9435444http://www.susanohanian.org/atrocity_fetch.php?id=3080 Murray State tenure In May 2006, Dunn was selected to become president of Murray State University. The Murray State board of regents approved Dunn's hiring by a 7-4 vote during a special meeting in May 2006. Dunn originally told the board that he would not accept the Murray State presidency without a near-unanimous vote from the board of regents, but he changed his mind and accepted the position after talking with his supporters on the board. Dunn was selected to replace King Alexander, who left Murray State in 2005 to take a job as the president of California State University, Long Beach. At the time of his selection, Dunn was on leave as chairman of the Department of Educational Administration and Higher Education at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. Randy Dunn took office at Murray State on December 1, 2006. During Dunn's tenure as president, the Hold Thy Banner High campaign came to a close. The fundraising campaign, which began in 2005 prior to Dunn's presidency, ended in October 2012. The campaign raised $71.73 million to benefit student scholarship endowments, support athletics, purchase new research and laboratory equipment, and advance campus improvements. The campaign was the largest fundraising effort in the history of the university, and it included a $3.3 million donation to the athletic department that resulted in renaming the Regional Special Events Center as the CFSB Center along with construction of a new basketball practice facility. In 2008, Dunn had announced a highly publicized goal of increasing enrollment to 12,000 students at Murray State by 2012. When Dunn took office at Murray State in 2006, total enrollment was at 10,304. In the next two years, enrollment fell to 10,156 in 2007 and 10,022 in 2008. Following the enrollment campaign, the university did experience marginal growth. 2012 total enrollment was 10,832; however, that total was only about 500 students more than when Dunn took office 6 years earlier and significantly short of the 12,000 student goal. In 2010, Dunn applied for the position of president of the University of Tennessee. In October of that year, the UT presidential search panel announced that Randy Dunn was not among the finalists for the position. Dunn applied for the vacant president position at Missouri State University, and he was announced as one of the finalist for that position in September 2012. After visiting the campus during final interviews in October, Dunn stated that the Missouri State position would be his capstone presidency and that it was exactly the kind of place where his background would be beneficial. He then announced on October 15 that he was withdrawing his candidacy for the position. In his statement regarding the decision, he stated that \\"it has become increasingly clear to me in the past few days from various statements, reports, and editorial commentary that the Springfield community has wanted ‚Äúone of their own‚Äù to provide the next era of leadership for Missouri State. As such, I have come to the conclusion that‚Äîeven if I were to be chosen to be Missouri State‚Äôs next president‚Äîthe level of support necessary as an external candidate to guide that institution into a bold and dynamic future would be lacking.\\" He then expressed his intent to remain at Murray State; however, less than two months later he applied and was named as one of three finalists for the position of Florida Education Commissioner. Dunn was ultimately passed over for the position in Florida. On March 15, 2013, the Murray State board of regents voted 7-4 to let Randy Dunn's contract expire, rather than extending it beyond its June 30, 2014 expiration date. A report reviewed by board of regents members prior to the vote indicated that the university's academic standing had fallen since Dunn took over leadership, and enrollment at most of the regional campuses had fallen while enrollment at the main campus remained relatively flat during his tenure as president. The report showed that the university had dropped significantly in at least three major academic rankings. The report also highlighted a deteriorating relationship between Dunn and the board of regents, especially over the last year. Murray State's graduation rate dropped from 59 percent in 2006 to 51 percent in 2012, and the freshman retention rate dropped from 77 percent to 71 percent over the same time period. Controversy surrounded the contract vote, because it was preceded by social gathering the night before the vote at a Regent‚Äôs home in Murray. During that gathering, a quorum of board members were present and informally discussed some university business. Opponents of the contract vote argued that the social gathering constituted an illegal meeting, because public notice was not issued prior to the social gathering and there was no record of minutes from the social gathering. Within a few weeks after the vote by the board of regents, news sources announced that Dunn had applied to, went through initial interview rounds, and was selected as a finalist for the president positions at both Illinois State University and Youngstown State University.http://thenews.org/2013/04/17/dunn-announced-as-finalist-at- illinois-state-university/http://thenews.org/2013/04/12/dunn-begins- interviews-at-youngstown-state/ As a result of the complaints against the board of regents, a re-vote was held on May 10, 2013. In the second vote, the board of regents upheld their original 7-4 decision to let Randy Dunn's contract expire. Youngstown State tenure On April 3, 2013, Dunn was named one of eight semi-finalists for the position of president of Youngstown State University in Youngstown, Ohio. Following a round of interviews held on April 12 and April 13, Dunn was named one of three finalists for the position. On May 10, Randy Dunn was named by the Youngstown State University board of trustees as the new president of the university. Dunn signed his employment contract with Youngstown State on June 7, 2013, and began his tenure on July 15. Under the contract, Dunn would earn $375,000 per year for three years and receive benefits including health care, term life insurance, disability insurance, residence in the newly remodeled Pollock House, an American-made car, and membership at a local country club and one civic club. Dunn will not receive pay increases each year under his contract. On February 17, 2014, after serving as president of Youngstown State University for only seven months, Dunn announced that he would resign his position as president effective August 16, 2014. Dunn announced that he had accepted the position of president at Southern Illinois University. Before his resignation, members of the Youngstown State University Board of Trustees, including its chair Dr. Sudershan Garg, indicated surprise when the news broke on February 16. Dunn had not notified them that he was a candidate for the position at SIU. Confusion continued the following day as Dunn did not appear as expected at an event for prospective students, where he was to speak. Later that day, the YSU Board of Trustees accepted his resignation with 180 days notice as allowed under his contract, though the contract also allows the board to terminate his employment without notice. Dunn did not notify the board of his potential job offer as SIU asked for confidentiality. Jim Tressel was announced as the next President of Youngstown State University to replace Dr. Randy Dunn.http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/feb/17/siu-student-newspaper-dunn-new- president/http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/feb/17/dunn-leave-ysu-southern- illinois/http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/feb/17/dunn-no-show-crash-day-ysu- trustees-meet-president/ On Wednesday, March 5, 2014, following an executive session by the Youngstown State University trustees, the university announced that it had voided Dunn's contract. The board of trustees and Dunn‚Äôs attorneys agreed to the amended contract, which allowed for his departure on March 21. As a result, Dunn was ordered to vacate the university's presidency on March 21 and move out of the presidential residence by April 20. Provost Ikram Khawaja assumed the presidency on an interim basis after Dunn‚Äôs departure.http://news.wsiu.org/post/update-youngstown-releases- dunnhttp://wkbn.com/2014/03/05/dunn-departing-ysu-on-march-21/ Southern Illinois University tenure SIU presidential search firm William Funk & Associates approached Randy Dunn to be a nominee for the vacant president position in October 2013, only three months after he took office as president of Youngstown State. Dunn initially expressed reservations about being formally considered, but he told the search firm to keep him in mind. The search firm followed up again with Dunn in December and January. Dunn formally submitted his application for the presidency on January 10, and he interviewed with the SIU board on February 12 in St. Louis. His selection was announced on February 17, 2014.http://dailyegyptian.com/dunn-opens-up-about-confidential- search/ Dunn was appointed president of Southern Illinois University effective May 1, 2014, and later had his contract renewed. Dunn stated, \\"This will be the last job for me. I do not plan to leave this position until retirement.\\" Dunn found himself in the middle of another controversy when an email surfaced in which he was caught stating a campus financial arrangement was discussed to \\"simply to shut up the bitchers from Carbondale...\\" Dunn was swiftly rebuked by two Illinois state legislators who called for his resignation. The University Board of Trustees called a special meeting that was held June 21, 2018, to discuss Dunn's future employment as president. A motion was presented to suspend Dunn, but failed in a four-to-four vote; however, the board voted to release more than 1,800 pages of email correspondence that were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Trustee Marsha Ryan called on Dunn to resign following the release of the documents. The Board of Trustees announced Dunn's resignation on July 13, 2018. The Board of Trustees met in special session on July 16, 2018, to vote on termination and a severance package, with Dunn placed on leave effective July 17, 2018. In May 2019, a report was released from the Executive Ethics Commission of the State of Illinois in which it was determined that Dunn was responsible for two incidences of improper hiring. The first incidence was Dunn's commitment to hiring the daughter and son-in-law of the late SIU Chancellor Carlo Montemagno as conditions of Montemagno's employment in 2017. Dunn was found to have skirted fair hiring practices through misapplication of Civil Service hiring rules and an improper search waiver that allowed both positions to be given to the couple non-competitively. Dunn was also alleged to have kept his actions secret from the Board of Trustees while simultaneously misrepresenting that the board approved of the search waiver. The report also determined Dunn had abused search waivers while hiring his long-time friend and colleague Brad Colwell to the position of vice-president for student and academic affairs. https://thesouthern.com/news/local/siu/ethics-report-on-randy-dunn-s-improper- siu-hires-released/article_3bb5ea9e-6082-5300-acd2-aeaae542c7d9.html Colwell had previously served as the college's interim chancellor from 2015 until Montemagno was hired. Colwell had also been a candidate for the permanent position. Dunn oversaw his hiring to the VP position after Colwell lost the bid for chancellor. In April 2019, it was reported that Colwell had stepped down from his role as VP of student and academic affairs due to the investigation into his hiring. He now teaches at the university. https://news.wsiu.org/post/colwell-out-siu-vp#stream/0 Personal life He began dating Dr. Ronda Baker in 2006 while he was the Illinois State Superintendent of Education and she was a regional superintendent in southern Illinois.

The line now constitutes the northernmost section of the original North Line which has not been electrified to form part of Copenhagen's commuter rail network, the S-train. The railway is owned by Hovedstadens Lokalbaner and operated by the railway company Lokaltog which runs frequent local train services between Hiller√∏d station and Helsing√∏r station. History Gr√∏nholt halt in 1983. The North Line opened in 1864 between Copenhagen and Elsinore by way of Hiller√∏d. It was originally the main line to Elsinore before the more direct Coast Line opened in 1897. The North Line was gradually electrified to form part of Copenhagen's commuter rail network, the S-train, with electrification reaching Hiller√∏d station in 1968. The Little North Line now constitutes the northernmost section of the original North Line which has not been converted into S-train. Route Map of the Little North Line The line continues the North Line of the S-train network. It runs north from Hiller√∏d station along the tracks of the Gribskov Line, before curving east towards Helsing√∏r. The most important town along the route is Fredensborg, home to Fredensborg Palace, one of the Danish Royal Family's two main residences. The Little North Line joins the Coast Line in Snekkersten, one station before reaching Helsing√∏r. Operation Trains on the Little North Line is operated by the railway company Lokaltog. Lokaltog operates a fairly intensive timetable on the Little North Line with light DMUs working a fixed 30-minute frequency most in the day time (until 19:00) and every hour in the evening.Timbe table.

He ascended to the throne at the age of sixteen. He succeeded his brother, Abu Amir Abdallah ibn Ahmad. His forces were involved in an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Gibraltar from the Emirate of Granada in 1410. In 1415 the Portuguese seized the port of Ceuta. Abu Said Uthman III failed in an attempt to recover Ceuta, and was shortly after assassinated. His vizier gained control of the kingdom, establishing the Wattasid dynasty of rulers of Morocco. Siege of Gibraltar The garrison of Gibraltar rebelled in 1410 against the Granadan ruler, Yusuf III, and declared allegiance to Abu Said Uthman III. Abu Said Uthman III sent his brother, Abu Said, to take charge with an army numbering some 1,000 cavalry and 2,000 infantry. They occupied a number of castles in the area as well as the ports of Estepona and Marbella. A Granadan counter-offensive in 1411 drove Abu Said back to Gibraltar, where he took refuge. Yusuf III's son Ahmad laid siege to Gibraltar and defeated several Moroccan attempts to break out. Eventually a Granadan sympathizer in the garrison helped the besiegers to gain entrance. They stormed the Moorish Castle, forcing Abu Said to surrender, and restored Granadan control over Gibraltar. Back in Morocco, Abu Said Uthman III reacted by writing to Yusuf III to ask him to execute Abu Said for disloyalty. Instead, the Granadan sultan gave Abu Said an army and sent him back to Morocco to launch an ultimately unsuccessful rebellion against Abu Said Uthman III. Ceuta In 1415 King John I of Portugal seized Ceuta. This conquest marked the beginning of overseas European expansion. The Portuguese capture of Ceuta in 1415 had taken the Moroccans by surprise. In 1419 Abu Said Uthman III led an army to recover it, but his siege of Ceuta failed. The besieging forces included those of Abu Said Uthman III and allied forces from the Emirate of Granada. The Portuguese garrison of Ceuta was led by Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real. The Portuguese gathered a fleet under the command of princes Henry the Navigator and John of Reguengos to relieve Ceuta. According to the chroniclers, the relief fleet turned out to be quite unnecessary. In a bold gambit, D. Pedro de Menezes led the Portuguese garrison in a sally against the Marinid siege camp and forced the lifting of the siege before the relief fleet even arrived. Assassination and succession The failure to recapture Ceuta led to widespread disaffection with the sultan and instability in the Marinid state. This culminated in a coup in Fez in 1420, in which the sultan Abu Said Uthman III was assassinated, leaving behind only a one-year- old child, Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haqq II as son and heir. A succession struggle broke out immediately as other pretenders quickly emerged. Opportunistically, the Nasrid rulers of Granada and the Abdalwadids of the Kingdom of Tlemcen intervened, each sponsoring different candidates for the Moroccan throne. At the time, Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi was serving as the long-time governor of Sal√© for the Marinids. Hearing the news of the sultan's assassination, Abu Zakariya hurried from Sal√© and seized control of the royal palace of Fez, proclaiming the orphan child Abd al-Haqq as the new Marinid sultan and appointing himself his regent and chief minister (vizier). Morocco quickly descended into disorder and strife. Granadan and Tlemcen interventions and intrigues continued, regional governors seized control of their districts, selling and re-selling their allegiance to the highest bidder, Sufi-inspired religious radicals drummed up mobs to seize control of urban centers and take to the field, while rowdy rural nomads, the Hilalian Bedouin tribesmen, availed themselves of the general breakdown of law and order to launch a series of bandit raids on smaller towns and settlements. However, the vizier Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi eventually gained control, becoming the effective ruler of Morocco, founder of the Wattasid dynasty of viziers and later sultans.

The free version contains network visualization and social network analysis features. The commercial version includes access to social media network data importers, advanced network metrics, and automation. It is a popular package similar to other network visualization tools such as Pajek, UCINet, and Gephi.. Codebase NodeXL is a set of prebuilt class libraries using a custom Windows Presentation Foundation control. Additional .NET assemblies can be developed as \\"plug-ins\\" to import data from outside data providers. Currently-implemented data providers for NodeXL include YouTube, Twitter, wikipedia (the MediaWiki understructure), web hyperlinks, Microsoft Exchange Server. Features NodeXL is intended for users with little or no programming experience to allow them to collect, analyze, and visualize a variety of networks. NodeXL integrates into Microsoft Excel 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016 and opens as a workbook with a variety of worksheets containing the elements of a graph structure such as edges and nodes. NodeXL can also import a variety of graph formats such as edgelists, adjacency matrices, GraphML, UCINet .dl, and Pajek .net. Data Import NodeXL Pro imports UCINet and GraphML files, as well as Excel spreadsheets containing edge lists or adjacency matrices, into NodeXL workbooks. NodeXL Pro also allows for quick collection of social media data via a set of import tools which can collect network data from e-mail, Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr. NodeXL requests the user's permission before collecting any personal data and focuses on the collection of publicly available data, such as Twitter statuses and follows relationships for users who have made their accounts public. These features allow NodeXL users to instantly get working on relevant social media data and integrate aspects of social media data collection and analysis into one tool. Data Representation NodeXL workbooks contain four worksheets: Edges, Vertices, Groups, and Overall Metrics. The relevant data about entities in the graph and relationships between them are located in the appropriate worksheet in row format. For example, the edges worksheet contains a minimum of two columns, and each row has a minimum of two elements corresponding to the two vertices that make up an edge in the graph. Graph metrics and edge and vertex visual properties appear as additional columns in the respective worksheets. This representation allows the user to leverage the Excel spreadsheet to quickly edit existing node properties and to generate new ones, for instance by applying Excel formulas to existing columns. Graph Analysis NodeXL Pro contains a library of commonly used graph metrics: centrality, clustering coefficient, diameter. NodeXL differentiates between directed and undirected networks. NodeXL Pro implements a variety of community detection algorithms to allow the user to automatically discover clusters in their social networks. Graph Visualization NodeXL generates an interactive canvas for visualizing graphs. The project allows users to pick from several well-known Force-directed graph drawing layout algorithms such as Fruchterman-Reingold and Harel-Koren. NodeXL allows the user to multi-select, drag and drop nodes on the canvas and to manually edit their visual properties (size, color, and opacity). In addition, NodeXL allows users to map the visual properties of nodes and edges to metrics it calculates, and in general to any column in the edges and vertices worksheet. Research NodeXL has been used by news outlets like Foreign Policy to visualize the structure of conversations about political topics as well as organizations like the World Bank to analyze voting data. NodeXL has been used as an analytical tool in dozens of research papers in the social, information, and computer sciences as well as the focus of research in human computer interaction, data mining, and data visualization.

Generally written by Anglo-Saxons, the syllogae demonstrate that inscriptions were plentiful along the via Flaminia and in the city of Rome.Everett, Literacy, 243‚Äì44. The reasons for recording inscriptions varied. Some are interested solely in inscriptions on churches and Christian monuments. These, like Sylloge einsiedlensis from the time of Charlemagne and Pope Hadrian I, often include itineraries of \\"the places of the saints\\" (loca sanctorum), for the benefit of fellow pilgrims, and reports of the liturgical practices of the Patria sancti Petri. Others, like the Sylloge laureshamensis, contain classical and pagan inscriptions with references to emperors, important personages, titles and offices. The author of the Laureshamensis traversed the peninsula between Rome and Ivrea, passing through Milan, Pavia, Piacenza, Ravenna, Spoleto and Vercelli. He had a special interest in metrical inscriptions and his Piacentine collection he divided under the headings RITHM and METR, indicating rhythmic and hexametric metre, respectively. The Sylloge centulensis, from an eighth- or ninth-century manuscript of the monastery of Corvey, compiled on a trip from Rome to Spoleto to Ravenna, records \\"what we might term Petrean poetry\\", a style lying between classical and medieval forms.Everett, Literacy, 244. Pierre Rich√© referred to it as \\"a religious poetry in classical vocabulary and form\\" where \\"not even dogma escaped the laws of poetry\\". The seventh-century Sylloge turonensis concentrates on the monuments of Rome. Later examples include the Sylloge parisina, the Sylloge virdunensis and the Sylloge wirceburgensis. The surviving syllogae were first edited and studied by the archaeologist Giovanni Battista de Rossi, who published them in the first part of the second volume of his monumental Inscriptiones christianae urbis Romae septimo saeculo antiquiores (Rome: 1857, 1861‚Äì88).

Located at an altitude of about 760 m, the crater is about 80 m deep and has been heavily worn by erosion. Following its formation, a crater lake formed in the depression that was gradually filled in with deposits, so that the surface is now an average of 45 m beneath the rim. The present day interior is filled with swampy ground that is maintained by a stream flowing in from the eastern side. This water exits the crater to form a tributary of the North Johnstone River. The mean annual rainfall at this site is 2,500 mm. Sedimentary deposits in the crater provide pollen samples covering most of the last 200,000 years of vegetation growth in the region; spanning the last two glacial periods. During the interglacial epochs, the crater was occupied by mesic evergreen rainforest. In the cooler glacial periods, this was replaced by rain forests prevalent in drier climes. From 40,000 years ago, the crater was gradually occupied by sclerophyll vegetation such as Casuarina and Eucalyptus, with the transition being completed 26,000 years ago. Around 10,000 years ago, evergreen vegetation once more regained dominance. Particles of charcoal dated from up to 38,000 years ago are believed to be the result of fires lit by Aboriginal Australians, and are coincident with the appearance of the sclerophyll vegetation and loss of regional megafauna.

As of 2013, people of African descent are the majority in Saint Lucia, accounting for 82.5% of the country's population. An additional 11.9% of the country is multiracial, predominantly of Afro- European descent and Afro-Indian descent.  Origins  H.H. Breen, one of the earliest writers to write a detailed study of St Lucia, noted during his period little was known about the Island In its early French colonial period, the African slave population were imported from Martinique, or, during bouts of British rule, supplemented by slaves from Barbados. This dominance of Martinique merchants in monopolising the slave imports into the Island has raised the reasonable inference, supported statistically, that most slaves shared a common origin from the Senegambian coast. According to Dalphinis, the majority of slaves from 1695 onwards were indisputably from the Senegambia, comprising mainly Wolof and Mandingo ethnic groups. As a British possession, however, at the end of the eighteenth century, St Lucia increasingly imported large numbers of slaves from Akan and Igbo groups. Consequently, the slave population, diverse but distinct, is shaped over the course of two centuries by Senegambian slaves (including slaves from the Malian hinterland, Fulani, Dyula, Bambara etc.) and Akan (Gold Coast slaves) and Igbo slaves (Bight of Biafra: roughly 3,000 slaves, or 53% of the slaves enter St Lucia before the end of Slavery). As to Yoruba, they constitute a strong cultural influence on the Island. In many areas, their cultural impact has left the strongest legacy since many Yoruba came as 'indentured servants' after slavery, introducing the Kele and Ogun ritual rites. Also present in big numbers were the Ambundus Central Africans slaves (more of 1,000 slaves, or 22%). Between 1600-1700, most of the slaves, as noted, came from Senegambia. These slaves were mainly used as servants. Meanwhile, Ewe and Fon slaves, from the Slave Coast, exerted as rural slaves The ethno-linguistic dominance of specific groups in certain areas of work, had a great importance in the origin of Creole identity  History  In 1763, when the British acquired the island by the Treaty of Paris, they imported enslaved Africans as workers. Caribbean conditions were harsh, and many African slaves, like the Caribs (also used as slaves in the island), died, requiring continued importation of new captives. The British continued to import slaves until they abolished the trade in 1808. By that time, people of ethnic African and less so Carib descent greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. On 21 February 1795, an army of French and African freedom fighters led by Goyrand defeated a battalion of British troops. For the next four months, a united front of recently freed slaves and freedom fighters known as the Brigands (also ex-slaves, who instigated revolt across the region) forced out not only the British army, but many of the slaveholders who had been loyal to the British. Just under a year later, the British Army returned, with many more troops than the freedom fighters could manage, and eventually re-imposed slavery until 1807, when the African slave trade was abolished (although it was not until 1834 that they abolished the institution of slavery). In 1814, the British regained control of the island, many of those freed had escaped into the thick rain forests.They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters by Robert J Devaux Even after abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \\"apprenticeship\\" which forced them to work for free for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. They achieved full freedom in 1838.  Demography and culture  The culture of Saint Lucia has been influenced by African, East Indian, French and British heritage. One of the secondary languages is a Creole, a form of French patois.  Languages  The official language is English; The official language spoken in Saint Lucia is English although many Saint Lucians also speak a French dialect, Creole (Kw√©y√≤l). The Saint Lucian Creole French (Kw√©y√≤l), which is a French-based Creole colloquially referred to as \\"Patwah\\" (Patois), is spoken by 95% of the population. This Antillean Creole is used in literature and music, and is gaining official acknowledgement. It is derived chiefly from French and African languages, with some vocabulary from Carib and other sources.  Music  The B√®l√® music type, characteristic of Saint Lucia, Dominica and Martinique is probably of Dahomeyan origin. Cuisine The island's cuisine is a unique blend of African, European (mainly British and French) and East Indian cuisine; this creates dynamic meal dishes such as Bouillon hearty soups packed full with fresh locally produced vegetables, hearty fish broths or fish water, pelau, green fig and salt fish, breadfruit and saltfish and other combinations. St Lucian cuisine is similar to that in many other commonwealth Caribbean nations such as Dominica, neighboring St Vincent and Trinidad. Typical essential food stuff are potatoes, onions, celery, thyme, coconut milk, cassava, flour and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over ground provisions or rice. Due to St Lucia's small Indo-Caribbean population curry is very popular, however due to the blend of between cooking styles curry dishes have a distant Caribbean twist to it. Roti, a flatbread of Indian origin, has become very popular and is typically served in households or as a quick meal to go.

In 1859, the British began transporting indentured workers from British India to work on plantation estates in Saint Lucia, which had become a British colony in 1814. The first ship carrying 318 indentured workers from India, the Palmyra, arrived in Saint Lucia on 6 May 1859, and the last ship carrying Indian indentured workers, the Volga, arrived on 10 December 1893. In total, 13 ships transported nearly 4,500 Indian indentured workers to Saint Lucia between 1859 and 1893, excluding those who died during the voyage. About 2,075 workers returned to India, while the rest remained in Saint Lucia or emigrated to other Caribbean nations such as Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana. The last indenture contracts expired in 1897, and by the end of the 19th century, Saint Lucia had a population of 2,560 free Indians. Many Indians who had completed their indenture periods were unable to return home as they did not have sufficient funds to do so. The Indians that remained in Saint Lucia are the origin of the Indo-Saint Lucian community. As of 2013, people of Indian descent are a minority ethnic group in Saint Lucia, accounting for 2.4% of the country's population. An additional 11.9% of the country is multiracial, predominantly of Indian and African descent. History European colonialists established sugarcane plantations in the West Indies in the 17th century using African slave labour. Following the abolition of slavery in British West Indian colonies in 1838, plantation owners in the region sought to find alternate sources of labour. In 1859, the British began transporting indentured workers from India to work on plantation estates in Saint Lucia, which had become a British colony in 1814. Most of the workers came from rural areas of the modern-day Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. In India, they had been agricultural labourers and small farmers. Most of them belonged to lower castes and were poor, however, they were not the poorest people in their native villages. The majority of them owned cattle and property in India. They emigrated to the West Indies primarily for economic reasons, intending to make money there and return to India with their savings. Others, in particular the female indentured workers, saw the work as a \\"vehicle for emancipation\\" believing that their indenture period was a path to attaining personal and economic freedom. Nearly two-thirds of all indentured Indian women were widows, former prostitutes, single mothers, or had been deserted by their husbands or had run away from unhappy marriages. The conditions of the Indian workers on plantation estates was poor, and on average, 25-30% of all workers suffered from malaria or spleen disease at any given point of time. The first Indian settlements in Saint Lucia were established near the sugar estates where they worked namely, Pierrot, Augier, Belle Vue and Cacao around the Vieux Fort factory; La Caye and Dennery near the Dennery factory; Marc and Forestiere near the Cul-de-Sac factory, and Anse La Raye near the Roseau factory. A small Indian village also came up in Balca, near to Balenbouche estate. The first ship carrying 318 indentured workers from India, the Palmyra, arrived in Saint Lucia on 6 May 1859. This group was indentured for a period of three years, and most were re-indentured in 1864. Not much is known about the conditions under which workers were re-indentured or had their contracts extended. The next ship, the Francis Ridley brought 261 Indian workers in June 1857. This group was also re-indentured in 1864. More Indian workers arrived on the island in 1860. The Victor Emmanuel brought 367-393 workers to Saint Lucia on 15 February and the Zemindar carried 293-316 workers on 10 April 1860. The indenture period of the Indians brought on board these two ships ended in 1863, but all of them were re-indentured. There were an estimated 1,215 Indian indentured workers in Saint Lucia by the end of 1860, of whom 242 died by the end of 1861. At least one Indian worker was reported to have absconded from Saint Lucia. British Colonial Administrator Breen of Saint Lucia attributed the high mortality rate to the poor conditions provided to workers on the Roseaux Valley estates owned by William Muter. The birth of 50 Indian children on the island brought the total Indian population in the country to 1,202 by the end of 1861. The Ulysses transported 287-320 Indians from Calcutta and arrived in Saint Lucia in February 1862. The population of Indians on the islands reached 1,463 by the end of 1862. A new hospital system for indentured workers was established in 1862, after the high mortality rates under the previous system of medical care. Saint Lucia had 1,304 and 1,325 Indians by the end of 1863 and 1864 respectively. The Indian workers who had arrived aboard the Victor Emmanuel and the Zemindar completed their five-year indenture period by the end of 1865. The Indians who arrived on board the Palmyra completed their indenture period in May 1857. Per the terms of their contract, they could choose to avail a free passage to India or could receive a free grant of land from the colonial Governor of Saint Lucia. The Indian population totaled 1,207, of whom only 251 were still indentured by the end of 1867. Only the Indian workers that had arrived on board the Ulysses had not completed their indenture period. The majority of the Indian workers who had completed their indenture period requested to return to India. However, the Governor of Saint Lucia wanted them to remain in Saint Lucia and offered cash in exchange for forfeiting the right to return. Four hundred Indians took up the Governor's offer, while 230 officially registered to return to India by the end of 1867. 451 Indians returned to India aboard the Ganges at the end of that year, and 298 returned on board the Lincelles in November 1868. The Lincelles voyage cost the British colonial government ¬£3,600 (). The government also spent ¬£3,097 () to pay 425 Indians who had chosen to forfeit their right of return. 162 Indians returned to India in January 1870. Around 1,500 Indian indentured workers arrived in Saint Lucia between 1859 and 1869, of whom only 300 remained on the island. The majority of Indians who forfeited their right of return to India, chose to use the cash they received from the Governor to emigrate to other Caribbean nations, particularly those with large Indian populations. The exodus of Indians from the island caused labour shortages for plantation estates that were heavily dependent on Indian labour. Fearing that some estates may collapse, the government introduced a new scheme to persuade Indians to remain in Saint Lucia in 1870. Under the new policy, Indian workers (and their children) would be entitled to a free return voyage to India if they agreed to remain in Saint Lucia for at least 3 years, register with authorities periodically, and only pursue agricultural occupations. By 1870, plantation owners were successful in replacing some of the Indian workforce with Barbadians. The Harkaway transported 162 Indians back to India in 1871. This was the last group of Indians entitled to free return. Illness resulted in a large group of Indians, around 340, being admitted to hospitals in 1878. In April of the same year, 580 Indian workers arrived in Saint Lucia aboard the Lucindas to help replace the ill workers. The Chetah, Foyle and Bann brought 221, 67, and 316 workers to the country in 1879, 1880, and 1881 respectively. The Jamuna returned 95 people back to India in 1883. Between 1881 and 1883, Saint Lucia was unable to obtain Indian labourers due to competition from larger Caribbean countries, and considered importing Chinese workers instead. Saint Lucia was able to obtain 626 Indians workers on board the Bracadille in 1884. However, the ship, which had departed from Calcutta, had to be quarantined on arrival due to a cholera outbreak on board. This in turn resulted in some neighbouring countries quarantining Saint Lucia. Many of the Indians on board the Bracadille were admitted to Saint Lucian hospitals the following year, and they were deemed to be in the poorest physical state of any Indian workers that had come to the island. The Poonah transported 306 Indian indenture workers to Saint Lucia in 1885. A Canadian Presbyterian Mission to Indian immigrants in Trinidad established three schools for Indian children in Saint Lucia in 1887. Creole children were also enrolled in the schools. The Moy, Rone, and Hereford returned 327, 132, and 21 Indians back to India in 1888, 1889, and 1890 respectively. In 1889 or 1890, the Victoria Hospital treated 1,301 Indians for various illnesses. The SS Roumania brought 554 Indians to Saint Lucia on 31 March 1891. The ship sailed from Calcutta via the Suez Canal making it the first ship to transport immigrants to the West Indies via that route. The SS Roumania had 309 male and 126 female adults, 7 children, 105 infants on board. Three births and five deaths occurred during the voyage, and one birth and one death occurred at the Castries harbour before the passengers had disembarked. Most of the passengers, particularly the children, were malnourished and had to be admitted to the hospital directly. A further 19 children and 3 adults would die at the hospital. By the end of 1891, Saint Lucia had an Indian population of 2,523 Indians - 1,849 Hindus, 475 Christians, and 199 Muslims. Indian workers who had been brought to Saint Lucia in 1881 and had completed their indenture period were unable to avail their right of return to India in 1891 because the colonial government failed to procure any transportation for them. However, the government reserved a 627-acre plot of land near the Castries to establish a settlement for Indians. The government sold 5 to 10 acres of land to each Indian at a cost of about ¬£1 () per acre payable in installments over a five-year period. Administrator in Chief V. Skipton Gouldsbury noted, \\"I hope to be able before long to establish the nucleus of another Indian coolie settlement in the neighborhood of Vieux Fort at the south end of the island, and am having lands surveyed in that locality for that purpose.\\" Indians that remained in Saint Lucia began investing in the country in 1891. They made large deposits in savings banks, purchased livestock, and some bought property in the Castries region. The country had 5 schools catering to Indian children by the end of 1891. The Jumna returned 137-139 workers who had completed their indenture period back to India in August 1892. The workers also received a total of ¬£2,138 () in cash. Colonial authorities closed the Indian school located at the Central Factory Estate at the end of 1892, re-opened it in February 1893, before closing it permanently in October 1893. A colonial government record from 1893 also noted that Indians who were absent from plantations estates without leave or those who refused work could face imprisonment. The last ship carrying indentured Indian immigrants, the Volga, departed Calcutta with 730 Indians on board - 554 adults, 395 males and 159 females. The vessel arrived off the coast of Castries harbour on the night of 10 December 1893. However, the ship ran aground at the Vigie Point, then capsized and sank. Fortunately, the limited wind and a comparatively smooth sea allowed the ship's lifeboats and people at the shore to rescue all passengers. Only 156 of the ship's passengers remained in Saint Lucia, as the remaining were scheduled to be transported to Jamaica. 487 Indians sailed for Jamaica aboard the Jumna on 22 December 1893. The remains of the Volga are believed to lie at the bottom of a cove in the Vigie Peninsula. The cove is known as \\"tou deewee\\", meaning \\"rice hole\\" in French Creole, because oral accounts of the ship stated that it was carrying bags of rice, some of which reportedly washed on shore. All of the Indians who arrived on the SS Roumania and the Volga had to remain in Saint Lucia because they did not have sufficient funds to return to India, and the fund set up by the colonial government to repatriate Indian workers had no money left. The British Peer returned 450 immigrants, including 40 children, to India in September 1894. They received a total of ¬£2,989 () from the colonial government. At the end of 1894, 889 Indian workers completed their indenture period. Of these workers, 317 accepted the government's scheme to remain in the country, while 36 remained in the country without claiming compensation from the government. 708 Indians remained indentured in Saint Lucia at the end of 1894, and 721 the following year. Four Indian schools functioned in Saint Lucia with a total of 233 students in 1894 and 211 in 1895. At the end of 1896, 149 Indians remained indentured in the country. In total, 13 ships transported 4,354 Indian indentured workers to Saint Lucia between 1859 and 1893, excluding those who died during the voyage. About 2,075 workers returned to India, while the rest remained in Saint Lucia or emigrated to other Caribbean nations such as Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana. The last indenture contracts expired in 1897, and by the end of the 19th century, Saint Lucia had a population of 2,560 free Indians. Many Indians who had completed their indenture periods were unable to return home as they did not have sufficient funds to do so. The Indians that remained in Saint Lucia are the origin of the Indo-Saint Lucian community.  Indian Arrival Day  The Indian Diaspora of St. Lucia, an association promoting Indo-Saint Lucian heritage, organized the first Indian Arrival Day celebrations in Saint Lucia on 6 May 2013. The association is campaigning for the Saint Lucian government to officially declare the 6th of May as Indian Arrival Day. Many other Caribbean nations observe Indian Arrival Day annually to commemorate the date when the first Indians arrived in their respective countries.

All India Radio Srinagar broadcasts in Kashmiri, Urdu & Hindi. Formerly known as Radio Kashmir, it was renamed as AIR Srinagar, AIR Jammu and AIR Leh. All India Radio Jammu broadcasts in Dogri, Urdu & Hindi. History It was established on 1 July 1948 when Sheikh Abdullah, then the Prime Minister of Kashmir, inaugurated the Radio Kashmir Srinagar station near the Tourist Reception Centre in Srinagar. Its broadcasting station is still located in Srinagar near Zero or Abdullah Bridge. J.N. Zutshi was the first Director General of Radio Kashmir. He was also the Secretary to Information & Broadcasting to J&K; Government. Ghulam Mohi-ud-Din was the first head of the station. Radio Kashmir Srinagar became most popular when Pushkar Bhan's Zoon Dab was aired for more than nineteen years from the Radio Kashmir station, and became a usual medium of entertainment for the people who used to listen the Radio Kashmir 24/7. Crisis After 1953 when Kashmir's political power began to change, observers say that Radio Kashmir Srinagar, shortly after its establishment, came under the control of All India Radio to counter the Radio Azad Kashmir. Observers also say that both these stations were used to counter programmes aired by each other. When the Azad Radio Kashmir used to air Zarb e qaleem, it was countered by Srinagar station's Jawabi hamla. Contribution All India Radio Srinagar has contributed a lot towards the traditional music of Kashmir. It became home of people like Ghulam Hassan Sofi, who used to sing Kashmir's traditional songs which provided relief to the disturbed minds of Kashmiri people. All India Radio Srinagar also aired Kailash Mehra's collection which people liked most. Ghulam Nabi Dolwal was one of the noted artist who showed his talent through All India Radio (lSrinagar. Nowadays his daughter Jahan Ara Janbaz reaches her fans through All India Radio Srinagar. All India Radio Srinagar is believed to be the only medium which is broadcasting the audio of Kashmiri traditional songs, thus keeping Kashmiri musical tradition alive and contributing towards the Kashmiri society.

Even after the flood wiped the Doordarshan Kendra Srinagar which led to wind up its broadcast, just next door to it, Radio Kashmir Station survived much more than any other radio or Internet service. Radio station in floods started Short Message Service so affected people could be rescued while its building was itself submerged. Finally the flood reached the first floor where in studios were affected and radio too closed its broadcast and announcer promised to restore the service as soon as possible.

Religious contribution AIR Srinagar also serves in the holy months of Muslims by producing such programs related to particular holy months like Muharram and for Ramadan. AIR Srinagar aired in 1980's the voice of Mirza Abdul Ghani Beigh, the prominent Kashmiri Noha reciter and writer. Shia people across the valley remained in waiting for the programme of such religious Noha chanter personalities.

Oplismenus hirtellus flowers are typically deep reddish or purple, whereas a sister species Oplismenus undulatifolius features white or very lightly colored flowers. Description The species flowering stalk is located above the leaves with the sticky purple colored awns. Flowers appear from December to June. It grows high and has some hairs which have 10-15 nerves on either side. The plant is whitish on the lower surface and is very narrow near midrib. It is self-pollinated plant which seeds attract various animals and birds. The sticky seeds are easily distributed by animals and humans, easily adhering to fur and clothing. Distribution In the United States Oplismenus hirtellus is considered native to the southeastern United States, growing in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Oklahoma. There has been some disagreement about the taxonomic classification of non-native Oplismenus in several states: * In Maryland and Virginia an exotic invasive Oplismenus with white flowers was discovered in 1996 and identified as Oplismenus hirtellus subsp. undulatifolius but later recognized as the separate Oplismenus undulatifolius. * In Hawaii, the grass was recorded in 1819 though not considered native to the state. With deep reddish flowers, the Hawaiian grass is most likely a form of the tropical Oplismenus hirtellus rather than the temperate O. undulatifolius. Because of its presence on the islands for over 150 years, it is referred to as a naturalized non-native, while its dominance in shaded forests suggests the species could be described as invasive.

History  In 1654, when the French tried to dominate the Caribs, they recorded the presence of 3,000 black people and much fewer pure Caribs (\\"Yellow\\"), without making any reference to an individual's state of freedom or slavery. The number was ratified 12 years later in a report by the English Colonel Philip Warner: \\"In Saint Vicent, a French possession, there are about 3000 black and none of the islands there are that amount of Indians.\\"Calendar of State Papers (1665‚Äì1676), vol. 10, reissue of 1964. In 1668, the British broke the treaty signed between France and the Caribs in Basse Terre, and tried to impose, as a first measure of domain, that the Indians stopped harbouring the blacks fugitives and delivered them to the British as soon as they were required.Calendar of State Papers (1661‚Äì1668), vol. 5, reissue of 1964. Actually, according to researchers such as the linguist specializing in the Garifuna language Itarala, most of the slaves arriving in Saint Vincent came from other Caribbean islands (as, he says, no boat came directly from Africa to the archipelago), and settled in Saint Vincent in order to escape enslavement. So coming to the island were Maroons from plantations on all the surrounding islands, but were diluted in the strong culture of Carib resistance.‚ÄúEscala de intensidad de los africanos en el Nuevo Mundo‚Äù, ibidem, p. 136. Although most of the slaves came from Barbados,Garifuna reach: Historia de los gar√≠funas. Posted by Itarala. Retrieved 19:30 pm. slaves came also from such places as St. Lucia and Grenada. The Barbadians and Saint Lucians arrived on the island pre-1735. After 1775, most of the slaves who came from other islands to escape the slavery were Saint Lucians and Grenadians.A Brief History of St. Vincent After arriving at the island, they were received by the Caribs, who offered protection, enslaved themCharles Gullick, Myths of a Minority, Assen: Van Gorcum, 1985. and, eventually, mixed with them. Addition of the African refugees, the Caribs captured slaves from neighboring islands (although also they had as slaves white people and his own people), even more that the white people, while were in fighting against the British and French. Many of the captured slaves were integrated into their communities (this also occurred in islands such as Dominica), while the others slaves were mixed only each other and with the rest of the population of the island. However, as opposed to Itarala, some authors indicated that many slaves of Saint Vincent hailed from slaves ports on all the coast of West and Central Africa: Senegambia, Sierra Leone, Windward Coast, Gold Coast, Bight of Benin, Bight of Biafra, Central Africa, and of others areas from Africa. All these places provided thousands of slaves to Saint Vincent, specially the Bight of Biafra (from where, apparently, more than 20,000 slaves came, some 40% of the slaves) and of the Gold Coast (from where came, apparently, more of 11,000 slaves, 22% of the slaves).African origins of the slaves from British and former British Antilles At any rate, to be this well, these slaves lived with the slaves of the Caribs. So, the \\"Black Archers\\", i.e. the population of African origin that had adopted Carib customs and was accepted on an island where the indigenous resistance has not gone off, caused panic among Europeans. A warrior body of Amerindians and free blacks constituted a threat to the plantation slave system and a low blow to the colonial order, unwilling to accept miscegenation that they could not control it. In turn, to ingratiate with the Caribs or because they really felt \\"belonging to the same single nation\\",As stated by Jean-Baptiste Labat in Voyages aux isles de l'Am√©rique, Paris, 1704, quoted by Ruy Galvao de Andrade Coelho, p. 37. the most of the black people of St. Vincent in the early eighteenth century wore loincloths, used the bow and arrow, sailed by canoe, used the tables for the infants cranial deformation, touched the snail and painted their bodies with red dye annatto or achiote (Bixa orellana).John Murungi, \\"Philosophy as Home in Coming\\". Democracy, Culture and Development, M√©xico: Praxis-UNAM, p. 239. On the other hand, perhaps because of its numerical dominance, the black community pushed the Yellow Caribs towards the leeward side of the island, staying them with the most flat and fertile part (but also more liable to be attacked from the sea) of windward. It also seems true that in 1700 the Yellows asked the intervention of the French against the Black Caribs, however, when visualized they should share their scarce land, preferred to give up the alliance.Ensayos de Libros: Garifuna - Caribe (Trials of Books). Beginning in 1719, French settlers from Martinique gained control of the island and began cultivating coffee, tobacco, indigo, cotton, and sugar on plantations. These plantations were worked by enslaved Africans. In this same year, blacks and Amerindians repelled a force of 500 French soldiers who, upon landing, burned the villages of the coast and destroyed the plantations. In 1725, the English tried to settle his time in Saint Vicent. By then, according to Bryan Edwards, blacks were leading the Caribs and his boss spoke \\"excellent French,\\" in which he recalled to captain Braithwaith that he had rejected to Dutch and English before him, and to the French, their peace cost them many gifts. After which, backed by five hundred men armed with rifles, said he was doing a favor to let him go.Bryan Edwards, vol. I, pages. 415‚Äì421. Thus, the British returned to their ships then. Since then, during a long time, the Amerindian chiefs and black from Yurumein sold indigo, cotton and snuff produced by women and slaves,\\"Realizing that there were not enough women to work their gardens, bought slaves.\\" Ruy Galvao de Andrade Coelho, p. 42. and in exchange for which they received arms, ammunition, tools, and wine from the French islands.Rafael Leiva Vivas. Tr√°fico de Esclavos Negros a Honduras. Tegucigalpa: Guaymuras, 1987, p. 139. This was very normal, according to William V. Davidson, after 1750, when the Black Caribs of St. Vincent were quite prosperous and numerous. The black leaders were warriors living with several wives and traveled by canoe to the islands of Martinique, St. Lucia and Grenada to change snuff and cotton they produced, complementing the female agricultural labor with African slave labor, weapons and ammunition.William V. Davidson. Black Carib (Garifuna) Habitats in Central America. Frontier Adaptations in Lower Central America. Philadelphia: Institute for the Study of Human Issues. 1976, pp. 85‚Äì94. In 1763 by the Treaty of Paris, France ceded control of Saint Vincent to Britain, who began a program of colonial plantation development that was resisted by the Caribs. Between 1783 and 1796, there was again conflict between the British and the Black Caribs, who were led by defiant Paramount Chief Joseph Chatoyer. In 1797 British General Sir Ralph Abercromby put an end to the open conflict by crushing an uprising which had been supported by the French radical, Victor Hugues. More than 5,000 Black Caribs were eventually deported to Roat√°n, an island off the coast of Honduras. \\"Negro Festival\\" on St Vincent, 1801 Slavery was abolished in Saint Vincent (as well as in the other British colonies) in 1834, and an apprenticeship period followed which ended in 1838. After its end, labour shortages on the plantations resulted, and this was initially addressed by the immigration of indentured servants (Indian and Portuguese people from Madeira) .  Demography  As of 2013, people of African descent are the majority ethnic group in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, accounting for 66% of the country's population. An additional 19% of the country is multiracial, with many mixed-race Saint Vincentians having partial African descent.  Black Caribs  The Black Caribs are a distinct ethnic group in Saint Vincent, also found in the Caribbean coast of mainland Central America. They are mixture of Caribs, Arawaks and West African people. However, their language is primarily derived from Arawak and Carib, with English and French to a lesser degree. Several theories have been made to explain the arrival of Africans on the island of Saint Vincent and the mixture of many Africans with the Caribs. The best known explanation is that of English governor William Young in 1795. According to oral history noted by the English governor, the arrival of the African population on the island began with the shipwreck of a slave ship that hailed from the Bight of Biafra in 1675. The survivors, members of the Mokko people of today's Nigeria (now known as the Ibibio people) reached the small island of Bequia, where the Caribs brought them to Saint Vincent, did became them in slaves and, over time, intermarried with them by supplying the African men with wives, since it was taboo in their society for men to go unwed. However, according to Young, because the slaves were \\"too free of spirit\\", the Caribs planned to kill all the African male children. When Africans learned of the Caribs' plan, they rebelled and killed as many Caribs as they could, then fled to the mountains, where they settled and lived with other slaves who had taken refuge there. However, some researchers, such as the Garifuna specialist linguist Itarala, are more inclined to think, based on documented evidence, that over time slaves were actually from other islands (mostly from Barbados, St. Lucia and Grenada), and probably many Africans from the mountains also down from the mountains to have sexual intercourse with women Amerindians or to steal food. Many intermarried with indigenous Africans, thus causing the Black Caribs. In 1763, the Treaty of Paris awarded Britain rule over Saint Vincent. After a series of Carib Wars, which were encouraged and supported by the French, and the death of their leader Satuye (Chatoyer), they surrendered to the British in 1796. The British considered the Garinagu enemies and deported them to Roat√°n, an island off the coast of Honduras. In the process, the British separated the more African-looking Caribs from the more Amerindian-looking ones. They decided that the former were enemies who had to be exiled, while the latter were merely \\"misled\\" and were allowed to remain. Five thousand Garinagu were exiled, but only about 2,500 of them survived the voyage to Roat√°n. Because the island was too small and infertile to support their population, the Garifuna petitioned the Spanish authorities to be allowed to settle on the mainland. The Spanish employed them, and they spread along the Caribbean coast of Central America.

The two-vessel class was intended to operate in shallow waters. After the Peace of Amiens Firm was paid off in March 1802; she was sold in 1803. Service Sir John Henslow designed the class on the model of flat-bottomed Thames barges. Commander Temple Hardy commissioned Firm in June 1794. Commander Robert Plampin replaced him in September, for Ostend and Flushing. In August 1795 she came under the command of Commander John Edwards for the Leith station. She was paid off in February 1796 at Sheerness. Commander Horace Pine recommissioned her in September and she was stationed at Chatham to protect the River Medway. On 2 and 3 June 1797, during the Spithead and Nore mutinies, Firm was at Shellness. The ringleader of the mutiny, Richard Parker, put a man, Thomas Appleyard, aboard her to take command of her. However the crew did not join the mutiny and instead Firm sailed to Sheerness and anchored by the Half Moon Battery and then by the Grain Spit to act against the mutiny if necessary. Appleyard later received a court martial and was hanged aboard Firm,Cunningham (1829), pp.57-8. then at Gillingham Reach.Herbert (1876), p.322. Commander Patrick Campbell replaced Pine in June 1798.Pine drowned shortly thereafter. He had just taken command of the sloop . On 21 August 1799 Bulkeley Mackworth Praed, newly released from enemy custody, was promoted to Commander on Firm, which served in the Channel. She was at Sheerness from March 1800 on, with Praed remaining with her. In March 1802 she was paid off. Praed received promotion to post captain on 29 April 1802.The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Review, (December 1852), Vol. 192, p.634. Fate Firm was sold to Mr. F.

Bodies were diecast metal with plastic parts. Sometimes parts came in special illustrated packages to be assembled like the ornate roof racks on this Benz. The box portrays the model provided. R. W. Modell boxes were the same design, but red. Ziss-Modell, originally also called R. W. Modell or Wittek Modell were 'brand' names of the German Mini-Auto firm which made diecast metal classic and contemporary vehicles from the 1960s through the late 1970s. Later, use of the Mini-Auto name largely disappeared and the models were mainly known as Ziss or R. W. Modell. The company was based in Lintorf. Complex name history The company began sometime in the 1960s as the Mini-Auto Company with models called R.W. Modell - possibly for the founder E. (probably Erich) Wittek or another relative of the same family - brand nomenclature in early pamphlets is unclear. The Mini-Auto name appeared occasionally on packaging and the bases of models, but it usually appeared only in brochures (Johnson 1998, p. 254; Wittek No date). Later, about the mid-1970s, use of the name Mini-Auto disappeared in favor of only R. W. Modell or Ziss. This may have been due to confusion with other names of miniature manufacturers like Italy's Dugu Miniautotoys, the Miniauto line produced by Kaden in Czechoslovakia, or Dave Sinclair's Mini-Auto import and sales shop in Erie, Pennsylvania. Finally, R. W. Modell seems to have been changed to Ziss which may have also been a family name (some web sites say E. Wittek's son continued the operation, thus the gradual name change from R. W. to Ziss; see Robinson 2010). For a time, however, the two names were used simultaneously under the Mini-Auto or Wittek Modell appellation and some company brochures show both 'brands' on their covers. There appears to have been no specific model differentiation between the two lines. The influential U.S. importer David Sinclair, who scoured Europe for new models and got to know many of the individuals behind the companies, called the company a \\"comparatively small family operation\\" (Sinclair 1979, p. 392). The company, whichever name is used, was located in Lintorf, West Germany, a town near Ratingen, north of D√ºsseldorf and not far from the Rhine River (Wittek No date; Rixon 2005, p. 72). R. W. and Ziss boxes commonly say \\"Made in Western-Germany\\" on the flaps. The company made both contemporary and veteran vehicles. That a German manufacturer would carry models from two distinct decades seems a rare treat - French companies like Minialuxe, RAMI by J.M.K. or Italian Rio Models and Brumm were ahead of any German firm in making veteran vehicles from before 1930. Except for Cursor Models which were made for the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart, and some Gama veteran cars, Ziss seems to be the only German manufacturer dedicated to making an array of models from the veteran era (Gibson 1971, p. 21). Veteran Line Ziss-Modell / Euro-Modell no. 60 1913 Audi Alpensieger (Alps winner) with boat-tail design. This is a \\"Euro-Modell\\", with the Ziss name blotted out from the metal base. The same model number is used as that applied in the original Ziss line-up. The earliest models were a classic line of mostly German vehicles in the spirit of French RAMI by J.M.K. or Italian Rio Models (Gibson 1971, pp. 20-21). Both autos and trucks were produced, usually in three or four different colors for each model. Under the earlier R.W. name, models included the cute little 1920s Hanomag \\"Kommisbrot\\" (\\"bread loaf\\" - in top up and top down versions, like Rio and Brumm models), a 1905 Mercedes Kettenwagen, coupe and Grand Prix, a BMW Dixi, and a FIAT 508S Balilla coupe. Under the Ziss Modell name, new marques such as Adler, Mercedes-Simplex, Audi Alpensieger, Opel, and N.A.G. appeared. New trucks appeared as well like Henschel, M.A.N. and B.V. tankers. These trucks were heavy with an unusually high metal content (Rixon 2005, p. 73). Some of the models, like selected Henschel trucks, appeared as special promotionals in distinct white boxes. Even a couple of Ford Model Ts, including a utility \\"Ranch-wagen\\", were made, similar to choices that the French RAMI by J.M.K. had done. It is interesting that none of the R. W. models appear to have leaked over into the Ziss line- up, showing somewhat of a break in development of models between R. W. and Ziss Modell - but about 1970 or so, both were offered simultaneously, and there appears no specific rationale for the two lines, other than a gradual name change. For Ziss at least two significantly different versions from each marque appeared, such as an Opel Stadtcoupe and an Opel Torpedo or the Adler phaeton and the Adler limousine. Contemporary offerings Though Ziss-Modell is more known for its classic line, like the French Minialuxe it also offered a few contemporary cars and trucks. From the outset, R. W. Modell made a Ford Transit van, contemporary German Hanomag stake and delivery trucks in both shorter wheelbase and longer articulated forms, a Volkswagen transporter flatbed, a tractor and a Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman limousine. A simply cast Jeep was also available. Later Ziss offerings included an Opel Rekord II four door sedan from about 1972 with opening front doors, and a two-door Opel Commodore (Bickford 2009). An Opel Manta is mentioned by some, but the existence of this model has not been confirmed. The rather arbitrary nature of the contemporary offerings makes one wonder if they were offered mainly because of promotional contracts with Opel or Mercedes-Benz. Why not other Porsches, Audis, Volkswagens, BMWs or Mercedes-Benzes? Because Schabak had Audi and Cursor had Volkswagen and other companies covered Mercedes-Benz? Ziss models also appear to have been for special purposes. Promotional models Besides the normal liveries appearing on the sides of some trucks, Ziss did some models which were promotionals for specific companies. Ziss made a rather simple diecast Jeep and one version was a marketing promotional for Wick√ºler beer - complete with '3 Musketeers'-like figures holding up beer steins. The Ford Transit van was offered with Funny Frisch chips logo on the sides. Various liveries appeared on the M.A.N. and Henschel trucks including British Petroleum, Aral Oil, Wick√ºler beer, and Schenker transport. One M.A.N. omnibus was for the Wiblingen-Ulm-Wiblingen circuit to the famed cathedral. Ziss also made a few construction vehicles which were apparently used for company promotion. One example was a Clark C-500 540D forklift made in a gray-green in 1/24 scale and also a pair of O&K; excavator-loaders in both wheeled and tracked versions. Also offered was a yellow P&H; excavator loader, which appeared very similar to the O&K; machines. A couple of tractors - an orange and gray Fiat 550, and a Deutz Series 06 were also offered in bright card boxes with photos of the tractors on the sides. Packaging It seems earlier boxes were blue and labeled with the Mini-Auto name along with Wittek Modell, but this design is rare. Some R.W. Modell vehicles had red boxes with plastic windows with no illustration of the vehicle. These boxes were in German script with brief vehicle specifications. Other R.W. boxes had red and white vertical stripes on two sides with solid red on the alternate sides - with an illustration of the vehicle. Ziss Modell boxes were blue, yet decorated in the same manner as the earlier R.W. boxes. Vehicles sometimes came with railings or other parts in packages with illustrations on how to affix the parts to the model. This is the case with the 1911 Benz Landaulet which came with separate, ornately curved, diecast zamac roof racks. Some of the R.W. Hanomag truck boxes were multicolored, but the striped boxes described above were most common. Some of the last vehicles in the late 1970s or possibly the early 1980s were sold in plastic display boxes. Execution and detail Ziss-Modell / Audi Alpensieger wheel detail. These plastic 'wire' wheels looked better than the earlier cheaper looking plastic spoke wheel design. The model selection of mainly German marques in the R.W. and Ziss line-up earns kudos, especially some in the R.W. Modell line like the Hanomag \\"Kommissbrot\\". This model was ultra detailed with fine features like lights, horn, opening rear engine lid, tilting seats and a spare tire behind the seats. Still, the execution and detail of some models lacked confidence. Ziss models often have a cheap looking plastic 'wooden spoke' wheel style that doesn't even look as good as Matchbox Models of Yesteryear's metal wheels. Later models offered a more realistic plastic wire wheel design. Color choice was sometimes criticized as was the rendition of Ziss lamps, grilles and other finer pieces of the models, which Gibson called \\"uncomfortable\\" (Gibson 1971, pp. 28-29). Another uncomfortable feature was the raised ribs for door joints on some models like the Audi Alpensieger - a ridge to give the impression of the door line is unfortunate though the same practice is also seen on Spot-On models. Still, no other diecast company before or since has offered such classic German selections. They are done well, some of them very well and are reasonably priced on the normal auction sites. Demise of Ziss Most sources say the company stopped producing about 1978 (Sinclair 1979, p. 392). Some models may have been produced into the early 1980s. Previous Ziss models appeared in the early 1980s modeled as Euro-Modell. These often blotted the molded Ziss name from the metal base of the model, but some Euro-Modell's bases still said Ziss. Whether it was Ziss with another new name or a completely different company is uncertain, but some reported that models such as the Audi Alpenseiger were sold as promotional models in contemporary Audi dealers. It is uncertain if this 'Euro-Modell' (hyphenated) was related to the more contemporary 'Euro Modell' HO (1:87 scale) plastic model producer. References * Bickford, Keith. 2009. Ziss-Modell.

Between May 1960 and May 1963, S√°nchez was the 26th Mayor of the commune of Pichilemu. He is also one of the founding members of the Pichilemu Fire Bureau (Cuerpo de Bomberos de Pichilemu) and was, for decades, the director of the hospital of Pichilemu. Biography Little is known of S√°nchez Beguirist√°in before his arrival in Pichilemu in 1933, at age 30. According to Historia Hospital de Pichilemu from the Chilean Ministry of Health Library, S√°nchez arrived \\"on holidays [...] and like others was delighted for [Pichilemu's] beauty and quietness\\", and decided to stay in Pichilemu to work as a doctor; he was contracted by mayor Felipe Iturriaga Esquivel. Between 1933 and 1940, he directed the Dispensario San Rafael, first health organization of Pichilemu, created years before by fellow physician Eugenio D√≠az Lira. On 1 November 1940, the Ministry of Health created the Pichilemu Relief House (Casa de Socorros de Pichilemu), and designated Basilio S√°nchez as its First Chief. The relief house was elevated to the category of hospital in the 1960s, and became the Hospital of Pichilemu, with S√°nchez continuing as its director. Former mayor Felipe Iturriaga and S√°nchez after his naming as Illustrious Son of Pichilemu In 1960, S√°nchez was elected mayor of Pichilemu, and took office on 19 May.‚ÄúLa Naci√≥n‚Äù, Santiago, 5 April 1960 The direction of the hospital of Pichilemu, through his mayorship, was relegated to a doctor of Italian origin surnamed Matasi. His council was composed of the regidores H√©ctor Greene Valverde, Carlos Echazarreta I√±iguez, Alberto Araneda Concha, and Sergio Morales Retamal. He held the mayor position until 19 May 1963. Once he completed his mayoral term, he returned to the direction of the local hospital, and did so until 1976. Just before he resigned, he brought to the hospital two physicians from the University of Concepci√≥n, who were welcomed in a ceremony by then mayor Eduardo Parraguez Galarce. In that ceremony, S√°nchez was named Illustrious Son of Pichilemu (Hijo Ilustre de Pichilemu), for \\"working in the health area in Pichilemu for almost fifty years.\\" Following his resignation to the direction of the Hospital of Pichilemu, S√°nchez retired. S√°nchez was a founding member of the Pichilemu Fire Bureau (Cuerpo de Bomberos de Pichilemu), founding which took place on 4 December 1945. He was named a member of the honorary direction of the fire bureau. S√°nchez was also Super Intendant of the Pichilemu Fire Bureau between 1950 and 1951, and between 1961 and 1969. He also appears as a founding member of the Aerial Club of Pichilemu (Club A√©reo de Pichilemu); the club foundation occurred on 2 November 1964.

The film stars Michelle Giroux as a pharmacist who is unhappy with her life and marriage, who starts to receive letters from an anonymous admirer, asking her to undertake increasingly risky activities. Production The idea for the film originated in a writer's group in the Neighbourhood Bookstore and Cafe in Wolseley, Winnipeg, and is based on a story by the film's cowriter Bill Fugler. Garrity then added narrative elements to bring the idea to the big screen. The director had planned to shoot the film in Winnipeg when a sudden career opportunity for his wife led to them relocating to Toronto. Garrity found the expense of shooting in a big city to be financially and physically draining, compared to his experiences in his native Winnipeg. In an effort to find a big enough house for the film's middle-class main characters, who would not be able to afford such a large residence in Toronto, Garrity ended up filming in suburban Richmond Hill, Ontario. Giroux, better known as a stage actress and friend of cast member Jonas Chernick, was originally brought in simply to read with the male actors during pre- production. But she so impressed Garrity that she was chosen for lead role over other actresses with more film experience. Release Blood Pressure premiered in Winnipeg on February 22, 2013 with sold out screenings at the city's Cinematheque, followed by a run at the Empire Theatres 8 in Grant Park, Winnipeg starting Mar. 8. The film opened in Toronto at The Royal Theatre on March 15, and was moved to the Carlton Theatre on March 22, where it was held over. The film reportedly averaged $3000 per screen in Toronto and Winnipeg, according to distributor Flying Horsie Films.

Built in 1841-43, this log structure is one of the oldest surviving buildings of Russian America, and was one of the centerpieces of the Russian Orthodox church's efforts to spread its influence among the natives of Alaska. It was the home and administrative center of Ivan Veniaminov, the first Bishop of Alaska, later canonized as Innocent of Alaska. The house is now a unit of Sitka National Historical Park, and is administered by the National Park Service. Description The Russian Bishop's House is a two-story log structure, measuring about . It is divided into nine bays, each measuring about (one sazhen) square, and covered by a hip roof. The east and west ends of the building are further extended by shed-roof \\"galleries\\" that are wide, which historically provided space for stairwells, storage, latrines, and entrances. The exterior has undergone a number of alterations since construction. The south facade was sheathed in clapboarding c. 1851, and the galleries were roofed in metal around that time. In 1887 the galleries were sheathed in board-and-batten siding. The interior was repeatedly altered over the decades, and underwent a major restoration once the property was acquired by the National Park Service 1973. Secondary buildings The property on which the Bishop's House stands includes two secondary buildings associated with the activities of the Russian Orthodox Church. East of the main house stands the Old School, a two-story wood frame structure built in 1897 to provide a kindergarten and girls' school. House 105 is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure which stands facing Monastery Street. It was originally on a separate parcel of land, and was apparently moved to its present location in the 1950s. History The Russian Bishop's House was built between 1841 and 1843 by Finnish laborers brought in by the Russian American Company, to provide housing for Reverend Ivan Veniaminov, who had been appointed the first Bishop of Alaska by the Russian Orthodox Church. From his seat in Sitka, Veniaminov oversaw the spread of Orthodox missionary and educational work to the indigenous peoples of southern Alaska, nearly doubling the number of Orthodox worshippers in the region between 1841 and 1860. Missionary efforts were continued after the United States purchased Alaska in 1867, and were only significantly cut back after funding cuts in the wake of the Russian Revolution in 1917. The seat of the Russian diocese was relocated the San Francisco in 1872, and the Bishop's House was repurposed to provide housing quarters for priests. Its first floor also served as an inn for a time. In 1903 a bishop was once again assigned to a district with its seat at Sitka. For most of the 20th century, the upper floors house a chapel and the quarters of the bishop, while the ground floor was used in a variety of ways. In the 1920s it housed a printing operation that produced, in addition to church publications, the Sitka Sun and the Sitka Tribune. The Old School was used as a church school building until 1922, and as a public school thereafter. House 105, while not of architectural note, was used as a church rental property for many years, and is one of the oldest buildings in Sitka. The property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the \\"Russian Mission Orphanage\\" in 1966, reflecting its major function at that time. The National Register designation was altered to \\"Russian Bishop's House\\" in 1980. The Russian Bishop's House is now owned and managed by the National Park Service as a unit of Sitka National Historical Park. It is open to the public on ranger-guided tours.

The Oregon health insurance experiment (sometimes abbreviated OHIE) was a research study looking at the effects of the 2008 Medicaid expansion in the U.S. state of Oregon, which occurred based on lottery drawings from a waiting list and thus offered an opportunity to conduct a randomized experiment by comparing a control group of lottery losers to a treatment group of winners, who were eligible to apply for enrollment in the Medicaid expansion program after previously being uninsured. The study's results have been published in the academic journals The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Science, The New England Journal of Medicine, and The American Economic Review. In the first year after the lottery, Medicaid coverage was associated with higher rates of health care use, a lower probability of having medical debts sent to a collection agency, and higher self-reported mental and physical health. In the 18 months following the lottery, researchers found that Medicaid increased emergency department visits. Approximately two years after the lottery, researchers found that Medicaid had no statistically significant impact on physical health measures, but \\"it did increase use of health care services, raise rates of diabetes detection and management, lower rates of depression, and reduce financial strain.\\" Commentators in publications such as Forbes and RealClearPolitics cited the study as evidence that the Medicaid program fails its central cause of assisting the American poor, but other commentators in publications such as The New Republic and the Daily Kos stated that the evidence of improved financial security and mental health provided a significant social benefit. Background In 2008, Oregon began an expansion of its Medicaid program for low-income adults. Because officials could not afford coverage for all those who wanted to enroll, they decided on the novel approach of allocating the limited number of available slots by lottery. Thus, a situation allowing for a randomized experiment occurred, with a control group of individuals not selected by the lottery and a treatment group of individuals selected by the lottery and thus eligible to apply for Medicaid. A total of 29,835 Oregonians were given the opportunity to apply for the state's Medicaid program out of almost 90,000 people on the waitlist. About 30% of those who were selected from the waitlist both chose to apply for Medicaid and met the eligibility criteria. Researchers collected data from both existing administrative data sources and new primary sources. Administrative data included hospital discharge, emergency department, credit report, and mortality records and records on receipt of state and federal benefits. The researchers also conducted a mail survey approximately one year after the lottery and conducted in-person interviews and physical-health exams. For logistical reasons, data on emergency-department visits was limited to twelve Portland-area hospitals and in-person data collection was limited to study participants in the Portland metropolitan area. The control and study groups were statistically similar in many dimensions such as age and ethnicity. Because of the randomized controlled design, the study was able to isolate the effects of insurance from confounding factors such as the initial health status of participants. Principal investigators Katherine Baicker and Amy Finkelstein are well known as economists at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, respectively. The rest of the authors are regarded as some of the top researchers in this field. Findings The researchers compared lottery winners who had the chance to enroll in Medicaid to individuals not selected in the lottery, using a standard two-stage least- squares instrumental-variable regression from their data to assess the effect of Medicaid coverage on many outcomes, including health care use, financial strain, and mental and physical health. In the first year of coverage, researchers found that Medicaid coverage increased health care use, including hospital admissions, prescription drug use, and outpatient visits. Medicaid coverage was associated with a 2.1 percentage point (30%) increase in the likelihood of having a hospital admission, an 8.8 percentage point (15%) increase in the likelihood of taking any prescription drugs, and a 21 percentage point (35%) increase in the likelihood of having an outpatient visit. Medicaid coverage also increased the likelihood of receiving recommended preventive care, including an 18.7 percentage point (60%) increase in having a mammogram within the past year for women over 40. Medicaid coverage reduced, by 6.4 percentage points, (25%) the probability of having an unpaid medical bill sent to a collection agency and, by 20 percentage points, (35%) the probability of having any out-of-pocket medical expenditures. Over an 18-month period following the lottery, Medicaid coverage increased emergency department use by 0.41 visits per person, a 40% increase. Researchers found increases across a range of different types of visits, including visits classified as preventable or primary care treatable, and across different subgroups. From in-person interviews and physical health exams after about two years of coverage, researchers examined patient health issues including depression, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, high glycated hemoglobin levels, and long-term cardiovascular risks (the latter using the Framingham risk score). The study found no statistically significant impact of Medicaid coverage on any of the four physical measures. However, there were statistically insignificant improvements associated with Medicaid coverage in every single category, with a 1.33 percentage point (8%) decrease in high blood pressure incidence, a 2.43 percentage point (17%) decrease in high cholesterol incidence, a .93 percentage point (18%) decrease in high glycated hemoglobin incidence, and a 0.21 percentage point (2.5%) decrease in Framingham risk score. Based on the findings, the researchers could reject, with 95% confidence, the decrease in blood pressure that would be expected based on previous studies of the effect of Medicaid coverage. The study found that Medicaid increased the rates of being diagnosed with diabetes and of using medication for diabetes. The researchers could not reject the decrease in blood sugar that would be expected to result from the increased use of diabetes medication, based on the clinical literature. The study reported that Medicaid coverage was associated with significantly lower rates of screening positive for depression (a 9 percentage point decline) despite the fact that there \\"was no significant increase in the use of medication for depression.\\" On average, Medicaid coverage increased annual medical spending by approximately $1,172 relative to spending in the control group. The researchers looked at mortality rates, but they could not reach any conclusions because of the extremely low death rate of the general population of able-bodied Oregon adults aged 19 to 64.  Limitations  The study had significant limitations. The population examined was from only one state, and data collection involving in-person interviews and physical exams was limited to the Portland metropolitan area. The study looked at results over a two-year period and the limited sample size generated limitations in statistical power. The study outcomes were considered in the context of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and how the ACA may impact states' Medicaid expansion. Although the authors addressed and described the Oregon expansion population (100% of poverty, self-selection to apply for the program lottery, etc.), they did not examine the possible differences in the expansion for the population between 100% and 138% of poverty. Also, it will be important to consider how Oregon's healthcare delivery system is pertinent in the context of the ACA. Response and commentary Avik Roy wrote for Forbes that the reported \\"result calls into question the $450 billion a year we spend on Medicaid, and the fact that Obamacare throws 11 million more Americans into this broken program.\\" He remarked as well that \\"if relieving financial strain is all we are trying to do, we‚Äôd be better off giving poor people the cash and letting them spend it how they choose.\\" Michael F. Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, wrote for RealClearPolitics that the \\"study shows there is absolutely no warrant to expand Medicaid at all.\\" Megan McArdle stated in The Daily Beast that \\"it's hard for me to look at this study and see the kinds of numbers that save tens of thousands of lives every year\\" even though proponents of expanded Medicaid as a part of health care reform had claimed so. In addition, she labeled the study \\"bombshell new.\\" The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal argued that \\"Federal Medicaid rules require states to offer all-you-can-eat benefits to everyone rather than targeting public assistance to those most in need.\\" National Review Online ran a commentary by Jeremy Rozansky, who argued that \\"Medicaid is clearly a poor use of hundreds of billions of dollars.\\" Kevin Drum wrote for Mother Jones that even though the positive patient health results of being on Medicaid did not pass statistical significance at the 95% level, the results mattered at other levels that he saw as more appropriate. The New Republic ran an article by Jonathan Cohn arguing, \\"The Oregon study can't disprove that Medicaid produced physical health benefits, because it can't pinpoint the results with enough precision.\\" He also stated that the result of \\"large improvements in mental health were just as surprising to the researchers as the lack of large improvements in physical health.... Not only might better mental health save some money, given the costs to society of lost productivity and activity. It should also save lives.\\" Joan McCarter of the Daily Kos asserted that expanding \\"Medicaid to more people absolutely doesn't hurt public health\\" since extending \\"the security of having access to affordable health care has absolutely improved the mental health and the financial security of the people who received it\\" since she views that \\"the point of health insurance.\\" John McDonough of the Harvard School of Public Health, writing for The Boston Globe remarked, \\"These results have changed no one's mind about Medicaid... because, in the end, this is not a debate about numbers or data or studies.\\" According to McDonough, \\"This is a debate about values.\\" Ben Domenech, managing editor of Health Care News and fellow of the Heartland Institute, commentated that the moderate changes in depression found in the study from Medicaid could have been exceeded by having all of the patients adopt a pet, which significantly lowers depression and reduces the risk of heart disease, and also would have been far cheaper. He concluded, \\"So... you actually care about people being healthier and not just feeling less depressed, is to end Medicaid and simply give people the monetary value of the program to purchase a private health plan.\\" In The Atlantic, Brian Fung wrote, \\"Obviously, simply 'feeling' healthier does not an argument for expanding Medicaid make. But the drop in depression diagnoses is a promising outcome given the condition's links to all manner of unpleasant health consequences. Taking greater steps to identify health problems before they happen has also been touted as a key requirement in keeping healthcare costs low over the long term. And improvements in financial security‚Äîincluding a 40 percent drop in the likelihood of having to take out a loan or leave other bills unpaid due to spending on healthcare‚Äîare a promising sign if the aim is to make healthcare more affordable.\\" Josh Barro wrote in Bloomberg View, \\"The financial effect is a big deal. Having Medicaid reduces your likelihood of facing medical expenses that exceed 30 percent of your income by 80 percent. This reflects that Medicaid is, in large part, a redistributive income-support program, which is desirable given persistently high unemployment and widening wage gaps.\\" In an interview with Talking Points Memo, Jonathan Gruber, a co-author of the study and a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, \\"I would view this study as somewhat weakening the argument for universal coverage based on health improvement and greatly strengthening the argument based on financial security and mental well being.\\" Ezra Klein wrote for Bloomberg that the \\"bottom line is that Medicaid worked\\" and called into question some of the technical particulars of the study. He quoted scholar Aaron Carroll of Indiana University‚Äôs School of Medicine that \\"if you look at the table in their study and look at baseline blood pressure it was like 119 over 76\\" and that \\"was normal. You wouldn‚Äôt expect it to go down by nine. It would be a bad thing for normal blood pressure to drop that much. All we should care about is blood pressure in the small subset that had high blood pressure. But they don‚Äôt present that.\\" Writing for The Incidental Economist, Aaron Carroll and Austin Frakt, a health economist and researcher, argued that the study \\"shows that some things improved for people who got Medicaid. For others, changes weren't statistically significant, which isn't the same thing as certainty of no effect. For still others, the jury is still out. But it didn't show that Medicaid harms people, or that the ACA is a failure, or that anything supporters of Medicaid have said is a lie. Moreover, it certainly didn't show that private insurance or Medicare succeeds in ways that Medicaid fails.\\" In The New York Times, Ross Douthat wrote that \\"health insurance is useful mostly because it averts financial catastrophe\\" and suggested that if financial security and economic mobility are goals, access to catastrophic health plans or to various tax credits should be expanded rather than access to Medicaid. Richard Kronick of the United States Department of Health and Human Services and Andrew B. Bindman of the University of California, San Francisco wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine, \\"Insurance has three main purposes: to protect financial assets in the event of illness, to improve access to care, and to protect health... these results confirm the capacity of Medicaid to quickly and positively accomplish at least two of the three goals of insurance.\\" Roy Grant wrote in the American Journal of Public Health that conservative health policy wonks like Roy \\"minimized or ignored\\" the major positive results of the OHIE, including \\"increased primary health care use, increased receipt of preventive health services including Papanicolaou tests and mammograms for women, increased diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, and increased diagnosis of depression.\\" Grant also emphasized the finding that Medicaid was significantly associated with reduced medical debt and out-of- pocket spending.

Soylent was introduced in 2014 after a crowdfunding campaign.  History  Origin A Soylent package, along with the powder and resulting drink In January 2013, software engineer Rob Rhinehart purchased 35 chemical ingredients‚Äîincluding potassium gluconate, calcium carbonate, monosodium phosphate, maltodextrin, olive oil‚Äîall of which he deemed to be necessary for survival, based on his readings of biochemistry textbooks and U.S. government websites. Rhinehart used to view food as a time-consuming hassle and had resolved to treat it as an engineering problem. He blended the ingredients with water and consumed only this drink for the next thirty days. Over the course of the next two months, he adjusted the proportions of the ingredients to counter various health issues and further refined the formula. Rhinehart claimed a host of health benefits from the drink and noted that it had greatly reduced his monthly food bill, which fell from about US$470 to $155, and the time spent behind the preparation and consumption of food while providing him greater control over his nutrition.  Naming  Soylent is named after a food in Harry Harrison's 1966 science fiction novel Make Room! Make Room! In the novel, most types of soylent are made from soy and lentils, hence the name of the product, a combination of \\"soy\\" and \\"lent\\". The word also evokes the 1973 film adaptation Soylent Green, in which the eponymous food is made from human remains. Rhinehart also says he chose the name, with its morbid associations, to pique curiosity and deeper investigation, since the name was clearly not chosen with a traditionally \\"flashy\\" marketing scheme in mind. DIY community In 2013, a community of people interested in making their own Soylent emerged online, attracted by the ability to customize nutrition precisely to each person's unique needs. Another software engineer, Nick Poulden, founded the web site diy.soylent.me (now www.completefoods.co), where users shared the results of their own tinkering with the Soylent recipe. Users could enter a nutritional profile and select a recipe, after which the web site would calculate exact proportions of each ingredient to yield the desired intake of each nutrient. Zach Alexander, a former professional cook, made a Soylent formula mostly from ingredients available at grocery stores rather than laboratory supply houses, which he calls Hackerschool Soylent. A commercial venture Rhinehart's blog posts about his experiment attracted attention on Hacker News, eventually leading to a crowdfunding campaign on Tilt that raised about $1.5 million in preorders aimed at moving the powdered drink from concept into production. It became one of the most funded crowdfunding projects ever accomplished. After the campaign, Soylent had venture capital financing for a seed round of $1.5 millionCrowdfunding Darling Soylent Nets $1.5 Million In VC Funding. October 22, 2013 to further develop proof of concept. Media reports detailed how operations began for Soylent Nutrition, Inc. in April 2014, using a relatively small $500 system to ship the first $2.6 million worth of product. In January 2015, Soylent received $20 million in Series A round funding, led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Prior to June 2015, Soylent was only available for purchase and shipment to people in the United States. On June 15, 2015, the shipping of Soylent to Canada was introduced at the same price in U.S. dollars as for U.S. customers. Expansion to European countries is a stated future goal. In October 2017, Canada disallowed further shipments of Soylent due to a failure to meet Canadian food regulations on meal replacements. In July 2017, Soylent was sold offline for the first time at 7-Eleven stores around Los Angeles. By April 2018, Soylent was sold in over 8,000 7-Elevens around the United States and is currently also sold at Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Meijer. Health effects The makers of Soylent claim it contains the nutrients necessary for a healthy lifestyle. There may be social drawbacks of living on a Soylent-only diet, since some critics have said that it comes at the expense of the pleasures from eating and sharing food. Some people have experienced gastrointestinal problems from consumption of Soylent, particularly flatulence. Speculation on the cause of such symptoms is sometimes centered around the amount of dietary fiber contained in the product, which is known to cause such symptoms when diets are abruptly altered to increase amounts of fiber consumption. Later versions of the product lowered the amount of fiber content, but this did not stop the reports of gastrointestinal problems. The lower fiber content of the product led to additional criticisms of not containing an adequate amount, compared to daily recommendations, leading some to utilize fiber supplementation. As of October 24, 2017, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) blocked sales of Soylent from Canada because the label on Soylent does not meet the CFIA requirements to be listed as a meal replacement. Shipping Soylent to Canada has been blocked by the CFIA until Soylent Nutrition, Inc. makes changes to its products; Canadian shipments first began in June 2015. Shipments to Canada resumed in Q2, 2020. Lead and cadmium content On August 13, 2015, nonprofit environmental and corporate social responsibility watchdog As You Sow filed a notice of intent to pursue a lawsuit against the makers of Soylent, claiming that Soylent did not adequately label its product given the levels of lead and cadmium present in the drink. The basis for the lawsuit lies in California's Proposition 65, a law that requires additional labeling for food products containing trace amounts of certain substances. Although Soylent contains levels of lead and cadmium far below the national safety levels set by the FDA, it does contain 12 to 25 times the level of lead and 4 times the level of cadmium allowable in a product without additional labeling as specified by Proposition 65. A lawyer who has worked on settlements of Proposition 65 suits described the case as \\"alarmist\\", as the levels are well below FDA limits of what is allowed in food products. However, as Soylent is marketed as a complete meal replacement, many customers consume the drinks three times a day, equating to 36 to 75 times the lead and 12 times the level of cadmium without the Prop 65 label. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, and even at low levels is linked to nerve damage, lower IQ, and reproductive problems including decreased sperm count. Cadmium is also a toxic heavy metal and has been linked to kidney, liver, and bone damage. Soylent's website displays the Proposition 65 warning required by California. Soylent Nutrition, Inc. published the position that the levels of heavy metal content in Soylent \\"are in no way toxic, and Soylent remains completely safe and nutritious\\". Soylent Nutrition, Inc. also published an infographic and spreadsheet based on an FDA study of heavy metal content in common foods, comparing two selected example meals to servings of Soylent with a similar amount of caloric intake. Both of the company's chosen comparison meals include high levels of cadmium and arsenic, along with levels of lead similar to those of Soylent; although one of them includes tuna and the other includes salmon, providing over 97% of the arsenic in each proposed meal, with spinach providing 74% of the cadmium in the higher-cadmium meal and fruit cocktail providing 71% of the lead in the higher-lead meal. Product recalls On October 12, 2016, the company announced it would halt sales of the Soylent Bar due to reports of gastrointestinal illness, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The company asked customers to discard any unconsumed bars and said it would offer full refunds. On October 21, 2016, the company triggered a product recall, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced it had commenced a food safety investigation. On October 27, 2016, the company also halted sales of Soylent Powder. The company said tests on the bar had come back negative for contamination, but also said that some powder users had reported similar stomach-related symptoms from consuming the powder.Soylent pulls Powder as part of probe into customer sickness Techcrunch, October 28, 2016 The company initially suspected soy or sucralose intolerance. However, on November 7, 2016, Soylent instead blamed algal flour for making people sick, and said it planned to remove algal flour from future formulations of the powders and bars, which it did in the next formulation version 1.7 introduced on December 15, 2016.Soylent blames algal flour for consumer complaints November 7, 2016. The Verge Retrieved November 7, 2016. The drink-based products use algal oil, not algal flour, so were deemed to be safe for users. TerraVia, the supplier of Soylent's algal ingredients, published a fact sheet in response to media coverage for its algal flour.  Flavor and product reviews  Soylent has gone through multiple iterations which have significantly changed flavor, texture, and nutritional ingredients since release. Rhinehart called the flavor of the original versions \\"minimal\\", \\"broad\\" and \\"nonspecific\\". Soylent 1.0 contains soy lecithin and sucralose as masking flavors and to adjust appearance, texture and smell. Before version 1.4, vanillin was included as an ingredient for flavoring. Dylan Matthews of The Washington Post noted in 2013 that Soylent fulfills a similar need as medical foods such as Abbott Laboratories's Jevity, but for a much lower cost. Reviews on the taste of powdered Soylent vary. One reviewer said he was \\"pleasantly surprised\\" with the \\"rich, creamy, and strangely satisfying\\" flavor, and another likened it to that of a vanilla milkshake with the texture of pancake batter. Negative reviewers said it tasted \\"like someone wrung out a dishtowel into a glass\\", said \\"my mouth tastes hot and like old cheese\\", or that it was \\"purposefully bland\\", \\"vile\\" and made the taster \\"gag\\" and compared the taste to \\"homemade nontoxic Play-Doh\\". Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times said he \\"found Soylent to be a punishingly boring, joyless product\\". Chris Ziegler of The Verge, who experimented with subsisting only on Soylent for almost a month, said that although he liked and \\"never really tired of the flavor\\", he still concluded that \\"Soylent isn't living, it's merely surviving\\", and described the apple he ate at the end of that period as \\"my first meal back from the abyss\\" and the best he'd ever had in his life. Adrian Chen of Gawker said he \\"was having trouble getting it down\\", and eventually \\"dumped the whole thing in the sink\\". Both Manjoo and Ziegler said they had experienced some gastrointestinal problems from drinking it. Lee Hutchinson of Ars Technica also reported a brief period of \\"adaptation gas\\" at the beginning of a four-day experiment. Amongst the new flavors, Mocha has been described as similar to a \\"caffeinated Nesquik drink,\\" and Nectar has been described negatively as tasting like \\"lemon aspartame.\\"  See also  * Liquid diet * Meal replacement * Protein shake * Therapeutic food  References   External links  * Category:Products introduced in 2013 Category:Dietary supplements Category:Vegetarian diets ","title":"Soylent (meal replacement)"},{"id":"39382307","text":"Gamochaeta is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family.Weddell, Hugh Algernon. 1855.

Early life & education  Cameron Davis graduated from New Trier High School and Boston University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in International Relations, with an interest in international environmental affairs. He worked during the day and put himself through night school at Chicago-Kent College of Law, earning his J.D. and certification from the law school's Program in Environmental and Energy Law.  Early career  After college, Davis volunteered for the Lake Michigan Federation. As a volunteer, he worked on coastal cleanups and, with the guidance of prominent national environmentalist Lee Botts, organized and participated in public meetings for a stronger Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the U.S. and Canada. The two countries amended the Agreement in 1987 to clean up toxic hotspot \\"Areas of Concern\\". From 1992 to 1998, he served as a litigating attorney with the National Wildlife Federation and Adjunct Clinical Assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor. In 1998, the Lake Michigan Federation's Board of Directors invited Davis to serve the organization in Chicago as Executive Director. Davis led the effort to strengthen the organization's mission to work on the entire ecosystem and, in 2005, changed the organization to the Alliance for the Great Lakes with unanimous support from the Board of Directors. The Board appointed him to be President and CEO. In 2007, Davis worked with volunteers to challenge oil giant BP's plans to increase pollution to Lake Michigan, and won. He helped write and pass the Great Lakes Legacy Act to fund Area of Concern cleanups, forge the Great Lakes Water Resources Compact to establish water conservation standards and establish the Adopt-a-Beach program for schools, communities and families, which grew to nearly 10,000 volunteers. Because of these and other efforts during his tenure, the Alliance for the Great Lakes also won the American Bar Association's Distinguished Award in Environmental Law & Policy, the first time for a public interest organization in the honor's history.  \\"Great Lakes Czar\\"  After the Brookings Institution produced analyses in 2007 showing at least a 2:1 return on investment for restoring the Great Lakes, in September 2008, the Obama-Biden campaign pledged to establish a $5 billion Great Lakes restoration trust fund and appoint a federal agency coordinator to advance Great Lakes restoration. In June 2009, the Obama Administration announced Davis's appointment to serve as Senior Advisor to the Administrator at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to fill the coordinator pledge. Because of the appointment's importance, the media dubbed the position as a \\"czar\\" for cleaning up the Great Lakes and his appointment came under immediate question from some commentators claiming Davis had been an ACORN Board member with no water management experience. The claims, while repeated often, remained unsubstantiated. Meanwhile, industrial leaders praised Davis as \\"willing to consider the region's business interests\\" and The Economist deemed him a \\"respected advocate.\\" Still, in 2010, there was an attempt by representatives outside the Great Lakes region to kill Davis's position and those of other \\"czars\\" through legislation. Great Lakes Restoration Initiative In his FY2010 budget, President Obama had established the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to fund the work of 16 federal agencies within 11 Interagency Task Force departments. Shortly after his appointment, Davis helped write the Action Plan guiding some $300 million per year under this presidential program to clean up Areas of Concern, prevent invasive species, restore habitat, reduce land-based pollution and ensure accountability. The Task Force, including the White House Council on Environmental Quality, Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, and others, along with several of the region's governors, released the Action Plan, which received praise from Washington Post commentator David Broder. Also at this time, he helped establish the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee to create a strategy and guided the Initiative to fund work to address the imminent threat of the fish showing signs of moving toward the Great Lakes. He also helped develop an Administration policy on offshore wind energy and the National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan. In September 2012, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson signed an updated U.S.-Canada Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, which continued efforts to clean up Great Lakes Areas of Concern and included new provisions on invasive species, helping communities prepare for changes in the climate, and rebuilding habitat. Davis served as a lead negotiator. In 2012, he began working to build support within the Administration for another five years and, in March 2013, the White House announced its commitment, with Davis coordinating the effort to unify stakeholders around development of a new Action Pan. In September 2014, during a meeting of Great Lakes mayors about drinking water following the shutdown of Toledo's water system the month before, the Administration unveiled its second Great Lakes Restoration Initiative action plan. The program has been praised as a model bipartisan, results-oriented federal conservation initiative.  Post-federal service  As an appointee, Davis left federal service with outgoing President Obama, on January 20, 2017, having served as a \\"lifer\\" (both terms). In February, he founded www.genoir.com as a small business to help families tell their stories and joined GEI Consultants as Vice President, in charge of business development, assistance to tech start-ups and agency- related services to clients in the Midwest.  Elected office  On January 21, 2018, Davis announced he was running for office, seeking the Democratic nomination for one of the nine commissioner positions at the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago in the March 20, 2018, primary. Political pundits opined that no one could win, as the race was a \\"write-in\\" race, which had never been conducted on a countywide basis in recent memory. The Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune, Sierra Club, and several prominent elected officials endorsed him within weeks. On April 10, 2018, the Cook County Clerk's Office certified Davis as the winner of the race, with eight opponents (eight fellow Democrats, one Green candidate. The Republican Party did not field or nominate any candidates). Davis won 89% of all valid write-in votes, with 54,183 votes total, beating the previous statewide record for a write-in candidate set in 1944 by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, with 47,561 write-ins. Three days after the primary, however, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner made an appointment until November 2020 for the same office sought by Davis. Critics, including the Chicago Sun-Times contended that the appointment was only valid until the \\"next regular election,\\" November 2018. On September 21, 2018,the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory judgment about whether the voters should decide in the November 6, 2018, general election who should represent them or whether a governor's appointee should get two extra years to serve until November 2020. Attorney Ed Mullen represented Davis. On October 24, Judge Patrick Stanton of the Cook County Circuit Court ruled that the voters could decide in the 2018 election who could represent them. Rauner's appointee said he would let the ruling stand without appealing. On November 6, Cook County voters elected Davis with 1.1 million votes, garnering 75% of returns for the seat.
