The equation is named in honor to Alfred G. Redfield, who first applied this equation in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. There is a close connection to the Lindblad master equation. If a so-called secular approximation is performed, where only certain resonant interactions with the environment are retained, every Redfield equation transforms into a master equation of Lindblad type. Redfield equations are trace-preserving and correctly produce a thermalized state for asymptotic propagation. However, in contrast to Lindblad equations, Redfield equations do not guarantee a positive time evolution of the density matrix. That is, it is possible to get negative populations during the time evolution. The Redfield equation approaches the correct dynamics for sufficiently weak coupling to the environment. The general form of the Redfield equation is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\rho(t) = -\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} [H, \\\\rho(t)] -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar^2} \\\\sum_m [ S_m, \\\\Lambda_m \\\\rho(t) - \\\\rho(t) \\\\Lambda_m^\\\\dagger] where H is the Hermitian Hamiltonian, and the S_m, \\\\Lambda_m are operators that describe the coupling to the environment. Their explicit form is given in the derivation below. Derivation Consider a quantum system coupled to an environment with a total Hamiltonian of H_\\\\text{tot} = H + H_\\\\text{int} + H_\\\\text{env}. Furthermore, we assume that the interaction Hamiltonian can be written as H_\\\\text{int} = \\\\sum_n S_n E_n, where the S_n act only on the system degrees of freedom, the E_n only on the environment degrees of freedom. The starting point of Redfield theory is the Nakajima‚ÄìZwanzig equation with \\\\mathcal{P} projecting on the equilibrium density operator of the environment and \\\\mathcal{Q} treated up to second order.Volkhard May, Oliver Kuehn: Charge and Energy Transfer Dynamics in Molecular Systems. Wiley-VCH, 2000 An equivalent derivation starts with second-order perturbation theory in the interaction H_\\\\text{int}.Heinz-Peter Breuer, Francesco Petruccione: Theory of Open Quantum Systems. Oxford, 2002 In both cases, the resulting equation of motion for the density operator in the interaction picture (with H_{0,S} = H + H_\\\\text{env}) is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\rho_I(t) = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar^2} \\\\sum_{m,n} \\\\int_{t_0}^t dt' \\\\biggl(C_{mn}(t-t') \\\\Bigl[S_{m,I}(t), S_{n,I}(t') \\\\rho_I(t')\\\\Bigr] - C_{mn}^\\\\ast(t-t') \\\\Bigl[S_{m,I}(t), \\\\rho_I(t') S_{n,I}(t')\\\\Bigr]\\\\biggr) Here, t_0 is some initial time, where the total state of the system and bath is assumed to be factorized, and we have introduced the bath correlation function C_{mn}(t) = \\\\text{tr}(E_{m,I}(t) E_{n} \\\\rho_\\\\text{env,eq}) in terms of the density operator of the environment in thermal equilibrium, \\\\rho_\\\\text{env,eq}. This equation is non-local in time: To get the derivative of the reduced density operator at time t, we need its values at all past times. As such, it cannot be easily solved. To construct an approximate solution, note that there are two time scales: a typical relaxation time \\\\tau_r that gives the time scale on which the environment affects the system time evolution, and the coherence time of the environment, \\\\tau_c that gives the typical time scale on which the correlation functions decay. If the relation :\\\\tau_c \\\\ll \\\\tau_r holds, then the integrand becomes approximately zero before the interaction-picture density operator changes significantly. In this case, the so-called Markov approximation \\\\rho_I(t') \\\\approx \\\\rho_I(t) holds. If we also move t_0 \\\\to -\\\\infty and change the integration variable t' \\\\to \\\\tau = t - t', we end up with the Redfield master equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\rho_I(t) = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar^2} \\\\sum_{m,n} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty d\\\\tau \\\\biggl(C_{mn}(\\\\tau) \\\\Bigl[S_{m,I}(t), S_{n,I}(t-\\\\tau) \\\\rho_I(t)\\\\Bigr] - C_{mn}^\\\\ast(\\\\tau) \\\\Bigl[S_{m,I}(t), \\\\rho_I(t) S_{n,I}(t-\\\\tau)\\\\Bigr]\\\\biggr) We can simplify this equation considerably if we use the shortcut \\\\Lambda_m = \\\\sum_n \\\\int_0^\\\\infty d\\\\tau C_{mn}(\\\\tau) S_{n,I}(-\\\\tau). In the Schr√∂dinger picture, the equation then reads :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\rho(t) = -\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} [H, \\\\rho(t)] -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar^2} \\\\sum_m [ S_m, \\\\Lambda_m \\\\rho(t) - \\\\rho(t) \\\\Lambda_m^\\\\dagger] ReferencesExternal links * brmesolve Bloch- Redfield master equation solver from QuTiP.

The sole purpose was to promote and showcase agricultural development to both those involved in farming and agriculture as well as to promote an agricultural awareness to the general public. The event used to be held at Ashton Court in Bristol until the society purchased its current 130-acre site, which was previously part of the Tyntesfield Estate, in 2002. Many other events are also held at this site throughout the year. The Show Today Many of the basic traditions can still be found in today's show with the emphasis still being very much on agriculture. The showing of livestock, horses and demonstrations of local and rural skills and crafts still play an important part of the show. The 2019 event was the 160th show.

Career Hungary became Europe's leading discus throw power during the early 1930s, with the emergence of throwers like Remecz, Istv√°n Donog√°n and Endre Madar√°sz. Remecz first broke the European record in 1931, throwing 48.83 m in Debrecen; his mark was the best in the world that year. Remecz broke the European record three more times in 1932, eventually reaching 50.73 m in Dunakeszi; he was the first European to break 50 metres. He was one of the leading favorites at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but he underperformed and only reached 45.02 m, placing ninth and failing to qualify for the final rounds. Remecz's European record was broken by Sweden's Harald \\"Slaktarn\\" Andersson in 1934. Remecz was Hungarian champion in 1932, 1933 and 1934 and placed fourth at the inaugural European Championships in Turin, behind Andersson, Paul Winter and Donog√°n.

Sprague in 1926. Sprague was best known for making a large line of capacitors used in a wide variety of electrical and electronic in commercial, industrial and military/space applications. Other products include resistive components, magnetic components (transformers and coils), filter assemblies, semiconductors and integrated circuits. History overview Sprague used $25,000 of his savings to open Sprague Specialties Company at his home in Quincy, MA, in 1926. One of his first products was the mini condenser (an old name for capacitor). Mini condensers were commonly used in radio applications for noise filtering, signal coupling and tone controls. Early capacitors were two pieces of metal foil wrapped between wax paper or any other type of suitable insulation material. The type of insulating material determined the capacitor's capacitance and maximum voltage. Capacitors are also useful in high power applications like motors, and soon Sprague turned his attention those areas as well. Sprague capacitor products were bought and absorbed by Vishay in early 1993. Sprague found a sustainable product line in capacitors. The increase in the types of radios using AC created demand for many different types of capacitors. By 1929, Sprague Specialties Company needed a bigger facility, and in 1930 Sprague purchased a plant on Beaver Street in North Adams, MA, in Berkshire County. When local residents heard the company was expanding, Sprague received all kinds of incentives from the banks and other businesses to relocate there. Sprague chose the area because he wanted to open a shop where his father Frank had grown up. By the mid-1930s Sprague had become a recommended source for capacitors by radio manufacturers, radio repair and many electrical applications. As the size of the company grew there was a desire from the manufacturing workers to form an organized labor union. The Wagner Act of 1935 prohibited company unions. In 1937 the company agreed with the workers to form an independent union, the Independent Condenser Workers Union. From 1936-1944, the Sprague Specialties Company sales increased seven-fold, however expansion put a damper to profits. For many years the company sustained losses. Robert felt strongly connected to his company and to the people of North Adams, and always tried to consider the company's effects as the largest employer in town. Sprague purchased the Arnold Print Works plant in North Adams, Massachusetts, which became the permanent headquarters and principal manufacturing site for Sprague Specialties Company. By 1942 the Sprague Specialties Company had relocated to the abandoned Arnold Print Works Facility on Marshall St. This became the main facility, and eventually consisted of 26 buildings that were interconnected by tunnels and bridges. Former employees remember the complex layout and interesting ways to get from one department to another. Previous to the Sprague Specialties Company, the Arnold Print Works had been the largest employer in North Adams, operating in the area from 1860-1942. In 1942, the company's name was changed from Sprague Specialty Products to Sprague Electric. The Sprague Electric name would remain until its last owner Penn Central started to sell off pieces of its Sprague division in the early 1990s.  The Sprague Log (1938‚Äì1985)  Beginning in 1938, as CEO, Sprague tried to bridge the gap between the employees and the business, with the publication of the Sprague Log. Sprague used this newsletter to bring management and workers closer, and to maintain morale after forcing workers to take a 10% pay cut that same year. The publication was divided into two sections. Part 1 discussed the company accomplishments, achievements and the loyalty of Sprague employees, often spotlighting individuals. Part 2 contained employee announcements: births and weddings, social activities, and other family events.  Sprague Electric: Early years (1942‚Äì1960)  After the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and the declaration of war that followed, US manufacturing stopped commercial production and switched to wartime activities. Sprague Electric's participation in the US war effort improved its reputation, future contracts, and sales, and propelled the Sprague name to the forefront of the growing American electronic business. One of Sprague Electric's biggest contributions to the war effort was in the manufacturing of the variable timing proximity fuse. The proximity fuse was a small transmitter (and in some cases a receiver) built on a bomb or artillery shell that would detonate the bomb or shell before impact, causing greater destruction. Sprague Electric continued to make capacitor and resistive components to meet military requirements of quality and reliability. Robert C. Sprague was also a member of War Production Board for the Advisory Committee on Capacitors (1942-1945). Tantalum vs aluminum oxide electrolytic capacitors. Size comparison of two equal value capacitors. Larger is around 1946 and the smaller is a Sprague tantalum capacitor from the 1980s During the Second World War, Sprague invented the tantalum capacitor. The use of tantalum allows capacitors to achieve high values of electron storage or capacitance along with higher operating voltages, shrinking the capacitor to a fraction of the size of a more conventional design. Vishay Intertechnology, which currently owns the Sprague capacitor brand, calls their tantalum capacitors the Sprague tantalum.  Post World War II  After the Second World War, Sprague Electric retooled for the commercial and industrial products market and eventually Sprague capacitors and resistive products became a widely-known brand name. Radio and television manufacturers like RCA, Zenith and Philco continued to use Sprague Electric products. Sprague Electric products were also found in stores selling electronic parts, and the electronics servicing business. In 1946 Howard W. Sams (SAMS Publishing) introduced their Photofact Servicing manuals, which were a valuable resource for the service of consumer electronics. Sprague Electric capacitors were listed as a recommended replacement part. Sprague Electric flourished during the Cold War and the Space Race because of their reputation and experience in the building of military components. However, by 1954 most of Sprague Electric's sales and profits were from the TV and radio markets; military products sales were second. Sales reached almost $50 million. Also in 1954, the company built new capacitor plants in North Carolina and in the US territory of Puerto Rico. It was the beginning of Robert C. Sprague's dream to make Sprague Electric into a major corporation; this expansion would continue into the late 1960s. Sales of Sprague Electric products remained steady from 1954-1958 at just below $50 million. The company continued to expand its product base by opening a semiconductor plant in New Hampshire in 1957 and a magnetics plant in California. As the company grew, union membership (Independent Condenser Workers Union #2) grew as well. By November 1956 straight hourly workers wages were tied to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. Additionally, workers received better benefits. The Sprague Log recorded in this in a \\"Special Negotiations Supplement.\\"  Sprague Electric: Expansion, growth and difficulties (1960‚Äì1971)  By 1959 Sprague Electric achieved $50 million in sales. Robert C. Sprague continued as Chairman of the Board and his brother Julian as President. Contemporary advances in the integrated circuit and thin film technologies, Sprague saw a need to move to support and design products around these new technologies. Thin film products and integrated circuits lead to more compact circuit designs and smaller products. Sprague understood this as the future trend in electronics; he opened more plants in the United States and developed a worldwide network of sales offices. Comparison of non-film and film capacitors. Larger is Sprague Black Beauty (1950's) and smaller is polyethylene film (2000's) Both have identical capacitance but the film has 3 times the voltage rating. By 1960 Sprague Electric had manufacturing plants in North Carolina, New Hampshire, Vermont, Wisconsin, Virginia, Maryland and California. Many were involved in making capacitors that used thin film technology. This proved to be a very important product for Sprague Electric. These plants also produced magnetic products (transformers, inductors etc.). With advances in transistor and integrated circuit technology (later computer chips) resistance to noise interference became a factor. Magnetics played a role in reducing noise interference. Sprague got into the semiconductor business in the late 1950s, somewhat later than the already established semiconductor firms. Fairchild Camera (directed by Robert Noyce) had marketed the first commercial integrated circuit as early as 1963. Sprague wanted to be an early participant into this young product. They set up a group at the New Hampshire facility where thin film capacitors were made. In 1965 Sprague Electric acquired Micro Tech (Sunnyvale, CA), a manufacturer of semiconductor equipment for fabrication. By 1966 Sprague opened a brand new facility in Worcester, MA dedicated to semiconductor and integrated circuit fabrication. The new factory was headed by Dr. John L. Sprague, the youngest son of Robert C. Sprague. John Sprague was a graduate of Stanford University, and specialized in semiconductor development. Eventually the Micro Tech was moved to the same area. However Sprague's plans for Micro Tech never blossomed, and they wound up making capacitors. Robert C. Sprague's heavy investment in the semiconductor business reduced income for the company. Sales of Sprague Electric products were $100 million by 1966 and the workforce increased to over 12,000. As the company grew, management was reorganized, and more expansion occurred, in the form of external partnerships. However, this rapid expansion served to keep profits down. Additionally, expansion did not have much impact on wages, benefits and working conditions. As one local historian put it, Robert Sprague's view of his employees was \\"paternalistic\\". In March 1970 a major labor strike started and affected all areas of the company. The strike lasted 10 weeks and was ultimately settled by a federal mediator. While Robert C. Sprague and the Union representatives shook hands after the settlement, the results had a negative effect on future of the company, its management and employees.  Sprague Electric: Later years (1970‚Äì1978) With the end of the 1970 strike, Robert C. Sprague retired as chief executive and was succeeded by Neal W. Welch. Although the workers got some of what they demanded, the strike and the new contract would devastate the company. Sprague Electric made cuts to minimize costs, including reducing the labor force and shuttering some of its North Adams operations. Employee morale plummeted which was reflected in the rapid decline of the company's newsletter the Sprague Log during this period. The paper was only published twice a year, then not all until 1978; in that year, the company was sold to General Cable, which later was taken over by Penn Central in 1981.  Closing of the North Adams facility and its future  In the 1980s, Sprague Electric was a division of Penn Central. In 1981, John L. Sprague, the younger son of Robert C. Sprague, was named chief executive. John Sprague tried to bring the employees and management closer together. The Sprague Log increased its frequency of publication, and again emphasized the need to work together. During his leadership, sales of Sprague Electric products still grew steadily but not the company's profits. Capacitor products from overseas as well as other electrical and electronic components were cutting into sales from US manufacturers. Also by the 1980s, many electronic assembly plants were overseas, and there was more inclination to buy local or from areas closer to assembly. This was an area Sprague Electric could not compete. Even though sales of Sprague products reached $500 million in the mid-1980s, the Sprague division continued to reorganize. In 1985, it was announced that the Sprague division headquarters would move to Lexington, Massachusetts, and the North Adams plant would close down. As a company Penn Central focused on profits; it viewed Sprague Electric performance as unsatisfactory, and gradually closed or sold off operations. Sprague was spun off from Penn Central in 1987 under the holding company Sprague Technologies. In 1990, Sprague sold its semiconductor unit to Sanken Electric of Japan. Many of the capacitor products were sold in 1993 to Vishay, a leading manufacturer of components used in electronics for industrial and military/space applications. After Sprague Electric's permanent closing in North Adams, the population of North Adams dropped by 4,000 and the unemployment climbed to 14%. The biggest employer was gone and the site was rusting and decaying.The Sprague Electric Company's Long Goodbye Pt1-4 Removal and cleanup of the industrial waste, including carcinogenic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were also lingering problems. In 1996, 17 homes were demolished on Alton Place, Avon and West Main Streets in the Braytonville area due to the vaporizing of a toxic trichloroethylene (TCE) plume of groundwater seeping west from the Brown Street siteTCE Contamination: North Adams, Massachusetts  Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art  Entrance to MASS MoCA (formerly Sprague Electric Headquarters on Marshall Street) In 1986, Thomas Krens, director of Williams College Museum of Art, was looking for an exhibit space for large-scale contemporary art works. The mayor of North Adams, John Barrett III, suggested the abandoned Sprague Electric facility. In 1999, after years of demolition, cleanup, restoration, and construction, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) opened. Twenty-five of the 26 original buildings were restored, including many of the interconnecting bridges and tunnels. The Marshall Street site was listed in the National Historic Register. MASS MoCA is the largest contemporary art museum in the United States. Its location is a multiuse site, with the museum, offices, businesses, and recreation and special activity areas.  Legacy of Sprague Capacitors  Sample of Sprague capacitors and resistive Components over 60 years The revival of interest in vacuum tube amplifiers brought the mystique of having the right electronic components for top performance. Sprague Electric components had a long history of name recognition, quality, and brand loyalty. Starting in the early 1950s, Sprague produced its classic \\"Black Beauty\\" line of capacitors. These paper capacitors were similar to Robert Sprague's original patent. Instead of using wax coating on the outer body to keep moisture out (moisture renders capacitors useless), Sprague applied a plastic resin material to encapsulate the device and provide better and longer-lasting resistance to moisture. In the late 1960s capacitors developed quickly as better materials, such as mylar, were used in their production. Capacitors became more reliable, smaller, and able to withstand higher voltages. Sprague Electric's \\"Orange Drop\\" capacitors were well received by manufacturers and designers. They set the standard for \\"modern\\" capacitors in appearance and performance. Today, some designers and restorers will use only Sprague/Vishay Orange Drops or other Sprague capacitors. After the breakup of Sprague Electric, the Orange Drop Capacitor line was continued by SBE Inc until 2012, when the Orange Drop product line was sold to Cornell Dubilier.SBE Announces the Sale of the Orange Drop Product Line to Cornell Dubilier (CDE) - SBE Inc. : SBE Inc See also * Apollo 11 goodwill messages ReferencesFurther reading * External links *The Sprague Log, Preserving a Company Newsletter A complete set of the Sprague Log from the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) library. *Company Town Paul W.

The proposal is based on the benefits of agglomeration and aims to reposition the British economy away from London and the South East. The spatial footprint of the Northern Powerhouse is defined as the 11 Local enterprise partnership areas of the North of England. The proposal involves improvement to transport links, investment in science and innovation, and devolution of powers in City Deals. Former MP for Stockton South, James Wharton, was appointed as minister responsible for the proposal in May 2015. A 2018 investigation by The Guardian indicated he rarely left London to visit the northern areas, however. In October 2015 during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the UK, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the Northern Powerhouse proposal has \\"Chinese backing\\". Under the new government of Theresa May who became Prime Minister in July 2016, it was alleged that the focus on the North was to be downgraded into a nationwide agenda for boosting productivity outside the south-east. However, this was subsequently refuted by Theresa May who pledged to \\"help the great cities and towns of the North pool their strengths and take on the world\\". In September 2016 one of the main architects of the Northern Powerhouse project, Lord O'Neill, resigned from the Government and quit the Conservative benches in the upper house. Transport improvements Transport for the North (TfN) is set to become the first sub-regional transport body in the UK from April 2018. Working with central government and national transport bodies, TfN will develop and deliver strategic transport infrastructure across the North of England. Proposed transport improvements include Northern Powerhouse Rail (otherwise known as High Speed 3) and the ongoing work of the Northern Hub to remove a railway bottleneck around Manchester and provide faster connections across the North of England. In June 2015, the government suspended electrification of the Midland Main Line from London to Sheffield, and the TransPennine route between Manchester and Leeds amid spiraling costs and missed targets just weeks after winning the 2015 election. In December 2015, the Government awarded the two rail franchises in the North of England from April 2016 onwards, the Northern and TransPennine Express franchises. These franchises will come with ¬£1.2 billion of investment in more than 500 brand-new carriages, 2,000 extra services a week, free wi-fi on trains and at stations. The outdated diesel powered Pacer trains will also be removed from the network in 2020. The co-management of the franchises will be undertaken by Transport for the North and Government from April 2018, transferring the functions from Rail North. In August 2016, it was reported that proposals for a road tunnel underneath the Pennines to cut journey times by 30 minutes between Manchester and Sheffield, were being advanced. If completed, it would be the world's longest road tunnel. In July 2017 Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling, said that it is unlikely that the railway line between Manchester and Leeds will be fully electrified. He also cast doubt on whether the planned two extra through platforms at Manchester Piccadilly station would be built. It was also announced that the electrification plan of the Midland Main Line was to be scrapped and InterCity Express Trains ordered would be changed to less efficient bi-mode trains with diesel engines added to run on non-electrified lines. Research by the Institute for Public Policy Research has shown that current or planned expenditure on transport infrastructure per head of population is ¬£1,943 in London and ¬£427 in the north of England. Completed projects In January 2016, the new southern entrance to Leeds station opened, allowing commuters travelling south to reduce their journey times from the station, as well as a new concourse and cycle storage. In December 2017, the Ordsall Chord linking Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria opened. Science and innovation Projects include the National Graphene Institute, Square Kilometre Array and National Biologics Industrial Innovation Centre. Arts Manchester will get a new ¬£110 million theatre named The Factory (named after Factory Records). In April 2016 the Government launched The Great Exhibition of the North, investing \\"¬£5 Million towards the exhibition with an additional ¬£15 million into a legacy fund to attract further cultural investment in the Northern Powerhouse\\". Technology In March 2017, a delegation of 30 digital and technology leaders from the North of England visited San Francisco, home of tech companies including Facebook, Apple and Uber, on a Northern Powerhouse trade mission. The trip was coordinated by MC2, a Northern Powerhouse partner, and the delegation was led by Professor Adam Beaumont, founder and CEO of telecoms operator aql. The flight marked the first ever direct service from the North to San Francisco and the only such route outside of London in the UK. The trip resulted in a new partnership between aql and CircleLoop, a smart online phone system provider. Links were also forged with incubation experts, including Rocketspace. Northern Powerhouse Partnership reports The first Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP) report was released in January 2017. George Osborne and Lord Jim O'Neill launched the inaugural report ‚Äì which included input from over 200 businesses, civic and academic leaders from across the North ‚Äì at Salem Chapel, Leeds, headquarters of Northern Powerhouse partner aql. The report outlined a plan to grow the region's economy by ¬£100bn and create 850,000 jobs. A map which includes a list of all Northern Powerhouse Partnership members is available on Google Maps. Devolution An elected Mayor of Greater Manchester has assumed significant powers in Greater Manchester. The current Mayor of Greater Manchester is Andy Burnham. Additional devolution proposals include the creation of elected mayors for Sheffield and the North-East (Newcastle, Durham, Northumberland, South Tyneside, North Tyneside and Sunderland), with the first elections due for 2017. In popular culture In February 2017 Goole band Sandra's Wedding released an album named Northern Powerhouse, inspired by the policies and political implications of the project. It was discussed in the Press and praised by then Northern Powerhouse Minister Andrew Percy prior to his resignation from the post in June 2017. In August 2019 Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry announced the Northern Powerhouse Partnership scheme exceeded 300 members.

The study was conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in thirteen different countries, at a cost of $24 million. About fifty scientists worked on the study, which was the largest case-control study conducted on the association between mobile phones and cancer as of 2014. The study's results, published in 2010, indicated that mobile phone use did not increase the risk of tumors among most cell phone users, with the possible exception of an increased risk among the 10% of users who used their cell phones the most. In the Interphone study, the top 10% of users used their phones 30 minutes/day. Some users reported using their cell phones >5 hours per day, but this was considered implausible at the time of the study. The median usage was less than 2.5 hours per month. History and design In 1998 and 1999, the IARC conducted a feasibility study which concluded that a large case-control study examining the relationship between mobile phone use and risk of brain tumors would be \\"feasible and informative\\". After this conclusion was reached, Interphone began in 2000, and interviewed over 5,000 people with either glioma or meningioma. The study ended in 2006 and was originally due to be released that year, but its release was delayed until 2010 because scientists involved in the study could not agree on how its results should be described. Funding Interphone received some funding from the mobile phone industry, including the Mobile Manufacturers Forum and Groupe Speciale Mobile Association,Funding but this was subject to guarantees that the study would remain scientifically independent. Results On May 17, 2010, the Interphone study's results were published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. The results indicated that overall, mobile phone use did not increase the risk of glioma or meningioma, and that, in fact, a decrease in risk was observed. The authors said this decrease may have been due to study limitations. However, the results also found that among people who were exposed to mobile phones the most (half an hour per day over ten years), there was evidence of an increase in risk of glioma. The study also concluded that \\"biases and error prevent a causal interpretation\\" with regard to the increased risk of glioma observed at the highest exposure levels. The authors also said that the number of people using their mobile phones this much was relatively small. Reaction The results of the study were hailed by the mobile phone industry, but some researchers criticized the study, with an editorial accompanying it arguing that its results were likely due to bias. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society noted that Interphone was the largest study of mobile phone use and tumor risk conducted to date, but also criticized it, saying in a statement that \\"The majority of participants in this study were not heavy cell phone users compared to today's practices.\\" John Niederhuber, the then-director of the National Cancer Institute, said that Interphone \\"illustrates how difficult it is to identify and corroborate, or definitively rule out, any possible association between the two [i.e. cell phones and cancer]\\".

From 2009 to 2012 he served as Deputy of the LXI Legislature of the Mexican Congress representing Chihuahua. Life Ochoa was born in Chihuahua City, and between 1994 and 1999, he studied for an undergraduate degree in Financial Administration from Tec de Monterrey Campus Chihuahua. Beginning in 1997, he served as the director of finances and administration at Ochoa Comercial, S.A. de C.V., a Chihuahua-based business that markets food products. Three years later, he also began serving as the director general of Transportadora Mexicana del Norte, S.A. de C.V. Ochoa also served on many committees and chambers in the 2000s. In 2000 and 2001, Ochoa served on the Coparmex Commission of Young Entrepreneurs; from 2001 to 2002, he served on the national council of CONACCA, the National Confederation of Associations of Wholesale Market Merchants. 2001 also saw Ochoa begin to serve on the board of the National Chamber of Commerce in Chihuahua, with which he remained involved for the rest of the decade. For instance, between 2003 and 2005, he was the Vice President of Exterior Commerce in the organization, then he became its treasurer between 2005 and 2006 and its president from 2006 to 2008. He also served in several capacities with CONCANACO, the national confederation of chambers of commerce, serving on its national council between 2002 and 2003, presiding its Commission on Strengthening the Internal Market between 2003 and 2006, functioning as vice president of the northeast region from 2006 to 2007, and being the national vice president of domestic commerce in 2008 and 2009. In 2009, voters in the VI Federal Electoral District of Chihuahua, including the capital city, elected Ochoa Mill√°n to the Chamber of Deputies for the LXI Legislature. In his three years in San L√°zaro, he was the secretary of the Tourism Commission and served on the Communications, Special for Monitoring of the Sugar Industry, and Special for Export Manufacturing Industry Commissions. That same year, he began studying for an MBA from Tec de Monterrey, Campus Chihuahua. After his term as a deputy, he became part of the Chihuahua City Municipal Board of Water and Sanitation. In 2015, the state government of Chihuahua tapped Ochoa Mill√°n to become the new Secretary of Urban Development and Ecology in the state. He resigned in March 2016 in order to run for the state congress. In late April, Ochoa formally registered as PRI candidate to run for the Chihuahua state congress from local district 15. While official counts showed him as losing to Jorge Soto, the PAN candidate, the PRI challenged the results because of irregularities with the number of ballot papers at some polling sites, including so-called \\"pregnant\\" ballot boxes; the party alleged that more ballots had been cast than had been supplied to the sites.

He came to hold national syndicalist views that prefigured fascism. He was anti-Semitic, hostile to freemasonry, hostile to the republic and flirted with monarchism. However his main goal was the nationalization of the land and of the means of production. Life=Early years √âmile Janvion was born on 10 April 1866 in M√¢con, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire. He was given the nickname \\"Pisse-vinaigre\\" (vinegar piss). In 1893 he founded the first syndicate of employees of the prefecture. Janvion was one of the founders of the Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail, (CGT ‚Äì General Confederation of Labor). In 1896 he contributed towards the Parisian anarchist newspaper Le P√®re Duch√™ne. In 1897 Janvion and Jean Degalv√®s founded the Ligue d'enseignement libertaire (League of Libertarian Education). The league was in favor of rational and complete education with mixed classes. That year Janvion and Degalv√®s published the brochure La libert√© par l'enseignement (Freedom through Education). Although helped by major figures such as Jean Grave, √âmile Zola, Maurice Barr√®s and Octave Mirbeau, they could only raise enough money to teach a small group of 19 children in the 1898 and 1899 summer holidays in Pontorson, Lower Normandy, and to conduct some lectures and evening courses at the H√¥tel des Soci√©t√©s Savantes between 1899 and 1900. The school closed in 1901 due to lack of money and disagreements between Janvion and Degalv√®s. Janvion wrote for various anarchist papers between 1898 and 1899 including La Aurore, Le Libertaire, Le Cri de R√©volte, L'Homme Libre and Le Journal du Peuple. He wrote for the periodical Germinal from 1899 to 1902. This was an anarchist journal published in Paterson, New Jersey, US. From 1899 Janvion led an antisemitic and anti-masonic campaign among syndicalists. He was the main organizer of the Anti-Parliamentary Congress of 1900, which was banned before it could be held. Anti- militarist In December 1902 √âmile Janvion was one of the founders of the Ligue antimilitariste, along with fellow anarchists Henri Beylie, Paraf-Javal, Albert Libertad and Georges Yvetot. The Ligue antimilitariste was to become the French section of the Association internationale antimilitariste (AIA). In preparation for the anti-militarist congress in Amsterdam in 1904 Janvion launched L'Ennemi du peuple (The Enemy of the People). The bi-monthly four- page journal first appeared in August 1903, with contributions from Miguel Almereyda, Zo d'Axa, Lucien Descaves, √âlie Faure, Urbain Gohier, Charles Malato and Jehan Rictus. Georges Darien, who had suggested the title to Janvion, contributed from the second issue. Divergences of opinion soon appeared in the Ennemi's pages. Skirmishes developed into outright war between the contributors, and eventually Janvion decided to close the journal down. The last issue appeared in November 1904. In October 1906 Janvion was the delegate of the Union of Paris Municipal Employees to the 15th national congress of the CGT in Amiens. In 1907 government troops fired on winemakers in Languedoc who were protesting imports of cheap Algerian wine, killing several. Janvion was among the anti-militarist revolutionary syndicalists who were indicted for signing a poster protesting the massacres, blaming a \\"government of murderers\\". He was dismissed from his job as a municipal official in the prefecture of the Seine for having signed the poster, but after an amnesty regained his position with all rights. On 1 May 1908 Janvier spoke at the Bourse du travail, and denounced the oppressive tactics of Georges Clemenceau whom he accused of fomenting the disiturbances of 1 May 1906 so that he could claim to be the only man capable of preventing revolution. In October 1908 he again represented his union at the 16th national congress in Marseille. Anti-Semite In the spring and summer of 1908 Janvion attacked Freemasons and the republic in a violent campaign among the syndicalists. Janvion denounced Freemasonry, which he called a \\"Mardi Gras brotherhood\\" serving \\"the masters of the hour.\\" He spoke out against the growing subordination of the unions to what he called the Radical-masonic- Jewish establishment. From 1909 his journal Terre libre provided a platform for anti-Semites and anti-republican syndicalists. In April 1911 Janvion and √âmile Pataud sponsored a mass meeting in Paris that they called \\"a great anti- Jewish and anti-Masonic demonstration. Janvion was expelled from the CGT in 1913 for his anti-Semitism. Anti-republican In 1908 Georges Valois started an \\"inquiry into the monarchy and the working class\\" in the first issue of the Revue critique des id√©es et des livres. He invited various syndicalists and intellectuals interested in syndicalism to comment on whether the monarchy would be preferable to the republic in advancing working class interests and the progress of syndicalism. Janvion was among the thirteen whose replies were published, of whom only the royalist syndicalist Darguenat was in favor of the monarchy. Valois gave Janvion's response a flattering introduction, but although Janvion was glad to criticize the republic he would not support the idea of a monarchy, which he thought would not be viable without politicians. In November 1909 the revolutionary syndicalist Marius Riquier helped Janvion and the writer Georges Darien to found the anti- republican journal Terre Libre (Free Land). Janvion decided to cooperate with royalists, and in return received support for the Terre Libre. He worked with L√©on Daudet and Mahon, leader of the Amicale royaliste, to arrange workers' meetings. As part of the drive to gain support for royalism among syndicalists, Janvier and three other syndicalists hung a bust of Marianne (symbol of the republic) from the front of the Bourse de Travail in Paris. They were prosecuted for this act. It was said that Georges Valois was providing money for the Terre Libre from Action Fran√ßaise. Valois probably used Marius Riquier, who worked for both the Action Fran√ßaise and the Terre Libre, to make contact with the syndicalist movement through Janvion. Left- wing members of the Action Fran√ßais who followed Charles Maurras collaborated in Terre Libre with revolutionary syndicalists. The journal appeared until May 1914, and constantly insisted that exploitation of workers could only be achieved by nationalizing the land. Janvion's Terre libre group evolved towards fascism. To Janvion, as to fellow-socialists Georges Sorel and √âdouard Berth, democracy was the supreme evil in all circumstances. Anti- feminist During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Janvion published an undated pamphlet, probably in late 1917, titled Le f√©minisme d√©faitiste (Defeatist Feminism). He identified pro-peace feminist leaders such as H√©l√®ne Brion, S√©verine, Marguerite Durand, Hubertine Auclert and Nelly Roussel, and wrote, \\"the history of defeatism, when it is known, will demonstrate superabundantly that feminism will there merit, I dare say, the place of honor.\\" √âmile Janvion died on 21 July 1927 in Paris and was buried the next day in the cemetery of Bagneux, Ile de France.

The chain specialises in cakes, and its menu included continental breakfasts, lunches and teas and coffees. The company went into administration in January 2019, prior to a management buyout funded by Causeway Capital Partners. History=Foundation The Sutton, London branch in Sutton High Street According to Helene (Leni) Vermeirsch, the niece of the founders, Patisserie Valerie was first opened in 1926 on the corner of Dean Street and Old Compton Street in Soho, London by Esther van Gyseghem, born in Ostend, Belgium on 22 April 1900 and her husband Theophile (Theo) Vermeirsch. There is not known to have been a Valerie in the founders' families, but Esther came to be referred to as Madame Valerie. Theo died in 1947, and Esther ran Patisserie Valerie alone until she retired in 1965. Leni Vermeirsch thinks that her aunt sold the business to an Italian businessman based in Soho. The Soho Clarion magazine said that the Fonteyn family founded Patisserie Valerie; there is some evidence of them in Soho and in the catering business. Patisserie Valerie remained at its original location until it was bombed out during World War II, and reopened in nearby Old Compton Street after Theo and Esther spent a short time in Norfolk. The Scalzo brothers bought it in 1987 from descendants of the founder, and grew the business to nine branches, including shops in Piccadilly and Kensington. Leni Vermeirsch said when Patisserie Valerie was struggling in early 2019 \\"What ended up being called Patisserie Valerie did not bear any resemblance to the original one\\". Expansion In 2006, Luke Johnson's Risk Capital Partners acquired the Scalzo brothers' controlling stake in the company. At the time of the acquisition, Luke Johnson said: The chain has expanded rapidly since 2006, growing from eight shops in 2006 to 192 as of May 2017. It opened its first shop in the Republic of Ireland in 2017, in Debenhams in Blanchardstown Centre. A selection of their cakes are now available in many Sainsbury's stores, also there is the option to buy online and collect personalised and unstocked items in-store. Stockmarket listing In April 2014 the company announced plans to raise ¬£33m on the London Alternative Investment Market, using the sum to reduce its debt. Share suspension and collapse into administration Trading in the shares of Patisserie Holdings, the parent company of Patisserie Valerie, were suspended on 10 October 2018 following the discovery of potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities, which had led to the possibility that there had been a material mis-statement of the company‚Äôs accounts. It was widely reported in the press that there was a multimillion pound black hole in the company's accounts. Luke Johnson, the company chairman, said: \\"We are all deeply concerned about this news and the potential impact on the business\\". On 11 October, the company announced that there was a material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business and that without an immediate injection of capital the directors were of the view that there would be no scope for the business to continue trading in its current form. On 12 October, Hertfordshire police issued a statement saying that: \\"A 44-year old man from St Albans has been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. He has been released under investigation.\\" It was widely reported that the individual concerned was Chris Marsh, the firm's finance director. The Serious Fraud Office announced on its website that it had opened an investigation into an individual at the company. Later that day the company announced details of a rescue plan under which it would borrow ¬£20 million from Johnson and place 31,451,100 ordinary shares at 50 pence to raise new capital of approximately ¬£15.7m before payment of expenses. The rescue plan prevented the imminent bankruptcy of the company and subsequent loss of 2500 jobs, but was criticised in The Daily Telegraph as being against the interests of smaller shareholders. On 14 October it was reported that two unauthorised and unreported overdrafts of almost ¬£10 million had been discovered. On 22 January 2019, the firm announced that it had collapsed into administration following failed talks with banks, which the company stated was a \\"direct result of the significant fraud\\". The collapse will lead to the immediate closure of 70 of the nearly 200 stores and concessions operated by the group, leading to the loss of around 900 jobs.

He has represented the 111th District, which includes parts of Miami and Hialeah in northeastern Miami-Dade County, since 2014. History Avila was born in Hialeah, Florida. He graduated from Miami Springs High School in 2002. He attended Miami Dade College, receiving his associates degree in 2004, and graduated from the University of Miami with a bachelor's degree in political science in 2006. Avila went on to attend Florida International University, where he graduated with a Masters degree in Criminal Justice as well as a Master of Public Administration degree in 2010. In 2011, Avila was appointed to serve on the Planning and Zoning Board for the City of Hialeah. The following year, he was appointed to the city's Scholarship Board. In 2013, Avila was elected as the Vice-Chairman of the Republican Party of Miami-Dade County and served until his election to the Florida House of Representatives. Avila is married to his high school sweetheart, Cindy Gil-Avila. In 2015, their daughter, Olivia, was born. Campaign for State House In 2014, Avila ran to succeed incumbent State Representative Eduardo Gonz√°lez, who was unable to seek re-election due to Florida term limits. He faced Alexander Anthony, a former candidate for Mayor in Miami Springs in the Republican primary. Avila campaigned on improving the state's economy, cutting taxes, expanding educational opportunities, reducing the size of government, and eliminating corporate welfare. He earned the endorsement of the Miami Herald, which, though it recommended his candidacy, criticized his opposition to Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Avila ended up defeating Anthony by a wide margin. He won the Republican primary with 60% of the vote and advanced to the general election, where he faced Mariano Corcilli, the Democratic nominee. This time, he did not earn the endorsement of the Miami Herald, which supported his opponent over his opposition to Medicaid expansion. Ultimately, it was not a close election with Avila defeating Corcilli in a landslide, winning 67% of the vote. Florida House of Representatives During his first term in office, Avila authored pieces of legislation such as providing a property-tax exemption for low-income seniors, streamlining the tax appeals process, establishing in-state tuition for all active duty service members, reforming HIV testing, and implementing distance requirements for Assisted Living Facilities. In 2016, Avila ran for re- election and defeated Sevi Miyar, the Democratic nominee and a high school teacher. Avila was recognized for his accomplishments during his first term in office and received the endorsement of the Miami Herald, which praised him as a rising star. He went on to win 59% of the vote and was sworn in for his second term on November 22, 2016.

They are famous for the use on the Red Ball Express from Normandy to the front, but were also used in the China Burma India Theater. After the war they were used in Europe, including during the Berlin Crisis, and in the Korean War.  History  Designed and first manufactured by International Harvester, later Kenworth and Marmon-Herrington also built them. The official model number was 542, to which are added a prefix letter designating the manufacturer of the engine (thus 'H' from Harvester) and a suffix number relating to the tire size. The M426 was a heavier duty evolution of the M425. All model H-542-9 M425s were built by International, H542-11 M426s were built by all three companies. 1,200 M425s were upgraded to M426 standards.  Engine and driveline  IHC Red Diamond 450D engine (cutaway view) The engine in these vehicles was an International Red Diamond 450D, a overhead valve inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developing at 2700 rpm. The clutch was made by W.C. Lips, Model Z-32-S, and the transmission was an IHC Model F-54-D. This transmission had 5 forward and one reverse speed. The first speed was very low, fifth speed was direct.  Chassis  M425 cab interior view All models had a ladder frame with two axles on semi elliptical leaf springs. A set back front axle allowed a wheelbase of only , allowing a very short turn radius. The M425 and M426 were general service load carriers, designed to haul load over roads, so they didn't need to be 4 x 4. The front axle was an I-beam, the rear was a double reduction full floating type. International used their own front and rear axles, Kenworth and Marmon-Herrington used Timkens. Brakes were full air with drum brakes on all wheels. Trailer brakes could be used independently of the tractor. A disk type hand brake was mounted on the propeller shaft. M425s had 9.00x20 size tires, while M426s had larger 11.00x20s with stronger springs and a slightly longer wheelbase. All had dual rear tires. Except for the difference in the size of the tires, and some minor details, all types are mechanically identical. All models were a cab over engine design with a military style open cab.  Trailers  The M425 towed a 7-ton (6,350kg) load rated trailer long, the M426 a 10-ton (9,072kg) trailer long. Both had a single axle with dual rear tires, and a stake-and-platform body.

The peak after 1815 was caused by the Mount Tambora eruption. The 1808 mystery eruption was a large volcanic eruption conjectured to have taken place in late 1808, possibly in the southwest Pacific. A VEI-6 eruption, comparable to the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, is suspected of having contributed to a period of global cooling that lasted for years, analogous to how the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora (VEI-7) led to the Year Without a Summer in 1816.  Background  Before the 1990s, the deterioration of the weather in the early 1810s was considered by climatologists as normal for the Little Ice Age. A study of Greenland and Antarctic ice cores in the 1990s found markers that implied that a massive volcanic eruption had occurred in early 1809. The problem facing climatologists and volcanologists was that there were no recorded eruptions of the order of significance needed in this period. Further research and bristlecone pine tree ring data pointed to the eruption being in 1808.  Location and date  Adding to the mystery was the expectation that any eruptions of that magnitude should have been noticed at the time. Records from the time throughout the world were checked but nothing appeared viable until the summer of 2014, when PhD student Alvaro Guevara- Murua and Dr Caroline Williams of the University of Bristol discovered an account of atmospheric events consistent with such an event by Colombian scientist Francisco Jos√© de Caldas. Caldas served as Director of the Astronomical Observatory of Bogot√° between 1805 and 1810 and in 1809 reported a transparent cloud that obstructs the sun's brilliance at Bogot√°. It had first been observed by him on 11 December 1808 and was visible across Colombia. The cloud might have been a \\"dry fog\\", which is a sulfuric acid (H2SO4) aerosol. He also reported that the weather had been unusually cold, with frosts. To the south, in Peru, similar observations were made by physician Hip√≥lito Unanue of Lima. These reports led those involved to suggest that the window of the eruption was within 7 days of 4 December 1808. Caldas' and Unanue's accounts indicated the existence of a stratospheric aerosol veil spanning at least 2600 km into both northern and southern hemispheres. The only likely source for this would be a tropical volcano, most likely located in the southern hemisphere but not likely further than 20 degrees south latitude. An area in the tropics to the west of Colombia and Peru with candidate volcanoes and with little reporting at that time is the south- western Pacific Ocean between Indonesia and Tonga. This area had no European settlements at the time. Apart from the occasional sighting by European explorers, most of the reporting on volcanic activity, such as that in the Rabaul area, which has had VEI 6 eruptions, went back only to the mid-19th century.2\\\\.

History Sullivan was born in Altamonte Springs, Florida, and claims that she has completed half the credits at Liberty University towards a degree. However, the registrar of the university says Sullivan was enrolled for a single semester in 2011. She has held a number of jobs, including working at a blueberry farm, as a waitress, and as a babysitter, and campaigned for Amendment 2, an ultimately successful constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage in Florida in 2008, and for her mother, Patricia Sullivan, who unsuccessfully ran for the Congress in the Republican primary in 2010 in the 8th congressional district. Florida House of Representatives In 2014, incumbent State Representative Bryan Nelson was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, so Sullivan ran to succeed him. She faced Randy Glisson, Terri Seefeldt, Belita Grassel, and Joseph Stephens in the Republican primary, which was an open primary because no other candidates had filed. Sullivan campaigned on her conservative Christian credentials, and attracted support from a number of young volunteers from other states who traveled down to Florida to work on her campaign. The Orlando Sentinel ended up endorsing Grassel, blasting Sullivan in an editorial for being \\"steeped in tea-party dogmatism that has contributed to polarized governance.\\" Ultimately, in a close campaign, Sullivan emerged narrowly victorious, defeating Glisson by a little more than one thousand votes, winning 35% of the vote to Glisson's 29%, Seefeldt's 19%, Grassel's 14%, and Stephens's 3%, making her the youngest female member of the Florida House in its history. In November, 2016, Sullivan was re-elected by 73% of the voters of her district.

The history of the piece is somewhat contentious but it was most notably included in the collection Illustrious Words to Instruct the World, written by Feng Menglong, and published in 1620. Genre The piece has a few particular nuances that are worthy of note and distinction. First, the language in the piece is written vernacular, or baihua rather than literary language. This means that it was more accessible to the average person than pieces typically were. Second, while it is normally accepted by scholars that the piece was an adaptation of an oral story, there is evidence to support that the piece may in fact have been an adaptation of an earlier work, titled The Pearl Shirt as written by Sung Mao-Ch'engThe Making of The Pearl-Sewn Shirt and The Courtesan's Jewel Box Hanan, Patrick, Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Vol. 33, (1973), pp. 124-153 Finally, the piece focuses on a mercantile lifestyle which was common for short stories at the time, but less common for Classical pieces like The Pearl Shirt.Hanan, Patrick, Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Vol. 33, (1973), pp. 124-153 The adaptation of the piece from The Pearl Shirt is notable for a few reasons. The translation from Classical language to baihua meant that many phrases were changed, and some of the distinctive language was lost. The structure between the pieces, though, has been primarily preserved, as well as most of the thematic content. There are roughly fifteen 'scenes' that the pair of stories share, and while much has changed the shift in perspective is most notable. The Pearl Shirt used a technique that Hanan referred to as \\"unobtrusive omniscience\\" whereas The Pearl-Sewn Shirt focused on \\"highly obtrusive omniscience.\\" In layman's terms; the original piece had little outside context or interaction from the narrator, whereas the re- written one by Sung Mao-Ch'eng had a more expressive and invasive narrator or authorial tone. Plot Taking place in the early Ming dynasty, the story begins by following a merchant named Jiang Xingge, who had married a respectable wife, Wang Sanqiao. The pair were well-matched and Xingge did not travel away from home for two years, putting his business on hold. Eventually, he did have to go south, in order to conduct trade. Despite many restrictions and limitations on his wife, in order to preserve her chastity, Sanqiao is noticed by another merchant, named Chen Dalang. Chen cannot meet Sanqiao because she stays indoors, and is constantly surrounded by servants, as precaution by Xingge. Chen enlists the help of an older woman, also a merchant, named Madam Xue. She becomes friends with Sanqiao, as a part of the machinations by Chen. Eventually, Madam Xue is able to put the pair together and they start an affair. Sanqiao and Chen love each other, despite the fact that each is married. The next year, Chen travels away as well. While he is departing, Sanqiao gives him a pearl-sewn shirt, which is an important family heirloom of the Jiang family. In his travels south, he meets Jiang Xingge. Chen confesses about his love affair but is ignorant to the fact that he is speaking to Sanqiao's husband. Chen shows Xingge the pearl shirt, and Xingge knows. Xingge then returns home, and sends his wife away with an order for a divorce. He also calls for thugs to smash up Madam Xue's home for her part of the misdeeds. The story then changes perspective, to follow Chen Dalang's wife, Pingshi. The story continues as Pingshi and Chen argue over the pearl shirt, which Pingshi then hides, to spite him. Chen decides to go on a trip, but comes up ill. Pingshi leaves their home to find her husband, in order to take care of his illness, but instead, she finds that Chen has already died. She is advised by others to marry another man in order to pay for Chen's funeral and to take care of herself. The marriage is arranged to Xingge. The couple get along well, and when Jiang Xingge sees the pearl shirt that Pingshi kept, he believes that their pairing is divine intervention. In the fourth, and final act, Xingge departs on a trip for business again, though this time, he gets into an argument in a market. Through a series of circumstances, this leads to the death of an old man, and Xingge is found to have charges pressed against him. The judge of the case is the new husband of his ex-wife, Sanqiao, and she begs her second husband to preserve Xingge's life. Xingge is spared, and when Sanqiao's husband is told the entire tale, the judge begins to cry and sees that Sanqiao and Xingge still care deeply for one another. He allows Sanqiao to leave him, and become Xingge's second wife. Rather than bicker or fight with one another, Pingshi and Sanqiao get along well, and the story draws to a close. Possible Themes Generally the piece focuses on the reinforcing of Confucian morals, primarily dealing with social contracts, such as marital obligations. As Wang is eventually overcome by her sexual desire, it can be said that there is also a treatise against excess. A major portion of the work also seems to focus on the intent of divine intervention. This comes in a few forms; when Jiang meets Chen, who has his family's heirloom shirt, or Pingshi and Jiang's marriage, as well as Wang's second husband being the judge of Jiang's trial. Second, there is the introduction of a few Buddhist notions, most notably in the form of compassion. While Jiang does show anger towards Madam Xue, he only does what society dictates towards his wife and divorces her. This serves as an important part of the story, as later, his wife's favor saves his life when dealing with the judge. Even more, the judge is compassionate enough to understand the love between Wang and Jiang, and allows her to leave him, to return to her first husband. Adaptation A 2004 Chinese television film The Pearl Shirt (ÁèçÁè†Ë°´), directed by Teng Huatao, was based on the story. It starred Sunny Chan as Chen Dalang, Li Chen as Jiang Xingge, Choi On-kiu as Wang Sanqiao, and Cao Xiwen as the maid Qing'er.

The Ohio ABLE ACT and Disability Policy  The Ohio ABLE Act, creating ABLE accounts, was the first of its kind state program which allows those with a qualifying disability to save for their disability expenses into a 529(a) savings account. Dever introduced legislation making Ohio the first state in the nation to pass this legislation. Dever worked to remove the term \\"mentally retarded\\" from the Ohio Revised Code and its State documents and sponsored legislation providing health care coverage for autism and its related disorders.  Drug policy  Dever advocated for funding to double the treatment options in Hamilton County. He sponsored legislation to treat heroin, cocaine, and crack cocaine the same when it comes to punishing drug traffickers. Prior to this change in law, heroin was treated similar to marijuana trafficking.  Banking, Housing, and Consumer Protection  Dever introduced legislation creating the DOLLAR Deed in Ohio. This allows a homeowner to stay in their home as a tenant when facing foreclosure rather than being put out on the street. DOLLAR stands for Deed Over your property in exchange for a Lender Lease and an Agreed Repurchase. \\"Bill proposing buy-back program for foreclosed properties progresses  The Daily Reporter\\" He also introduced HB 463 which revised Ohio‚Äôs foreclosure processes, addressing blight, vacancy, and abandonment.

He served in the Legislative Council of Newfoundland from 1870 to 1895 and represented Harbour Grace in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1900 to 1904 as a Liberal. He was born in Bermuda and was educated at the University of Pennsylvania. Harvey came to Newfoundland in 1853. In 1861, he joined Dunscombe, Harvey and Company, later known as Harvey and Company; his uncle Eugenius Harvey was part owner of the firm. When his uncle left, he became managing partner. Originally a fishery supply business, the company expanded into mining, lumber and manufacturing. He was also a partner in A. Harvey and Company and the New York, Newfoundland and Halifax Steamship Company. In 1894, he became an agent for the Dominion Coal Company of Cape Breton. Harvey established the Cabot Steam Whaling Company in 1896. In 1864, Harvey married Elizabeth Walker. In 1870, Harvey was named to the Newfoundland Legislative Council. He was opposed to union with Canada and supported the construction of a railway across the colony. He served as chairman of a committee tasked with deciding how Newfoundland should set up a fisheries commission; he later became chair of the commission. In 1889, he was named to the Newfoundland cabinet, responsible for the fisheries commission. From 1893 to 1896, he was head of the fisheries ministry. Harvey resigned from the Legislative Council and the cabinet in December 1895. This was in part due to the collapse of the Union and Commercial banks in 1894; Harvey had been a director for the Union bank as well as a major client of the bank. In 1900, he was elected to the Newfoundland assembly and he served in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio. Harvey helped establish the Fishermen and Sailors' Home in 1886. He was also a member of the committee set up to help Doctor Wilfred Grenfell provide medical care in Labrador. He died in St. John's at the age of 63.

Two police officers, patrolling stairwells in the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)'s Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York, Brooklyn, entered a pitch-dark, unlit stairwell, one of them, Officer Peter Liang, 27, with his firearm drawn. Gurley and his girlfriend entered the seventh-floor stairwell, fourteen steps below them. Liang fired his weapon; his shot ricocheted off a wall and fatally struck Gurley in the chest. A jury convicted Liang of manslaughter, which a court later reduced to criminally negligent homicide. On February 10, 2015, Liang was indicted by a grand jury (seven men and five women) for manslaughter, assault, and other criminal charges (five counts total) after grand jury members were shown footage of the unlit Pink house, and passed around the 9mm Glock used in the shooting, testing the possibility of equipment failure - concluding that the 11.5-pound (51-newton) trigger could not have been fired unintentionally. Liang turned himself in to authorities the next day to be arraigned on the charges. Liang was convicted of manslaughter and official misconduct on February 11, 2016, and faced up to 15 year of prison time. He was expected to appeal while he remained free without bail. Due to the fact that Liang, an Asian cop, became the first NYPD officer to be convicted of an on-duty shooting in over a decade, the conviction galvanized the Chinese community in New York City and across the United States. Many felt that Liang was being used as a scapegoat, and Chinese Americans used WeChat on a massive scale along with Facebook, Twitter, and email to organize rallies in major cities. Peter Liang appealed the court's decision. On March 28, 2016, the prosecuting Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson recommended to Judge Danny Chun that Liang serve only house arrest and community service for his sentence. On April 19, 2016, Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun sentenced Peter Liang to five years of probation and 800 hours community service, after downgrading his manslaughter conviction to criminally negligent homicide. Background=Akai Gurley Akai Kareem Gurley ( - November 20, 2014) was born in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, the Caribbean, and moved to New York when he was a child. He was not a resident of the Louis H. Pink Houses, where he was killed, but lived in nearby Brownsville with his domestic partner, her daughter and their two-year-old daughter. According to police, Gurley had 24 prior arrests on his record. Officer Peter Liang Peter Liang (born ), a Hong Kong American, had less than 18 months of experience with the New York City Police Department (NYPD) at the time of the shooting. Liang was born in Hong Kong, immigrated to the United States as a child and lived in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, with his parents and grandmother; he also has a younger brother in college. Liang had aspired to become a police officer since he was a child. Location The Louis H. Pink Houses are considered to be among the worst housing developments in New York. Patrick Lynch, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the City of New York, characterizes them as \\"among the most dangerous projects in the city\\" with dimly lit stairwells presenting a particular danger. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton reported that there had been a recent \\"spike in violence\\" in the neighborhood over the preceding months with two homicides, two robberies, and four assaults. Two rookie police officers were assigned to the Louis H. Pink Houses where they were conducting routine vertical patrols, in which officers patrol a public housing complex from the roof to the ground floor, stopping on each floor to see if there is any crime in progress. The New York Daily News initiated rumors that their commander had instructed officers in the area not to carry out vertical patrols and instead to conduct exterior policing in the East New York housing project, and that the officers were texting their union representative as Gurley lay dying. The rumors were later debunked by the District Attorney's office, but the Daily News did not issue a retraction or apology. The NYPD's policy on whether an officer should keep a weapon holstered on such patrols is purposely vague and the decision as to when to take out a firearm is left to the discretion of the officers, according to Police Commissioner Bill Bratton. The department also insists that officers place their fingers on the trigger only upon encountering \\"extreme and particularized danger.\\" During trial testimony, officers testified that they were taught during academy training to have their guns out at times for fear of possible \\"ambush\\" or when they felt \\"unsafe\\", and that they were specifically trained to take out their firearm as they approached a roof landing because it was \\"dangerous\\". One officer testified that cops are taught to beware of a possible \\"ambush\\" on vertical patrols specifically. She also testified that you were taught that when you approach a roof landing, you should have your firearm out, finger alongside the trigger. At the time the gun was discharged, the light in the stairwell on the 8th floor was broken and it was pitch black. Shooting Akai Gurley, 28 years old, was visiting his girlfriend and getting his hair braided before Thanksgiving. He entered the stairwell on the 7th floor, below Officers Shaun Landau and Peter Liang, who were patrolling the pitch-dark stairwell with no lights. According to the prosecutors, seconds earlier, Officer Liang, who is left-handed, pulled out his flashlight with his right hand and unholstered his 9mm Glock with his left. He then shoved open the stairwell door with his right shoulder with his gun drawn pointed down the way police officers are trained. It appeared neither side knew the other was there and no words were exchanged, according to authorities. Liang's gun accidentally discharged as he opened the door and the bullet ricocheted off the wall and struck Gurley once in the chest. He died within a few minutes. Upon entering, Liang said he heard \\"a quick sound\\" to his left which startled him. He turned left and \\"it just went off when my whole body tensed up\\", Liang testified. It was reported that Gurley actually ran after hearing the gunshot, and didn't realize he was bleeding until collapsing on the fifth floor. Similarity to the shooting of Timothy Stansbury Jr. The fatal shooting of Akai Gurley is notably similar to the shooting death of Timothy Stansbury Jr. that occurred in January 2004, when Officer Richard S. Neri killed Timothy Stansbury Jr., 19, on a roof at the Louis Armstrong Houses in Brooklyn at about 1 a.m. when Officer Neri, with his gun drawn, approached a rooftop door to check the stairway inside. A grand jury declined to indict Officer Neri on charges of criminally negligent homicide, declaring the event an accident, after he gave testimony that he had unintentionally fired; he was startled, he said, when Mr. Stansbury pushed open a rooftop door in a place where drug dealing was rampant. Aftermath New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton declared the shooting to be an accident and that Gurley was a \\"total innocent\\". Kings County District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson said that he planned to impanel a grand jury to look into the death of Akai Gurley. Media reports initially surfaced that indicated both officers text-messaged their union representatives before calling for help, which were later refuted as false by both the police union and the District Attorney office. When asked by reporters, the mayor Bill De Blasio did not take any sides in this issue after Liang's conviction, but only commented that it was a \\"tragedy\\" to Gurley's family and requesting respect to the court's verdict. On the stand of NYPD patrolling, he neutrally noted that as essential to public safety; he also characterized, to Asian Americans, the prevailing argument in Asian society of Peter Liang being a scapegoat as non- existent, [16] and to African Americans, who had ongoing suspicions about police brutality cases somehow being linked together, De Blasio characterized white supremacy conspiracy theories as non-existent as well. Akai Gurley's funeral was conducted December 6 at the Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Fort Greene. Initially Al Sharpton offered to speak at the service, but stepped down after a dispute within the family. Instead activist Kevin Powell spoke at the service. Gurley is interred at Rosedale Memorial Park in Linden, New Jersey.Akai Kareem Gurley's funeral service program, Dec. 6, 2014, Brown Memorial Baptist Church, Brooklyn The continued conduct of vertical patrols has also been scrutinized in the wake of Gurley's shooting. Police Commissioner William Bratton has said that the patrols are needed to reduce crime, and vertical patrols continue to be conducted in the Louis H. Pink Houses. On February 5, 2016, while Liang's trial was ongoing, two NYPD officers were shot while conducting vertical patrols at a housing development in the Bronx, although both were expected to survive. ReactionsChinese-Americans= Protestors supporting Peter Liang on February 20, 2016, at Boston Common More than 3,000 Chinese-Americans showed up at New York City Hall in March 2015 to support Liang. Thousands walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan's Chinatown in April, feeling that Liang was being used as a scapegoat, and demanded the charges to be dropped, as other, white police officers were previously not charged. Following his conviction, Asian- Americans denounced the verdict at various gatherings across the country, many expressing dismay and frustration. There were differing opinions among Liang's supporters, with some still feeling that he should not have been prosecuted at all, and some feeling that he should have been prosecuted but that a manslaughter verdict was too harsh as it carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in jail, but all agreeing that the overall system needs a change. State Assemblyman Ron Kim stated, \\"I do not believe true justice prevailed. Our system failed Gurley and it failed Liang. It pitted the unjust death of an innocent young black man against the unjust scapegoating of a young Asian police officer who was frightened, poorly trained, and who committed a terrible accident.\\" Nearly 15,000 people protested on behalf of Liang in New York on February 20, 2016, and protests were also held in other cities across the United States on the same day. Liang's supporters held signs with condolences for Gurley, as well as MLK signs (referencing civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr.) and signs asking for justice for Liang and Kizzy Adonis (black police officer who was prosecuted for the death of Eric Garner while the white police officer, Daniel Pantaleo, was not charged). Many of Liang's supporters demanded that all killers should be prosecuted and that there should be no such thing as selective prosecution, scapegoating, or racism. Joseph Lin, a real estate agent and activist, had helped to organize the protests due to feeling that Asian-Americans had been too \\"passive\\" or \\"indifferent\\" with no political voice, saying that \\"If he's a black officer, I guarantee you Al Sharpton will come out. If he's Hispanic, all the congressmen will come out. But no, he's a Chinese, so no one is coming out.\\" New York City councilwoman Margaret Chin stated that she was satisfied with the grand jury indicting Liang but she also asked for leniency in Liang's sentencing. Congresswoman Grace Meng also sent out her voice; however, she did not say anything meaningful that defined her standing. Senator Mark Treyger and William Colton had always spoke on the behalf of Chinese. =Black Lives Matter movement= Gurley's death was one of several police killings of African Americans protested by the Black Lives Matter movement. On December 27, 2014, 200 people marched in Brooklyn to protest the fatal shooting of Akai Gurley on the same day as the funeral for slain NYPD Officer Rafael Ramos, who was killed in the 2014 killings of NYPD officers, despite calls from the mayor to postpone demonstrations. Legal proceedings On February 10, 2015, Officer Peter Liang was indicted by a grand jury for the shooting death of Akai Gurley. He was charged with second-degree manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, and two counts of official misconduct. Liang had a court date on February 11, and turned himself in that day. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released without having to post bond, and suspended from his job without pay. His trial started on January 25, 2016. Liang was convicted of manslaughter and official misconduct on February 11, 2016. Liang now faced anywhere from no jail to a maximum of 15 years of prison when sentenced in April. His lawyers planned to submit an appeal to Judge Danny Chun while Liang remained free without bail. Delores Jones-Brown, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, speculated to The Atlantic that Liang would have avoided conviction had he rendered aid to Gurley, while jurors later reported that the effort required for them to pull the trigger on a police-issued pistol led them to disbelieve that Liang's testimony was completely true. Shaun Landau, the other officer involved, was not criminally implicated in Gurley's death. However, he was fired from the NYPD one day after his partner was convicted. Officer Landau, like Liang, was also within his two-year probationary period, and his firing after the trial was within his contract. Landau testified at the trial of his former partner under immunity from prosecution. Landau described his partner as \\"in shock\\" and that \\"[Liang] couldn't believe he just shot someone.\\" He said that neither of them tried to revive Mr. Gurley, with both of them saying that they did not feel qualified to perform CPR. According to Landau's words, that the instructor of the police academy that he and Liang graduated from, gave them the free pass to the course by helping them to cheat on the exams. Both radioed for an ambulance, as Gurley's girlfriend unsuccessfully performed CPR. On April 19, 2016, Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun sentenced Peter Liang to five years of probation and 800 hours community service. Chun believes incarceration is \\"unnecessary\\", but \\"he will be much more productive if he spends more time in community service.\\"  Arguments used in court  The Assistant District Attorney, Joseph Alexis, accused the killing as intentional‚ÄîLiang \\"chose\\" to place the finger on the trigger. However, one of Liang's defense attorneys, Rae Koshetz, argued that what had happened was a tragedy, not a crime, because Liang did not choose to point his gun at the victim, though the bullet bounced off the wall and coincidentally hit Akai Gurley, causing his death. Liang's attorneys, Robert Brown and Rae Koshetz, argued that Liang was in a \\"state of shock\\" after his gun went off, and did not realize that he hit anyone. The defendants also argued that Liang pulling out his gun was still falling in the line of protocol, because \\"lack of lighting is commonly perceived as a sign of criminal activity.\\" Furthermore, the light, as an answer to Kenneth P. Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney's, request, and had been out of service for number of days without repair. After Liang's bullet ricocheted off the wall and struck Akai Gurley in the chest, officer Liang and his partner Landau did not try to save the dying person who lay in the pool of his own blood. CPR was not performed while time passed.  Ending  In August, 2016, New York City reached a settlement with Akai Gurley's family with a fine about 4 million dollars, which was initially sued by Kimberley Ballinger, Akaila's mother, in November 2014. The New York Housing Authority paid 400,000 dollars, and former officer Liang paid 25,000 dollars. All this money will be placed on Akaila, Gurley's two-year-old daughter, but she does not have access to it until she turns 18, or having approval's from Court. After the settlement of Liang's trial, about 260,000 dollar funds were returned to the donors. About 325,000 dollars were given to Liang's family. About 80,000 dollars would be used for Chinese Communities. Media coverage The incident received national and international coverage, in part due to the time of its occurrence shortly after the August 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; the July 2014 death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, which also involved police officers; and the Ferguson unrest after Brown's fatal shooting, which had attracted public attention. The New York City Police Department's practice of vertical patrols was also criticized. The Village Voice described the incident as part of a year of public relations disasters for the NYPD. Other coverage has focused on the maintenance and public safety issues that led to the death.  Other influence  On the following Friday, February 12, 2016, Gurley's family, in a joint statement Friday, demanded 'The NYPD permanently end all vertical patrols and stop using the NYPD as your security.' They also requested for Landau to be fired from the department, and for the city to reinvest the fund in programs like \\"affordable housing\\", \\"community centers and after-school programs,\\" instead of using it to keep growing the base of NYPD officers.

Merrie Melodies color cartoon short directed by Arthur Davis. The short was released on August 23, 1947. Plot An insomniac fox is having trouble sleeping, and despite his best efforts (tossing and turning, clamping his eyes shut, etc), he simply cannot fall asleep. On accident, he stumbles across a book entitled \\"INSOMNIA AND ITS CURE\\", which tells him filling his pillow with duck feathers is essential for a good night's sleep. Upon the next morning, the fox heads out to capture himself a duck and soon comes across one. The duck, however, proves to be too much for the fox to handle, as he's constantly outsmarted and all his plans to capture him backfire at every turn. Frustrated, the fox tries one last ditch effort to capture the duck, who's flying just out of his reach. Using many boards and nails, he creates himself a crude wooden bridge to reach him, though the duck outsmarts him yet again by almost-completely sawing off the part of the tree the boards were attached to, leaving it on the verge of collapsing should even the slightest bit of movement be had... and as luck would have it, the bridge is balanced dangerously over a rather large ravine. Though he's frightened, the fox still persists on capturing the duck, who then lets loose one of his feathers onto the wooden bridge... which the extra weight proves to be just enough to cause it to collapse, along with the fox, who falls to his death. Satisfied, the duck starts to fly away, but he's stopped by the angel spirit of the now-dead fox. Panicked that the fox now has the ability to fly with his newly-gained angel wings, the duck quickly takes off into the distance with the fox following closely behind.

They comprise the Fisher‚ÄìWidom line, the Widom line, and the Frenkel line. Overview supercritical gas-liquid boundaries in pT diagram According to textbook knowledge, it is possible to transform a liquid continuously into a gas, without undergoing a phase transition, by heating and compressing strongly enough to go around the critical point. However, different criteria still allow to distinguish liquid-like and more gas-like states of a supercritical fluid. These criteria result in different boundaries in the pT plane. These lines emanate either from the critical point, or from the liquid‚Äìvapor boundary (boiling curve) somewhat below the critical point. They do not correspond to first or second order phase transitions, but to weaker singularities. The Fisher‚ÄìWidom line is the boundary between monotonic and oscillating asymptotics of the pair correlation function G(\\\\vec{r}). The Widom line is a generalization thereof, apparently so named by H. Eugene Stanley.Boston University Research Briefs (2003), http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/researchbriefs/display.php?id=659 However, it was first measured experimentally in 1956 by Jones and Walker, and subsequently named the 'hypercritical line' by Bernal in 1964, who suggested a structural interpretation. The Frenkel line is a boundary between \\"rigid\\" and \\"non-rigid\\" fluids characterized by the onset of transverse sound modes. One of the above mentioned criteria is based on the velocity autocorrelation function (vacf): below the Frenkel line the vacf demonstrates oscillatory behaviour, while above it the vacf monotonically decays to zero. The second criterion is based on the fact that at moderate temperatures liquids can sustain transverse excitations, which disappear upon heating. One further criterion is based on isochoric heat capacity measurements. The isochoric heat capacity per particle of a monatomic liquid near to the melting line is close to 3 k_B (where k_B is the Boltzmann constant). The contribution to the heat capacity due to the potential part of transverse excitations is 1 k_B . Therefore at the Frenkel line, where transverse excitations vanish, the isochoric heat capacity per particle should be c_V=2 k_B , a direct prediction from the phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics. \\"Phonon theory sheds light on liquid thermodynamics\\", PhysicsWorld, 2012 Another criterion for the Widom line is a peak in the isobaric heat capacity. In the subcritical region, the phase transition is associated with an effective spike in the heat capacity (i.e., the latent heat). Approaching the critical point, the latent heat falls to zero but this is accompanied by a gradual rise in heat capacity in the pure phases near phase transition. At the critical point, the latent heat is zero but the heat capacity shows a diverging singularity. Beyond the critical point, there is no divergence, but rather a smooth peak in the heat capacity; the highest point of this peak identifies the Widom line. Anisimov et al.

This kind of art became a way to address many women-related issues in Egypt that are not merely related to political developments, such as the status of women in society and sexual harassment. Notable female artists include Aya Tarek and Hend Kheera, while collaborations include Women on Walls and NooNeswa among others. Background=Voices in Street Art The public nature of street art provides a forum for those who are silenced by cultural or political oppression to be heard. Typically well planned and designed, street art is often created to send a message about a specific issue or topic. In a 2014 Al Jazeera article, Women on Walls founder Mia Grondahl states \\"Street art is all about \\"strengthening the people, being with the people, listening to the people.\\" Urban life is centered within the confines of the city's buildings, and the existence of street art makes witnessing the statements behind it unavoidable. As stated by Angie Balata, \\"Everyone who sees it receives the same message ‚Äî even those who don't necessarily want to receive it.\\" In societies where certain groups are not given equal footing in social and political settings, this alternative form of speech is an outlet for those voices. Street art and the revolution Before the revolution of 2011 in Egypt, street art was not a common presence. There were only a few artists using public space as a canvas prior to 2011. Before this time, street art was seen as a suspicious activity and could be stopped legally. The political revolution in Egypt was focused on overthrowing former president Hosni Mubarek. Street art at this time gave men and women a way to speak out against the military ruling. Since the end of the revolution, street art has continued to be a way for artists to protest. A couple common themes speak out against the Muslim Brotherhood and gender inequality. Street art, beginning with the Egyptian revolution, has even given way to collaborations such as Women on Walls (WOW) who focus specifically on women's rights statistics. One artist said, \\"If you want to tell people something in Egypt, you've got to tell them in the street.\\" Art has become the way to voice an opinion in Egypt. Women in street art Traditionally, Muslim women have been confined to the home and to private space, while public space has belonged to men. Street art gives women a voice in the public space that they have often been denied. Groups such as Noon El Neswa, NooNewsa, and Women on Walls have been running campaigns to claim a position for women in the public by bringing both women's artists and women's issues to the streets. Nawara Belal, a member of NooNewsa, stated, \\"Women are not comfortable in public spaces. We must feel that we belong there, that it's our zone.\\" In addition to groups there are many individual female artists operating in Egypt. Until recently, there were very few women or women-related issues depicted in street art, or, if there were, the women were depicted in an insulting way. Now, women in Egypt are using art that features women not only to comment on politics in Egypt, but also to address and raise awareness about issues directly affecting their lives. Common themes amongst these artists include the status of women in Egypt, gender disparities, and the high rates of sexual assault in the country. Important artists and collaborations=Aya Tarek According to the well-known Arab blogger, \\"Suzee in the City,\\" Aya Tarek is an Alexandrian street artist; one of the first recognized Egyptian street artists. She began her street artwork before the Egyptian revolution and refers to the street art as \\"an open gallery.\\" Hend Kheera Well known Egyptian street artist, Hend Kheera was an active participant in the first months of the Egyptian revolution. In her work Kheera questions the social norms in Egypt, discusses her personal experiences as a woman, and contributes to anti-sexual harassment campaigns. In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Kheera sympathized with the idea that street art has a strong voice, claiming \\"You write on a wall in the street to speak to people. In my opinion, a wall is more powerful than any media channel, for example, because you can't ignore it‚Ä¶By making graffiti in the streets [you] make people aware of what's happening.\\" Women on Walls WOW, began by Mia Grondahl and Angie Balata, focuses specifically on women's rights statistics and women's empowerment. They work with political, economical, social, and cultural topics. It began as a very small campaign and now has more than 60 artists working in both Egypt and Jordan. NooNewsa This group focuses on changing the attitude toward women in Egypt, through projects such as Graffiti Harimi (Female Graffiti), which aims to break social taboos. NooNewsa is dedicated to making women feel comfortable in public space. They want to give the people positive images of women and often use well-known female figures as subjects in their art.

The art fair dates back to the \\"Deutsche Kunst und Antiquit√§tenmesse\\" (German art and antiques fair) initiated by Otto Bernheimer in 1956. The event, located in the Munich Haus der Kunst, is held annually in the fall and runs for 10 days. The current initiators of the exhibition are 19 art dealers who have established themselves at The European Fine Art Fair (TEFAF) in Maastricht, Netherlands, over the last two decades.  History  The art collector and antique dealer Otto Bernheimer initiated the art and antique fair in 1956, at the beginning of the German economic boom and was elected president of the German art trade association. Until 1988 the art fair, which was regarded as the leading event of its kind in Germany, was held at the Haus der Kunst in Munich and later was moved to Messe M√ºnchen in Riem. Due to lack of attendance from both the public and retailers, the organizers began the search for a suitable alternative in the city center of Munich. The name of the exhibition, Kunstmesse M√ºnchen, was then passed on. In 2004 Konrad O. Bernheimer, grandson of Otto Bernheimer and Chairman of Pictura, the pictures department of TEFAF, launched the \\"Munich Highlights\\", which continues the tradition of trade from the original Munich art exhibition and its exhibitors. Art dealers and gallery owners shared their spaces around the Odeonsplatz in Munich with international colleagues and invited the audience to an artistic walk through Munich‚Äôs downtown. The name highlights was the focus on the new name of the exhibition \\"Highlights ‚Äì Internationale Kunstmesse M√ºnchen\\" in 2010, and with the change of location back to the Haus der Kunst, the exhibition returned to the traditional location in the Munich Prinzregentenstra√üe.

Set theory In set theory, Hamkins has investigated the indestructibility phenomenon of large cardinals, proving that small forcing necessarily ruins the indestructibility of supercompact and other large cardinals and introducing the lottery preparation as a general method of forcing indestructibility. Hamkins introduced the modal logic of forcing and proved with Benedikt L√∂we that if ZFC is consistent, then the ZFC-provably valid principles of forcing are exactly those in the modal theory known as S4.2. Hamkins, Linetsky and Reitz proved that every countable model of G√∂del-Bernays set theory has a class forcing extension to a pointwise definable model, in which every set and class is definable without parameters. Hamkins and Reitz introduced the ground axiom, which asserts that the set- theoretic universe is not a forcing extension of any inner model by set forcing. Hamkins proved that any two countable models of set theory are comparable by embeddability, and in particular that every countable model of set theory embeds into its own constructible universe. Philosophy of set theory In his philosophical work, Hamkins has defended a multiverse perspective of mathematical truth,J. D. Hamkins, The multiverse perspective on determinateness in set theory, talk at the Exploring the Frontiers of Incompleteness, Harvard University, October 19, 2011. video arguing that diverse concepts of set give rise to different set-theoretic universes with different theories of mathematical truth. He argues that the Continuum Hypothesis question, for example, \\"is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and as a result it can no longer be settled in the manner formerly hoped for.\\" (Hamkins 2012) Elliott Mendelson writes of Hamkins's work on the set-theoretic multiverse that, \\"the resulting study is an array of new fantastic, and sometimes bewildering, concepts and results that already have yielded a flowering of what amounts to a new branch of set theory. This ground-breaking paper gives us a glimpse of the amazingly fecund developments spearheaded by the author and...others...\\"Elliott Mendelson, Zentralblatt review of J. D. Hamkins, The set-theoretic multiverse, Review of Symbolic Logic, 5, No. 3, 416-449 (2012), . Infinitary computability Hamkins introduced with Jeff Kidder and Andy Lewis the theory of infinite-time Turing machines, a part of the subject of hypercomputation, with connections to descriptive set theory. In other computability work, Hamkins and Miasnikov proved that the classical halting problem for Turing machines, although undecidable, is nevertheless decidable on a set of asymptotic probability one, one of several results in generic-case complexity showing that a difficult or unsolvable problem can be easy on average. Group theory In group theory, Hamkins proved that every group has a terminating transfinite automorphism tower. With Simon Thomas, he proved that the height of the automorphism tower of a group can be modified by forcing. Infinite chess On the topic of infinite chess, Hamkins, Brumleve and Schlicht proved that the mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is decidable. Hamkins and Evans investigated transfinite game values in infinite chess, proving that every countable ordinal arises as the game value of a position in infinite three-dimensional chess.C. D. A.

History The faith community was reestablished in 1963, as parishioners from St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Dumfries and Pohick Episcopal Church purchased property below Bel Air, the historic former home of Parson Weems, rector of Dumfries parish after the American Revolutionary War and famous for his anecdotes concerning George Washington. The disestablishment of the Anglican church in Virginia in 1786, coupled with the Glebe Act of 1802 (which authorized the state to seize church property), had crippled the Anglican (now Episcopal) church in the state, and Parson Weems supported himself as a bookseller, as well as managed his wife's properties. Nonetheless, as (sub)urbanization spread after World War II, Prince William county once again could support a parish, and this parish first met in Fred Lynn Junior High School during construction.Don W.
