The monarch made St. Gilles the second capital of his country. That a Jew was in those times chosen to so high an office is a fact of some importance, as it goes far to show the position which the Jews occupied in southern France previous to the war with the Albigenses. The war lasted until 1229. Some scholars pretend to see in this Abba Mari the father of Isaac ben Abba Mari, the author of the 'I·π≠·π≠ur.

Biography According to Talmudic accounts, he took a very prominent part in the uprising against Rome in 70, being then at the head of the Zealots at Jerusalem. He was the nephew of Johanan ben Zakkai, at that time leader of the Peace party. After the Zealots had destroyed all storehouses, thus causing a famine in the besieged city, Johanan ben Zakkai invited Abba to an interview and asked him: \\"Why do you act in such a manner? Will you kill us by famine?\\" Abba replied: \\"What shall I do? If I tell them anything of the kind, they will slay me.\\" Thereupon Johanan said to him: \\"Try and invent for me some possibility of escape so that I may be able to save something out of the general wreck.\\" Abba complied with the request; and the Talmud gives a full account of the device by which he enabled his uncle to flee to the Romans. The historical character of this account is not beyond doubt, and it is especially surprising that Josephus knows nothing of Abba as leader of the Zealots. The fact that Josephus does not mention him, can not, however, be accepted as a sufficient proof against the Talmudic account, for he ignores also Johanan ben Zakkai, one of the most important and influential men at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple. Purely personal motives may have actuated the vainglorious historian to ignore both uncle and nephew. There exists, however, a Midrash which tends to show that there is at least a grain of truth in his account. In Ecclesiastes Rabbah 7:11 it is related: \\"There was at Jerusalem a certain Ben Ba·π≠ia·∏•, a nephew of Johanan ben Zakkai, who was in charge of the storehouses, which he destroyed by fire\\". This account is quite independent of that in the Talmud, since they differ not only with regard to the names, but also materially: for, whereas the Talmudic account states that Johanan escaped from Jerusalem by the aid of his nephew, it is related in the Midrash that he barely escaped death at the hands of his nephew. It might, therefore, be assumed that there existed a third and older source from which both the Talmudic and midrashic accounts were derived, and also that the traditions thus handed down underwent some change in the course of transmission.

Lope D√≠az III de Haro (b. ? ‚Äì d. June 8, 1288, Alfaro) was a Spanish noble and head of the House of Haro. He was the 8th Lord of Biscay, a post which he gained by hereditary means after the death of his father. He held that title from 1254 until his own death in 1288 where he died attempting to assassinate the King of Castile.  Family origins  He was son of Diego L√≥pez III de Haro and Constanza de Bearne. His maternal grandparents were the Vizconde Guillermo II de Bearne and his wife, Garsenda de Provenza. His paternal grandparents were Lope D√≠az II de Haro, also Lord of Biscay, and of Urraca Alfonso de Le√≥n, the illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. Lope was the oldest of 5 siblings which included Teresa de Haro, who merged the Haro family with the House of Lara, and Diego L√≥pez V de Haro who died during the Siege of Algeciras in 1310.  Biography  Lope took possession of the title of Biscay while still a minor after the death of his father. Due to the unnatural way in which his father died and the fact that his father had actively supported the overthrow of Alfonso X of Castile and had sworn allegiance to the King of Navarre, Lope's tutors brought the boy to Estella-Lizarra where he too offered his services to the Navarese King. After long, Lope was reconciled with Alfonso X who reinstated Lope as Lord of Haro, a privilege his father had lost the family. Lope entered the service of Fernando de la Cerda, the eldest son of King Alfonso X. Fernando however ended up dying in 1275, throwing into question his line of succession. Disputes arose between two of his sons; Alfonso de la Cerda and Sancho de la Cerda who began jockeying for power and influence to see who would gain power over the succession of the Castilian crown. Lope decided to throw his support behind Sancho which turned out to be a savvy move. On April 4, 1284, Alfonso X of Castile died and Sancho IV of Castile was named King of Castile. Sancho IV was married to Mar√≠a de Molina who was the sister of Don Lope Diaz' wife. This good fortune made Lope a very powerful man, earning the Lord of Biscay the additional titles of Mayordomo Real of the Kingdom, Caniller y Alf√©rez Mayor, and was given title of all the land from Burgos to Cantabria. In 1287, he was the regent of the Kingdom of Castile along with the Bishop of Astorga.  Death  Before long, the other nobles of Castile became envious of Lope's enormous power and began to take their issues up with the King. Things came to the breaking point on June 8, 1288 in a town in La Rioja called Alfaro. In a meeting with King Sancho IV, Lope D√≠az III de Haro got in an argument with Juan Alfonso L√≥pez de Haro I, a noble of the same House of Haro who held the title of Se√±or√≠o de Cameros. The argument allegedly resulted in Lope pulling out a knife and threatening the life of the King where after he was executed. The Spanish text of the incident from author Claudio S√°nchez-Albornoz y Mendui√±a is as follows.  Marriage and descendants  He married Juana Alfonso de Molina, daughter of Alfonso of Molina, niece of the King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n, and sister of the wife of King Sancho IV of Castile. He married Juana without the consent of the king which was considered a great affront at the time. The wedding took place at the Monasterio de Santa Mar√≠a y San Andr√©s and the following marriage brought two children: * Diego L√≥pez IV de Haro (b. ? ‚Äì d. 1289), who succeeded his father as Lord of Biscay and as head of the House of Haro. After his death, there was a struggle over the succession of the Lordship of Biscay between Diego's paternal uncle, Diego L√≥pez V de Haro, and his sister, Mar√≠a II D√≠az de Haro who was supported by her husband and King Alfonso X. * Mar√≠a II D√≠az de Haro (b. c. 1274 ‚Äì d. 1342), Married Juan de Castilla, hijo de Alfonso X of Castile, the King of Castile and Le√≥n. She became the Se√±ora de Vizcaya or Lady of Biscay in 1310, after the death of her paternal uncle Diego L√≥pez V de Haro, with whom she had been fighting for the title. Diego V was successful in his attempts to capture the lordship after the death of Diego L√≥pez IV de Haro. Maria was the mother of Juan de Haro 'el Tuerto' who was assassinated in Toro in 1326 by order of the King Alfonso XI de Castilla.

It is now served only by lines S1 and S 2 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station. Location Oeserstra√üe underpass The station is located in the district of Nied at the crossing of the Main-Lahn railway over the street of Oeserstra√üe. It forms the border between the boroughs of Nied-Nord and Nied-S√ºd and thus separates new developments to the south and traditional village architecture to the north. North-west of the station is Kahnplatz and Nied Cemetery. The station has a structural resemblance to Frankfurt-Sindlingen station: Oeserstra√üe passes through an underpass under the railway tracks, while foot traffic reaches the platforms by separate walkways and steps. There is a long-term plan to relocate the station from Oeserstra√üe to Mainzer Landstrasse to create a better connection to tram line 11. History Bus stop and covered bicycle rack The Main-Lahn Railway was opened through Nied in 1879. In 1888, the station was opened in the then independent village at the intersection with R√∂delheimer Stra√üe (now Oeserstra√üe). The small station building was soon insufficient and it was replaced in 1915 by a larger, prestigious building to the north-west of Oeserstra√üe. At the establishment of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn, the platforms were moved to the southeastern side of Oeserstra√üe and the station building lost its function. The level crossing on Oeserstra√üe was replaced by an underpass in 1988. The first covered bicycle rack in Frankfurt was established at Nied station in 1990; this launched the new concept of \\"bike and ride\\" for the promotion of the combination of public transport and cycling in Frankfurt. Since April 2008, the platforms have been equipped with digital passenger information displays. Operations The station is served by S-Bahn lines S 1 and S 2. The station is also served by bus line 59, which stops at the Nied Bahnhof/Lotzstra√üe and Nied Bahnhof/Friedhof bus stops. The night bus route N8 also stops at the two bus stops. The lines S1 and S2 normally operate at 30-minute intervals and hourly at times of low traffic, so that in combination trains run at 15 or 30 minute intervals. Both lines are reinforced during peak hours by services running from the west, which terminate above ground at Frankfurt Central Station, rather than running through the Frankfurt City Tunnel. Line S1 is also reinforced by such services at lunch time. The travel time to the city centre is about ten minutes.

The update was aimed at decreasing search engine rankings of websites that violate Google's Webmaster Guidelines by using now declared black-hat SEO techniques involved in increasing artificially the ranking of a webpage by manipulating the number of links pointing to the page. Such tactics are commonly described as link schemes. According to Google's John Mueller, as of 2013, Google announced all updates to the Penguin filter to the public. Effect on search results By Google's estimates,http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/another-step-to-reward- high-quality.html Penguin affected approximately 3.1% of search queries in English, about 3% of queries in languages like German, Chinese, and Arabic, and an even greater percentage of them in \\"highly spammed\\" languages. On May 25, 2012, Google unveiled another Penguin update, called Penguin 1.1. This update, according to Matt Cutts, former head of webspam at Google, was supposed to affect less than one-tenth of a percent of English searches. The guiding principle for the update was to penalize websites that were using manipulative techniques to achieve high rankings. Pre-Penguin sites commonly used negative link building techniques to rank highly and get traffic, once Penguin was rolled out it meant that content was key and those with great content would be recognised and those with little or spammy content would be penalised and receive no ranking benefits. The purpose per Google was to catch excessive spammers. Allegedly, few websites lost search rankings on Google for specific keywords during the Panda and Penguin rollouts. Google specifically mentions that doorway pages, which are only built to attract search engine traffic, are against their webmaster guidelines. In January 2012, the so- called Page Layout Algorithm Update (also known as the Top Heavy Update) was released, which targeted websites with too many ads, or too little content above the fold. Penguin 3 was released October 5, 2012 and affected 0.3% of queries. Penguin 4 (also known as Penguin 2.0) was released on May 22, 2013 and affected 2.3% of queries. Penguin 5 (also known as Penguin 2.1) was released on October 4, 2013, affected around 1% of queries, and has been the most recent of the Google Penguin algorithm updates. Google was reported to have released Penguin 3.0 on October 18, 2014. On October 21, 2014, Google's Pierre Farr confirmed that Penguin 3.0 was an algorithm \\"refresh\\", with no new signals added. On April 7, 2015, Google's John Mueller said in a Google+ hangout that both Penguin and Panda \\"currently are not updating the data regularly\\" and that updates must be pushed out manually. This confirms that the algorithm is not updated continuously which was believed to be the case earlier on in the year. The strategic goal that Panda, Penguin, and the page layout update share is to display higher quality websites at the top of Google's search results. However, sites that were downranked as the result of these updates have different sets of characteristics. The main target of Google Penguin is spamdexing (including link bombing). In a Google+ Hangout on April 15, 2016, John Mueller said \\"I am pretty sure when we start rolling out [Penguin] we will have a message to kind of post but at the moment I don't have anything specific to kind of announce.\\" = Penguin 4.0 (7th Penguin update) = On September 23, 2016 Google announced that Google Penguin was now part of the core algorithm meaning that it updates in real time. Hence there will not longer be announcements by Google relating to future refreshes. Real- time also means that websites are evaluated in real-time and rankings impacted in real-time. During the last years webmasters instead always had to wait for the roll-out of the next update to get out of a Penguin penalty. Also, Google Penguin 4.0 is more granular as opposed to previous updates, since it may affect a website on a URL-basis as opposed to always affecting a whole website. Finally, Penguin 4.0 differs from previous Penguin versions since it does not demote a web site when it finds bad links. Instead it discounts the links, meaning it ignores them and they no longer count toward the website's ranking. As a result of this, there is less need to use the disavow file. Google uses both algorithm and human reviewers to identify links that are unnatural (artificial), manipulative or deceptive and includes these in its Manual Actions report for websites. Google's Penguin feedback form Two days after the Penguin update was released Google prepared a feedback form, designed for two categories of users: those who want to report web spam that still ranks highly after the search algorithm change, and those who think that their site got unfairly hit by the update. Google also has a reconsideration form through Google Webmaster Tools. In January 2015, Google's John Mueller said that a Penguin penalty can be removed by simply building good links. The usual process is to remove bad links manually or by using Google's Disavow tool and then filing a reconsideration request. Mueller elaborated on this by saying the algorithm looks at the percentage of good links versus bad links, so by building more good links it may tip the algorithm in your favor which would lead to recovery.

Summary Once upon a time in Java, there was a poor widow named Mbok Srini that lived alone in her humble house on the edge of the jungle. She felt so lonely and prayed to the gods to bless her with a child. One night in her dream, she envisioned something wrapped under a tree of the jungle. She took this dream as an omen, an answer for her prayer. She later went to the jungle to search for something wrapped inside a cloth under a tree, she expected to find a baby to take care. Finally she discovered the object wrapped inside a cloth under the tree exactly as her vision in her dream. When she unwrapped it, there was no baby inside the wrapped cloth but only a seed of cucumber. Suddenly she heard a monstrous laughter; a green-skinned giant named Butho Ijo (in Javanese, means \\"Green Giant\\") appeared behind her. The green giant told her to plant the cucumber seed and she will have a child. She must nurture the child, however when the child had grown up, Mbok Srini must give the child back to Butho Ijo. The giant wished to eat the child. Eager to have a child, Mbok Srini agreed with Butho Ijo's deal. Mbok Srini returned to her home and planted the cucumber seed in an orchard behind her house. Later, a magical golden cucumber grew from its seed, and when Mbok Srini took the cucumber and opened it, a beautiful baby girl appeared inside it. Thus, she named the baby girl Timun Mas which means \\"golden cucumber\\". Year after year, Timun Mas grew to become a beautiful girl. She is a loving, kind and diligent child always willing to help and take care of an aging Mbok Srini. Just a week before Timun Mas' 17th birthday, Butho Ijo appeared in front of Mbok Srini's house and reminded her about her promise, and announces that within one week he will return to collect Timun Mas. Mbok Srini is so sad and fearful of the horrible fate that awaits her beloved child. Mbok Srini heard that there is a powerful rishi that resides in a mountain nearby. She hastily went to the mountain to seek help from a wise old hermit residing on said mountain. After hearing her story, the old hermit gave her four small bags of cloth with something inside it. The four objects inside the bags are cucumber seeds, needles, salts, and terasi (shrimp paste). The hermit told Mbok Srini to give these objects to Timun Mas and tell her to throw them when she is being chased by the giant. Mbok Srini returned home and told Timun Mas what to do if the green giant chased her. Finally on Timun Mas' 17th birthday, Butho Ijo appeared at Mbok Srini's house to take Timun Mas as promised: he will eat the girl. Mbok Srini ordered Timun Mas to run for her life. Timun Mas was really scared and terrified and ran as fast as she can to try to escape the giant. The giant was furious and destroyed Mbok Srini's house while chasing Timun Mas. Finally, Butho Ijo caught up to the fleeing Timun Mas. In distress, Timun Mas opened one of her four cloth bags spreading cucumber seeds behind her. Suddenly a large cucumber vine appeared and strangled the giant's body, trapping him so that he can‚Äôt move. This gave Timun Mas time to escape further. However the powerful giant finally managed to break free and continued his chase. Timun Mas opened her second bag and spread needles behind her. Suddenly the needles transformed into a bamboo forest with sharp tips that wounded the giant badly. The giant was badly wounded stuck with sharp bamboos, however he managed to get through the sharp bamboo forest and caught up to the running Timun Mas again. She opened her third bag and spread salts behind her back. Suddenly a sea appeared behind her drowning the evil giant. However the giant managed to swim through the sea and continued to chase her. Timun Mas, once again, almost got caught and opened her last bag. She threw the terasi behind her and continued to run desperately. Suddenly the terasi shrimp paste transformed into sea of boiling volcanic mud. Butho Ijo was stuck inside the boiling hot mud, drowned and died. Timun Mas finally survived and return to her mother Mbok Srini, and they lived happily ever after.

Gender policing serves to devalue or delegitimize expressions that deviate from normative conceptions of gender, thus reinforcing the gender binary. According to Judith Butler, rejection of individuals who are non-normatively gendered is a component of creating one's own gender identity. Gender mainstreaming is a public policy concept, whereas gender policing is a more general social phenomenon. It is common for normative gender performances of gender to be encouraged and rewarded, while non-normative performances are discouraged through punishment or generally negative reactions. Policing of non-normative performances ranges in intensity from relatively minor discouraging comments to brutal acts of violence. Tactics of gender policing also vary widely, depending in part on the perceived gender of the individual target. Heteronormativity and the gender binary Gender policing aims to keep gender roles rigid and aligned according to the gender binary. The gender binary is the idea that gender exists as the opposition between man and woman. Heteronormativity, as an institution, is an extension of this belief that posits that gender and sexuality are expressions of biology. This functionalism of biology asserts that male and female genitalia only serve the purpose of procreation, which creates gender roles that manifest from a perceived innate desire, giving sexuality a specific purpose within society. Gayle Rubin's writing in \\"The Traffic in Women\\" links the creation of the gender binary to the subordination of women in western society. Rubin studied the works of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and Claude L√©vi- Strauss to gain a better understanding of the creation of the \\"sex/gender system\\". Rubin found that \\"woman\\" was a role created in opposition to \\"man\\" and served the purpose of building power, trade relationships, and mutual aid through the exchange of women by marriage. These Kinship systems necessitated rules, which had to be policed to ensure their continued survival. These rules crystallized into heteronormativity, culturally instilling the rules for accepted sexuality in western society. The gender binary in western society was formalized from the interpretations of men and women during the hunter- gatherer ages. During this Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age in North-West Europe, hunting and gathering food was a prominent survival strategy. Early interpretations of these survival techniques is one of the main reasons for the current idea of the gender binary within western society. In his review of the ethnography of gathering shellfish, Clive Bonsall incorrectly presumed that women and children were primarily gatherers and men were the hunters due to their stronger skill set. These assumptions of past societies shaped the current structure of western society into the beliefs that men are the providers and women are the supporters. Additionally in the idea of heterosexual marriage as the societal norm came from the analysis of the interactions between different Mesolithic populations. Another mentality that strengthens the idea of binary gender within western society is the warrior- breeder relationship. In this mentality, masculinity is characterized by the traits of the model warrior: strong and fearless, yet disposable. Meanwhile, femininity and womanhood revolve around reproduction. In this relationship, there are only two types of people; therefore, two genders. This dichotomy is valued because it keeps society safe in times of war. The warriors fight and protect while the breeders replace the fallen warriors. From the works of LGB activism during the late 1980s to 1990s, the queer theory was created along with the influential work of Foucault and Sedgewick. The queer theory creates a space outside the gender binary. This theory deconstructs and discredits the idea of a gender binary. Disregarding the gender binary caused fears within the western society, ultimately leading to gender policing in order to maintain the idea of binary gender. Man and woman as categories can not exist without the other to enforce what they are and are not. The same can be said of heterosexuality and homosexuality. These categories are created out of their opposition, forming power dynamics. Michel Foucault referred to this creation of identities, through creating discourse surrounding the ideal, as reverse discourse. This antagonistic relationship between identities is the basis for gender policing. Deviation from normative expression, of either gender or sexuality, is often met with varying degrees violence.Spargo, Tamsin. Post Modern Encounters Foucault and Queer Theory. New York: Totem, 1999. Print. Patriarchy and hegemonic masculinity Patriarchal societies perpetuate masculine dominance in all aspects of life. Patriarchy privileges masculine thought and expression creating a gender hierarchy where women and the feminine are subordinated. The concept of hegemonic masculinity describes a hierarchy even within masculinity itself. Hegemonic masculinity allows for the terms and expression of masculinity to be renegotiated according to time, culture, and class status, allowing for the rationalization of its continued dominance. Pdf. Sociologist, Raewyn Connell created the theory of hegemonic masculinity in order to explain the relationships between men and women and between the class of men within a patriarchal system. This theory is based on Antonio Gramsci's concept of hegemony ‚Äì‚Äì conformity or subordination of one group which creates class-based domination. Connell's theory explains the ways in which ideal or normalized masculine traits have the highest values in western society. These masculine attributes include wealth, control over resources, fertility, attractiveness, heterosexuality, physical strength, and emotional detachment. Demetrakis Z. Demetriou further divided hegemonic masculinity into two types: external and internal. External hegemonic masculinity refers to the subordination of women under men. Internal hegemonic masculinity is the spectrum of masculinity seen within men. This spectrum is defined by the amount of power and masculinity a man holds. The patriarchy needs hegemonic masculinity in order to maintain power. In order to keep this power, men must be policed and women must be dominated. Since the ideal form of masculinity is seen by patriarchal power, men that fit in this norm are seen as what a human should embody. The gender hierarchy created by patriarchy and hegemonic masculinity creates competition for dominance resulting in the policing of gender and sexuality. Policing of masculinity in a heteronormative society reinforces the gender binary. Individuals seeking to reaffirm their position in a masculine hierarchy seek out and police individuals performing inadequately. Those performing inadequately must either conform to the accepted forms of gender and sexual expression or risk violence and ostracism. Fathers are more likely than mothers to enforce gender boundaries, or police the gendered expressions of their children. Second, both fathers and mothers enforce gender boundaries more frequently with sons than with daughters. Research on the topic of parental gender policing has shown that female children who display traditionally masculine traits or behaviors receive more social and parental acceptance than male children who exhibit traditionally feminine tendencies. Many scholars on the subject argue that this is due to the greater value assigned to \\"masculine\\" traits or behaviors compared to \\"feminine\\" ones, and/or beliefs that \\"tomboyism\\" is temporary. At least one study indicates that parents across various social locations celebrate and encourage their preschool age daughters to engage in gender nonconformity, such as wearing sports-themed clothing and participating in traditionally male activities. However, other research indicates that in part due to peer and parental pressures, \\"tomboys\\", or female children with \\"masculine\\" traits or behavioral tendencies, frequently either abandon these tendencies in adolescence, or adopt a more feminine performance but retain many masculine skills and traits. Pressures to conform to gender norms increase with age, and often manifest in these children being \\"instructed or shamed to conform to traditional femininity ‚Äì in dress, appearance, posture, manner, interests, and dating.\\" Psychoanalysis Fields of knowledge that claim to be universal are still created within societal frameworks that have their own rules and biases. A patriarchal society gives privilege to masculine thought and excludes other points of view and histories. All discourse created in a patriarchal society can be said to acquiesce to hegemonic masculinity. Michel Foucault viewed Psychoanalysis as a secular confession concerned with finding our natural sexual selves. The problem, Foucault argued, is that sexuality is cultural and any narrative created around it gives the subject the illusion of identity rather than experience. Psychoanalysis conducted in a hetero-normative society would view any deviation as a failing to achieve that ideal. Rather than someone being seen as performing an act, they would be seen as embodying that which society deemed inadequate. Gayle Rubin wrote about Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory in \\"The Traffic In Women\\". Rubin states that Jacques Lacan's analysis of Freud views the Oedipus complex as the crisis experienced by a child when internalizing kinship rules. The child becomes aware of the sex/gender system and organizes itself accordingly. Neurosis is seen as having an understanding of this system yet failing to adapt to it. Lacan's separation of the Phallus from the physical penis elucidates societies privileging of the masculine and gender's separation from biology. In Rubin's view psychiatry further policed accepted gender and sexual expression by deeming non normative behavior as mentally and emotionally stunted. Rubin also saw that this system of internalizing norms privileged heterosexual masculinity while outlining the psychic oppression society inflicts on women and femininity. Intersectionality  Gender policing affects different social identifications in different ways. Along with gender, characteristic attributes such as race, gender identity, class, sexual orientation, age, religion, creed, and disability interact with each other and are affected differently by gender policing. The effect of intersection of these social categories are studied in intersectionality theory. Understanding intersectionality within gender policing can be done by tracing back and analyzing the relation between race and gender in history. Race and gender over time produced hierarchies within themselves. Similar to the way the classification of \\"man\\" cannot exist without \\"woman\\", \\"white\\" people cannot exist without \\"black\\" people. Race as a classification arose from European capitalist colonialism. European colonists deemed those who weren't \\"white\\", primitive and deserving of domination and \\"civilizing\\". Global colonialism by European capitalists imposed European ways of knowing and being on the peoples they colonized. This included a racialized and patriarchal conception of gender. The view of colonized peoples as primitive created a distinction between \\"white\\" (human) and \\"black\\" (property or inhuman). The view of \\"black\\" as other than human excluded \\"black\\" people from classifications of gender. In western society, being \\"white\\" and middle class continue to inform gender norms, leaving \\"non-white\\" people unable to perform accepted femininity or masculinity. In modern-day times, intersectionality now touches upon various other forms of human characterizations, affecting people in countless different ways. How a white transgender woman may experience gender policing is going to differ greatly from how an Asian heterosexual woman might (etc.). Socialization An individual's expression of gender is often first policed by their parent(s), as well as other elder authorities such as teachers and day care providers, at a very young age. Gender policing is part of the process of \\"gendering\\" children, or socializing them in a way considered conventionally appropriate to their assigned sex. Once children are taught gender norms and experience their enforcement, they are likely to begin policing others ‚Äì both their peers and their elders. = Early childhood = Gender policing begins with gender enforcing from parents teaching their children what is \\"masculine\\" and what is \\"feminine\\" in the traditional sense of these terms. These traditional ideas of gender are reinforced through practices such as referring to children as \\"boys\\" and \\"girls\\" which \\"makes sex/ gender the central component of how kids think of themselves, understand their social group, and view themselves through their parents‚Äô eyes.\\" As Jane Ward, professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies at University of California, Riverside, writes in her chapter of the book Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting Practices, even parents who hope to redefine \\"boyhood\\" or \\"girlhood\\" (such as through allowing a \\"tomboy\\" daughter, or dressing a son in dresses, for example), still reinforce the concept of gender as a binary which is biologically determined. The gender binary is already enforced in obvious places, such as in the segregation of toys in stores, for example. Ethnographic research in preschools has also contributed to the body of knowledge related to gender policing. This research has suggested that teachers give their students gendered instructions about what to do with their bodies. Across several schools, teachers gave boys explicit bodily instructions more frequently than girls, indicating that boys' bodies are policed more often than girls'.Martin, K. 1998. Becoming a Gendered Body: Practices of Preschools. American Sociological Review, 63(4), 494-511. However, this may be because teachers were more forceful with their instructions to girls, who were also usually quicker to follow instructions, thus teachers did not need to repeat themselves as often. Teachers were also more likely to direct boys to cease behaviors (e.g. running, throwing objects), whereas they were more apt to instruct girls to alter them. For example, girls were given directive bodily instructions such as \\"talk to her, don't yell, sit here, pick that up, be careful, be gentle, give it to me, put it down there.\\" As a result, a wider range of potential activities is available to boys than girls, because although they are dissuaded from some, they are not directed to engage in specific activities as often as girls are. According to Martin, the scholar and sociologist who conducted this research, \\"Gendering of the body in childhood is the foundation on which further gendering of the body occurs throughout the life course. The gendering of children's bodies makes gender differences feel and appear natural, which allows for such bodily differences to emerge throughout the life course.\\" Relatively recent efforts have been made to limit gender policing, particularly in childhood. Sweden's reformation of their school system in 1962 resulted in a new curriculum which included objectives to limit gender policing in early education. Within this new curriculum it was determined that \\"Pre-schools should work to counteract traditional gender and gender roles. Girls and boys in pre-schools should have the same opportunities to try and develop their abilities and interests without being limited by stereotyped gender roles.\\" These preschools, elementary, and secondary schools aim to reduce the gender policing placed onto children, but through doing this must show how teachers and other pedagogical adults may accidentally reinforce gender stereotypes. Tools teachers use to combat this include practices such as keeping journals and videotaping classroom interactions (a practice proposed by Susanne Rithander). A general pedagogical practice in these Swedish schools in called compensatory pedagogy, which plays off the idea that, per traditional gender roles, boys are encouraged to maintain autonomy while girls are encouraged to maintain closeness with others. Compensatory pedagogy challenges these traditional gender roles by encouraging girls to maintain autonomy and boys to build closeness with others. Some parents have attempted to limit gender policing through their parenting styles, as is the case with Storm's parents, who chose not to gender their child but instead to wait until their child could decide for themself. Unlike the relative success so far of Swedish schools in limiting gender policing, individual efforts by Kathy and David, Storm's parents, faced huge media backlash. In the chapter titled Get Your Gender Binary Off My Childhood!: Towards a Movement for Children πs Gender Self-Determination, Ward shows how Storm's parents were often called deceitful and manipulative, as Ward puts it, \\"For not revealing what they knew about Storm‚Äôs genitals, Kathy and David were accused of hiding Storm‚Äôs very selfhood.\\" = Adolescence = Adolescence is a developmental stage in which peer groups are especially important, and peer relationships take primacy over familial relationships. It is also a stage during which gender policing amongst peers becomes increasingly common. Adolescents have already been introduced, during childhood, to normative gender expressions and social expectations therein by elders. These expectations are then reinforced during adolescence, largely by peers gender policing one another. In this (and every) stage of development, gender policing is especially prevalent in explicitly gendered environments, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams. Dude, You're a Fag, a book by CJ Pascoe, examines masculinity and gender policing in high schools through ethnographic research. Pascoe largely focuses on high school boys' use of the fag epithet to establish their own masculinity by questioning or challenging others'. In this context, the use of the fag epithet is a form of gender policing, frequently applied to boys who lack heterosexual prowess or are deemed inadequately masculine or strong. According to Pascoe, \\"[the fag identity] is fluid enough that boys police their behaviors out of fear of having the fag identity permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it\\".Dude You're A Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School (2007), by C.J. Pascoe. A study of male students of a co-educational, Catholic high school demonstrates insights from adolescent males themselves in regard to gender policing. This study highlights the gender policing of males by each other through exploring the types of bullying being practiced. Forms of bullying (and gender policing) come from accusations of males being homosexual. One participant in the study explains that he was bullied for dancing ballet and described his bullying as \\"Just a lot to do with being a woman\\", thus showing an association of specific activities with a specific gender (and that deviance from typical gender roles proves a perceived grounds for bullying). Through the practice of conducting interviews, the study briefly explores an observed policing of male behavior by females. One interviewee \\"appears to be drawing attention to the different norms for governing the conduct of girls who police boys‚Äô bullying practices through a condemnation of violent behaviors\\". Interviewees also draw attention to the confirmation and reinforcement of attitudes and practices considered \\"masculine\\" within males. In addition, these \\"masculine\\" identifiers are further enforced through female interaction and confirmation. In conducting these interviews, it is also found how adolescents view the stereotypical concept of masculinity as a concept which is ingrained early on in their lives and ‚Äúpassed on from their fathers\\". = Adulthood = During adulthood, gender policing generally becomes more subtle. However, for an individual whose gender is perceived as ambiguous, blatant forms still exist. These range from curious inquiries by children (e.g. \\"Are you a boy or a girl?\\") to gender policing in bathrooms (discussed in the following section). People who are gender-normative in appearance experience primarily behavioral gender policing, such as reminders to act in a more (or less) feminine or masculine manner. Men are more often dissuaded and shamed for feminine behavior than women are for masculine behavior. It is theorized that this is due, at least in part, to the higher societal value of masculinity. Gender policing has been reinforced in adults for many years. As Angela Y. Davis points out, early women's prisons relied on gender policing as a means of reformation. The first women's reformatory in the U.S. opened in Indiana and included areas designed as kitchens, living rooms, and nurseries. The idea was to train women about domesticity through activities such as cooking, sewing, and cleaning. Sex testing and verification in sports and athletics shows gender policing as a practice still relevant to many countries and athletic organizations in recent history. In the case of the nineteen-year-old Missouri runner Helen Stephens in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, who finished first place in the 100-meter race, many questioned her sex because they could not fathom the concept of a woman running so quickly. Sex testing and verification has existed throughout human history, even being traced back to practices in ancient Greek contests. Within these Greek traditions, women were deterred from participation and even spectatorship at times. In the examples of both Greek practices and the story of Helen Stephens of Missouri, it can be seen how women are often more likely to be subject to sex verification processes and accusations of deceit (i.e. women are often accused of actually being men disguised as women; men are not often accused of being women disguised as men). Transgender, androgynous, and gender non-conforming individuals The severity of gender policing is often proportional to the extremity of non-normativity. For example, transgender individuals are likely to be victims of the most extreme and violent forms of gender policing. Research regarding conformity pressures and gender resistance among transfeminine individuals (those who are assigned the male sex at birth but identify as more feminine than masculine) indicates that these persons experienced \\"intense and pervasive\\" pressures to conform to traditional masculinity, and feared exposure of their gender identity would result in physical danger or loss of legal, economic, or social standing.Gagn√©, P., & Tewksbury, R. 1998. Conformity Pressures and Gender Resistance among Transgendered Individuals. Social Problems, 45(1), 81-101. Thus, transgender individuals must often choose between self-preservation and expressing their self-identified gender. Gender policing is especially prevalent in bathrooms due to the increased salience of gender in explicitly gendered environments (and the forced binary of \\"men\\" and \\"women\\"). While this issue is frequently encountered by transgender and genderqueer individuals, to a lesser extent, it is also experienced by persons with androgynous or gender ambiguous appearances. For individuals with non-normative gender identities, the choice of which bathroom to use is often laden with \\"anxiety, ambivalence, and anticipated harassment.\\"Embodied Resistance: Challenging the Norms, Breaking the Rules (2011), edited by C. Bobel and S. Kwan. It is not uncommon for gender-normative people to alert security of the presence of transgender (or androgynous) individuals in a bathroom, regardless of whether the bathroom they are using conforms to their sex or to their gender identity. According to Jack Halberstam, the main distinction between gender policing in the women's room and in the men's room is that in the former, not only trans women, but all gender ambiguous females are scrutinized, whereas in the latter, biological males are less frequently deemed out of place.Female Masculinity (1998), by Judith Halberstam. Further, compared to trans women in the women's room, trans men in the men's room are likely to be less scrutinized because men are less vigilant about intruders than women. However, a trans man in the men's room is more likely to be met with violence if he does not succeed in passing. trans women and trans men are ‚Äúsix times more likely to experience discrimination‚Äù than non-trans people. Over 2,000 incidents of anti-LGBT hate crimes were reported to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs in 2013. In 2014, there was a national study of trans violence discovered with the results of ‚Äú53% of respondents reporting verbal assault and 8% physical assault in a place of public accommodation‚Äù. As a site where gender norms are policed, bathrooms are the most common public accommodation where trans people and gender non-conforming people experience hate violence. People tend to believe that there is a connection between genitals and gender. Therefore, the gender segregation of bathrooms is based on genital configuration. Because of this ‚Äúmatch‚Äù between genitals and gender, trans people often are labeled as ‚Äúdeceivers‚Äù and blamed for the violence. When a trans or androgynous person is questioned in the bathroom, the reaction is ‚Äúnot to reassess the arbitrary nature of segregating bathrooms by sex but to violently eject the trans or gender non-conforming person‚Äù. Using a public bathroom is no longer a simple matter for trans and gender non-conforming people. As of March 2017, 19 states (California, Nevada, Hawaii, New York, etc.), the District of Columbia and over 200 cities have enforced the anti-discrimination law toward transgender people allowing them to use any public restroom that corresponds to their gender. Also, most public accommodations changed their restroom signs where there are both genders and the text ‚ÄúGender Neutral Restroom‚Äù or ‚ÄúInclusive Restroom‚Äù. This law was passed because of the March 2016 ‚ÄúBathroom Bill‚Äù in North Carolina. The bill argued that banning people from using public restrooms of their choice due to the biological sex listed on their birth certificates (genitals vs. gender) was unreasonable, therefore, it launched transgender rights into the national spotlight.  Fashion and modern opposition to gender policing  In 1924, gender norms accepted and reinforced ideologies that shadowed Freud's hegemonic thesis that ‚Äúbiology is the key determinant of gender identity‚Äù. These norms were imbedded into cultural regularity, affecting gender identity in everyday life, law and politics. Gender policing strategies enforced these norms, and a prevalent tactic was to use culturally obligatory dress codes as a tool in forcing people into gender binaries. However progressive movements throughout history have worked vigorously to defy policing, combating restrictive norms through disregard and reformation of policed gender standards. Following of Freud's theory has steadily begun to dwindle and new studies are beginning to reveal a popular uprising theory that individuals make their own decisions as to which gender distinctions apply to them. Modern opposition of gender norms are erasing the aged policing of conforming to the standards of one's sex. According to a study by Intelligence Group, a consumer insights company, ‚ÄúMore than two- thirds of people ages 14 to 34 agree that gender does not have to define a person in the way that it used to‚Ä¶ and 6 in 10 say that men and women do not need to conform to traditional gender roles or behaviors anymore.‚Äù = Gendered clothing laws and ordinances = Older fashion protocols systematically enforced normative gender binaries, confining people to dress and accessorize in a way that connected to their sex. Society would use gender policing tactics to enforce cultural and societal acceptance of a gendered dress code. The earliest gendered clothing ordinance in the United States was enacted in Columbus, Ohio in 1848.\\"PBS News Hour\\" The ordinance forbade someone from appearing, \\"in a dress not belonging to his or her sex.\\" In the 19th century, forty American cities passed anti-drag and anti-crossdressing ordinances. Article in \\"The Advocate\\" These ordinances often adopted language invoking public indecency, such as St. Louis's 1864 law which stated: ‚ÄúWhoever shall, in this city, appear in any public place in a state of nudity, or in a dress not belonging to his or her sex, or in an indecent or lewd dress... shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.‚Äù Other ordinances were couched in terms of public safety. An 1845 New York state statute, for example, defined an unlawful vagrant as ‚Äú[a] person who, having his face painted, discolored, covered, or concealed, or being otherwise disguised, in a manner calculated to prevent his being identified, appears in a road or public highway.‚Äù Many gendered clothing laws from the early 20th century focused particularly on forbidding people assigned male at birth from dressing in women's clothing. Such sex-specific laws were passed in Detroit, Michigan in 1944, in Denver Colorado in 1954, and in Miami, Florida in 1965. In the latter half of the 20th century, some crossdressing laws were challenged on the basis of their ambiguity and difficulty of enforcement. The Supreme Court of Ohio saw the 1975 case Columbus v Rogers, which challenged and overturned the city's ordinance. Ohio Supreme Court Justice O'Neill wrote that the ordinance was, \\"unconstitutionally void for vagueness, because it does not provide adequate standards by which activity can be determined as legal or illegal.\\" He clarified later in his opinion, \\"Modes of dress for both men and women are historically subject to changes in fashion. At the present time, clothing is sold for both sexes which is so similar in appearance that a person of ordinary intelligence might not be able to identify it as male or female dress.\\" Case Text for Columbus v Rogers = Using fashion in modern opposition = This reformation campaign against gender policed conformity has found a focus in developing cultural acceptance for fluidity in modern cultural dress codes. Nowadays decisions on gender identity are seen as self made and a form of ‚Äúself expression‚Äù. A prevalent way of expressing one's identity and not conforming to gender norms is through personal choice in style. These choices include apparel, accessories and beauty habits. Style has a ‚Äúsymbolic meaning‚Äù of self expression, ‚Äúgiving us a means to cultivate our own visions of the culture we experience around us‚Äù. Therefore, fashion nonconformity has expansively become wonted and accepted by a rising number of millennials who believe in bending past policed gendered binaries. They do this by ignoring the outdated dress codes that were previously used to confine someone to their gender identity. In disregarding a dress code that has been used as a weapon in enforcing gender binary, millennials have found a powerful opposition to gender policing. Modern gender-specific fashion has become more flexible to personal preference, becoming visibly more directed against old gendered style constraints. The refusal to conform to the rules of outdated fashion protocol is being embraced by a la mode fashion and mainstream style. A recent pattern in clothing and accessories that transcend gender style norms has become steadily vogue and evidently pioneering fashion trends have increasingly grown accepting to the fusion of normally gender specific style details. Trendy nonconforming styles empower women to dress in an inclusively ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù manner and enable men to adapt ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù attributes in their style, for example women choosing to wear suits to work, or men wearing nail polish, etc.  See also * Anti-gender movement * Childhood gender nonconformity * Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women * Eleno de C√©spedes * Gender representation in video games * Machismo * Masculism * Sex and gender distinction * Sociology of gender * Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer References Category:Gender nonconformity Category:Sexism ","title":"Gender policing"},{"id":"35757213","text":"Greer is an unincorporated community in Mason County, West Virginia.

Zajkov, Physics Institute, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Macedonia.) In electromagnetism, √òrsted's law, also spelled Oersted's law, is the physical law stating that an electric current creates a magnetic field. This was discovered on 21 April 1820 by Danish physicist Hans Christian √òrsted (1777‚Äì1851),H. A. M. Snelders, \\"Oersted's discovery of electromagnetism\\" in when he noticed that the needle of a compass next to a wire carrying current turned so that the needle was perpendicular to the wire. √òrsted investigated and found the physical law describing the magnetic field, now known as √òrsted's law. √òrsted's discovery was the first connection found between electricity and magnetism, and the first of two laws that link the two; the other is Faraday's law of induction. These two laws became part of the equations that govern electromagnetism, Maxwell's equations. √òrsted's rules √òrsted found that, for a straight wire carrying a steady direct current (DC): *The magnetic field lines encircle the current-carrying wire. *The magnetic field lines lie in a plane perpendicular to the wire. *If the direction of the current is reversed, the direction of the magnetic field reverses. *The strength of the field is directly proportional to the magnitude of the current. *The strength of the field at any point is inversely proportional to the distance of the point from the wire. Direction of the magnetic field Using the right hand rule to find the direction of the magnetic field The direction of the magnetic field at a point, the direction of the arrowheads on the magnetic field lines, which is the direction that the \\"north pole\\" of the compass needle points, can be found from the current by the right-hand rule. If the right hand is wrapped around the wire so the thumb points in the direction of the current (conventional current, flow of positive charge), the fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. Vector form of the law The above rules can be generalized to give the modern vector form of √òrsted's law > The line integral of the magnetic field \\\\mathbf{B}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\, around any > closed curve C\\\\, is proportional to the total current I\\\\, passing through > any surface bounded by the curve. :\\\\oint_C \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell} = \\\\mu_0 I\\\\, where \\\\mu_0\\\\, = 4œÄ√ó10‚àí7 V¬∑s/(A¬∑m) is the magnetic constant, and the direction of integration around C\\\\, is related to the direction of current by the right hand rule. The law can be expressed in terms of the current density \\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\, through the surface S\\\\, instead of the total current I\\\\, through it :\\\\oint_C \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell} = \\\\mu_0 \\\\iint_S \\\\mathbf{J} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{S}\\\\, where S\\\\, is any surface spanning C\\\\,. √òrsted's law only holds for steady currents, which don't change with time. Therefore, it only holds for DC electric circuits, with no capacitors or inductors. It can be seen that it fails for time varying currents by considering the case of a circuit consisting of a battery charging a capacitor through a resistor. It can be verified experimentally that the current in this circuit creates a magnetic field, yet any closed curve encircling the conductor can be spanned by a surface passing between the capacitor plates, through which no current passes, from which the equation would give zero magnetic field. √òrsted's law was modified by Maxwell to cover the case of time-varying currents by adding a new source term called displacement current, giving the Ampere‚ÄìMaxwell equation.

In 2009 representatives from across the TV industry identified key areas where they felt the broadcasters could undertake work that would make a real difference in the transition to digital production, ideally helping TV producers and post-production houses overcome the complexities and get to the benefits of digital working more quickly.UK Broadcasters team up for Digital Production Partnership The areas identified formed the basis for the DPP's working groups, drawing on industry experts from all areas of TV production and technology. This included work on common technical and metadata standards for digital TV production and sharing best practice in digital production across the industry. From 1 April 2015 the DPP became a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee: Digital Production Partnership Ltd.DPP Becomes Digital Production Partnership Ltd To date, the DPP has been funded by the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. These broadcasters continue to provide lead funding, but becoming a Membership organisation means the DPP is now more directly accountable to all those it works on behalf of, from across the whole industry. It continues to be core to the purpose of the DPP to reduce complexity and increase interoperability across the industry ‚Äì everywhere. The DPP works closely with trade bodies such as AMWA (Advanced Media Workflow Association) in the US, EBU (European Broadcasting Union),UK file format deal benefits from EBU groundwork UK Screen (Post Production representatives) and the PMA (Production Managers Association) to articulate the needs of the UK TV production industry. The DPP has also shared their portfolio of industry standards and guidelines with the BBC Academy College of Technology and Creative Skillset's media academies in order to help train digital television programme makers.DPP Shares Findings  Technical & Metadata Standards  In March 2011 the DPP created common technical standards for tape delivery of HDTV and SDTV programmes to all major UK broadcasters at the time.Top UK broadcasters unveil digital production partnership UK TV producers now have one set of guidelines that cover technical specifications, picture and sound quality for delivery to ITV, BBC, Channel 4, Sky, Channel 5, BT Sport and S4C. In January 2012 the DPP announced that these broadcasters had also agreed the UK‚Äôs first common file format, structure and wrapper to enable TV programme delivery by digital file.Broadcasters unveil new standards for file based delivery The guidelines complement the common standards for tape delivery of HD and SD TV programmes and endeavour to avoid a situation where a number of different file types and specifications proliferate. The inclusion of editorial and technical metadata creates a consistent set of information for the processing, review, and scheduling of programmes, as well as their onward archiving, sale and distribution across the television industry. These standards do not prescribe the suitability of particular cameras, or post- production technologies, as these can vary from production to production and remain subject to discussion between producer and broadcaster. In October 2012 the DPP standards were updated to include guidelines for live programme delivery via satellite, fibre and microwave links. The use of MPEG-4 is recommended in these standards due to its superior quality over MPEG-2 for a given data rate.DPP Launches Live Technical Standards The Advanced Media Workflow Association (AMWA) in the US worked with the DPP to create AS-11, a new international file format for HD Files.AMWA releases AS-11 MXF for contribution The DPP guidelines require files delivered to UK broadcasters to be compliant with a specified subset of this new, international standard. In September 2012 the DPP released a downloadable metadata application, developed in order to enable standardised editorial & technical metadata to be delivered with completed MXF programme files. This is intended to be an interim measure until equipment and system suppliers are able to offer this functionality within their systems.Digital Production Partnership Unveils New Metadata Application An update to the DPP Technical Standards (v4.0), the DPP Metadata Application (v1.2) & the AMWA specification in October 2013 includes audio production to the EBU R128 loudness specifications along with other changes such as guidance on use for UHD (4K) cameras and an addition for the carriage of multichannel audio metadata within a programme file.DPP Updates File Based Standards In Jan 2016 the DPP released Common Technical Delivery Standards for High Definition Commercials/Sponsorship and Promotions/Presentation material. and their first future-focused standard, a technical standard for the delivery of Ultra High Definition (UHD) programmes. However, the DPP \\"standards\\" are a misnomer; they are actually recommended practices. To be a standard they would have to be approved and certified by an organisation such as ISO or ANSI and follow the practices that other standards bodies in the industry such as IEEE, SMPTE and others adhere to.  Compliance Programme  The DPP launched a Compliance Programme in Mar 2014DPP Compliance Programme to help the industry identify trusted products, such as Vidchecks Vidchecker software, which work with AS-11 DPP files and to speed the implementation of the file-based delivery process by ensuring products can correctly create, read and / or process files which meet the AS-11 DPP standard. The DPP worked closely with the Advanced Media Workflow Association (AMWA) to develop a testing and certification process. This focuses on testing product conformance to the UK DPP Shims of the AMWA AS-11 Specification (beginning with AS-11 DPP HD).  Progress of Digital TV Production in the UK  During 2012/13 ITV, BBC, and Channel 4 began to take delivery of programmes on file on a selective basis. In September 2013 the DPP announced that File based delivery would become the preferred delivery format for these broadcasters from 2014 and on 1 October 2014 end-to-end digital finally became a reality. The DPP continues to work on various subjects including connectivity; news exchange; a mastering format; Live IP Production; standards of trust and international exchange.  International Adoption  Although the DPP is formed of broadcasters from the UK, international interest in the work undertaken by the industry partnership is growing rapidly. For example, work is ongoing by the AMWA to create a standard called AS-11 NA (North America).AMWA Newsletter Also, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation NRK has based its latest Technical Standards document on the DPP standards.NRK Technical Standards In 2015 the DPP starting working with the North American Broadcasters Association (NABA) on a common standard for delivery across North America, for publication during 2016.

The first stage of business analytics is descriptive analytics, which still accounts for the majority of all business analytics today. Descriptive analytics looks at past performance and understands that performance by mining historical data to look for the reasons behind past success or failure. Most management reporting ‚Äì such as sales, marketing, operations, and finance ‚Äì uses this type of post-mortem analysis. Prescriptive Analytics extends beyond predictive analytics by specifying both the actions necessary to achieve predicted outcomes, and the interrelated effects of each decisionThe next phase is predictive analytics. Predictive analytics answers the question what is likely to happen. This is when historical data is combined with rules, algorithms, and occasionally external data to determine the probable future outcome of an event or the likelihood of a situation occurring. The final phase is prescriptive analytics, which goes beyond predicting future outcomes by also suggesting actions to benefit from the predictions and showing the implications of each decision option. Prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen. Further, prescriptive analytics suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and shows the implication of each decision option. Prescriptive analytics can continually take in new data to re-predict and re-prescribe, thus automatically improving prediction accuracy and prescribing better decision options. Prescriptive analytics ingests hybrid data, a combination of structured (numbers, categories) and unstructured data (videos, images, sounds, texts), and business rules to predict what lies ahead and to prescribe how to take advantage of this predicted future without compromising other priorities. All three phases of analytics can be performed through professional services or technology or a combination. In order to scale, prescriptive analytics technologies need to be adaptive to take into account the growing volume, velocity, and variety of data that most mission critical processes and their environments may produce. One criticism of prescriptive analytics is that its distinction from predictive analytics is ill-defined and therefore ill-conceived. The scientific disciplines that comprise Prescriptive Analytics History Prescriptive analytics incorporates both structured and unstructured data, and uses a combination of advanced analytic techniques and disciplines to predict, prescribe, and adapt. While the term prescriptive analytics was first coined by IBM and later trademarked by Ayata, the underlying concepts have been around for hundreds of years. The technology behind prescriptive analytics synergistically combines hybrid data, business rules with mathematical models and computational models. The data inputs to prescriptive analytics may come from multiple sources: internal, such as inside a corporation; and external, also known as environmental data. The data may be structured, which includes numbers and categories, as well as unstructured data, such as texts, images, sounds, and videos. Unstructured data differs from structured data in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation. More than 80% of the world's data today is unstructured, according to IBM. In addition to this variety of data types and growing data volume, incoming data can also evolve with respect to velocity, that is, more data being generated at a faster or a variable pace. Business rules define the business process and include objectives constraints, preferences, policies, best practices, and boundaries. Mathematical models and computational models are techniques derived from mathematical sciences, computer science and related disciplines such as applied statistics, machine learning, operations research, natural language processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, image processing, speech recognition, and signal processing. The correct application of all these methods and the verification of their results implies the need for resources on a massive scale including human, computational and temporal for every Prescriptive Analytic project. In order to spare the expense of dozens of people, high performance machines and weeks of work one must consider the reduction of resources and therefore a reduction in the accuracy or reliability of the outcome. The preferable route is a reduction that produces a probabilistic result within acceptable limits. Applications in Oil and Gas Key Questions Prescriptive Analytics software answers for oil and gas producersEnergy is the largest industry in the world ($6 trillion in size). The processes and decisions related to oil and natural gas exploration, development and production generate large amounts of data. Many types of captured data are used to create models and images of the Earth‚Äôs structure and layers 5,000 - 35,000 feet below the surface and to describe activities around the wells themselves, such as depositional characteristics, machinery performance, oil flow rates, reservoir temperatures and pressures. Prescriptive analytics software can help with both locating and producing hydrocarbons by taking in seismic data, well log data, production data, and other related data sets to prescribe specific recipes for how and where to drill, complete, and produce wells in order to optimize recovery, minimize cost, and reduce environmental footprint. =Unconventional Resource Development= Examples of structured and unstructured data sets generated and by the oil and gas companies and their ecosystem of service providers that can be analyzed together using Prescriptive Analytics softwareWith the value of the end product determined by global commodity economics, the basis of competition for operators in upstream E&P; is the ability to effectively deploy capital to locate and extract resources more efficiently, effectively, predictably, and safely than their peers. In unconventional resource plays, operational efficiency and effectiveness is diminished by reservoir inconsistencies, and decision-making impaired by high degrees of uncertainty. These challenges manifest themselves in the form of low recovery factors and wide performance variations. Prescriptive Analytics software can accurately predict production and prescribe optimal configurations of controllable drilling, completion, and production variables by modeling numerous internal and external variables simultaneously, regardless of source, structure, size, or format. Prescriptive analytics software can also provide decision options and show the impact of each decision option so the operations managers can proactively take appropriate actions, on time, to guarantee future exploration and production performance, and maximize the economic value of assets at every point over the course of their serviceable lifetimes. =Oilfield Equipment Maintenance= In the realm of oilfield equipment maintenance, Prescriptive Analytics can optimize configuration, anticipate and prevent unplanned downtime, optimize field scheduling, and improve maintenance planning. According to General Electric, there are more than 130,000 electric submersible pumps (ESP's) installed globally, accounting for 60% of the world's oil production.{http://www.ge- energy.com/products_and_services/products/electric_submersible_pumping_systems/} Prescriptive Analytics has been deployed to predict when and why an ESP will fail, and recommend the necessary actions to prevent the failure. In the area of Health, Safety and Environment, prescriptive analytics can predict and preempt incidents that can lead to reputational and financial loss for oil and gas companies. =Pricing= Pricing is another area of focus. Natural gas prices fluctuate dramatically depending upon supply, demand, econometrics, geopolitics, and weather conditions. Gas producers, pipeline transmission companies and utility companies have a keen interest in more accurately predicting gas prices so that they can lock in favorable terms while hedging downside risk. Prescriptive analytics software can accurately predict prices by modeling internal and external variables simultaneously and also provide decision options and show the impact of each decision option. Applications in healthcare Multiple factors are driving healthcare providers to dramatically improve business processes and operations as the United States healthcare industry embarks on the necessary migration from a largely fee-for service, volume-based system to a fee-for-performance, value-based system. Prescriptive analytics is playing a key role to help improve the performance in a number of areas involving various stakeholders: payers, providers and pharmaceutical companies. Prescriptive analytics can help providers improve effectiveness of their clinical care delivery to the population they manage and in the process achieve better patient satisfaction and retention. Providers can do better population health management by identifying appropriate intervention models for risk stratified population combining data from the in-facility care episodes and home based telehealth. Prescriptive analytics can also benefit healthcare providers in their capacity planning by using analytics to leverage operational and usage data combined with data of external factors such as economic data, population demographic trends and population health trends, to more accurately plan for future capital investments such as new facilities and equipment utilization as well as understand the trade-offs between adding additional beds and expanding an existing facility versus building a new one. Prescriptive analytics can help pharmaceutical companies to expedite their drug development by identifying patient cohorts that are most suitable for the clinical trials worldwide - patients who are expected to be compliant and will not drop out of the trial due to complications. Analytics can tell companies how much time and money they can save if they choose one patient cohort in a specific country vs. another. In provider-payer negotiations, providers can improve their negotiating position with health insurers by developing a robust understanding of future service utilization. By accurately predicting utilization, providers can also better allocate personnel.

Lau was instrumental in the development of sports in Singapore. Education He attended Victoria School in Singapore, where he had excelled in sports, and he graduated from Loughborough College in the United Kingdom, where he studied physical education to become a Physical Education teacher, graduating with a DLC 1st Class Honours in 1956. In 1973, he obtained a Master of Science from the University of Oregon in United States. Appointments After graduating from Loughborough College, he became a lecturer and eventually the chief of physical education at the then-Institute of Education, until 1975. He served as the executive director of the Singapore Sports Council from 1975‚Äì92, where he assisted the government in shaping and implementing the strategy for physical education and sports in Singapore. He assumed the post of secretary- general of the Singapore National Olympic Council in 1995. He left the post in 2001 at the age of 73 after a heart bypass. He had also previously served as a vice-president of Singapore Amateur Athletics Association, and was the honorary secretary of the Football Association of Singapore from 1982, a post he held for more than a decade. Achievements Lau devoted his whole life to the promotion of sport in Singapore. He believed sports was good for the nation and Singaporeans, and put his heart and soul into it, against a backdrop where economy has always been the highest priority in the country. He was a national badminton player, represented Singapore from 1956‚Äì58 and training alongside four-time All-England champion, Wong Peng Soon. He was Singapore's chief badminton coach from 1963‚Äì65, after which he served as honorary visiting coach of the New Zealand national badminton team. He was also an avid football player, squash player, and golfer. As one of Singapore's top sports administrator, he played a key role in implementing the physical education strategy in Singapore schools. He championed sports-for-all initiatives and was behind pushing for sports facilities to be built in the heartlands, fitness apparatus to be built in parks, stadiums and educational institutions, as well as mass sports participation events. He also championed an initiative to enhance coaching education and development in Singapore, which saw physical fitness instructors certified at the national level. The National Physical Fitness Award/Assessment (NAPFA) test was introduced during his tenure at Singapore Sports Council; the test was later adapted by the Singapore Armed Forces as the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT). A highly respected educationist and a man of many talents, his life has been about volunteerism. Training young sports leaders in the early days has had a ripple effect on the present day. Dr Chris Chan, Singapore National Olympic Council's secretary-general said: \\"Every Singaporean has benefited in some way from Lau's work, whether they know it or not.\\" Former Singapore Sports Council chairman, Dr Tan Eng Liang said: \\"His contribution as a teacher, sportsman and administrator is second to none\\" and that it will be hard to find another person who exhibit such selflessness and dedication to local sport. Awards Lau was awarded the National Day Public Service Administration awards in 1969 (bronze) for education and 1981 (silver) for sports, and the International Badminton Federation's Distinguished Service Award in 1997. He received the Honorary Doctorate (Honoris Causa) from Loughborough University in 2003 for his contribution to the public service and the development of sports in Singapore. Autobiography Lau launched his autobiography less than 2 weeks before he died. One of the 20 invited guests presented with the book at the launch was the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Teo Chee Hean. The book, titled \\"Lau Teng Chuan (Sportsman, Teacher, Sports Administrator)\\", has more than 400 copies printed and distributed to various sections of the sporting fraternity. Proceeds of the book go to the Lau Teng Chuan Scholarship Fund, which will benefit physical education teachers. His grandchildren had urged him to pen the book to share with Singaporeans his sporting experiences and service to sports in various capacities. Death Lau died on 8 May 2012 at the age of 83 from stomach cancer, leaving behind his wife, Mary, 2 sons, a daughter, and 7 grandchildren.

Life Born in Camberwell on 19 January 1827, he was the eldest son of Mary Chesshyre and her husband, John Syer Bristowe, a medical practitioner in Camberwell. He was educated at Enfield School and King's College School, and entered St Thomas' Hospital as a medical student in 1846. There he won prizes, with the treasurer's gold medal in 1848, and in the same year obtained the gold medal of the Apothecaries' Society for botany. In 1849 he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and on 2 August 1849 he received the licence of the Society of Apothecaries. In 1850 he took the degree of MB of the University of London, gaining the scholarship and medal in surgery and the medals in anatomy and materia medica; in 1852 he was admitted MD of London University. In 1849 he was house surgeon at St Thomas' Hospital, and in the following year he was appointed curator of the museum and pathologist to the hospital. He was elected assistant physician in 1854, and during the next few years he held several teaching posts, being appointed lecturer on botany in 1859, on materia medica in 1860, on general anatomy and physiology in 1865, on pathology in 1870. In 1860 he was elected full physician, and in 1876 he became lecturer on medicine, a post which he held until his retirement in 1892, when he became consulting physician to the hospital. He served in many posts at the Royal College of Physicians. Elected a fellow in 1858, he was an examiner in medicine in 1869 and 1870. In 1872 he was Croonian lecturer, choosing for his subject Disease and its Medical Treatment; in 1879 he was Lumleian lecturer on The Pathological Relations of Voice and Speech. He was censor in 1876, 1886, 1887, 1888, and senior censor in 1889. He was examiner in medicine at the universities of Oxford and London, at the Royal College of Surgeons, and at the war office. He was also medical officer of health for Camberwell (1856‚Äì95), physician to the Commercial Union Assurance Company, and to Westminster School. In 1881 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and the honorary degree of LLD was conferred upon him at the tercentenary of the University of Edinburgh in 1884. He was president of the Pathological Society of London in 1885, of the Neurological Society in 1891, and of the Medical Society of London in 1893. In that year he delivered the Lettsomian lectures on Syphilitic Affections of the Nervous System. He was also president of the Society of Medical Officers of Health, of the Hospitals Association, and of the metropolitan counties' branch of the British Medical Association. In 1887 his term of office as physician to St Thomas' Hospital having expired, he was appointed for a further term of five years at the request of his colleagues. Bristowe died on 20 August 1895 at Monmouth, and is buried at Norwood cemetery. Legacy A three-quarter-length portrait by his daughter Beatrice M. Bristowe hung in the committee room at St Thomas' Hospital. The bulk of the subscriptions collected on his retirement from St Thomas' Hospital in 1892 was used to found a medal to be awarded for proficiency in the science of pathology. Works Bristowe's reputation was as an outstanding teacher of students at the bedside. As a physician he was noted in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the nervous system. He communicated to the public health department of the privy council a series of reports: * On Phosphorus Poisoning in Match Manufacture (1862), first describing phossy jaw; * On Infection by Rags and Paper Works (1865); * On the Cattle Plague (1866) with John Burdon Sanderson; and * On the Hospitals of the United Kingdom with Timothy Holmes. This was an extensive work of 281 pages, Appendix 15 to the Privy Council Medical Officer's Report, London, HMSO, 1863.The Development of the London Hospital System, 1823 - 1982. Many of the microscopical drawings to be found in his books were his own. In particular his figures of trichina spiralis, a parasitic worm in the muscles of humans, were copied in many textbooks. Bristowe published also: * Poems, London, 1850; towards the end of his life he issued another volume of poems for private circulation. * A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Medicine, London, 1876; the 7th edition was issued in 1890. This work immediately became one of the main textbooks of medicine for students and practitioners in English-speaking countries. * Clinical Lectures and Essays on Diseases of the Nervous System, 1888. * Annual Reports of the Medical Officer of Health to the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell, Surrey, London, 1857‚Äì82. Bristowe edited the St. Thomas's Hospital Reports, 1870‚Äì76. Family Bristowe married, on 9 October 1856, Miriam Isabelle, eldest surviving daughter of Joseph P. Stearns of Dulwich.

Traditional hagiographies like Periya Puranam (13th century CE) and Thiruthondar Thogai (10th century CE) detail his legendary life and services to the Hindu god Shiva. Kari Nayanar was a vedic Brahmin devotee as well as a Tamil poet with an understanding of Sanskrit. The poet-saint compiled the vedic truths in Kovai(Anthology), a Tamil composition titled Karikkovai. Therefore the saint got the name as Kari Nayanar. Hagiography Kari Nayanar was born in a Vedic Brahmin family in Thirukkadaiyur, a coastal town located - 15 km north of Karaikal - on the east coast of Tamil Nadu, where there are Amritaghateswarar - Abirami Temple and the ancient Thirukkadaiyur Mayanam temple. The poet-saint was not only the great Shiva devotee but also a learned scholar. The saint, with the help of his Sanskrit learning and with fair knowledge about the Vedic truths, composed anthologies in praise of Shiva and on Vedic truths. The knowledge of Vedic truths originally compiled in Sanskrit language was disseminated in the easily understandable, rhythmic and music filled Tamil anthology compositions, which melted the entire Tamil regions. The poet-saint also composed anthologies in praise of the monarchs i.e., Chera, Chozha and Pandyan, the rulers of three major Tamil kingdoms. In appreciation of his anthologies, the poet-saint was rewarded with heaps of prize money and gifts. The saint utilized all his earnings for the cause of Saiva services. The poet-saint built many Shiva temples. He also served Shiva devotees. After rendering the prolonged selfless services, the devotion, faith and intense prayers of the poet-saint made him to attain the abode of Shiva.

The genus so far contains one species, L. perspicullum.  Etymology  Limniphacos is derived from the Greek words limne (lake) and phakos (lens of the eye).  Distribution  Earliest portion of the upper part of the Buen Formation, Brilles√∏, North of the J√∏rgen Br√∏nlund Fjord, Southern Peary Land, Greenland.  Ecology  Limniphacos perspiculum occurs together with Mesolenellus hyperborea, Serrodiscus, hyoliths, Petrianna fulmenta (Bradoriida), and inarticulate brachiopods.  Description  The raised central part of the head shield (or glabella) is conical (with a narrow front and a wide back), and has four or five pairs of furrows. It does not reach the border furrow with its front. The eye lobes are short and do not reach the most backward glabellar lobe. The headshield (or cephalon) carries four spines. Those closest to the axis (or intergenal spines) are short. The outer spines (or genal spines) are of moderate length and slightly in front of the back of the cehalon. The main body (or thorax) has at least 12 segments with prominent spines. All parts are reticulate and granularly ornamented.

It is the sequel to the 2006 game Company of Heroes. As with the original Company of Heroes, the game is set in World War II but with the focus on the Eastern Front, with players primarily controlling the side of the Soviet Red Army during various stages of the Eastern Front, from Operation Barbarossa to the Battle of Berlin. Company of Heroes 2 runs on Relic Entertainment's proprietary Essence 3.0 game engine. In January 2013, Sega acquired Relic Entertainment and along with it the Company of Heroes intellectual property from THQ. The game was released on June 25, 2013 in North America and Europe. Gameplay =Resources= The resource-generation system from the first game has been modified. Players will still capture specific flagged points all over the map to collect munitions and fuel credits, which will be invested in assembling their units. Most armies can construct caches to increase the fuel or munitions income from these points, though some points produce a higher income of one material but cannot have caches built on them. Instead of the soldier units actually gathering at the flagged point itself, capturing the point is possible if the player's units are inside a specific zone with no enemy units in the same zone. The accumulation of these resources and the size of the player's army can be much faster if players capture various flagged points all over the map. In order for a player to receive the benefits of a captured flagged point, it must be part of a continuous area of captured territory, thus allowing an unbroken chain (\\"supply line\\") connected to the headquarters. Thus, the resource intake will be curtailed if the opposing side captures territory that isolates (\\"cuts off\\") owned points from other allied sections in the map. Manpower is used to build common units, and the amount will decrease the larger a player's army grows. =Buildings= Units can occupy a civilian building and use it as a temporary strongpoint. However, the occupants can be flushed out through attacks by artillery or soldiers using flamethrowers and grenades. The building-damage system from Company of Heroes is retained and enhanced; wooden buildings set afire will continue burning until they are reduced to cinders. Furthermore, buildings can be damaged by tanks and light vehicles driving into them. The Soviets' main structure is the Regimental Field Headquarters, which is used to produce conscripts and field engineers. The Special Rifle Command, Support Weapon Kampaneya, Mechanized Armor Kampaneya, and the Tankoviy Battalion Command are the respective Soviet equivalents of the original game's barracks; weapons support center, vehicle center, and tank hall. A field hospital can help treat seriously injured soldiers. The Wehrmacht's main structure is the Kampfgruppe Headquarters, which is used to produce pioneers and MG42 Heavy Machine Gun teams and to upgrade battle phases to allow for more advanced units and structures. =Combat mechanics= Combat includes controllable units that are recruited and ordered directly by the player (through the user interface at player- controlled buildings, or through a doctrine ability), as well as activated support actions, such as artillery bombardment or air cover suppression. Every controllable unit type, whether infantry or vehicle, has an associated construction cost and recruitment time, as well as a range of fighting abilities. Vehicles and infantry can eventually be upgraded by purchasing specific capabilities. Upgrades generally improve the unit's effectiveness. Some upgrades are global, granting immediate benefits to all deployed units, while others must be purchased on a unit by unit basis. Most combat takes place through direct, line-of-sight engagements. As with the original Company of Heroes, colored dots will show locations that provide varying degrees of cover for soldiers and support units. Soldiers can also climb over low terrain obstacles such as fences and walls while vehicles, depending on their type, can simply smash through obstacles. Occasionally if a vehicle takes too much damage, it will be abandoned rather than destroyed; the crew is killed but the vehicle remains mostly intact. Abandoned vehicles can be repaired by engineer units and recovered or captured by sending an infantry squad of sufficient size to crew it, or they could be destroyed by collateral fire to deny them to the enemy. The game also offers the player a chance to complete side quests in a mission, which are denoted by an inverted triangle icon. =TrueSight= The game's Essence 3.0 engine introduces a new line-of-sight feature called the TrueSight system, which aims to better emulate troop visibility in real combat. In contrast to overhead visibility seen in other strategy games, TrueSight more accurately represents a unit's visibility range based on environmental conditions and type of unit. =Weather= Weather conditions are a major factor in Company of Heroes 2s gameplay, under the new ColdTech weather-simulation system. Since many battles in the Eastern Front occurred in winter weather, troops can die of frostbite if caught in the outside during severe weather, especially when pinned by enemy fire; a thermometer-shaped bar to the left side of the unit icon denotes a soldier's body temperature. The soldiers can recover their body heat if they are close to a bonfire or have found a building to shelter in, though soldiers in cover outside will not lose or gain body heat. Players moving through deep snow will move at a reduced speed unless they are on a road; their footprints are also visible to the enemy. Certain maps have frozen bodies of water, allowing for more movement options. However, players face the danger of being attacked from the other side; as a result, the ice can buckle under the weight of the units in movement or shattered by explosions. =Theatre of War= The game introduces the \\"Theatre of War\\", a series of single-player and cooperative missions detailing various aspects of the Eastern Front campaign from both German and Soviet sides. Eighteen missions set in 1941 will be part of the game upon release with the missions from 1942 onward available as downloadable content. The first of these offerings is Case Blue, a package only free to pre-ordered copies and Red Star editions of the game, featuring the Axis forces during the Fall Blau campaign on the Eastern Front. Later releases include Victory at Stalingrad, taking place around the city of Stalingrad during 1942, and Southern Fronts, focusing on events surrounding the spring rasputitsa in 1943. =Order 227= Company of Heroes 2s campaign attempts to tackle Joseph Stalin's Order No. 227, which prohibits retreating except under the direction of senior officers. Starting from the fifth mission set in Stalingrad, Order 227 will be in effect if the player deploys Fresh Conscripts, Frontovik Squads, or Penal Battalions. A time bar appears on the left side of the map display; for that duration, players must not have their soldiers go into full retreat back to headquarters or else said soldiers will be executed for doing so. Plot The game's story focuses on the Eastern Front campaign as narrated through flashbacks by Lev Abramovich Isakovich, a Soviet Army lieutenant locked up at a gulag in Siberia in 1952. Colonel Churkin ‚Äì his old commanding officer ‚Äì shows him a book and interrogates him about his experiences during the war, including the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Moscow, combat in the outskirts of Leningrad, fighting in Poland, up to the Fall of the Reichstag. Lev Isakovich first reminisces the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942, where he, as a Lieutenant, motivates his men to break through the German lines. As the Soviets reach Red Square, a wave of conscripts is pushed back by heavy defenses. The commissar orders a Maxim gunner to gun down the retreating men as part of Order 227; Not One Step Back. The Soviets attack again, this time the Germans are defeated. As Lieutenant Isakovich and his men inspect the carnage, they stumble upon a lone German survivor trying to surrender, only to be killed. His next experience details when he first met with Colonel Churkin of the NKVD. Churkin orders the Soviet forces to hold the line against the Germans and destroy/burn anything of value that cannot be evacuated to keep it out of enemy hands, including several houses and fields. As the rest of the supplies are evacuated, the Germans bring in Panzer IV tanks and the Soviets are ordered to fall back to the bridge. As a few soldiers run towards the bridge, Lieutenant Isakovich regrettably detonates the explosives, leaving the men at the mercy of the pursuing Germans. As winter began to roll in, the Soviets under Lev defend Mtsensk from German soldiers and StuGs long enough for T‚Äë34 reinforcements to arrive. Soon later, temperatures dropped to an extreme low; the Soviets were far better prepared for these conditions than the Germans, whose vehicles stalled and suffered more losses to frostbite. Outside of Moscow, a small Soviet force struggles through the snow while destroying several disabled vehicles. Returning to Stalingrad, Lev recalls that the only thing driving the Soviet soldiers to fight was Order 227, in which soldiers caught retreating would be executed as traitors. As the fighting in Stalingrad was coming to an end, Lev Isakovich, now a captain, searches for German intel. As he discovers a map on an officer, a German Tiger Heavy Tank flattens the building, burying Lev alive under the rubble. Yuri, one of the survivors of the expedition, goes back to HQ to ask to save Captain Isakovich before the Germans reach him. The Soviet forces then move into the area and hold their ground long enough for the captain to be freed. Upon returning to HQ, Major Polivanov shoots Yuri for leaving his post to save Lev, and orders Lev to placed on the next train to Moscow while the remaining soldiers that helped him are executed. As Lev is recovering at the hospital, he is holding a conversation with Sergeant Ivan Pozharsky, who discusses the Siege of Leningrad, which was completely cut off by the Germans for over a year, until the Soviets manage to break through the siege. As fighting in Leningrad continued, a Soviet armored squadron investigates the site of a recent tank battle. However, they are ambushed by a Tiger Heavy Tank. Despite losing their armor, the Soviets manage to kill the Tiger's crew and drive it back to their base. After recovering from his wounds, Lev abandons his military career in favor of journalism but found nothing inspiring of the war, except for the heroism demonstrated by the soldiers on the battlefields. As the war went on, the Soviets fight the Germans in Lublin, Poland. After the ISU-152s break down the gate of a suspected prison camp, Lev realizes that this was Majdanek, a Nazi concentration camp and a glimpse into the Holocaust. Soon afterwards, Sergeant Pozharsky, who had recently returned to active service, introduces Lev Isakovich to Ania Zielinska, a leader of the Polish partisans. After she returns with a captured German officer, Pozharsky directs her to the supplies that were promised. But Lev watches in horror as Pozharsky betrays Ania and her fellow partisans, claiming that once the war with the Germans ended, the Polish would be fighting the Russians, before executing her. Lev then decides to publish his findings, only to be stopped by Churkin, who promptly assigns him to the 8th Guards' penal battalion. As the Soviets enter Germany, they encircle a town full of Germans and prevent most of them, including civilians, from escaping. Soon, the Soviets began to lay siege to Berlin fighting the remaining Germans through the streets and ruined buildings, ultimately capturing the Reichstag, signaling final German defeat. Ironically, the Reichstag was disused since Hitler first came to power and millions of Soviets died to raise the flag. These experiences have left Isakovich shaken as he reveals he tried to defect after the war in order to show the world the truth. He was captured and sent to the gulag on Churkin's orders. Isakovich claims that \\"The first casualty of war is Truth\\" and the truth is in the pages of the book. A man then steps forth and prepares to execute Isakovich, only to be killed by Churkin. Churkin then allows Isakovich to escape the gulag to spread the truth, and commits suicide, stating that he never looked at the pages of the book ever since it was recovered and he was not to survive Joseph Stalin's next purge. Development THQ first announced the sequel to the acclaimed Company of Heroes in May 2012. THQ executive vice president of core games Danny Bilson noted that the publisher will continue working on Company of Heroes 2 following its launch next year. On December 19, 2012, publisher THQ filed for bankruptcy just after postponing the release date of the video game. The following month, on January 23, 2013, it was announced that THQ had sold Relic Entertainment to Sega for as part of an auction of the company's properties in result of the bankruptcy. Company of Heroes 2 takes advantage of DirectX 11 but also supports DirectX 10. The game also utilizes Valve's Steamworks technology with matchmaking and achievements. On March 6, 2013, Sega announced that Company of Heroes 2 would be released in North America and Europe on June 25, 2013. A few weeks later, the company announced that the first closed beta will begin April 2, 2013. The open beta was released to the public on June 4, 2013 after the stress tests and the closed beta sessions were finished. =Downloadable content = Relic has released downloadable content for the game after its release. * Commanders Add new abilities and units to a players arsenal, which are available in skirmish and multiplayer matches. A player can choose up to 3 commanders of which he can choose one during a skirmish. This commander will then give access to 5 unique units/abilities. Some commanders have been given away for free at certain events by Relic. * Cosmetic Items Vehicle skins allow to alter the camouflage pattern of certain vehicles and tanks and are a purely cosmetic change. Faceplates are another cosmetic change only visible in the main menu or loading screen when joining a multiplayer match. * Content Packs With the release of the Western Front Armies DLC, the playable factions of the U.S Forces (USF) and Oberkommando West (OKW) are available. Relic had released The Western Front Armies and Ardennes Assault DLCs, which was released on June 24, 2014 and November 18, 2014 respectively. Ardennes Assault added a new, non- linear campaign taking place in Belgium as the USF, pitting three playable companies against the OKW in various scenarios and skirmish maps with unique conditions. The third expansion of the game, titled The British Forces, was released on September 3, 2015, adding the British as a playable faction in skirmish and multiplayer. Reception PC World gave the game three and a half out of five. PC Gamer rated the game at 80 concluding, \\"Company of Heroes 2 is the USSR of real-time strategy games: huge, powerful and just a little bit broken\\". IGN gave the game an 8.4, saying, \\"More sequel-sized expansion than true successor, Company of Heroes 2 repeats many of the original Company of Heroes feats‚Äù. As of March 31, 2014, the game has sold 680,000 copies in Europe and North America. =Controversy= Relic has been questioned by critics and historians about accuracy of its portrayal of the Eastern Front in World War II. An article written for video game website Polygon by Colin Campbell reflecting on the subject stated that the \\"comments on forums and on Metacritic are testament to the strong feelings that the war still generates\\". In the same article, it cites the game's director Quinn Duffy who in regards to the creative direction of the first and second game felt that \\"the second game is painted on a broader canvas\\", whereas \\"in contrast, the first game focused on a small group of soldiers and did not seek to take a wider view\\". =Reception and criticism in Russia= In Russia and Post-Soviet states the game was found offensive by many users and critics for portraying the Red Army commanders as cruel, using their own soldiers in a cold-blooded way, exaggerating brutal war tactics.https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/25/4553536/is- company-of-heroes-2-anti-russian After the video made by the Russian blogger BadComedian (real name - Evgeny Bazhenov),https://carambatv.ru/bad- comedian/company-of-heroes-2/ thousands of people have signed a Change.org petition demanding Steam to block the game in CIS countries. The petition brands the game as \\"disgusting\\". In 2013, the sale of the game was banned in Russia.https://www.rbth.com/opinion/2013/08/13/company_of_heroes_2_war_game_offends_russians_28887.html Russian game publisher 1C-Softclub stopped distribution of the game on 26 July 2013 due to the strong negative feedback (notably a petition to stop the sale that was filed by the game players). Following the news, the game's publisher SEGA released a statement that they were \\"taking this issue very seriously and are investigating these concerns thoroughly with all relevant partners\\".

Early life  Kamala was born to Ramraman Bhattacharya and Suprabasini Devi, the fifth of seven children in the year 1945 in the erstwhile Sylhet district in Assam. In their family they were three sons and four daughters. She was the third of the four daughters, having a younger sister and a younger brother. Their family had to struggle through many hardships, after she lost her father early in her childhood. During the Partition of India, the district of Sylhet was acceded to Pakistan on the basis of Sylhet referendum. In the 1950 East Pakistan genocide, hundreds of Hindus were killed in Sylhet and they migrated to India in large numbers. Kamala's mother too migrated to Silchar in the Cachar district in the year 1950. Kamala's family used to stay in a rented accommodation in Silchar Public School Road. Her eldest sister Benu took up a nursing job and went to Simaluguri for training. Kamala's elder sister Pratibha was a school teacher. Her family was economically dependent on her earning for their livelihood. In her childhood, Kamala attended the Chhotelal Seth Institute in Silchar. She did not have the financial stability to buy the school text books. She had once asked her eldest sister Benu to buy her a dictionary for her, which her sister could not afford. She used to borrow books from her classmates and copy the text and read them. In 1961, Kamala appeared for the matriculation exams. She was determined to complete her graduation and had planned to learn typewriting before the matriculation results were declared.  Martyrdom  The very next day after the matriculation exams, a picketing was being organized in Silchar railway station demanding Bengali as the medium of education. On the morning of May 19, after taking bath Kamala wore the saree of her elder sister Pratibha and prepared to go to picketing. Her elder sister warned her of possible dangers. In the meanwhile, a group of 20-22 girls came to their house to take her. They alleviated her mother's concerns and took Kamala along with them. Kamala's mother gave her a piece of cloth to defend herself from tear gas. Kamala's younger sister Mangala, younger brother Bakul and her nephew Bappa too accompanied the group. Later during the day, Kamala's mother herself went to the railway station to enquire about their whereabouts. Bakul and Bappa had once been arrested by the police and then released. Kamala washed her mother's feet of the dust, gave her a sharbat and then sent her back home. The rail blockade programme had passed off peacefully in the morning. In the afternoon, the Assam Rifles had begun to arrive at the railway station. At around 2-35 P.M. the paramilitary police started beating the protesters with rifle butts and batons without any provocation from them. Kamala's younger sister hit by the police, fell to the ground and began crying to Kamala for help. The police had opened fire on the protesters by then. As Kamala rushed to the rescue of her younger sister, a bullet pierced through her eye and hit her head. Kamala was taken to hospital along with other wounded and bullet hit protesters. She died in the hospital. Unconscious Mangala too was admitted to hospital, where she regained her consciousness after one month. She became mentally unstable for the rest of her life.

This process of breakdown, or catabolism, and making new molecules from the results, or biosynthesis, is something all living things do. HPPD inhibitors were first brought to market in 1980, although their mechanism of action was not understood until the late 1990s. They were originally used primarily in Japan in rice production, but since the late 1990s have been used in Europe and North America for corn, soybeans, and cereals, and since the 2000s have become more important as weeds have become resistant to glyphosate and other herbicides. Genetically modified crops are under development that include resistance to HPPD inhibitors. There is a pharmaceutical drug on the market, nitisinone, that was originally under development as an herbicide as a member of this class, and is used to treat an orphan disease, type I tyrosinemia. HPPD inhibitors can be classified into three fundamental chemical frameworks: pyrazolones, triketones, and diketonitriles. The triketone class is based on a chemical that certain plants make in self-defense called leptospermone; the class was developed by scientists at companies that eventually became part of Syngenta. Bayer CropScience has also been active in developing new HPPD inhibitors. Mechanism of action The mechanism of action for HPPD inhibitors was misunderstood for the first twenty years that these products were sold, starting in 1980. They were originally thought to be inhibitors of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (protox). 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) is an enzyme found in both plants and animals which catalyzes the catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine. Preventing the breakdown of tyrosine has three negative consequences: the excess of tyrosine stunts growth; the plant suffers oxidative damage due to lack of tocopherols (vitamin E); and chlorophyll is destroyed due to lack of carotenoids that protect it. Plants turn white without deformation due to a complete loss of chlorophyll, which has led compounds of this class to be classified as \\"bleaching herbicides\\", as are protox inhibitors.Wolfgang Kramer and Ulrich Schirmer, Modern Crop Protection Compounds (1)197-276(2012) More specifically, inhibition of HPPD prevents the formation of a breakdown product, homogentisic acid, which in turn is a key precursor for the biosynthesis of both tocopherols and plastoquinone. Plastoquinone is in turn a critical co-factor in the formation of carotenoids, which protect chlorophyll in plants from being destroyed by sunlight. This class of herbicides represents one of the last discoveries of a new herbicide mode of action in the wave of discovery that ended in late 1990s. Products and economics As of 2009, HPPD inhibitors had three fundamental chemical frameworks:George W. Ware and David M. Whitacre.

In 1990 sulcotrione was introduced for post- emergence weed control in corn. Isoxaflutole opened the market more broadly for HPPD inhibitors when it was introduced in 1996 for corn and sugarcane, and for use as a pre-emergence herbicide that could control broadleaf weeds as did sulcotrione, but also additional grass weeds. Benzobicyclon, was introduced in 2001 for control of broadleaf weeds and some sedges that are problems in rice, that had become resistant to sulfonylurea herbicides. Mesotrione was introduced in 2002 and like sulcotrione is a triketone, so it is effective on the same weeds and crops, but is more potent, making it more useful in mixes with other herbicides - an important factor for fully controlling weeds and preventing the development of resistance. It has become the biggest selling member of the HPPD class. Topramezone was introduced in 2006 for corn and soy, and is the most potent HPPD inhibitor, but has serious carry-over issues especially for soybean in US, where the minimum time from application to planting is 18 months. Tembotrione was introduced in 2007 for corn, and works against key grass species and importantly, kills broadleaf weeds, including glyphosate-, ALS- and dicamba- resistant weeds. Used with safeners there are no crop-rotation restrictions. Pyrasulfotole was also introduced in 2007 for cereals in North America, and was the first new class of herbicide in cereals in many years, and an important advance against weeds that had become resistant to existing herbicides. It remains active in the soil during the growing season and when used with safeners, it does not damage crops and there are no crop-rotation restrictions. Herbicide risks and toxicities Tembotrione has low acute toxicity via the oral, dermal and inhalation routes of exposure (Toxicity category III or IV). It is a dermal sensitizer but not an eye or dermal irritantUS EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet: Tembotrione Genetically modified crops To deal with rising resistance to existing herbicides, Bayer CropScience has been developing various genetically modified crops resistant to HPPD inhibitors: in one version, the crops are resistant to both HPPD inhibitors and glyphosate, and in collaboration with Syngenta, crops that are resistant to HPPD inhibitors and glufosinate.Gil Gullickson for Crops.com December 5, 2012 Something old, something new with herbicidesRhonda Brooks for Farm Journal February 12, 2014. \\"Seed Companies Pick Up the Pace on Seed Trait-Herbicide Systems\\" The collaboration to develop the stacked HPPD inhibitor/glyphosate resistant products was first announced in 2007.Bayer CropScience press release.

Physician‚Äôs Guide to Tyrosinemia Type 1 Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase acts on tyrosine after HPPD does, so scientists working on making these inhibitors hypothesized that inhibiting HPPD and controlling tyrosine in the diet could treat this disease. A series of small clinical trials were attempted with one of their compounds, nitisinone and were successful, leading to nitisinone being brought to market as an orphan drug.Sobi Orfadin¬Æ (nitisinone) History of the discovery of the triketone class of HPPD inhibitors The origin of the triketone family of HPPD inhibitors had its beginnings in the curiosity of a biologist about allelopathic weed control of weeds in the back yard of his house. This curiosity led to the discovery and development of the triketone class of herbicides. Investigation of the mode of action of this class of compounds led to the discovery that it could be used to treat patients with tyrosinaemia type 1, a treatment which has been said to ‚Äú‚Ä¶. transform the natural history of tyrosinaemia.‚Äù All of the herbicidal and pharmaceutical triketone HPPD inhibitors including mesotrione (Callisto)(I),MeisterPro Crop Protection Handbook 2011, p.502 sulcotrione (Mikado)(II)MeisterPro Crop Protection Handbook 2011, p. 632 and nitisinone (Orfadin)(III)Christopher G. Knudsen, David L. Lee, William J. Michaely, Hsiao-ling Chin, Nhan H. Nguyen, Ronald J. Rusay, Thomas H. Cromartie, Reed Gray, Byron H. Lake, Torquil E. M. Frasier and David Cartwright , Discovery of the triketone class of HPPD inhibiting herbicides and their relationship to naturally occurring -triketones, Allelopathy in Ecological Agriculture and Forestry (2000), p.101-111 had their common origin in the observation in 1977 by Reed Gray, a biologist at Stauffer Chemical‚Äôs Western Research Center (WRC) in California, that few weeds emerged under bottlebrush plants (Callistemon citrinus) in the back yard of his house. { I II  III } To investigate this effect, he took soil from underneath these plants and extracted and fractionated it. The resulting extracts were applied to soil flats containing watergrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) as an indicator species at the very high application rate of 100 lb./acre. There was a herbicidal effect from this test, so the extracts were developed on a preparative thin layer chromatographic sheet. The same Echinochloa crus-galli seeds were placed on this sheet and germinated. The active ingredient was identified by bleaching symptoms on the test species. The area where the herbicidal activity was seen was extracted and he submitted the isolated active ingredient to Ken Cheng at the Western Research Center who, using proton NMR, IR and mass spectrometry identified the structure as being that of Leptospermone (IV) which was a known natural product that had been derived from the steam-volatile oils of some Australian plants, but which had never been cited as having any biological activity. {  IV } He approached a chemist, Ron Rusay, at the Western Research Center who independently synthesized the compound and submitted it for further greenhouse testing. These tests showed that it had modest herbicidal activity against grass weeds at a very high application rate of 100 lbs./acre. He prepared a series of analogs in which the alkanoyl group was modified and a patent was obtained on this series of compounds.Reed A. Gray, Chien K. Tseng, Ronald J. Rusay, 1-Hydroxy-2-(alkylketo)-4,4,6,6-tetramethyl cyclohexen-3,5-diones, US4,202,840(1980) These compounds had similar, weak herbicidal activity similar to that found with the lead compound. Because of the weak herbicidal activity, work on other analogs was not pursued. Shortly after this, another WRC chemist, Bill Michaely, synthesized an aroyl triketone (V) as an unexpected byproduct when attempting to synthesize a sethoxydim (VI)MeisterPro Crop Protection Handbook 2011, p. 618 analog. { V  VI } While this compound did not have any herbicidal activity, it did show activity in a screen designed to show antidotal activity toward other herbicides. When attempting to optimize the antidote activity, several aryl substituted analogs were prepared. What was discovered was that those compounds with an ortho substituent had herbicidal activity but no antidote activity. This observation coupled with the knowledge of the herbicidal activity of the earlier leptospermone analogs was pivotal in formulating an idea of a potential toxophore for this class of herbicides. A small task force consisting of David Lee, Bill Michaely and Don James prepared a number of substituted triketones with chloro-, bromo- and methyl-substituents in the ortho position. Biological activity remained modest and the task force was disbanded after a short while. One working hypothesis was that the active ingredient in these triketones was the cyclized tetrahydroxanthenones(VII). Bill Michaely prepared several of these, but the herbicidal activity remained modest and all work in the area was terminated. It was not until David Lee was able to show that these compounds were in equilibrium with the 2-hydroxy triketones(VIII) by trapping the intermediate with methyl iodide that the reason for the biological activity was understood. {  VII  VIII } David Lee had a strong background in quantitative structure‚Äìactivity relationships (QSAR) after a post-doctoral year with Professors Manfred Wolff and Peter Kollman where he used the Prophet system.Lee, D.L., Kollman, P.A., Marsh, F.J., Wolff, M.E., Quantitative relationships between steroid structure and binding to putative progesterone receptors, J. Med. Chem. , 20 (1977) pp. 1139-46 Looking over the QSAR (quantitative structure‚Äìactivity relationships) of the triketones, David Lee saw a potential discrepancy in the existing structure-activity analysis. Other than the 2-chloro-4-nitro substitution pattern, no other triketones with electron-withdrawing substituents in the 4-position had ever been prepared. He hypothesized that the activity of the triketones could be correlated to the electron withdrawing ability of the substituents. The activity of the 2-chloro-4-nitro analog was an outlier, and it was theorized that perhaps the nitro group was being reduced in vivo. The 4-methylsulfonyl group was then prepared to test this hypothesis, and what was to become the commercial herbicide Mikado (II) was prepared. The prospect of improving the biological activity with new aromatic substitution patterns totally rejuvenated work on the triketones. A key discovery in the preparation of these compounds was the finding by Jim Heather in the WRC Process Development group that acetone cyanohydrin was a good catalyst for the preparation of the o-chloro analogs.James B. Heather, Pamela D. Milano, Process for the production of acylated 1,3- dicarbonyl compounds, US 4,695,673 (1987) Use of this catalyst allowed for the first time production of the o-nitro triketones. At this point a very large effort on the synthesis of analogs was commenced with David Lee coordinating the effort. Key chemists participating in this were Charles Carter, Bill Michaely, Hsiao-ling Chin, Nhan Nguyen and Chris Knudsen, although at one time almost every synthesis chemist at the WRC worked on this project.(8) David L.

SC-0051 (sulcotrione) was synthesized and tested in Sept. ‚Äì Oct. 1983, and SC-1296 (mesotrione) and SC-0735 (nitisinone) were both synthesized and tested in early 1984. Triketones were in widespread university field trials in 1985.(10) Evans, J.O. and Gunnell, R.W. (1986) Evaluation of SC-0774, SC-0051 and SC-5676 in field corn. Research.progress.report. Western Society of Weed Science(USA),130-131 The first of the triketone patents was published in 1986.Michaely, W.J., Kratz, G.W., Certain 2-(2-substituted benzoyl)-1,3- cyclohexanediones and their use as herbicides, US 4,780,127 (1988) With a long history of working with bleaching herbicides which inhibit phytoene desaturaseSandman, Gerhard, Schmidt, Arno, Linden, Harmut, B√∂ger, Peter, (1991) Phytoene Desaturase, the Essential Target for Bleaching Herbicides, Weed Science, 39:474-479 including the commercial herbicide flurochloridone(IX),MeisterPro Crop Protection Handbook 2011, p. 428 there was some considerable interest to find that these compounds do not inhibit phytoene desaturase in vitro. The fact that phytoene desaturase inhibitors typically have a high log P, whereas the triketones do not, further suggested a different mode of action. {  IX } There had been some early toxicological concern about corneal and paw lesions which were observed with rats that had repeatedly dosed with a triketone. Several chemists and toxicologists came upon a paperKolzumi, S., Nagatsu, T., Iinuma, H., Ohno, M., Takeuchi,T. and Umezawa,H. (1982). Inhibition of phenylalanine hydroxylase, a pterin-requiring monooxygenase, by ouudenone and its derivatives, Journal of Antibiotics 35: 458. describing very similar ocular, but not skin, lesions with inhibitors of tyrosine hydroxylase. Linda Mutter in the WRC Toxicology Section used a spot test for tyrosine on the urine of treated rats and had positive results. Plasma tyrosine analysis further confirmed the buildup of tyrosine in treated rats.(14) M.P. Prisbylla, B.C. Onisko ,J.M. Shribbs, D.O. Adams, Y. Liu, M.K. Ellis, T.R Hawkes, L.C. Mutter, The Novel Mechanism of Action of the Herbicidal Triketones, Brighton Crop Protection Conference ‚Äì Weeds (1993.) 731-8 Work on the mode of action and toxicology of the triketones took on a broader range of interactions when Stauffer Chemical was purchased by ICI in June 1987. ICI then split off the pharmaceutical and agrochemical businesses as Zeneca and then Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals. As part of toxicology studies, Martin Ellis at the ICI Central Toxicology Laboratory identified triketone inhibition of tyrosine catabolism in rat liver and also found that tyrosine hydroxylase was not inhibited by the triketones.Ellis, M.K., A.C. Whitfield, L.A. Gowans, T.R. Auton, W.M. Provan, E.A. Lock and L.L. Smith 1995, Inhibition of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase by 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-cyclohexane-1,3-dione and 2-(2-chloro-4-methylsulfonylbenzoyl)-cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Toxicol. Appl Pharmacol. 133:12-19 He furthermore found that the urine of rats treated with III showed elevated levels of both p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and p-hydoxyphenyllactic acids. These results suggested that p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) was the enzyme that was inhibited, a fact which was confirmed by S. Lindstedt.Lindsted, W. and B. Odelh√∂g , 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase from human liver (1987) Methods Enzymol. 142;139-142 Further tests established that HPPD was the enzyme inhibited in plants as well as mammals.

The memory management function keeps track of the status of each memory location, either allocated or free. It determines how memory is allocated among competing processes, deciding which gets memory, when they receive it, and how much they are allowed. When memory is allocated it determines which memory locations will be assigned. It tracks when memory is freed or unallocated and updates the status. This is distinct from application memory management, which is how a process manages the memory assigned to it by the operating system. Memory management techniques =Single contiguous allocation= Single allocation is the simplest memory management technique. All the computer's memory, usually with the exception of a small portion reserved for the operating system, is available to the single application. MS-DOS is an example of a system which allocates memory in this way. An embedded system running a single application might also use this technique. A system using single contiguous allocation may still multitask by swapping the contents of memory to switch among users. Early versions of the MUSIC operating system used this technique. =Partitioned allocation= Partitioned allocation divides primary memory into multiple memory partitions, usually contiguous areas of memory. Each partition might contain all the information for a specific job or task. Memory management consists of allocating a partition to a job when it starts and unallocating it when the job ends. Partitioned allocation usually requires some hardware support to prevent the jobs from interfering with one another or with the operating system. The IBM System/360 used a lock-and-key technique. Other systems used base and bounds registers which contained the limits of the partition and flagged invalid accesses. The UNIVAC 1108 Storage Limits Register had separate base/bound sets for instructions and data. The system took advantage of memory interleaving to place what were called the i bank and d bank in separate memory modules. Partitions may be either static, that is defined at Initial Program Load (IPL) or boot time or by the computer operator, or dynamic, that is automatically created for a specific job. IBM System/360 Operating System Multiprogramming with a Fixed Number of Tasks (MFT) is an example of static partitioning, and Multiprogramming with a Variable Number of Tasks (MVT) is an example of dynamic. MVT and successors use the term region to distinguish dynamic partitions from static ones in other systems. Partitions may be relocatable using hardware typed memory, like the Burroughs Corporation B5500, or base and bounds registers like the PDP-10 or GE-635. Relocatable partitions are able to be compacted to provide larger chunks of contiguous physical memory. Compaction moves \\"in-use\\" areas of memory to eliminate \\"holes\\" or unused areas of memory caused by process termination in order to create larger contiguous free areas. Some systems allow partitions to be swapped out to secondary storage to free additional memory. Early versions of IBM's Time Sharing Option (TSO) swapped users in and out of a single time-sharing partition.(GC28-6698-5) =Paged memory management= Paged allocation divides the computer's primary memory into fixed-size units called page frames, and the program's virtual address space into pages of the same size. The hardware memory management unit maps pages to frames. The physical memory can be allocated on a page basis while the address space appears contiguous. Usually, with paged memory management, each job runs in its own address space. However, there are some single address space operating systems that run all processes within a single address space, such as IBM i, which runs all processes within a large address space, and IBM OS/VS2 SVS, which ran all jobs in a single 16MiB virtual address space. Paged memory can be demand-paged when the system can move pages as required between primary and secondary memory. =Segmented memory management= Segmented memory is the only memory management technique that does not provide the user's program with a \\"linear and contiguous address space.\\" Segments are areas of memory that usually correspond to a logical grouping of information such as a code procedure or a data array. Segments require hardware support in the form of a segment table which usually contains the physical address of the segment in memory, its size, and other data such as access protection bits and status (swapped in, swapped out, etc.) Segmentation allows better access protection than other schemes because memory references are relative to a specific segment and the hardware will not permit the application to reference memory not defined for that segment. It is possible to implement segmentation with or without paging. Without paging support the segment is the physical unit swapped in and out of memory if required. With paging support the pages are usually the unit of swapping and segmentation only adds an additional level of security. Addresses in a segmented system usually consist of the segment id and an offset relative to the segment base address, defined to be offset zero. The Intel IA-32 (x86) architecture allows a process to have up to 16,383 segments of up to 4GiB each. IA-32 segments are subdivisions of the computer's linear address space, the virtual address space provided by the paging hardware. The Multics operating system is probably the best known system implementing segmented memory. Multics segments are subdivisions of the computer's physical memory of up to 256 pages, each page being 1K 36-bit words in size, resulting in a maximum segment size of 1MiB (with 9-bit bytes, as used in Multics). A process could have up to 4046 segments. Rollout/Rollin Rollout/Rollin is a computer operating system memory management technique where the entire non- shared code and data of a running program is swapped out to auxiliary memory (disk or drum) to free main storage for another task. Programs may be rolled out \\"by demand end or‚Ä¶when waiting for some long event.\\" Rollout/Rollin was commonly used in time-sharing systems, where the user's \\"think time\\" was relatively long compared to the time to do the swap. Unlike virtual storage‚Äîpaging or segmentation, rollout/rollin does not require and special memory management hardware; however, unless the system has relocation hardware such as a memory map or base and bounds registers, the program must be rolled back in to its original memory locations. Rollout/rollin has been largely superseded by virtual memory. Rollout/Rollin was an optional feature of OS/360 Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks (MVT) > Rollout/rollin allows the temporary, dynamic expansion of a particular job > beyond its originally specified region. When a job needs more space, > rollout/rollin attempts to obtain unassigned storage for the job's use. If > there is no such unassigned storage, another job is rolled out -- i.e., is > transferred to auxiliary storage -- so that its region may be used by the > first job. When released by the first job, this additional storage is again > available, either (1) as unassigned storage, if that was its source, or (2) > to receive the job to be transferred back into main storage (rolled in). Note that Rollin/Rollout in OS/360 as used only for batch jobs, and rollin does not occur until the jobstep borrowing the region terminates.

Originating in P√≥voa de Varzim, it is currently observed in several towns, especially Vila do Conde and Esposende. The festival consists of a family picnic in the surrounding countryside or woodlands, known in the local dialect as Bou√ßas. Celebrations =Origins= The festival was popularized in the Ivy Festival of the 1920s, as a reminder of pagan culture and beliefs, which started from the traditional walk of the inhabitants of P√≥voa de Varzim to Anjo woodlands (Bou√ßas do Anjo), the name of the parish of Argivai (Parish of Saint Michael, the Angel). Anjo literally means angel. Part of the town's population originated in this parish in ancient times. Although currently several woodlands are used, such as Ofir and Barca do Lago in Esposende, Serra de Rates and S√£o F√©lix Hill in P√≥voa de Varzim, Mindelo and √Årvore in Vila do Conde. =The ivy as a love symbol= the Ivy, Hedera helix. The Anjo Festival was also a lovers' day. Students and other single young men waited for this day with great anxiety as it was the only day that their parents gave them complete freedom during all day and night. During the picnic people sang and danced. Girls, in the 1920s, in order to finance a local brass band used the traditional walk to the Anjo and placed themselves in the entrance of the woodlands where families had their picnic, selling ivy leaves to couples and singing ivy poems which led the couples to buy them, young men would put the ivy in their hats or pockets and girls would place them in their chests. Ivy poems: :The one who walked away from the ivy :and did not pick a leaf, :will not remember one's love. :I wish I was an ivy :to climb the wall :and look through the window :of your bedroom. =The ivy and Easter= The ivy is a very common plant in P√≥voa de Varzim, often found in granite walls that divide farmlands and, on Easter Sunday, with the arrival of Spring, they become symbolic and interweaved with Christian beliefs: the population picks ivy leaves and spreads them in the streets, especially near one's door or forming corridors meant to be stepped on by the compasso pascal, a Catholic parade that brings the Lord in the Crucifix into one's home. =Anjo as an Holiday= In the mid-20th century, Anjo day was suggested to become the P√≥voa de Varzim municipal holiday when August 15, the local holiday, was declared a national holiday, but given the fact that Easter Monday was already a public holiday during that period, Saint Peter festival was chosen as the city's holiday. Although Easter Monday is currently not observed in Portugal, cities become ghost towns during this day as the population and companies prefer to work on Holy Friday, a national holiday, to have Monday off. P√≥voa de Varzim City Hall grants the day off to its public servants and, since 1966, Vila do Conde also grants the day.

Lund was born in Sest parish, Ribe amt, Denmark. He converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) when he was 12. From 1865 to 1868, Lund was an LDS missionary in Denmark; during his mission he was a branch president. He emigrated to the United States in 1868, going on the last LDS charter sailing ship (after this LDS emigrant companies used steam ships) and was part of the last overland Mormon pioneer company before the railroad was completed. In 1869, Lund married Petra Antonie Maria Jensen, a native of Denmark. After her death he married Anna Nielsen, who was also from Denmark. Lund settled in Mount Pleasant, Utah Territory, shortly after his first marriage. He served as city recorder, member of the city council, mayor, and justice of the peace. He was a member of the territorial legislature in 1890 and 1894 and a member of the Utah State Constitutional Conventions of 1882 and 1888, both of which had their attempts to gain statehood rejected by the United States Congress. From 1879 to 1880, Lund served a mission for the LDS Church in Minnesota and the surrounding states. From 1890 to 1896, he was the bishop of the Mount Pleasant Ward. From 1896 to 1898, he served as president of the Scandinavian Mission of the LDS Church. When the North Sanpete Stake was formed in 1898, covering the northern part of the county, Lund became its first president. References *Jenson, Andrew. Latter-day Saints Biographical Encyclopedia.

The rivalry series between the two schools was largely dominated in the early years by Utah State until 1974. For the next three decades, BYU generally dominated the series with BYU winning ten straight times before the Aggies defeated the Cougars 31‚Äì16 on October 1, 2010.

Starting in 1981, the two teams have usually met on the first Friday of October, which has certain significance since it is generally the same weekend that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) holds its semiannual worldwide General Conference. The battle for the Old Wagon Wheel is an important cultural event in the state of Utah given the longstanding rivalry between the two schools and the fact that majority of the student body at both schools recognize themselves to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The road was developed to allow tourists access to the central part of the national park, and was designed in accordance with National Park Service design principles for naturalistic road design and the National Park Service Rustic style of design and construction. The new road was intended to supplant existing primitive roads that led into the park from the periphery, cutting straight through the park to its major sights. The road is designated California State Route 89. Design and construction Planning began in 1922 with survey work by Park Service Chief Engineer George E. Goodwin and landscape designer Daniel Ray Hull. A route was selected and final design work took place in 1923. There was considerable internal debate concerning the extent of the road network, and the plan was scaled back to allow for more back country. Construction began in 1925 on two sections in the southwest and northwest, intended to create a road on the eastern slopes of Lassen Peak. At the same time a ranger station was developed at Summit Lake, which was to be the midpoint of the road network. Control of the project was transferred to the Bureau of Public Roads in 1926, with design adjustments to conform to BPR practice. Work continued in the short building season available each year. In 1929 the park was expanded and the road network was adjusted to create an entrance at Manzanita Lake. The route was essentially complete in time for the park's dedication in July 1931. Work continued on surfacing and accessories, including entrance signs and rustic entrance stations at the Sulphur Works and Manzanita Lake. It was immediately apparent that further work was needed to create a durable road surface, and the road was reconstructed between 1931 and 1948, with work in the 1930s done by Civilian Conservation Corps labor. The road was finally paved entirely with asphalt in the 1950s. Further work was done in connection with the Mission 66 program in the 1950s and 60s, while blighted commercial inholdings were purchased and removed. The road was again reconstructed in the 1990s. Description The road features typical Park Service rustic details such as stone retaining walls and culvert headwalls. It is designed to work naturally with the landscape to provide a progression of views to motorists without adverse impact on the land. Major contributing structures include the Northwest Entrance Pylon, the Northeast Entrance Checking Station and Ranger Residence and the Summit Lake Ranger Station. The Raker Memorial Gateway is not listed as a contributing structure due to its extensive rebuilding. The Summit Lake Ranger Station and the area around Manzanita Lake are listed on the National Register in their own right. The highway was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 23, 2006.

After her husband died and her family forced her to end a relationship with a new lover, Wise retaliated by poisoning seventeen family members, of whom three died, in 1924. She was convicted of one of the murders, despite defense claims that she was mentally ill and that her lover had ordered her to poison her family. The case is considered one of the most sensational of the era in Ohio, where it occurred. Early life Martha Wise was born in 1884 in Hardscrabble, Ohio, to Sophie Hasel and her husband,Sources name the mother, but provide only the last name \\"Hasel\\" for the father. both of whom were farmers. Three brothers and a sister were also born to the family, although contemporary sources name only one sibling, a brother named Fred. In 1906, Martha met the substantially older Albert Wise at a box social; the two were married, though Wise neglected to give her a wedding ring. The marriage was not happy. Martha moved onto Albert's farm, but quickly discovered that he expected a farmhand more than a wife, and life was no less poor as a married woman than it had been when she lived with her parents. Even when pregnant, she was forced to do farm work that was generally male-oriented (such as plowing fields and slopping hogs) as well as the usual household chores of baking and cleaning. The couple's first child, Albert, did not survive infancy; four others, Everett, Gertrude, Kenneth, and Lester, did. Martha's main source of diversion during this period was funerals; she seldom missed a visit to any funeral held in or near Hardscrabble, whether she had known the deceased or not. When questioned, she simply said that she liked funerals. Albert Wise died suddenly in 1923, leaving his wife a 40-year-old widow with four children. Her odd behavior and fixation on funerals became more noticeable, and she began not only attending funerals, but openly crying and lamenting at them, no matter who had died. Deaths Within a year of Albert's death, Martha found new male companionship in the form of Walter Johns, who worked as a farmhand on property adjacent to her farm. The relationship was frowned upon by the Hasel family, and both her mother and her aunt, Lily Gienke, made no secret of their desire for Martha to end the relationship. By the end of 1924, Martha had acquiesced and the relationship ended. Johns moved to Cleveland and the couple lost contact. On Thanksgiving evening, 1924, several members of the family, including Martha's mother, fell ill with a severe stomach ailment. The others recovered shortly, but Sophie's illness worsened, and she died on December 13, 1924. New Year's Eve brought more illness. Lily Gienke, her husband Fred, and several of their children all began suffering stomach pains similar to those Sophie had experienced before her death. Several family members were hospitalized, and Lily and Fred were both dead by February 1925. In total, seventeen relatives were taken ill with similar symptoms in the fall and winter of 1924/1925. Four of the Gienke children were left partially paralyzed from the mysterious illness. Investigation After the deaths of the Gienkes, authorities began to investigate the cluster of deaths.Sources disagree on what triggered the investigation; the New York Daily News claims a series of unexplained fires raised suspicions, while the Daily Mirror cites reports of foul play by recovered victims of Wise's poisonings. The county sheriff, Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of arsenic. An autopsy on Lily confirmed the presence of arsenic in her digestive tract. Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Martha at first claimed she had obtained the arsenic to kill rats, but eventually confessed that she had used it to poison family members by putting it in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of. Trial Despite her confession, Martha pleaded not guilty to the charge of murdering Lily in front of a grand jury on March 23, 1925. She told the grand jury that she was irresistibly attracted to attending funerals, and that when there were not enough funerals in the community, she was driven to create them by killing. Martha was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder on April 7, 1925. Martha's trial for murder began on May 4, 1925. She was represented by Joseph Pritchard and prosecuted by Joseph Seymour. Defense claims included that Wise was criminally insane and that she was ordered to commit the murders by her former lover, Walter Johns. A number of setbacks plagued the defense, including the May 6 suicide of Martha's sister-in-law, Edith Hasel, and the subsequent collapse of her husband Fred Hasel, both of whom had been prepared to testify for the defense; the recantation of testimony by a man named Frank Metzger, who told the prosecution on cross-examination that the defense had asked him to perjure himself to support claims that Martha was insane; and her choice to take the stand on her own behalf. Family members including Martha's son, Lester, and three of the Gienkes' children testified against her. After one hour of jury deliberation, Martha was found guilty of first-degree murder. The jury urged mercy in sentencing, and the judge sentenced Martha to a life imprisonment, under the terms of which she could only be freed by executive clemency. Later life In 1962, as a result of Martha's good behavior in prison, Governor Michael DiSalle commuted her sentence to second-degree murder and she was paroled at age 79. Martha's remaining family refused to take her in, and a number of rest homes for the elderly similarly declined her residency; within three days Martha returned to prison, lacking anywhere else to go. Her parole and the commutation of her sentence were revoked. Martha died in prison on June 28, 1971. In media Martha Wise was featured in a 1930 Toledo News-Bee article series profiling \\"[w]omen who are paying the price for folly, women who gambled against society and lost\\". A 1962 issue of the St. Joseph Gazette called the Wise case \\"one of Ohio's most publicized crimes of the era\\", and she has been labeled the \\"poison widow of Hardscrabble\\" and a \\"poison fiend\\". Wise's case was covered in a 2008 episode of the Investigation Discovery series Deadly Women.

The team received its name from their home arena, the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall, and played only one season between 1915-16. The Winter Garden team was managed and coached by Arthur Sixsmith and consisted of several players from the defunct Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), which was the first openly professional hockey league. Despite the fact that former professional players were on the team, the club remained strictly amateur. Lorne Campbell and Arthur's brother, Garnet Sixsmith, played on the Winter Garden team and were both alumni of the WPHL. History Around 1914, public interest in ice skating was growing in Pittsburgh and that interest served was the focus for converting the Main Hall of Exposition Hall into the Winter Garden. Hockey was a growing sport in Pittsburgh and had been played at the Duquesne Gardens, which was located in the city's Oakland neighborhood. However, ice time at the Gardens was scarce while the demand for hockey was growing. In 1915, chiller pipes and concrete were added to the floor of the Main Hall to create an impressive ice surface. The size of the playing surface used for the Exposition's hockey games was x and was bigger than today's international size rinks. By comparison, today's National Hockey League rinks measure x . The increased size wore down visiting opponents and heavily favored the home teams. While the Winter Garden team was formed in late 1915, by Arthur Sixsmith; Roy Schooley, the manager of the Duquesne Gardens, began putting together his \\"Duquesne Garden hockey team\\". A feud soon began between the two clubs. The Duquesne and Winter Garden teams each played out-of-town opponents, often on the same night, and in direct competition of one another. On January 23, 1916, the Winter Garden team played a two-game series against the Sudbuy All-Stars, who were considered one of the best teams in Canada. The Winter Garden team defeated Sudbury, 2-0, in the first game. During the game, Pittsburgh's \\"Kewpie\\" Young collided with Sudbury's Shorty Green, resulting in the loss of several of Young's teeth. Of the opening game, the Sudbury players were reportedly overwhelmed by the size of the Garden's ice surface. However, the Winter Garden team would go on to drop the series' second game to Sudbury, 3-1.

Nine men were convicted of sex trafficking and other offences including rape, trafficking girls for sex and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child in May 2012. This resulted in Greater Manchester Police launching Operation Doublet to investigate further claims of abuse with 19 men so far being convicted. Forty-seven girls were identified as victims of child sexual exploitation during the police investigation. The men were British Pakistanis, which led to discussion on whether the failure to investigate them was linked to the authorities' fear of being accused of racial prejudice. The girls were mainly White British. In March 2015, Greater Manchester Police apologised for its failure to investigate the child sexual exploitation allegations more thoroughly between 2008‚Äì10. Sara Rowbotham, the sexual health worker who first recognised patterns of child abuse in the community and fought to bring these crimes to police attention, was made redundant in 2014. A former Detective Constable who was investigating the grooming gangs, Margaret Oliver, resigned in 2012 in disgust of the handling of the cases by the police force and spoke out as a whistleblower to inform the public. Perpetrators Twelve men were initially charged with sex trafficking and other offences including: rape, trafficking girls for sex and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child. Nine men were convicted, of whom eight were of British Pakistani origin and one was an Afghan asylum- seeker. Of the three not convicted, one was cleared of all charges, the jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case of the second, and the third was not present at the trial after fleeing to Pakistan whilst on bail. Most of the men were married and well-respected within their community. One gang member convicted of sex trafficking was a religious studies teacher at a mosque and a married father of five. The men were aged between 24-59 and all knew each other. Two worked for the same taxi firm and another two worked at a takeaway restaurant; some came from the same village in Pakistan and another two men shared a flat. The gang worked to secure underage girls for sex. Abuse The abuse of underage girls that occurred in 2008 and 2009 centred around two takeaways in Heywood near Rochdale. Despite one victim going to the police in 2008 to report the child grooming, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to prosecute two men, invoking the witness's lack of credibility. Attempts by Rochdale Crisis Intervention Team co-ordinator for the NHS, Sara Rowbotham, to alert police and authorities to \\"patterns of sexual abuse\\" were ignored. Between 2003 and 2014, Rowbotham made more than 180 attempts to alert police and social services but was told the witnesses were not reliable. As a result of the CPS dropping the case, the police halted their investigation, which was resumed when a second girl made complaints of a similar nature in December 2009. The CPS's original decision was overturned in 2011 when a new chief prosecutor for the region, Nazir Afzal, a first generation British-Pakistani, was appointed. The victims, vulnerable teenagers from deprived, dysfunctional backgrounds, were targeted in \\"honeypot locations\\" where young people congregated, such as takeaway food shops. One victim, a 15-year-old known as the Honey Monster, acted as a recruiter, procuring girls as young as 13 for the gang. The victims were coerced and bribed into keeping quiet about the abuse by a combination of alcohol and drugs, food, small sums of money and other gifts. The oldest person to be convicted, Shabir Ahmed, was for a while the main trafficker of the victims. On one occasion he ordered a girl aged 15 to have sex with Kabeer Hassan, as a \\"treat\\" for his birthday ‚Äî Hassan then raped the girl himself. Abdul Aziz, a married father of three, took over from Shabir Ahmed as the main trafficker and was paid by various men to supply underage girls for sex. Victims were physically assaulted and raped by as many as five men at a time, or obliged to have sex with \\"several men in a day, several times a week\\". The victims, plied with drugs and alcohol, were passed around friends and family, and taken to various locations in the north of England, including Rochdale, Oldham, Nelson, Bradford and Leeds. The abusers paid small sums of money for the encounters. One 13-year-old victim recounted that, after being forced to have sex in exchange for vodka, her abuser immediately raped her again and gave her ¬£40 to not say anything about the incident. Among the incidents recorded by the police were a 15-year-old victim too drunk to recall being raped by 20 men, one after the other; and another victim so drunk that she vomited over the side of the bed as she was being raped by two men. One 13-year-old victim had an abortion after becoming pregnant. Trial and sentences Some gang members told the court the girls were willing participants and happy having sex with the men. The ringleader, 59-year-old Shabir Ahmed, claimed the girls were \\"prostitutes\\" who had been running a \\"business empire\\" and it was all \\"white lies\\". He shouted in court, \\"Where are the white people? You have only got my kind here.\\" Shabir Ahmed's threatening behaviour and calling Judge Gerald Clifton a \\"racist bastard\\" resulted in him being banned from the court for the sentencing hearing. The trial concluded in May 2012 with the nine convictions. Shabir Ahmed received the longest sentence, 19 years for rape, aiding and abetting a rape, sexual assault, trafficking for sexual exploitation and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children. Mohammed Sajid was sentenced to 12 years for rape, sexual activity with a girl under 16, trafficking for sexual exploitation and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children. Kabeer Hassan was sentenced to nine years for rape and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children. Abdul Aziz received a similar sentence: nine years (concurrently) for trafficking for sexual exploitation and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children. Abdul Rauf was sentenced to six years for trafficking for sexual exploitation and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children. Adil Khan was sentenced to eight years for the same offences. Mohammed Amin received a five-year sentence for sexual assault and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children. Another five-year sentence was given to Abdul Qayyum for conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children, while Hamid Safi received four years for trafficking for sexual exploitation and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children. Four of the convicted, Shabir Ahmed, Adil Khan, Abdul Rauf and Abdul Aziz, who had dual British and Pakistani citizenships, had their British citizenships revoked by then Home Secretary Theresa May in order for them to be deported to Pakistan. May stated the revocations were ‚Äúconducive to the public good‚Äù. Second sex ring and Operation Doublet Following the break up of the first sex ring in May 2012, the police made arrests in relation to another child sexual exploitation ring in Rochdale. Nine men between 24 and 38 years old were arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with a child. Operation Doublet was launched at the same time as an investigation into child grooming and sexual abuse in the region. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood said that about 550 officers were working on Operation Doublet in May 2013. He said the investigation was at \\"an extremely sensitive stage\\" and street grooming was the force's top priority, \\"a bigger priority than gun crime\\". He said the investigation was looking at cases in Rochdale dating back to 2003. In March 2015, ten men aged between 26 and 45 were charged with serious sex offences against seven females aged between 13 and 23 at the time. The alleged offences that took place in Rochdale between 2005 and 2013 included rape, conspiracy to rape, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, sexual activity with a child, and sexual assault. Reaction and public debate The case raised a serious debate about whether the crimes were racially motivated. Suggestions emerged that police and social work departments failed to act when details of the gang emerged for fear of appearing racist, and vulnerable white teenagers being groomed by Pakistani men were ignored. A report by the deputy children's commissioner in 2012 said that 33% of child sex abuse by gangs in Britain was committed by British Asians, where Asians are 7% of the population, but concluded that it was \\"irresponsible\\" to dwell on the data. Ann Cryer, Labour MP for Keighley, recalled in a BBC documentary filmed in 2012 that she had worked with the families of the victims involved, and had been \\"round at the police station virtually every week\\" and was \\"begging\\" both the police and social services to do something. Cryer said, \\"Neither the police nor social services would touch those cases. I think it was because they were afraid of being called racist.\\"\\"Quitting the English Defence League: When Tommy Met Mo\\" BBC One, Producer/Director: Amanda McGlynn: video from 18:14. Broadcast 28 October 2013. Accessed 31 October 2013 Cryer had attempted to reach the Muslim community and persuade it to take action: \\"I went to a friend of mine, who was a local councillor and happened to be a Muslim and therefore able to represent me to the elders, because I thought it was a good move to try to get those elders involved. I hoped that I would be able to persuade the elders to go knocking on doors and say 'this behaviour is un-Islamic and I want it to stop because I'm going to tell the whole community about you and what you‚Äôre doing if you don‚Äôt'. Now they weren‚Äôt prepared to do that.\\"\\"Quitting the English Defence League: When Tommy Met Mo\\" BBC One: video from 19:13. Broadcast 28 October 2013. Accessed 31 October 2013 Tim Loughton, the Minister for Children and Families, said that while there was no evidence that ethnic communities condoned child sexual abuse, he was concerned that some had been slow to report it to the police, and urged police and social workers not to allow \\"political correctness around ethnicity\\" to hinder their work to apprehend such criminals. In late 2011, the Office of the Children's Commissioner began a two-year long inquiry into child sexual exploitation by street gangs. The inquiry issued its final report in November 2013. After members of the Rochdale gang were sentenced, the UK's Department for Education announced new funding for a specialist foster care scheme to protect vulnerable children in residential care, where some victims had been. =The Times report of 5 January 2011= A report by The Times on 5 January 2011, related to convictions for child sex grooming in the North and Midlands. Of the 56 offenders convicted since 1997 for crimes relating to on-street grooming of girls aged 11 to 16, three were white, 53 were Asian of which 50 were Muslim, and most were from the British Pakistani community. Furthermore, The Times article alleged: \\"with the exception of one town there is scant evidence of work being undertaken in British Pakistani communities to confront the problem\\" of \\"pimping gangs\\" largely consisting of \\"members of the British Pakistani community\\". The findings have been questioned by researchers Ella Cockbain and Helen Brayley, from whose work for the UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science The Times report had drawn much of its evidence. \\"The citations are correct but they have been taken out of context,\\" Cockbain told The Independent; \\"Nor do they acknowledge the small sample size of the original research, which focused on just two large cases.\\" Cockbain and Brayley expressed concern that \\"findings were being overextended from a small, geographically concentrated sample to characterise an entire crime type\\". =Coalition for the Removal of Pimping= Hilary Willmer, representing a Leeds-based support group for parents of sexually exploited girls, the Coalition for the Removal of Pimping (Crop), was quoted as saying \\"The vast majority [of] perpetrators are Pakistani Asians\\", with sources inside Crop claiming a percentage as high as 80 per cent although, The Independent said that \\"Kurdish, Romanian and Albanian gangs were also involved\\". Willmer added: \\"We think this is the tip of the iceberg\\", although she cautioned against treating the matter as a race crime: \\"It's a criminal thing.\\" By May 2012, according to The Independent, Crop had \\"gone suddenly silent\\" concerning the percentage of abusers of Asian origin who had come to the organisation's attention: Willmer explained to the paper: \\"We've been accused of being a cover for the BNP\\". =Child protection organisations= In 2011, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre launched a five-month long investigation into whether there was a link between racial profile and the crime of underage grooming. The organisation defined underage grooming as any situation where a child or young person received a gift in exchange for sexual favours. It drew statistics from organisations such as Barnardo's but the findings were considered inconclusive by expert academics because not all the figures had been compiled in the same way and ethnicity had not always been noted with each reported crime. Ella Cockbain and Helen Brayley pointed out, \\"There is no criminal offence of 'on-street grooming' and as a result it is very difficult to measure the extent of the crime based on court statistics.\\" Further research has been pursued since late 2011 by the Office of the Children's Commissioner. Wendy Shepherd, child sexual exploitation project manager for Barnardo's in the north of England, said that since she started working with the organisation, there has been \\"a shift from the men selling children in ones or twos to something that is much more organised in groups and networks. The networks of men come from different backgrounds: in the North and Midlands many have been British Asians; in Devon it was white men; in Bath and Bristol, Afro-Caribbeans; in London, all ethnic mixes, whites, Iraqis, Kurds, Afghans, Somalis.‚Äù She noted that white male predators on the street tend to work alone. She added: \\"The danger with saying that the problem is with one ethnicity is that then people will only be on the lookout for that group ‚Äì and will risk missing other threats.\\" The former head of Barnardo's, Martin Narey, said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \\"For this particular type of crime, the street grooming of teenage girls in northern towns ‚Ä¶ there is very troubling evidence that Asians are overwhelmingly represented in the prosecutions for such offences.\\" Narey rejected the idea that such gangs were specifically targeting white girls, but suggested vulnerable girls on the street were more likely to be white since Asian girls were subjected to strict parenting and were more likely to be kept off the streets. =Response from Muslim spokespeople= In a BBC documentary investigating grooming young girls for sex by some Pakistani men, Imam Irfan Chishti from the Rochdale Council of Mosques deplored the practice, saying it was \\"very shocking to see fellow British Muslims brought to court for this kind of horrific offence.\\" Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, accused elders of the Pakistani community of \\"burying their heads in the sand\\" on the matter of sexual grooming. He said that of convictions involving child sexual exploitation, 87% were of British Pakistani men and it was a significant problem for that community. He said the actions of criminals who thought \\"white teenage girls are worthless and can be abused\\" were \\"bringing shame on our community.\\" Sayeeda Warsi, co-chairperson of the Conservative Party, in an interview with the Evening Standard, said \\"You can only start solving a problem if you acknowledge it first,\\" and added, \\"This small minority who see women as second class citizens, and white women probably as third class citizens, are to be spoken out against.\\" She described the Rochdale case as \\"even more disgusting\\" than cases of girls being passed around street gangs, as the perpetrators \\"were grown men, some of them religious teachers or running businesses, with young families of their own.\\" Nazir Afzal, who as the newly appointed chief crown prosecutor decided to bring the case to trial, said that gender, not race, was the key issue: \\"There is no community where women and girls are not vulnerable to sexual attack and that's a fact.\\" =Hindu and Sikh objections= Hindu and Sikh groups have objected to media use of the \\"Asian\\" description saying that the culprits were \\"almost always of Pakistani origin\\" and \\"Muslim\\". They contend that clouding the issue by calling them \\"Asians\\" is unfair towards other groups and detrimental to a frank discussion. =Taxi controversy= Two of the convicted gang members worked at Eagle Taxis, which was taken over by Car 2000 after the scandal. The company's owner said that due to requests, clients could choose to have a white driver but this was reversed after 50 Asian drivers protested. =Moral panic= One study suggested that the British media's portrayal of South Asian men as perpetrators of sexual violence against white victims is an example of a moral panic. In particular they pointed out that the inquiry by the Office of the Children's Commissioner found that, while a majority of victims were white and a majority of perpetrators were men of South Asian descent, there were many cases where \\"perpetrators and their victims were ethnically diverse.\\" =BBC series= In May 2017, the BBC broadcast Three Girls, a miniseries about the case. Actress Maxine Peake starred in the series as Sara Rowbotham, the sexual health aid worker who first uncovered the patterns of severe abuse in the area, but struggled to bring it to the attention of authorities. Actress Lesley Sharp played the police detective Margaret Oliver in the series. Review of police actions In December 2013, the case review by Rochdale County was leaked, which highlighted findings from an internal police investigation. The review acknowledged that police officers might have discriminatory attitudes towards the victims, that the victims were interviewed by detectives without training in child exploitation and no strategy when victims returned to their abusers. One example mentioned was the issue of child protection for one of the victims, which was discussed in 40 meetings, without any record of police attendance. Also cited were a lack of managerial oversight in 2008 and 2009 and lack of resources and managerial support for the investigations despite formal requests. Finally, officers did not challenge a Crown Prosecution Service decision not to prosecute. The review recommended the Greater Manchester Police establish a monitoring system and commit to maintaining a child sexual exploitation team. On 13 March 2015, Greater Manchester Police apologised for its failure to investigate child sexual exploitation allegations more thoroughly between 2008 and 2010. The apology was made after a review by the Independent Police Complaints Commission \\"examined the conduct and actions of 13 officers who were involved in Operation Span and the policing of Rochdale Division.\\" Operation Span was the investigation launched in December 2009 into allegations made against the individuals who were convicted in 2012, and others. Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley said that, at the time of the earlier investigation, \\"there was a strong target driven focus, predominantly on serious acquisitive crime. At best this was distracting for leaders and influenced the areas that resources were focused on\\". She said that seven officers had been served with misconduct notices, but no further disciplinary action would be taken against them. Copley said: \\"We apologise to the victims and we give them our assurance that lessons have been learned, changes have been made and we are determined to use this to continue making improvements.\\" Greater Manchester Police, Report into Rochdale CSE investigation, 13 March 2015. Retrieved 13 March 2015 One of the seven officers retired without any sanctions being taken, even though his misconduct was found to have warranted disciplinary action.

It was released in 1989 for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, MSX and ZX Spectrum. Gameplay The game consists of five levels based on events from the movie. Each stage has a time limit and a health gauge (represented by Batman's face turning into the Joker's), with Batman losing a life if he runs out of either. The levels have varying gameplay: * In the first level, styled as side-scrolling gameplay, Batman fights his way through the Axis Chemical Plant to confront Jack Napier, knocking him into a vat of chemicals and turning him into the Joker. Batman can use his Batarangs and grapple gun to defeat enemies. The grapple gun can also be used to climb to higher platforms and swing across gaps. * In the second level, Batman drives his Batmobile across Gotham City, dodging traffic and using a grapple to turn corners at high speed. Missing three consecutive turns causes Batman to run into a police roadblock and costs the player one life, regardless of the timer and health gauge. * The third level is a Mastermind-like puzzle set in the Batcave, in which Batman must identify various components for Smilex, the deadly chemical that the Joker has laced into consumer products. The player must determine the three poisoned items from a group of eight; every incorrect guess carries a health penalty. * The fourth level takes place during the Joker's parade, in which Batman must fly the Batwing and cut away balloons filled with Smilex gas without hitting the balloons themselves or the floats to which they are tethered. * In the fifth and final level, styled similarly to the first, Batman climbs to the top of Gotham City Cathedral and must stop the Joker from escaping on a helicopter. Release =Batman Pack= Commodore UK reached an agreement with Ocean Software to bundle the game with Amiga 500 computers. Between October 1989 and September 1990, A500 machines were sold in the United Kingdom in Batman-themed boxes containing the game and The NewZealand Story, as well as F/A-18 Interceptor and Deluxe Paint II, both contributed by Electronic Arts. With an initial commission of 10,000 units, a total of 186,000 were sold at the end of the run, making it the most successful Amiga bundle ever sold by Commodore. Reception The game was number 1 in the Spectrum charts for February 1990 and was awarded Game of the Year in Crash magazine.http://www.crashonline.org.uk/75/awards.htm Computer Gaming World recommended the Amiga version to action fans, but reported that the Commodore 64 version was too buggy, but was well received by Commodore Format magazine and was seen as one of the best movie tie-in games released for the platform.

As usual, higher U-rank indicates less restriction, and the existence of a U-rank for all types over all sets is equivalent to an important model-theoretic condition: in this case, superstability.  Definition  U-rank is defined inductively, as follows, for any (complete) n-type p over any set A: * U(p) ‚â• 0 * If Œ¥ is a limit ordinal, then U(p) ‚â• Œ¥ precisely when U(p) ‚â• Œ± for all Œ± less than Œ¥ * For any Œ± = Œ≤ + 1, U(p) ‚â• Œ± precisely when there is a forking extension q of p with U(q) ‚â• Œ≤ We say that U(p) = Œ± when the U(p) ‚â• Œ± but not U(p) ‚â• Œ± + 1\\\\. If U(p) ‚â• Œ± for all ordinals Œ±, we say the U-rank is unbounded, or U(p) = ‚àû. Note: U-rank is formally denoted U_n(p), where p is really p(x), and x is a tuple of variables of length n. This subscript is typically omitted when no confusion can result.  Ranking theories  U-rank is monotone in its domain. That is, suppose p is a complete type over A and B is a subset of A. Then for q the restriction of p to B, U(q) ‚â• U(p). If we take B (above) to be empty, then we get the following: if there is an n-type p, over some set of parameters, with rank at least Œ±, then there is a type over the empty set of rank at least Œ±. Thus, we can define, for a complete (stable) theory T, U_n(T)=\\\\sup \\\\\\\\{ U_n(p) : p\\\\in S(T) \\\\\\\\}. We then get a concise characterization of superstability; a stable theory T is superstable if and only if U_n(T)<\\\\infty for every n.  Properties  * As noted above, U-rank is monotone in its domain. * If p has U-rank Œ±, then for any Œ≤ < Œ±, there is a forking extension q of p with U-rank Œ≤. * If p is the type of b over A, there is some set B extending A, with q the type of b over B. * If p is unranked (that is, p has U-rank ‚àû), then there is a forking extension q of p which is also unranked. * Even in the absence of superstability, there is an ordinal Œ≤ which is the maximum rank of all ranked types, and for any Œ± < Œ≤, there is a type p of rank Œ±, and if the rank of p is greater than Œ≤, then it must be ‚àû.  Examples  * U(p) > 0 precisely when p is nonalgebraic. * If T is the theory of algebraically closed fields (of any fixed characteristic) then U_1(T)=1. Further, if A is any set of parameters and K is the field generated by A, then a 1-type p over A has rank 1 if (all realizations of) p are transcendental over K, and 0 otherwise. More generally, an n-type p over A has U-rank k, the transcendence degree (over K) of any realization of it.

Georgians themselves destroyed the fortifications of Uplistsikhe, so it wouldn't fall to the hands of the enemy. The Muslim forces then raided Meskheti as well, but were unable to take the Tmogvi fortress and retreated. On the way they besieged Q'ueli fortress and took it despite stiff resistance. Muslims captured the military commander of the castle, Gobron, and put him to death. He was later canonized by Georgian Orthodox Church. Despite his military successes Abu l'Kasim was unable to attain his goal. He was forced to finally retreat from Georgian lands because of stubborn resistance by people whose lands he was so eager to ravage and subject. The Georgian chronicle also mentions another expedition between 918 and 923 of the \\"Saracens called Saj\\", in the course of which Mtskheta was taken and the Monastery of the Holy Cross burned down. The Muslim sources are silent about these events.

Shot in New York City, The Golden Boat is Ruiz's first film produced in the United States and has been categorized as an absurdist black comedy. The setting of New York City is not only important to the plot of the film but also its production, for the film was ‚Äúmade in cooperation with the New York performance art group, The Kitchen.‚Äù Ruiz channels the performances of the individuals in the art group in order to complete a ‚Äútransposition of both US and Mexican soap operas‚Äù on screen. The film's low budget was put together through a collaboration of small production companies; Duende Pictures, Nomad Films (Luxembourg), A.A.L.B. Partners, with the film's ludic nature being born out of, or produced through, the ‚Äúcollaboration with the postmodern performance group ‚ÄòThe Kitchen.‚Äô‚Äù One thing that is abundantly clear about the film is its lack of obviousness or clarity, which makes it all the more interesting that this film marked one of the first times that Ruiz shot from a script. But even with a script Ruiz‚Äôs The Golden Boat is elusive and ever-changing narrative, a film in flux. \\"In the United States you have to play by the rules,\\" claimed Ruiz, who was living in the United States for the first time while he teaches film at Harvard. But a man making a feature for $125,000, from a script he wrote in two days and rewrites at whim, with a cast of mostly nonprofessional actors, who did not even know where his post- production money would come from, is not playing by U.S. rules. Yet in his standards this film's production was much more structured than his past works, for Ruiz stated that his American film was very organized. He compares it to his works in France, saying ‚ÄúI have shot scenes where I didn't know which actors were coming. I usually write the scene about one hour before the take.\\" The film seems to break all standard conventions in a way that only Ruiz knows how to do so masterfully well. As a spectator one is left wondering what the film is about, as it's ‚Äúa sort of Beckettian black comedy of anti-manners, involving New Yorkers who insult and knife each other and themselves and then return from the dead - ask the question, provoke guffaws, and never get an answer. More often people defined the story by what it was not: as the Wooster Group's Kate Valk, the Mexican soap-opera star, lectured me, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no psychologically linear narrative. It‚Äôs more formal, more surreal. I am the sound of my voice, which is the same as the color of the room.‚Äù Members of the production crew were given little direction in a way that provides legitimacy to the power of not knowing. Continuity is nearly entirely absent, for Michael Kirby, the NYU professor of performance studies who was playing Austin, a knife-wielding philosopher, said The Golden Boat had \\"the strange continuity of a dream. The smallest thing that comes into a dream will suddenly make it take off in that direction.\\" When asked about this, Ruiz began making air-drawn maps that turned and wandered and branched out like some unstoppable family tree. \\"You can follow this direction or you can follow that direction and then suddenly there's another one which moves parallel to that one,\\" he said. The film deconstructs traditional narrative techniques, multiplying the linguistic eccentricities. The Golden Boat was realized on a small budget, relying on the avant-garde theater company The Kitchen. Several important actors on the New York scene took part in the film such as filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, writer Kathy Acker, Vito Acconci, John Zorn, the Wooster Group, or Annie Sprinkle. Plot The Golden Boat is inspired by American police series, mixed with Mexican soap operas, and immersed in the artistic context of the Underground Art scene of the early 1990s of New York. In the street, a young student of philosophy and criticism at The Village Voice, Israel Williams, meets Austin, an old man hurt and desperately in love with a soap opera star. Although he was stabbed several times, Austin does not seem to be affected by his injuries and refuses to go to see a doctor. He asks Israel to help him find his alienated son. Things get complicated when Israel discovers that the old man turns out to be a murderer. Israel is soon losing itself in a strange world populated by international celebrities, Marxist employees, and postmodern literary critics. Shortly summed up as an absurdist odyssey through downtown Manhattan with a sweet old serial killer, a student rock-music critic, and international bohemians. The film is centered around the curious student Israel and the knife-happy Austin. Criminals in the film are desensitized and/or numb, with themes centralized around death, confusion, craziness, cowardice and loneliness. There are certainly more questions raised than answers given and the narrative seems to unfold in a way that parallels the narrative that is life. The film is primarily shot in color during which the audio, or music, seems to undermine the visuals through a technique of cutting in and out quickly. Ruiz jumps back and forth quite a bit from color to black and white visuals, during which the music seems to play a different role, for during the black and white shots the music seems to add to the visuals in a hyper-melodramatic way. Cast and Crew Michael Kirby - Austin Federico Muchnik - Israel Williams Brett Alexander - Doc Mary Hestand - Alina Michael Stumm - Tony Luna Kate Valk - Amelia Lopes Production Design by Sermin Kardestuncer Art Direction by Flavia Galuppo Cinematography by Maryse Alberti Sound Design by Piero Mura Edited by Sylvia Waliga Music by John Zorn Associate Producers: Scott Macaulay, Dimitri de Clercq and Jacques de Clercq Produced by James Schamus + Jordi Torrent Written and Directed by Ra√∫l Ruiz Reception The film was generally well- received at its time, described as ‚Äúsomewhat plotted than the standard Ruiz pastiche.‚Äù ‚ÄúReality, dream and time merge in a vertiginous warped continuum. Ruiz seems to be suggesting that human redemption and spiritual resurrection are possible in the most benighted landscapes. None of this is meant to be taken too seriously.‚Äù The reviewer for Variety claims that Ruiz ‚Äúbenefits from working in English and on location in New York. Although unmistakably a Ruiz concoction, ‚ÄúThe Golden Boat‚Äù has a punchy contemporary atmosphere lacking in his French-language museum pieces. Bizarre editing and no-frills cinematography make for arrestingly disconcerting images that evoke a cockeyed alternative universe.‚Äù J. Hoberman for The Village Voice: The least one can say for The Golden Boat is that it should show would-be purveyors of ironic noir how it‚Äôs done. In addition to the requisite impossible camera angles and loop-de-loop dialogue, the movie is characterized by its bloody tableaux, circular structure, and pervasive hacienda music. The locations range from a Bowery flophouse to Mary Boone's loft to a pink-walled Loisaida apartment, and there‚Äôs some superb local color: the garbage that stews some Soho alley includes a half dozen pairs of shoes. Caryn James for The New York Times: ‚ÄúThe Golden Boat‚Äù will be shown at midnight as part of the New York Film Festival, and though that slot is an appropriate tribute to its hip, cult sensibility, the film deserves prime time. Mr. Ruiz's absurdist wit and skewed visual style have rarely been so accessible. His often laborious artistic imagery has never been so distant as it is from this slight, gleeful work. The twisty narrative line is as smooth and nonsensical as the film's opening shot, in which the camera glides at ankle level through garbage-strewn gutters, following a trail of abandoned shoes. But unlike most Ruiz films, ‚ÄúThe Golden Boat‚Äù at least has a narrative, however loopy it may be.

ToolBook uses a book metaphor ‚Äî a project file is thought of as a book containing pages of content. This is very similar to Microsoft PowerPoint‚Äôs use of the metaphor where presentations contain various slides. ToolBook was often compared to HyperCard and Visual Basic. The first version of ToolBook was demonstrated in a 1990 episode of \\"The Computer Chronicles\\", in an episode about Windows 3.0.  Runtime environments  ToolBook allows for the creation of applications and training materials for Windows and the web. To support these two distribution models, ToolBook contains two different programming environments. *OpenScript: ToolBook includes a very capable built-in programming language called OpenScript, which is similar to HyperTalk. OpenScript is object oriented and event-driven, where chunks of programming code are associated to the different elements within the lesson. The OpenScript language only functions within the Native engine of ToolBook. It does not function in DHTML delivered content. *Actions Editor: The Actions Editor is another programming environment where the syntax is virtually identical to OpenScript. The biggest difference is that the Actions Editor is not as powerful a language as OpenScript. Whereas OpenScript has over a thousand commands and functions, the Actions Editor contains perhaps 80. However, Actions Editor programming code works equally well within ToolBook (Native) as well as in a web browser (DHTML).  Features  ToolBook‚Äôs key features are: *Catalog - The Catalog is a repository of objects that can be added to your project. For example: Text fields, Buttons, Question Objects, Rectangles, Navigation Controls. You can even add your own objects to the catalog so that they can be used later in different projects. *Book Explorer - The Book Explorer will display a tree-view breakdown of all objects on a given page. *PowerPoint Converter - The PowerPoint Add-on (called SumTotal Publish To ToolBook) will allow you to convert a PowerPoint presentation into a ToolBook file. Once installed, you'll find this Add-on within the main Ribbon within PowerPoint. *Simulation Recorder - The Simulation Recorder will watch and record you interacting with another application, and allow you to import that simulation into ToolBook as an interactive simulation (this is not a video recording). *Simulation Editor - You can create your own simulations manually or edit/modify a simulation you recorded using the Simulation Recorder. Simulations can be played back in 3 modes: Demonstration (sit back and watch), Practice (provides detailed next- step instruction to user, allowing them to complete the simulation), Assessment (let the user attempt the simulation by themselves). *Path Animation - Any object in ToolBook can be configured to move (animate) across the page using a simple or even complex path. *Media Players - ToolBook supports the ability to play Audio and Videos in a wide variety of formats, supported by these 4 media technologies: Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, QuickTime, Flash. *SCORM/AICC - ToolBook provides SCORM and AICC support within web-published lessons for use in SCORM/AICC compliant Learning Management Systems. *AutoPackager - In order to distribute a Native lesson or application to a Windows computer (in non-DHTML format), the AutoPackager is used. It has the ability to wrap your lesson into a Windows Installer so an end user can install it onto their computer. *Quiz - Many question objects (True/False, Multiple-Choice, Match Item, etc.) exist in ToolBook to allow you to create a training lesson. Various scoring behaviors also exist, such as Score This Page (or Range of Pages). Using the Actions Editor, you can design complex navigation within a lesson based on individual question scores.

The Observatory is located in the town of Weston, Massachusetts, about west of downtown Boston.Weston Observatory The Observatory, which has been recording earthquakes since the 1930s, conducts research on earthquakes and related processes, delivers public information after significant earthquakes occur, contributes to earthquake awareness to help reduce the tragic effects of earthquakes, and educates. Front view of Weston Observatory. Weston Observatory houses seismic instruments for the New England Seismic Network (NESN)New England Seismic Network and for the World-Wide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN), as well as office and lab space and a geophysics library. The Observatory monitors earthquakes around the world, with emphasis on the Northeast United States (and particularly New England), disseminates information pertinent to any seismic events that are recorded, and is also a center for education and public outreach about earthquakes and related phenomena. Weston Observatory StaffEarthquake Maps  History  The first Weston Observatory seismographs were installed at the Campion Center, next to the current Observatory, and began recording earthquakes in January 1931. The instruments were maintained by the Jesuits for many decades and were relocated to the newly built Weston College (now the Weston Observatory) in 1949. The Observatory became affiliated with Boston College in 1947 and the buildings and grounds were bought by BC in the late 1970s. History of Weston Observatory The WWSSN instruments were installed late in 1961. Summary of the World-wide Standardized Seismograph Network Research The primary focus of Weston Observatory research is on the study of earthquakes and related phenomena. Observatory scientists study earthquakes both regionally and worldwide, conduct seismic hazard analyses, and are involved in earthquake hazard mitigation studies. =Seismic monitoring of New England= Weston Observatory analyzes data from a network of 17 seismographs throughout New England called the New England Seismic Network (NESN). Weston Observatory Most stations operate the Trillium 120PA broadband seismometer with a Reftek-147 accelerometer while others continue to operate the Guralp CMG-40T broadband seismometer. All stations have a RefTek-130 data logger that transmits ground motion data to the Observatory over the internet. Data from each NESN station, as well as data from stations in the region maintained by other agencies, is stored by Earthworm software and analyzed continuously by event detection programs. Also, seismologists at the Observatory regularly check the data and confirm reports of earthquakes either from the detection program or from reports of felt tremors from the public. =Geologic studies and paleobotany laboratory= Although the primary focus of Weston Observatory is on the study of earthquakes, other Earth Science related studies are also pursued at the Observatory. Two prominent examples are: Geologic Studies (with a focus on the Northeastern United States) and Paleobotany (the origin and early evolution of land plants). Geologists at Weston Observatory study of the assembly and breakup of supercontinents through time, map and analyze the regional geology of selected localities in terranes surrounding the Atlantic Ocean. Having been at an active plate margin millions of years ago, the Northeastern United States has very complex and interesting geology. Weston Observatory scientists study the local geology of southern New England and have published a number of books about the local geology, including: Roadside Geology of MassachusettsSkehan, James W. (2001). Roadside Geology of Massachusetts (2001 ed.). Mountain Press Publishing Company. . - Total pages: 379 and Roadside Geology of Connecticut and Rhode Island.Skehan, James W. (2008). Roadside Geology of Connecticut and Rhode Island(2008 ed.). Mountain Press Publishing Company. . - Total pages: 304 The Paleobotany Laboratory at Weston Observatory is engaged in research on the origin and early evolution of land plants based on fossil spores from lower Paleozoic rocks from around the world.Paleobotany  Science education and public outreach  Seismometer and other instruments for science education and public outreach. The broader mission of Weston Observatory is to integrate seismology research with science education and public outreach, focusing on earthquakes and related phenomena. Weston Observatory operates the Boston College Educational Seismology Project (BC- ESP). The BC-ESP began as a program to operate seismographs in K-12 schools, and based on those classroom seismographs, it continues to provide educational enrichment for students of all ages, using seismology as a medium for a broad- based science education program.Classroom Seismographs and the Challenge of Encouraging a Culture of Scientific Inquiry in K‚Äì12 Schools, A.L.

It opened in 2017. History =Development= Natural Resources Wales signed a lease agreement with Vattenfall of Sweden and its British-based subsidiary Vattenfall United Kingdom (formerly Nuon Renewables), to develop what will be the United Kingdom's highest altitude wind farm, on a site owned by Natural Resources Wales, previously the Forestry Commission Wales. The project has seen the installation of 76 turbines with a peak power of 228 MWp, that are planned to operate for 25 years, and to generate up to 0.6 TWh/yr, an amount enough to power up to 140 000 homes with an annual consumption of 4 266 kWh. The turbine manufacturer is Siemens Wind Power. During the planning process, Vattenfall (at that time: Nuon) agreed to contribute about ¬£1.85m annually to a community fund and to invest ¬£3m in a habitat restoration scheme, and the following parties contributed to the debate: *Glyncorrwg Action Group: the wind farm will look down on the village of Glyncorrwg in the Afan Valley. Residents of the village campaigned against the development, which they claim would destroy the character of the landscape. *Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales: objected on the grounds of its potential impact on a sensitive peat habitat. *Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council: the planning committee decided not to object to the scheme in January 2012, after councillors carried out a site visit, although they set a number of conditions. The project gained final planning permission in May 2012. =Construction and opening= The first turbine was fully completed in April 2016 and began generating electricity in autumn 2016. The final (76th) turbine was installed on 2 March 2017, and the farm has been fully operational since 7 May 2017. The farm was officially opened in September 2017.Pen-y-Cymoedd wind farm officially opens, BBC News (September 26, 2017).

The film's nonlinear narrative spans nine interweaving stories, most of which take place in the 17th or 18th centuries and feature fantastical characters such as pirates, nuns, young priests, a cannibal, a sultana, the Devil, and many more. To further complicate the already dizzying web of tales, many different characters are played by the same handful of actors across stories. This theme of the same individual portraying numerous identities extends beyond the limits of this one film (as many of Ruiz's themes do) and can be viewed in the larger context of Ruiz's work: for instance, lead actor Melvil Poupaud has been in several of Ruiz's films since his childhood. In 1983, at the age of ten, he starred in Ruiz's City of Pirates and went on to act in The Insomniac on the Bridge (1985), Treasure Island (1985), Three Lives and Only One Death (1996), Genealogies of a Crime (1997) and Mysteries of Lisbon (2010). Shot in Sintra (where Ruiz had made The Territory almost 20 years previously) and produced by Gemini Films, Madroga Filmes, Canal+ and Radiotelevisao Portuguesa, among others, Love Torn in a Dream premiered in August 2000 at the Montreal World Film Festival where it won a FIPRESCI Prize. From there, it went on to be released in France in November 2000, in Portugal in May 2001, in the Netherlands in January 2002 at the International Film Festival Rotterdam, and in Poland in October 2002 at the Warsaw Film Festival.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252335/releaseinfo?ref_=ttco_sa_2 Plot Opening in black and white with a puzzlingly self-aware narrated scene of Love Torn Within a Dream producer Paulo Branco welcoming the cast at a celebratory ceremony, the film quickly establishes (with the help of an illustrated configuration upon a chalkboard, one that explicitly references the theories of Ramon Lull‚Äôs ars combinatoria, one of Ruiz‚Äôs ongoing artistic preoccupations) that there are nine stories that will weave in and out of each other throughout the film: The Meditations, The Robber Mirror, Twenty Two Rings, The Healing Painting, The Discussion, The Pirate‚Äôs Treasure, The Prophetic Site, The Castle of Dreams, and The Traveling Companion. Through overlapping threads and exchanged objects, these nine stories form some supposed twelve in total, though the situation becomes increasingly jumbled and less clear as the film goes on. A handful of actors portray different characters across storylines and centuries ‚Äì Lucrezia, the nun-turned mystical nymph is played by the same woman (Elsa Zylberstein) who portrays modern-day Jessica who interacts with Paul, a student disturbed by a website foretelling his future. Paul is played by the same actor (Melvil Poupaud) who plays the troubled young Catholic who discovers he is Jewish, while many pirates and thieves, corpses and even the devil exchange actors in less pronounced roles throughout the film. Themes of a young theology student grappling with doubts over institutional ideologies and hypocrisy, the dangerous power of storytelling, shifting and self-proclaimed denial of identities, as well as piracy, charmed objects which act upon the bearers rather than the other way around, maps, and cannibalism are all recognizable as curious preoccupations and trademarks of Ruiz‚Äôs work to any seasoned fan. Cast *Melvil Poupaud as Paul, the young priest, doubting twin brothers *Elsa Zylberstein as Lucrezia, Jessica, the sultana *Lambert Wilson as Sebatol, pirate *Christian Vadim as David, pirate thief *Marie-France Pisier as mother, married woman *Rogerio Samora as Baniel, pirate *Diogo D√≥ria as Mariani, painter, father Reception Variety identified it as \\"witty diversion for upscale auds,\\" perhaps hinting at the lofty, enigmatic narrative games it plays, praised it as \\"another sly, spry intellectual game\\", but complained about the excessive length of the film. Les Inrockuptibles found it impossible to summarize, and suggested it was a kind of self-parody of Ruiz's earlier films.Combat d‚Äôamour en songe, Les InRocks Dennis Schwartz, of Ozus' World Movie Reviews, gave this \\"idiosyncratic film\\" a B- on Rotten Tomatoes, and described it as \\"an acting exercise to show-off the film-makers rich imagination.\\" Love Torn in a Dream won the FIPRESCI Prize (International Press Award) in Montreal World Film Festival. Soundtrack Jorge Arriagada composed the music and score of this film. He has worked with Ruiz on forty-four different films since their first collaboration on Ruiz's 1977 Colloque de chiens. Arriagada is the youngest composer to have won a Guggenheim fellowship, which he did at age 29 in 1972.

Plot  The plot of this film revolves around two insomniacs, a hunchback boxer and a voyeuristic teacher, who after meeting one another on a bridge decide to rape a pregnant woman. The two men discuss what it is like not being able to sleep and how they both feel disconnected from the rest of the world. Both men start to lose their grip on reality when they believe that by not sleeping, they somehow have a newfound power that will allow them to control all of the awake people. Ruiz's style of filmmaking becomes noticeably more convoluted and dreamlike as the character's journey through this nightmarish trance. Reception Although some true \\"Ruizian\\" fans commend this work for staying true to Ruiz's unique style of filmmaking, many others view it as a lost opportunity to delve deeper into a more philosophical analysis of the relationship between two insomniacs and the world. Many believe this opportunity was lost because the film was so experimental with its bombardment of confusing dream sequences and \\"supernatural events\\" that any salvageable themes or motifs were buried too deep to make any lasting impression on its audience. One review from Lenny Borger from Variety, quotes the Ruiz as directing this film in an almost ‚Äúcomatose state‚Äù. He goes on to commend Ruiz‚Äôs rapid fire style of filmmaking, at the time this was the 6th film he had made that year, all of which were on a ‚Äúshoestring‚Äù budget to make things even more impressive. Unfortunately, the reviews from the time stay true to viewers interpretations today. Borger says it best when he writes that ‚Äúthere are numerous consequences and surprises in this metaphysical farce but little enjoyable sense or nonsense to be had by the viewer.‚Äù  In Ruizian Cinema  The common trend when discussing or analyzing any of Ruiz‚Äôs works is to not focus on them individually, but rather in the context of his larger body of work. Ruiz was a rapid-fire filmmaker who wrote and directed numerous films with little to no budget around the clock. The result was that he got to make over 100 movies before his death in 2011, but many of them did not live up to the high standards of a critical audience. This is not to say that Insomniac on The Bridge does not have good elements, but rather illustrates that Ruiz‚Äôs style is just so avant-garde, that many of his films fail to resonate with an audience. Hollywood filmmakers would view this as a failure as their goal is to make money from films with an audience. However, Ruiz did not make films in the name of entertainment, he made them in the name of art and sometimes social or political commentary. One of his most well known films, Time Regained (1999), acts as a prime example of when his experimental style meshes well with an already established adaptation of a novel, making his unique artistic vision more palatable for the average viewer. It is a shame that many of his films go unnoticed or ignored for this reason, but at the end of the it is the price paid for such an incredibly vast body of work manifested in a single lifetime.

The Stuarts were royalists, and were in exile in France under the Commonwealth. Sophia returned to England after the Restoration of 1660, and in 1671 became a maid of honour to Queen Catherine of Braganza. About three years later she married Henry Bulkeley: he was fourth son of Thomas Bulkeley, 1st Viscount Bulkeley of Baron Hill, near Beaumaris, and brother of the royalist general Richard Bulkeley. Henry was master of the household successively to Charles II and James II. This marriage therefore placed Sophia in the inner court circles, and due course in 1685 she became lady of the bedchamber to Queen Mary of Modena. About 1680 it was rumoured that Sidney Godolphin was enamoured of her. In October 1688 she was a witness with Queen Mary at the birth of her son, the young James, Prince of Wales. The Glorious Revolution saw her move with the Queen and Stuart court to France in December 1688. Sophia Bulkeley remained a Jacobite loyalist, though she had personal reasons to return on occasion to England, something she managed in 1702.

East Valley is a loosely defined region, with differing definition of what constitutes it. Superstition Mountain PHX East Valley, a project with an area coalition known as the East Valley Partnership, defines the East Valley as an area that encompasses Apache Junction, Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Queen Creek, and Tempe. The East Valley Tribune, a newspaper that serves the region, considers Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Queen Creek, and Tempe as its service area. The newspaper formerly served Scottsdale as well, but pulled out of the city in 2009. Ahwatukee, which is an urban village of the City of Phoenix, is normally considered to be part of the East Valley as well. Valley Metro defines its East Valley service area for its ADA Paratransit service to include Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe, and Scottsdale. History The term \\"East Valley\\" to describe that part of Metropolitan Phoenix east of the city of Phoenix emerged in the early 1980s. Metro Phoenix is in the Salt River Valley, which has been marketed as the Valley of the Sun. A newspaper publisher, Charles Wahlheim, started using East Valley in the Mesa Tribune, Chandler Arizonan, and the Tempe Daily News - newspapers purchased by the Cox newspaper chain out of Atlanta - as a marketing device aimed at giving his company's newspapers creditability as alternatives to the powerful Phoenix- based Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette. In 1980, Phoenix dwarfed other cities in the region with a population of 789,704. Mesa was the next biggest city with a population of 152,404, followed by Tempe with a population of 106,919. A group called the Phoenix 40 heavily influenced the region's politics and business matters affecting the entire region. Wahlheim approached Chandler grocery-chain owner Eddie Basha and asked him to help create a business group to be the East Valley's answer to the Phoenix 40. That group was named the East Valley Partnership, an organization of business, education and political leaders that continues to advocate on behalf of the East Valley and its cities.*http://www.evp-az.org/e-v-profile.php One of the founders of the partnership was the late Jack Whiteman of Empire Southwest, a heavy equipment company. \\"My dad and a number of East Valley businesses wanted to have the East Valley equivalent of the Phoenix 40,\\" John Whiteman, who followed his dad as head of the prosperous dealership, told the East Valley Tribune. \\"Back then everything seemed to be going to Phoenix.\\" Ten years after the regional concept was introduced, it was politically institutionalized with the state legislature's creation of the East Valley Institute of Technology. What had once been the Mesa Vocational School was given a new name and an East Valley-wide tax base. Today, its services are offered to 10 school districts. Demographics The East Valley experienced a population increase of 41 percent, going from 937,638 in 2000 to 1,324,922 in 2011, according to U.S. Census data.*http://www.evp-az.org/documents/2012Profile-FINAL_000.pdf The 2011 median household income in the East Valley was reported $64,659, up from $52,100 in 2000. The 2011 median household income is also higher in the East Valley than Metropolitan Phoenix, the state of Arizona, and the entire United States. The median sales price of a single family home in the East Valley is $205,850. This figure is also higher than the median price of a single family home in Metropolitan Phoenix, the West Valley, all of Arizona, and the United States. The cost of living in the East Valley is quite low for such a thriving area. It has a composite score of 102 (NOTE: US average = 100), compared to 109 of Las Vegas, Nevada, 110 of Denver, Colorado, 118 of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and 147 of Los Angeles, California. A variety of forces combined to strengthen the East Valley region's identity and political parity, but none was more important than a 30-year surge in population that saw Mesa nearly triple in its population and Chandler grow from 29,173 to 236,123 and the town of Gilbert skyrocket from 5,717 to 208,453. The cities in the East Valley literally grew together. The city of Phoenix grew, too, but not at the same rate as it didn't quite double its population in the 30-year span ending in 2010. Ironically, The Arizona Republic contributed to the East Valley's separate identity in the mid-1990s by publishing a Sunday section called East Valley. Perhaps equally as ironic, the grouping of newspapers that Wahlheim had assembled did not incorporate East Valley into its nameplate until new owners had combined the newspaper's community editions into a single newspaper called The Tribune. It wasn't until 1999 that the newspaper retitled itself the East Valley Tribune. Education East Valley K-12 students are served by 14 school districts, 125 charter schools and one regional career-focused district (East Valley Institute of Technology). One measure of the academic quality of East Valley schools is that the region qualified 12 schools to compete in the 2012 Arizona Academic Decathlon competition - more than any other region.*http://azacadec.org/results.php =Arizona State University= With 33 percent of its population age 25 and above holding bachelor's degrees, higher education is a priority. Arizona State University's main campus in Tempe serves more than 49,000 undergraduate students and more than 10,000 graduate students. The ASU Polytechnic Campus in East Mesa serves more than 9,500 undergraduate students and nearly 1,000 graduate students. The Aerospace and Defense Research Collaboratory, which support aerospace and defense industries is housed at the Polytechnic Campus in the College of Technology and Innovation adjacent to Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in East Mesa. The airport and campus are on the grounds of what was Williams Air Force Base and in an area focused on aerospace industry development. Another example is ASU's Skysong Center in Scottsdale, located not far from the General Dynamics C-4 Systems facility. ASU describes Skysong as \\"an innovation center designed to help companies grow by providing business services and programs offered or facilitated by Arizona State University. These services include access to new technologies, capital networks, business education and a skilled workforce. =Community Colleges= Private colleges serve another 11,000 students in the East Valley. The community college system has enrolled 160,000 students at five East Valley colleges. They include the Chandler-Gilbert Community College, Mesa Community College, Rio Salado College, Scottsdale Community College and Central Arizona College. =East Valley Institute of Technology= For more than 20 years, the East Valley Institute of Technology (EVIT) has offered students in 10 East Valley school districts a wide range of career and technical education courses. The courses prepare students with skills for immediate entry into the local job market, but many are on career tracks that lead to higher education. More than 60 percent of the 3,000 students taking EVIT courses go on to college. EVIT is funded by a property tax levied on property owners in the 10 districts. EVIT has two campuses. The main campus opened in Mesa in 1998 at a cost of $46 million. It spans 65 acres with 15 buildings. The campus's long-time culinary and automotive technologies programs are highly regarded, but EVIT also serves the East Valley job market with such course offerings as 3D animation, electronics/robotics and engineering science. In 2007 and 2011 new health science buildings were opened at the main campus and quickly reached capacity. Programs offered to health and science students include biotechnology; nursing; sterile processing and distribution; and dental assisting. Many of the students are on track to enter medical school. EVIT also offers tuition-based career education programs for adults. In 2011 EVIT opened a 10-acre, $17 million campus in east Mesa that is clustered with the Arizona State University Polytechnic campus, the Chandler- Gilbert Community College Williams campus and Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. It is focused on health and aviation programs. Aviation students are trained for jobs in the East Valley's and state's robust aerospace sector. Arizona is fifth in the nation in aviation and aerospace employment. Aviation and aerospace The East Valley Aviation & Aerospace Alliance estimates aerospace accounts for 35,000 high-paying jobs and generates $3.5 billion a year in the East Valley.*http://www.evaaa.org/ The Alliance is working with the Arizona Commerce Authority to extend the sector's reach by obtaining selections of the state of Arizona as a center of excellence for development and testing of unmanned aerial systems. Among the sector drivers in the East Valley are the Boeing Corporation, Orbital ATK, Honeywell Aerospace, Able Aerospace Services, Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, Cessna, and Arizona Laboratories for Security and Defense Research (AZLabs). Mesa is the home of Boeing's sixth largest site where it assembles the Apache Longbow attack helicopter and the A160 Hummingbird unmanned aerial vehicle helicopter.*http://www.azaerospace.com/az_advantage/sucess_stories/ Boeing will test the unmanned helicopter in restricted aerospace near the town of Florence, a short distance south of the East Valley. Boeing has a workforce in Mesa of 4,700 employees. It utilizes 576 Arizona suppliers and annually spends $1.2 billion. Virginia-based Orbital ATK has about half of its workforce in the East Valley. In Chandler, the company designs tests and manufactures space launch vehicles, including the Pegasus and Minotaur rockets. In the town of Gilbert, Orbital ATK assembles and tests satellites. Orbital ATK describes its 135,000 square-foot satellite facility as one of the most advanced of its kind. In the past, Orbital ATK has focused on government satellite projects. But it is ramping up Gilbert operations for a major commercial project. It will assemble and test 81 satellites for the Iridium NEXT global communications system. In a 2011 press release, Iridium CEO Matt Desch said, \\"With this contract, Orbital becomes part of the most significant commercial space project in the world.\\" Iridium satellites are to be launched starting in 2015. The East Valley is also home of the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport one of the nation's most successful military base reuse projects. Formerly Williams Air Force Base, the growing reliever airport boasts a remodeled passenger terminal, convenient parking and three runways, the longest of which is 10,401 feet. The shortest is 9,301 feet. The airport currently serves Allegiant Airlines. East Valley leaders see it as an international aerospace center and a catalyst for bringing 100,000 jobs to the far East Valley in 20 years. The airport is located in Foreign Trade Zone 221. As of 2012, Gateway hosts more than 40 companies, serves 33 cities with non-stop service via Allegiant, Frontier, and Spirit Airlines as well as eight more cities with continuing service, and contributes $685 million annually to the Arizona economy. The airport's master plan projects more than 850,000 enplanements by 2017 and 2.2 million by 2027. Another promising military facility reuse project is AZLabs, formerly the Air Force Research Laboratory.*http://www.defensecommunities.org/headlines/mesa-lab-is-now- azlabs-as-city-creates-new-tech-center/# The Defense Department in 2011 turned ownership of the facility over to the city of Mesa. The lab is near Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport and Arizona State University Polytechnic campus. Alion Science and Technology manages the 97,500 square foot facility and describes it as ideally suited for hosting classified research programs. The East Valley also boasts three busy general aviation airports: the Chandler Municipal Airport, Falcon Field Airport in Mesa, and the Scottsdale Airport. Falcon Field and Scottsdale Airport served as World War II pilot training fields. British military pilots trained at Falcon Field and Americans in Scottsdale. In 2011, Falcon Field was the 5th busiest general aviation airport in the country. Located adjacent to Boeing, Falcon Field contributes over $2.3 billion to the local economy. With about 130,000 operations in 2010, Scottsdale Airport bills itself as one of the busiest single-runway facilities in the world. It is centrally located in Scottsdale's only industrial-zoned area. The Commerce Airpark area is headquarters to over 30 national/regional corporations and home to nearly 2,500 small and medium-sized businesses with over 48,000 jobs. With over 350 VFR flying days per year. Economy =Intel= No single company has had a more profound impact on the East Valley than the Intel Corporation. The company has 10,300 employees working in the city of Chandler‚Äîthe company's second largest U.S. site. According to a news backgrounder that Intel prepared for a January 2012 visit by President Barack Obama, the company's annual economic impact in Arizona tops $2.6 billion.*http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2012/01/24/chip- shot-president-obama-to-visit-intel-chandler-jan-25 This includes more than 20,000 non-Intel jobs resulting from the company's presence in the state. Intel is currently expanding its Ocotillo campus in Chandler by building a new chip manufacturing facility, called Fab. 42. Intel announced the $5 billion investment in its Chandler operation during a 2011 presidential visit to its Oregon campus. Intel says that Fab 42 will be the most advanced high-volume semiconductor manufacturing plant in the world. Construction of the facility will require thousands of people to put in more than 10 million hours. The plant is scheduled to open in 2013 and permanently employ 1,000 workers. Intel began exploring locating a facility in Arizona in the late 1970s. The company bought 160 acres on West Chandler Boulevard in 1978. Intel began operations in 1980. Prior to the Fab 42 announcement Intel had invested over $12 billion in high-tech manufacturing capability in the state since 1996. Arizona is home to two high volume manufacturing facilities, Fab 12 and Fab 32. Fab 12 began operations in 1996. The $3 billion Fab 32 was opened in 2007. In addition to its economic contributions, Intel has been a major contributor to the community. A fact sheet on the company's website said employees contributed $6.6 million to the United Way and 127,000 volunteer hours in 2009. =Growth= Prior to the Great Recession that marked its beginning at the end of 2007, phenomenal population growth was a powerful driver of the East Valley's economy. Even today, construction and maintenance comprises 12.59 percent of the workforce. Like many Sun Belt regions, the recession took a tremendous toll on home construction and ownership in the East Valley. But there are signs in early 2012 that the housing market is regaining strength. As of March 2012, home sales in the Phoenix market had increased by 22 percent over February, according to the Arizona Regional Multiple Listing Service as reported in the East Valley Tribune. The Arizona Republic reported that median March home prices in the Phoenix area climbed by 7 percent over February. Prior to the recession, the \\"town\\" of Gilbert was one of America's fastest growing cities and in 2011 the town showed the spark was still there as it issued 1,545 single-family construction permits. That was a 46-percent increase over 2010. While a long way from the 5,070 single-family construction permits issued by the town in 2004, it was outpacing in raw numbers the much larger city of Phoenix, which by November had issued less than 1,000 such permits. And The Wall Street Journal in a March A1 story focused on metro Phoenix's improving housing market under the headline \\"Rise in Phoenix Housing Shows Plath for Other Cities.\\" World War II is often cited along with air conditioning as the genesis of the region's population boom. With three military pilot training fields in the East Valley, military personnel along with mechanics and office workers flocked to the region. Some never left and others came back after the war. The birth of Major League Baseball‚Äôs Cactus League and marketing drives to attract tourists and retirees to the region also played roles in boosting permanent population growth. Census numbers tell the story. According to the East Valley Partnership, the 2011 population of the entire East Valley is 1,324,922. With a population of 439,041 as of the 2010 Census, Mesa is the East Valley's largest city and the 38th largest city in America. But in 1940, Census workers counted only 7,224 people living in Mesa. By the 1950 Census, population had more than doubled to 16,790. It doubled again by 1960 and again in 1970 and more than doubled by 1980. The torrid pace continued in the following two decades. The town of Gilbert is another story of blazing growth. The outgrowth of a railroad crossing that serviced nearby farms, Gilbert numbered only 837 people in the 1940 Census. By 2000, 109,697 people called Gilbert home. Nearly another 100,000 people were counted in the 2010 Census, which recorded the town's population at 208,453. While retirees have contributed to the East Valley's growth and vitality, the town of Gilbert with an average age is 31.37 demonstrates that the commonly held belief that the region is dominated by retirees is a myth. Arts and culture Each of the East Valley's major cities has performing arts centers and museums. The performing arts attractions range from community theater performances to such nationally acclaimed celebrities and performers as Bill Cosby, Earth, Wind & Fire, Joan Rivers and Jane Krakowski of 30 Rock. The venues include the Chandler Center for the Arts, the Higley Center for the Performing Arts of Gilbert, Queen Creek and southeastern Chandler area, the Tempe Center for the Arts, the Scottsdale Center for the Arts, the Mesa Arts Center, the Hale Centre Theatre Arizona in Gilbert, the Arizona Museum of Natural History in Mesa, the Arizona Historical Society's Museum at Papago Park in Tempe, the Arizona Museum for Youth in Mesa, the Gilbert Historical Museum and the Mesa Historical Museum, which has developed Play Ball: The Cactus League Experience. One of the crown jewels of the East Valley's performing arts venues is the Mesa Arts Center, which CNN selected to host the February 2012 Republican primary presidential debate. The architecturally stunning center in downtown Mesa is the largest arts center in Arizona. It features four theaters, five art galleries, and 14 art studios. Outdoor and recreation The East Valley is known for golf, eco-tourism and outdoor recreation enthusiasts, including hikers, bikers, birders, river rafters and floaters, fishermen, horse-back riders, climbers, hunters and four-wheel drive desert explorers. The East Valley is bounded on the north, east and south by mountains‚Äîthe Superstitions, the San Tans, and McDowell Mountains. All are accessible through trails and park facilities. The Tonto National Forest hugs the East Valley as does the lower Salt River valley basin and the Sonoran Desert. For boaters, Saguaro Lake is within a half hour of most East Valley locations and the 21,000 acre Lake Roosevelt and the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area is a 90-minute drive. In addition to the lakes, fishermen head for the Lower Salt River in the winter and spring. The Arizona Game and Fish Department stock the river with Rainbow trout during those months, though an occasional bass is also caught. A series of four national forest parks follow the Salt River and just minutes from the Red Mountain Expressway. The Lost Dutchman State Park is on the eastern edge of the East Valley. There are three metropolitan parks‚Äîone bordering Scottsdale, one bordering Mesa and one on the south nestled in the San Tan Mountains. The Gilbert Riparian preserve is well known to birders and is listed in the American Auto Club's 100 sites to see in Arizona. The Boyce Thompson Arboretum State Park with its collection of desert and riparian plants and wildlife is less than 45 minutes from most East Valley locations. The Desert Botanical Garden is located on Tempe‚Äôs western edge. Past attempts to secede from Maricopa County In the past, there have been some attempts for the East Valley to secede from Maricopa County and form a new county. Former State Senator Russell Pearce has at times proposed bills which would ease county splits, as part of his effort to split off the East Valley portion of Maricopa County. Such proposed names for a new county for the East Valley included but were not limited to Red Mountain County and Rio Salado County. Two such attempts to secede were made. The first attempt was in the early 1990s and included the cities and towns of Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek, Tempe, and Guadalupe. In the early 2000s, a second attempt was made, and included the same cities and towns as the early 1990s proposal except for Tempe and Guadalupe.

She is best known for her books Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey and Attachment. She is married to novelist Martin Amis.  Early life Isabel Fonseca was born in New York in 1961 and is the youngest of four children born to Uruguayan sculptor Gonzalo Fonseca and American painter Elizabeth Fonseca. Her siblings include Caio Fonseca, a much admired painter whose works hang in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Whitney Museum of Art; Bruno Fonseca, a painter who died of AIDS in 1994; and Quina Fonseca, a designer of clothes, costumes, and hats. Her maternal grandfather was Jacob Kaplan, the former owner of Welch's grape juice. Isabel grew up in a house on West 11th Street in New York that used to belong to Daniel Chester French, the sculptor of the Lincoln Memorial. Both of her parents had studios in this house that the children weren't allowed to enter uninvited. Isabel‚Äôs family was connected by, and shared a passion for, creating art. Even her grandparents on both sides were known for creating treasures out of trash. Because of this passion for art, Isabel claims that her parents were around but always preoccupied. They divorced during her teenage years. She attended Concord Academy and graduated magna cum laude from Barnard College in 1984. She then went on to study at Wadham College in Oxford. Isabel Fonseca was very close to her brothers, especially her brother Bruno who died in 1994. Because of this closeness, she never felt the need for serious relationships until her late 20s. After Bruno‚Äôs death, she wrote a short collection of stories titled Bruno Fonseca: The Secret Life of Painting that met with mixed reviews among her extended family.  Career  During her time at Wadham College, she began working as an editor for the Times Literary Supplement where she created a column about cultural commentary that persists to this day. While working there, she also wrote Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey, a history of the Romani people which she researched while traveling alone through Eastern Europe for four years. She traveled with gypsies from Bulgaria, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Albania. The title comes from a gypsy proverb, ‚ÄúBury me standing. I‚Äôve been on my knees all my life.‚Äù Bury Me Standing was originally published in 1995 by Random House. Isabel Fonseca has also written for the Times, The Guardian, The Economist, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, and The American Scholar, among other publications. In 2006, she took her husband, Martin Amis, and two children, Fernanda and Clio, to Uruguay while she worked on a book about the country's military dictatorship in the 1970s. However, that book was never written and she instead began writing a short story that later turned into the novel Attachment. Attachment was published in 2009 and met mixed reception due to the parallels between the main character Jean Hubbard and Fonseca's affair with Martin Amis in the early 90s.  Marriage to Martin Amis  Isabel Fonseca met novelist Martin Amis during a phone interview while she was working at the Times Literary Supplement. They began a relationship while Amis was still married to his first wife, Antonia Phillips, an American academic and the mother of his two sons. In 1993, Amis left Phillips for Fonseca, which led to much \\"finger- wagging\\" by the British press. The press painted Amis as a second-generation philanderer and Fonseca as a sultry American heiress (because of her being a trustee to the J. M. Kaplan fund). They married in 1996 and had their first daughter, Fernanda in 1997. Their second daughter Clio was born in 1999. Similar to the home she grew up in, Fonseca and Amis‚Äôs home in London contains an attic studio where she often does her writing. They maintain homes in Brooklyn, London, and Uruguay and spend time living in each of them. From 2006 to 2009, Isabel Fonseca and her family lived in a small Uruguayan village near Punta del Este. While there, they built a house, their children learned Spanish, and Isabel Fonseca penned her first fictional novel, Attachment. Isabel refused to show the novel to her husband Martin until after it was finished. She claimed, ‚ÄúIf he hated it, I would have been devastated, and if he really liked it, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have believed him.‚Äù Her daughter Fernanda has also been published in The Guardian.Bradford 2012, p.121  Notable works  * Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey (1995) * Attachment (2009) References External links * Interview in The Guardian * New York Times interview * Reportaje Diario El Pa√≠s Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:American people of Uruguayan descent Category:Amis family Category:Writers from New York City Category:Barnard College alumni Category:Alumni of Wadham College, Oxford Category:Date of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Isabel Fonseca"},{"id":"35759039","text":"Palaeodytes is a genus of beetles in the family Dytiscidae, containing the following species:Dytiscidae Species List at Joel Hallan's Biology Catalog.

Here he worked at the case, with Walt Whitman as a fellow compositor. He soon advanced to the place of proofreader. In this capacity, he rendered much critical service of an editorial character on a large variety of works. Among other interesting things that received his attention were the original proofs of Edgar Allan Poe's ‚ÄúRaven‚Äù and ‚ÄúBells.‚Äù He assisted Ephraim G.

For some time, he was on the editorial staff of the American Whig Review, and in 1853 succeeded Whitman as editor of a newspaper at Huntington, Long Island. He acted as proofreader, contributor, and associate editor on the different editions of the American Cyclopaedia, and noted the pronunciation of the titles in the volume of index to the second edition and in the text of the condensed edition.

It was officially licensed as a political party by the US military government on 8 December 1945.Rebecca Boehling, A Question of Priorities: Democratic Reform and Economic Recovery in Postwar Germany, Berghahn Books, 1998, p. 195 The party programmes was populist and was in some ways simply a support for its demagogic leader as it had a very limited policy base beyond support for federalism. Due to its anti-liberal stance the group has been characterised as radical right wing populist party by Betz and Immerfall.Hans-Georg Betz, Stefan Immerfall, The New Politics of the Right: Neo-Populist Parties and Movements in Established Democracies, Palgrave Macmillan, 1998, p. 95 Like the later All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights the WAV's main support base was amongst internal expellees and it had little support amongst native Bavarians. It also sought to reach out to demobilised soldiers and small-time former Nazi Party officials with only perfunctory connections to ideological Nazism who saw themselves as the victims of denazification plans.Ian Connor, Refugees and Expellees in Post-War Germany, Manchester University Press, 2007, p. 126 Into the Bundestag The party secured representation in the Landtag of Bavaria in 1946.Margalit, Guilt, Suffering, and Memory, p. 189 However the WAV went into decline as its lack of coherent policy and disaffection with Loritz's heavy-handed style of leadership led to around half of the party's local branches having been disbanded by 1948. In the 1948 local elections the demoralised party gained only 1.7% of the vote.Connor, Refugees and Expellees, p. 127 Nevertheless, the party contested the Bavarian seats in the 1949 West German federal election and captured 14.4% of the vote to win twelve seats. As a part of an agreement Loritz signed with the Passau-based refugee organisation the New Citizens Alliance half of the party's candidates were refugees and as a result they gained widespread support in those constituencies with the highest number of refugees. This group, led by the radical nationalist Gunther Goetzendorff, had been barred by the American authorities from participating in the 1949 election and so worked with the WAV for convenience. The combined group, under the WAV banner, was a \\"radical nationalist party\\".Connor, Refugees and Expellees, p. 128 Decline The 1949 election represented the high-water mark of the WAV, which went into steep decline thereafter. Their vote collapsed in the 1950 election to the Landtag of Bavaria, with the 2.8% vote share obtained falling some distance short of the 5% required to enter the Assembly. By that October the party within the Bundestag began to disintegrate when four of its members left to form a new group for refugees associated with the Centre Party.Grosser, Germany in Our Time, p. 253 In December 1951 a further group of six deputies left to join the German Party and when another joined the Deutsche Reichspartei soon afterwards it left Loritz as the WAV's sole deputy. Worse was to come in 1952 when the party contested the municipal elections and captured only 0.3% of the vote.Grosser, Germany in Our Time, pp. 252-253 No WAV candidates were put forward for the 1953 federal election and the party was not heard of again.

History  Cross Classical Academy was conceived in spring 2009 by Mandi Moore, a local mother exploring educational options for her kindergarten-age daughter. Moore felt she wanted a higher level of parental involvement than public school or a traditional five-day-a-week private school offered, but didn't feel her daughter would be well served by homeschooling alone. She enlisted the help of Joyce Baker, a fellow church member and former school board member in nearby Zephyr, Texas. Over the next year the duo worked on the school's launch. Initially, they assumed Cross Classical would not open until the 2011-2012 school year, but after another parent, Stephanie Davis, an attorney from Comanche, Texas expressed immediate interest in the program, Moore and Baker realized that a small pilot program would be viable for 2010-2011. Mandi Moore currently serves as Chairman of CCA's Board of Directors and Stephanie L. Davis serves as the school's Administrator.http://crossclassicalacademy.com/  Educational model and mission  Cross Classical Academy adheres to a typical University-Model¬Æ school weekly schedule, with classes held two days a week‚Äîin Cross Classical's case, Monday and Wednesday‚Äîand students being homeschooled the other three days. The model is designed to allow parents a more active role in educating their children in an attempt to integrate the home and school environments. The mission of the school is \\"to partner with parents to provide for their children a classical education founded upon a Biblical worldview in a University-Model¬Æ setting.\\" Ministry is the most significant driving force behind Cross Classical's future.  Student base  Cross Classical Academy's current enrollment base draws from over seven towns throughout central and west-central Texas and over 15 community churches.

Flor(imond) Grammens (born Bellem 13 April 1899: died Deinze, 28 March 1985) was a Belgian politician and Flemish activist. He campaigned for the Belgian language laws and the formalisation of the country's language frontier, establishing legally the dominance of Dutch in the north and French in the south. Upbringing and early career Grammens was the son of a former police adjutant. In 1910 the family, including his father's two daughters, relocated the short distance to Aalter. Grammens attended the (then francophone) St Vincent College in Eeklo. Later, during the First World War, he attended the \\"Normal school\\" at Sint-Niklaas, from where he graduated in 1919 with a teaching diploma. He obtained a teaching position in Kortrijk, relocating to nearby Ronse which at this time was still a bilingual town. He participated actively in the Davidsfonds at this time. This was an organisation dedicated to the promotion of the church, the Dutch language and Flemish identity. A shared concern over the bilingualism in Ronse brought Gramens into contact with like minded Flemish nationalists, notably Leo Vindevogel and with a former chairman of the Davidsfonds called Arthur Boon. Language activism At the request of van Boon, in 1926 Grammens gave a lecture to the Davidsfonds Congress on the subject of the language situation in Ronse and the surrounding district. This turned out to be the first of many lecture appearances that he would make in Flanders. In 1927 Grammens undertook a walking tour along the full length of Belgium's east-west language frontier, researching the language situations in the places through which he travelled. In 1929 he started setting up local language action groups along the langth of the language frontier, himself leading their discussions. In 1929 and 1930 he again undertook study tours along the length of the language frontier, now accompanied by August de Schryver who at this time was a parliamentary deputy for the Eeklo-Gent region and who would go on to play a leading part in national Belgian politics for more than three decades. Legislation promoted chiefly by francophone Wallonia had in 1921 replaced a widespread official bilingualism with a public monolingualism linked to place. This was intended to preserve the French language in southern Belgium at a time when migration from the Dutch-speaking north was tending to increase Flemish cultural and linguistic representation in the francophone south. From the Flemish side, Grammens campaigned to make Flanders monolingual, which endorsed the principal that public language use should be determined by where you lived rather than by individual preference. Starting in 1930, he headed up campaigning meetings, concentrating on the places on the Flemish side of the language frontier. His campaigning proved influential, and 1932 saw new legislation affecting language use in education and government, while protecting the status of any minority language used by at least 30% of a local population. A provision in the legislation (which would be revoked effective 1962 by the Eyskens government) provided for a language census every ten years which a municipality could use to mandate a change from French to Dutch (or vice versa) as its official language where there was a shift in the preferred language of the majority of the local population. Language legislation in respect of the courts followed in 1935. After the 1932 Language Law After the 1932 law had been introduced, Grammens introduced the \\"Taalgrenswacht\\" a monthly publication intended to inform people about the new arrangements. During the incumbency (between 1936 and 1937) of Interior Minister De Schrijver a commission was established, chaired by another national politician, Limburg born Camille Huysmans, to perform the necessary preparatory work for the official establishment of the language frontier. However, the politicians were focused on tying to secure national economic revival at this time and the Language Law commission's progress was, at best, slow, persuading Grammens to campaign more spectacularly for the timely implementation of the Language Laws. Grammans favours a direct approach From January 1937 Grammens started personally to over-write French language government communications, such as street signs. The first of these ventures took place in Edingen, a Flemish frontier municipality in Hainut Province. Grammens concentrated his campaign on municipalities where the linguistic mix of the population required special provision to be made for minority language speakers representing more than 30% of the total population. These were, in practice, mostly located near to the Franco-Flemish language frontier, and are the municipalities which today are recognised as \\"Faciliteitengemeente\\", (Municipalities with language facilities). In 1937 the Language Law required government communications here such as road signs to be written in both French and Dutch, but at this time the road signs in these places were written only in French, which traditionally had been the language of the ruling class throughout Belgium, but which was the first language of the wider population only in the south. In the rest of Flanders Grammens received both acclaim and active support from Flemish student movements. In February 1937 he switched his concentration to municipalities in the Flemish heartland which had no substantial francophone minority and which therefore, under the provisions of the language law, should be monolingual. In a single night the French language roadside signs in more than 200 municipalities were overpainted. This spectacular demonstration triggered renewed comment in both the national Chamber and the Senate. The actions were in part funded by the \\"Grammensfonds\\", an association set up for this purpose in 1938. These activities continued till 1939, not without results. The overpainting of francophone signs took place in Ghent four times, before the group changed tactics and simply smashed all the offending signs. A week later the town hall adopted the monolingual position (as they had been legally required to do ever since the relevant legislation had been enacted in 1932) and withdrew legal proceedings against the Flemish language activists. During this period Grammens frequently found himself in court, and even serving brief prison sentences. In January 1938 students stormed the prison in Belgium's oldest town, Tongeren, in an attempt to free Grammens from an incarceration. Another attempt to free him a year later, this time from the prison in Oudenaarde, also failed. On 3 July 1938 several tens of thousands organised supporters demonstrated in Ghent, demanding Grammens' release from the prison there. Many of the students involved in these protests were later themselves prominent in Belgian politics. Post-war activism Grammens spent the immediate post-war years in prison, his war time priorities having led him to be viewed as a collaborator. During the 1958 Universal Exhibition in Brussels, an event in respect of which the French language seemed in many ways preferred overDutch, Grammans protested together with the Flemish Peoples' Movement against the francophone character of the event. Grammens again found himself arrested and convicted on account of his involvement in throwing \\"bitumen eggs\\" (pekeieren) at the French pavilion. Later he was involved in founding the Language Action Committee.

In 2006, he came to the public's attention after being filmed by an undercover reporter for a Panorama documentary entitled \\"Undercover: Football's Dirty Secrets\\". Career =Playing and managerial career= Harrison had a reasonably short football career, playing for Nottingham Forest, Gateshead and Belgian side Charleroi. He then moved on to manage Hebburn, before taking a year out away from football. In 1995, he was appointed as Harry Dunn's replacement at Blyth Spartans. Harrison kept the caretaker managers Tony Lowery and David McCreery on as part of the backroom staff, with the intention of Lowery being his assistant coach and McCreery in a consultant role. However, after a few weeks, Lowery joined Bedlington Terriers and McCreery took up a new role in the US to help promote the inaugural Major League Soccer season. Harrison brought in his former Gateshead teammate Derek Bell soon afterwards, in a player-assistant role. Harrison led the club to sixth place in the 1995‚Äì96 season. He could not replicate the same form the following season, and after one win in ten matches, he handed in his resignation after a 4‚Äì0 defeat to Leek Town. John Burridge, who was playing for the club at the time, became caretaker manager, and eventually, Harrison's successor. =Career as a football agent= As a football agent, he was responsible for Ali Dia's move to Gateshead, following the infamous 53-minute appearance for Southampton. Harrison was a friend of Gateshead's chairman John Gibson, and as the club were struggling to find players, he turned to Harrison, who suggested Dia. The Senegalese had played under Harrison, making one appearance for Blyth Spartans. He joined the Tynesiders, scoring two goals in eight matches, leaving in 1997, following a change of manager. Harrison later became a licensed FIFA football agent and represented many players including Lucas Neill, Ali Al-Habsi, Ei√∞ur Gu√∞johnsen, Jussi J√§√§skel√§inen, Hidetoshi Nakata and Andy Carroll. He was also the agent of Rivaldo, who following his release from A.C. Milan, was linked with a move to Bolton Wanderers, but in the end, moved to Olympiacos. In 2006, he was filmed by an undercover reporter for Panorama's \\"Undercover: Football's Dirty Secrets\\", and featured prominently in the documentary. Well known figures in football shown in the documentary include: * Harry Redknapp, who discussed with Harrison on the possibility on buying Andy Todd. Redknapp later denied the conversation with Harrison amounted to \\"tapping up\\". * Kevin Bond, who admitted he would consider discussing receiving payments from a proposed new agency involving Harrison. Bond later denied that he had taken a bung or had ever taken a bung. He was first team coach at Newcastle United at the time of broadcast, and was relieved of his duties following the revelations. * Frank Arnesen, then-director of youth football at Chelsea, who was filmed \\"tapping up\\" Middlesbrough's Nathan Porritt and offers a fee of ¬£150,000 spread over three years as an incentive to relocate. Both of these allegations are against FA rules. Harrison is shown to privately decline the offer and decides to look elsewhere. (Porritt ended up staying at Middlesbrough, but never made an appearance for the first team.) * Sam Allardyce, who was allegedly bribed by Harrison, in regards with new signings to Bolton Wanderers, to pay his son Craig, also an agent, the money. Allardyce strenuously denies the allegations. In a statement to the Evening Chronicle, Harrison said, \\"Have a good look at the programme and see where the bungs are. There aren't any. There is no film, no evidence of them happening at all; no money changes hands. I've been in football for a lot of years and I've never had anything at all to do with bungs and I wouldn't want to.\\" Harrison had previous dealings with Allardyce ‚Äì in 2005, Allardyce loaned him and Lucas Neill ¬£300,000 to fund a property development at Laverick Hall Farm, Gateshead into 14 homes, and the agreement was to repay Allardyce ¬£600,000 plus interest, but the development was never built. The then-Bolton Wanderers manager took legal action against Harrison and Neill to recoup his money through the High Court in 2007, claiming some ¬£650,000 plus interest and costs, and the pair conceded and agreed to repay it. In 2009, Harrison faced a bankruptcy hearing in which the court made the order for ¬£782,000 ‚Äì it had emerged that he has already paid back around ¬£650,000. In an interview with The Daily Mail, Harrison admitted taking advantage of the then-chairman of West Ham United, Eggert Magn√∫sson, over the 2007 transfer of Neill to the Hammers. Neill was initially going to Liverpool, but West Ham United offered a better wage packet. At the time, Neill refuted that the transfer was monetary reasons, stating the move was for purely footballing reasons. Harrison represented Andy Carroll since the age of 16, and successfully negotiated his first professional contract and subsequent deals at Newcastle United. However, Carroll had told him that he wanted to be represented by Kevin Nolan's agent Mark Curtis, a couple of months after signing a two-year contract with Harrison. In the aftermath of Carroll's ¬£35 million transfer to Liverpool, the Reds used David Bromley, a little-known agent (although Carroll stated otherwise; he had taken advice from a solicitor, Richard Green). Bromley is an associate of Curtis, and Harrison had been reported to have sued Carroll for loss of earnings (as per FA rules), which was referred to arbitration. He also lost Jussi J√§√§skel√§inen, then at West Ham United, to Curtis around this time. Curtis has represented Allardyce for years, and was at odds with Harrison, following the Panorama documentary. In 2012, Harrison made a number of accusations on Twitter towards Curtis, Allardyce and Bolton Wanderers chairman and FA board member Phil Gartside. These actions resulted in a threat of legal action from the FA to protect Gartside. He retired as a football agent later that year, after the FA arbitration panel found against him in the Andy Carroll deal. =Other interests= In 2010, Harrison was the public face behind the takeover of Olympic Charleroi, and was described as the general manager by the club's secretary and the president by the team coach. Although he appeared on Belgian TV outlining his plans for the club, his lawyers described him simply as an \\"ambassador\\" for Olympic, who merely \\"encouraged\\" players to sign. The club went into insolvency, struggled to pay bills and players' wages, and some young players become hungry and homeless. According to FIFA rules, an applicant for a players' agent licence may not hold a position at a club. Harrison declined to speak to the BBC over the matter.

Biography  Cheron was born in Paris and was a pupil of Fran√ßois Meuret (1800‚Äì1887). She belonged to the Salon in Paris from 1846 to 1870. After 1870, when the popularity of portrait miniature started declining, Cheron only painted still portraits and landscapes on porcelain. She lived for a long time in Paris, at 52 rue De Chabrol, then at 22 rue Montholon and finally, in the last years of her life at Samois-sur-Seine. On 27 August 1850, she married Amed√©e Paul Cheron (Paris, 11 March 1819 ‚Äì 5 May 1881) and they had one son, Jacques Paul (b. 12 April 1953). On 7 July 1881, Jacques Paul married Lucie (Lucy) Josephine Fehrenbach (born 19 December 1856), who was a pupil of her mother and a miniature painter in Paris where she lived at 18 rue de L‚ÄôAncienne Com√©die. She participated to the Salon in Paris from 1875 to 1880 and also painted the portrait of the poet Fran√ßois Copp√©e. In 1881, after the death of Amed√©e, Aimee was granted a civil pension. Amed√©e was a well known bibliographer, who in 1845, entered the Imperial Library as director of the department for reprinting rare books regarding fine art and French history. In 1855/1856 he wrote, for the editor Jannet, the General catalogue of all literary works published in the period 1800‚Äì1855 and an additional book for Causeries du Lundi by Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve. Aim√©e‚Äôs style was very detailed, in the pointillist style typical of her teacher Francois Meuret. This style was also adopted by another of Meuret's pupils, Camille Corn√©ile Isbert (1825‚Äì1911), who often exhibited her miniatures at the Salon together with Aim√©e. She was a good drawer, she treated with great care all the details of the sitter's face, especially the skin tones. Also the clothing is painted with great attention and the backgrounds are various: landscapes, interiors, or simple monochrome. She had a deep faculty of introspection and succeeded in rendering the temperamental and psychological dimension of the sitters. She signed her miniatures \\"Aim√©e Jovin\\" until 1850. From 1852 to 1872 she showed at the Salon, signing her pieces as \\"Aim√©e Cheron\\". Cheron was also the surname of another painter and miniaturist, Elisabeth Sophie Cheron (1684‚Äì1711). Among her pupils was Tatiane Gerardin, who exhibited her works at the Salon from 1875 to 1885. In 1865, Aim√®e was represented in a marble bust by the sculptor Charles Cordier (1827‚Äì1905), which is now in the private collection of the descendants of Cordier.

This approach involves a reciprocal relationship between both the therapist and client, through which the client works through his or her clinical problems using dialogical conversation with the therapist. The therapist and client work together, utilizing their own, individual knowledge and understanding of the issues, to conceptualize and illuminate the client‚Äôs problems and provide new context, meaning and comprehension to those problems based on the collaboration.  Early sources  The theoretical approach known as collaborative language systems evolved from the traditional basis of collaborative therapy. Together, Harlene Anderson and Harry Goolishian took the core values incorporated into practiced therapeutic techniques involving reciprocal approaches toward the client-patient relationship and applied a cooperative understanding of the use of modern language and the role it plays in the formulation of ideas and perception, as well as Rogerian theory towards the therapeutic relationship. Goolishian and Anderson were later joined by Lynn Hoffman in expanding the application of their ideas. The approach corrected by the collective contributors was eventually expounded upon by Tom Andersen, who thrust the theories into a broader range of practice within the field family systems therapy.  Creating collaborative therapy  Collaborative therapy emerged as a postmodernist concept rooted in philosophical principles as a way to challenge existing psychotherapeutic approaches. The basic foundations upon which collaborative language systems are based involve the formation of our understanding of events and situations based on the words used to describe them. Through narration and dialogue, it is theorized, we give meaning to situations. This meaning changes given the context of the conversation and how we choose to describe it. Collaborative therapists believe that knowledge and language, and thus the meaning each is given, are interdependent, dynamic processes that change through the exchange of information and ideas.  Therapist‚Äìclient relationship  Unlike traditional psychotherapy, the collaborative therapist plays a more active role in the therapist/patient relationship. As narration is essential to this form of therapy, the therapist constantly invites and facilitates the dialogue in order to sustain a constant exchange of ideas and experience. The therapist‚Äôs goal is to gain an understanding of the client‚Äôs problems through their narration by attempting to comprehend meaning from the perspective of the client. This process serves as a co-learning experience during which the therapist pays close attention to both what and how things are being said. Any comments or suggestions made by the therapist are used simply as a basis for continued conversation rather than an attempt at guidance or persuasion. The role of a collaborative therapist is to provide a context in which the client can begin to author, edit, and re-edit their own lives through the development and exchange of language. Despite the implicit implications regarding influence during this mutual exchange, the process most closely resembles the ethical practice of re-framing rather than coaching. The collaborative therapist believes that the open exchange of ideas and continuous dialogue will create opportunities for growth and transformation within the client.  Application of Ideas  Collaborative language systems holds to certain core concepts during the conversational practice of therapy. Those concepts are: * Conversational Partners * Client Expertise * \\"Not Knowing\\" * Transparency * Uncertainty * \\"Everyday Ordinary Life\\" * Mutual Transformation These philosophies attempt to ensure, while working in tandem, the relationship between client and therapist grows in a mutually inclusive way, expounding upon the knowledge and understanding of situations by placing both the parties on the same level, providing the client the ability to share and explore their understanding openly and freely while setting and meeting their goals for therapy based on the end points they set for themselves. In this way, collaborative therapy builds upon the humanistic ideals with the client as the expert. It then builds upon the social constructionist view of identity through open dialogue. This theory involves the creation and understanding of problem an situations based upon the context and exchange in which they are formed. As the client and the therapist build their relationship through dialogical conversation, the context and meaning the client gives to the problems they are facing is altered as new perspectives and alternative viewpoints are offered by the therapist for consideration.

They were the pioneers of free public education for girls in Italy. They are commonly called the Venerini Sisters. History =Founding= The foundress of the institute, Rose Venerini, was born in Viterbo, Italy, in 1656, the daughter of a leading physician of the city. She felt a strong desire to serve God from her childhood. She entered briefly a Dominican monastery, but had to leave to care for her mother, after the unexpected death of her father.\\"Saint Rose Venerini\\", Franciscan Media Once home, Venerini searched for how she could still fulfill her commitment to God. She invited women and girls of the town to gather in her home to pray the rosary together. Conversations with them showed her the depth of their ignorance of both their Catholic faith and of general knowledge. Under the guidance of a Jesuit spiritual director, she gradually came to see answering the crying need for education as her calling, rather than the cloistered life. On August 30, 1685, with the approval of the Bishop of Viterbo, Cardinal Urbano Sacchetti, and the collaboration of two friends, Gerolama Coluzzelli and Porzia Bacci, Venerini left her father's home to begin her first school. The primary objective of the school was to give poor girls a complete Christian formation and to prepare them for life in society. Rose opened the first public school for girls in Italy. The origins were humble but the impact was deep, and it did not take long to receive the recognition of the religious and civil authorities. The three teachers had to face the resistance of clergy who considered the teaching of the catechism as their exclusive prerogative. But the harshest suspicion came from those who were scandalized by the boldness of this woman of the upper middle class of Viterbo, who had taken to heart the education of ignorant girls. The same pastors later recognized the moral improvement which education had generated among the girls and their mothers. =Expansion= After her initial successes, in 1692 Venerini was invited by the Bishop of Montefiascone, Cardinal Marcantonio Barbarigo, to establish schools in that diocese under her vision. She also trained a local successor, the future St. Lucia Filippini,\\"Feast of St. Rosa Venerini\\", Catholic Sun, diocese of Phoenix, May 7, 2019 who soon established an independent religious institute of teachers, who came to be known as the Religious Teachers Filippini. Venerini then returned to Viterbo to supervise the original school. From there, other schools were started throughout the region of Lazio. The Sisters were invited to duplicate their work in Rome in 1706, but the first experience there was a major failure, one which marked her deeply and caused her to wait six long years before regaining the trust of the authorities. On December 8, 1713, with the help of an abbot who was a good friend of the Venerini family, Venerini was able to open one of her schools in the center of Rome at the foot of the Campidoglio.Vatican News Service \\"Rosa Venerini\\" On October 24, 1716, they received a visit from Pope Clement XI, accompanied by eight Cardinals, who wanted to observe their lessons. Amazed and pleased, at the end of the morning he addressed these words to the foundress: ‚ÄúSignora Rosa, you are doing that which we cannot do. We thank you very much because with these schools you will sanctify Rome‚Äù. From that time on, governors and cardinals sought for the Sisters to establish schools in their areas. =Worldwide service= In 1909, the Sisters expanded their work to the United States, their first foreign site, going at the invitation of a pastor in Lawrence, Massachusetts, to help with the influx of Italian immigrants. They arrived there on November 28, 1909, and opened the first day care program in the state.\\"Saint Rose Venerini\\" The Newman Connection From there, they were invited to serve in other parishes in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and in the Diocese of Albany in New York.

The name is nominally a registered trademark of based in Suita, Osaka which is still the major market-share holder, but the enforceability of the tradename has been voided by the Supreme Court of Japan, which ruled seirogan to be a common generic name. The ruling only recognizes proprietary use of the bugle logo by Taiko,, pp. 131-; discusses bugle as only recognized trademark; mentions a site that collected 26 different similar looking seirogan brand boxes; on p. 134 is a gallery of 20 different such boxes. but not protection of its characteristic packaging. As a result, dozens of extremely similar packaged drugs are being manufactured and sold in the market.  Overview  Seirogan is a general-use medicine, mainly to treat the gastro-intestinal system.

To emphasize the distinction, wood creosote in Japan is sometimes called by such names as and minor variants thereof. The wood creosote is blended with two or more recognized in for their antiseptic and other effects, but the additional ingredients used are different among manufacturers (See under #Chemical composition for a sampling of formulas). Some quarters (perhaps kanp≈ç medicine practitioners and others) insist however that \\"Seirogan is not strictly speaking kanp≈ç medicine\\", and this point was emphatically printed in a retraction by a certain consumer-watch type book that criticized seirogan but had confused wood creosote with the industrial type. The retraction was in the magazine Sh≈´kan Kin'y≈çbi issue 8/20/1999, special on Katte wa ikenai; excerpt:\\"Ê≠£Èú≤‰∏∏„Çí„ÄåÊº¢ÊñπËñ¨„Äç„Å®„Åó„Åæ„Åó„Åü„Åå„ÄÅÊº¢ÊñπËñ¨„ÅÆÊàêÂàÜ„Åß„ÅÇ„ÇãÁîüËñ¨„ÅØ‰Ωø„Çè„Çå„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„ÅÆ„ÄÅÂé≥ÂØÜ„Å´„ÅØ„ÄåÊº¢ÊñπËñ¨„Äç„Åß„ÅØ„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åõ„Çì„ÄÇ...

In the classic form, it is a dark brown round pill, but in order to mask its distinctive medicinal odor and bitterness, sugar-coated tablet forms have become available as well. =Trademark= The Seirogan (Ê≠£Èú≤‰∏∏) name was filed for trademark registration by Taiko Pharmaceutical in 1954, but approximately thirty competitors such as objected, leading to a lengthy battle, petitioning the Patent Office, then later litigating in court. The Tokyo District Court rejected Taiko's claim to proprietary use of the Seirogan name, and the Supreme Court of Japan upheld that decision in 1974. The Supreme Court delivered the opinion that the name seirogan had passed into a common noun, so that use of the Seirogan (Ê≠£Èú≤‰∏∏) name by any company was valid, not answerable to the claims of this trademark, and did not constitute an infringement of any intellectually property rights thereof. The court also did not recognize Taiko Pharmaceutical's exclusive right to use the distinctive color scheme and graphic design on the packaged box (and sticker label on the pill bottle), with the exception of the product logo depicting a bugle. (Cf. #Taiko's trademark registration and Izumi's lawsuit to revoke trademark). As a consequence, there are currently numerous Seirogan products in the market that feature logos other than the bugle but otherwise look remarkably similar: Izumi Yakuhin Kogyou (calabash logo), (triangle and bear logo, nicknamed Y≈´tan, says the mascot name Y≈´tan is a pun on ). The retailer/drug store chain and wholesaler also market their own brands. In 2005, Taiko filed a lawsuit against a competitor, demanding suppression of what it considered copycat merchandise, but again lost the case in court, and the Supreme Court rejected the appeal in 2008 (Cf. #Taiko's petition for an injunction against unfair competitive practices). The bugle tune being played in Taiko's commercials for the product is the ex-Japanese Imperial Army bugle call to announce mealtime, colloquially known as the . The tune used currently by the Self Defense Force is of a different melody.

The Japanese Imperial Army, which experienced considerable setbacks due to unclean water sources during the Sino-Japanese War at the end of the 19th century, was working on solutions to combat infectious diseases. Surgeon-major , an instructor at the Military Medical College, discovered in 1903 that creosote agent was an effective suppressant for the typhoid fever pathogen. Taiko Pharmaceutical claims the Osaka-based medicine merchant developed the a year earlier in 1902 and initiated sales, which business was eventually handed over to Taiko. The higher echelons of the Army Medical Corps, including writer Mori ≈ågai, favored the German view that beriberi, a disease that caused an even heavier death toll than typhoid, was caused by an undiscovered transmittable pathogens (in contrast, British-trained doctors in the navy correctly saw it as a nutritional disorder). Prompted by their misguided view, the army distributed vast quantities of Seirogan (with their proven antiseptic properties) among the troops to be administered daily throughout the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5. In an army medical journal of 1901 there is mention of the pill as , but in the journals of 1904-5 appears the name ., p.21-22 The name Seirogan was widely used as the academic term by army doctors for about a 4-year span. But this was in the days when drug use as preventive medicine was not a widely embraced concept, and soldiers resisted swallowing this weird-smelling and unfamiliar pill, even when so instructed. The top brass decided to invoke the name of Emperor Meiji, telling the men that taking the pill was \\"according to the wishes of His Imperial Majesty\\". This subterfuge reportedly greatly improved the soldiers' compliance towards taking the pill, making them less prone to be forced out of action due to stomach aches or diarrhea. The army doctors were however disappointed to find that the pill did not show any of the desired combative effect towards the (non-existent) beriberi microbe. The army insisted on feeding their men pure white rice to boost morale, but that led to vitamin-deficient diet, so that one in three men serving the Russo- Japanese War were afflicted by beriberi, and 27,800 succumbed to it. Meanwhile, the Japanese navy deduced early on that beriberi was a nutritional disorder, and added breads and (wheat or wheat-rice mixture steam-cooked like rice) to their rations, so that none of their servicemen fell ill with beriberi. While Seirogan proved powerless against beriberi, the antidiarrheal and toothache-soothing properties of the pill were passed on, in somewhat exaggerated fashion, by repatriated war veterans. Amid the mood of victory in war, Seirogan's name became \\"the cure-all that defeated Russia\\" and many drug- makers rushed to manufacture the pill, which became a national medicine unique to Japan. The reputation for the pill's effectiveness also spread within areas under Japanese control before the end of World War II, and Seirogan is said to be one of the popular items purchased by travelers from Taiwan, the People's Republic of China, and other Asian countries. The pill ceased to be part of regular military issue supplies in 1906, but the military continued to keep itself constantly supplied for use. In 2007, it was part of the supply kit issued to the SDF during the UN Mission in Nepal. After the war with Russia, and again after World War II, administrative guidance was issued against the use of the kanji character as being undesirable from the standpoint of international relations. So in most cases, the written name of the pill was changed to . Taiko Pharmaceutical made the change in 1949., quote:\\"„ÄåÊ≠£Èú≤‰∏∏„Äç„ÅØÂΩìÂàù„ÄÅ‰∏Ä‰πù„Äá‰∫åÂπ¥„ÄÅ‰∏≠Â≥∂‰Ωè‰∏Ä„Å´„Çà„Å§„Å¶„Äå‰ªªÈú≤‰∏∏(Èú≤Ë•ø‰∫ú„Çí‰ªª‰ºê„Åô„Çã„ÅÆÊÑè)„Äç„ÅÆÂïÜÂìÅÂêç„Å´„Çà„Å§„Å¶Ë£ΩÈÄ†Áô∫Â£≤„Åï„Çå„Åü„Åå„ÄÅ‰∏Ä‰πùÂõõÂÖ≠Âπ¥Â§ßÂπ∏Ëñ¨ÂìÅ„ÅåË£ΩÈÄ†Áô∫Â£≤„Åô„Çã„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´„Å™„Çä„ÄÅ‰∏Ä‰πùÂõõ‰πùÂπ¥„ÄåÊ≠£Èú≤‰∏∏„Äç„Å®ÂêçÁß∞Â§âÊõ¥\\" But one manufacturer still uses the old written form that reads \\"conquer\\".  Intellectual property rights dispute  = Taiko's trademark registration and Izumi's lawsuit to revoke trademark = In 1946, the leading manufacturer of the pill, had obtained through formal negotiation with Saichi Nakajima the right to continue selling his \\"Ch≈´y≈´ Seirogan\\" pill. Accordingly, in 1954, Taiko made a claim for the exclusive use of the \\"Seirogan\\" name, and filed for trademark registration. Other manufacturers of the seirogan-type pill objected to this move, led by , which had developed its own creosote formula, and had supplied the military with its seirogan throughout World War II despite supply shortages. The group petitioned the Patent Office in April 1955 to revoke the trademark. It was not until April 1960, that the Patent Office handed down its decision to maintain the registered trademark. So the group filed a suit in the Tokyo High Court, which in September 1971, ruled that \\"The seirongan is recognized by the nation's populace as a common name for bowels-regulating agents that use creosote as main ingredient, and [the court hereby] rules to void the Patent Office's decision to make it a proprietary trademark\\". This ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Japan, thus finalizing the decision in March 1974. However, the Seirogan registered trademark is still retained by Taiko Pharmaceutical (Trademark Registration No. 545984). It is not clear why the registered trademark remains unexpunged despite the supreme court ruling, but a trademark registration does not vanish automatically, and needs to go through a Patent Office review process. The Patent Office may have surmised that the Court's ruling effectively accomplished the purpose or remedy sought by the petitioners, obviating the need for another review. The Court's opinion made it expressly clear that the name Seirogan had passed into a common noun, which meant that the trademark privileges (proprietary rights) upon it was not protected or enforceable pursuant to Japan's Trademark Act, Article 26, Paragaraph 2. Thus companies other than Taiko are allowed to sell the drug under the \\"Seirogan\\" name, without this constituting an infringement of trademark. Taiko's attempted litigation in 2005-8 (described) also failed to establish its proprietary rights. But the Court's opinion curiously left open a leeway, allowing for possible future reversal depending on the shift in popular convention. Seirogan is one of few pharmaceutical drugs names thus given public domain status, aspirin being another immediately called to mind. = Taiko's petition for an injunction against unfair competitive practices = On November 24, 2005, Taiko Pharmaceutical filed a suit against Izumi Yakuhin Kogyou in the , claiming the sales of merchandise with similar packaging constituted an act of unfair competitive practice under 2.1.1 or 2.1.2, and was an infringement of its trademark rights (docket number: Heisei 17 (waÔºâNo. 11663). On July 27, 2006, The Osaka District Court ruled against the plaintiff saying a distinction can be made between the bugle and calabash logos.Âπ≥ÊàêÔºëÔºòÂπ¥ÔºóÊúàÔºíÔºóÊó•Âà§Ê±∫Ë®ÄÊ∏° Âπ≥ÊàêÔºëÔºóÂπ¥(„ÉØ)Á¨¨ÔºëÔºëÔºñÔºñÔºìÂè∑‰∏çÊ≠£Á´∂‰∫âË°åÁÇ∫Â∑ÆÊ≠¢Á≠âË´ãÊ±Ç‰∫ã‰ª∂ (text of the Osaka Court's opinion) Taiko then appealed on August 7, but the Osaka High Court upheld the decision, and the Supreme Court's second rejected against hearing the case on July 4, 2008, which finalized Taiko's loss in this lawsuit. But in the opinion read by the court contained this passage: \\"Whether a certain label is a common name or not is an issue pertaining to perception by users (commercial dealers and consumers at large), so even if a label has been regarded as a common name within a certain period, it may later come to be perceived as denoting a specific product as a matter of the ongoing real situation of its commerce, and it is not impossible for it to regain its (i.e., manufacturer specifying) purpose\\".  Misinformed drug risk accusation controversy  The primary active ingredient used in seirogan is wood-tar creosote. This was listed merely as \\"creosote\\" in the first edition of the , a Ministry of Health issued guidebook, and remained so for a time, until it was listed more specifically as in the fifteenth revised first supplement dated 2007,Japanese Ministry of Health Bulletin No. 316, dated 9/28/2007 making this the official name. In addition, \\"a long-term safety study in rats documented a lack of oncogenicity for wood creosote\\" The second supplement then defined the coal-derivative as a separate commodity (containing carcinogenic substances such as Benzo(a)pyrene, a Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon notes a study by Weiner that found incidence of cancer highest in Toyama prefecture where a manufacturer of Seirogan was located, but cautions this cannot be ascertained to be a correlating factor. Besides, Toyama is not the prefecture where the major manufacturer is headquartered.). The wood-tar creosote is commonly called \\"Nikkyoku creosote\\" (i.e. Japanese pharmacopoeial creosote) as a means to distinguish from potentially harmful industrial creosote. These recent naming conventions were prompted by a controversy set off by a consumer alert booklet, (pub. 1999) that anthologized a series run in the magazine '. The booklet accused seirogan of its dangers, based on the mistaken notion that the wood-tar creosote and the industrial creosote oil were identical commodities. Notes  References  , pp. 130-.

At , it is the longest railroad bridge in the province. The bridge incorporates a swing span at its eastern end to permit the continued passage of marine traffic through the strait. It is an arch truss design, consisting of seven riveted steel trusses, each long, set on cut stone piers. The Grand Narrows Bridge crosses the Barra Strait of Bras d'Or Lake, carrying the Sydney Subdivision of the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway (CBNS) between Iona, Victoria County, on the West side, and Grand Narrows, Cape Breton County (Cape Breton Regional Municipality) on the east side. In 1993, a double leaf bascule bridge, the Barra Strait Bridge, carrying Route 223, was constructed just to the east of the Grand Narrows Bridge. The Government of Nova Scotia had operated a small ferry service for motor vehicles across the strait, starting in 1847, and continued for the next 146 years, which was replaced in October 1993 by the opening of the Barra Strait Bridge. Construction In 1887 the firm of Isbester and Reid contracted to build the foundations of a bridge at Grand Narrows, Cape Breton, and a 46-mile stretch of the Intercolonial Railway between the narrows and Point Tupper, near Port Hawkesbury. Work was under way by 1889 when one of the principals of the firm, Robert Gillespie Reid, arrived on site and spent some three weeks testing sea bed sediments and measuring the currents running through the Barra Strait. This was necessary as the strait is deep, over deep at its southern end and still over deep at the site chosen for the new bridge at the northern limit of the strait between Uniacke Point to the west and Kelly Point to the east. Other complicating factors in the construction of the bridge were the very strong, erratic tidal currents in the strait, overburden on the bedrock, and the presence of ice during the winter and spring breakup. I.C.R. Bridge, Grand Narrows Cape Breton, N.S. circa 1909 While the actual length of this structure was not extraordinary, at around seventeen hundred feet, the actual process of laying the masonry foundation was. Cofferdams, made of timber, were built on shore, ballasted, and floated out into the channel. These were then sunk in the locations where the bridge piers were to be built and sections were added to the tops until the dams reached from the surface to the bottom of the channel, resting on the floor of the strait. The dams were heavily ballasted around their outer walls, then pumped dry so excavation of the overburden could begin. Once bedrock was reached a flat area was quarried out and long anchor bolts were sunk into the rock below. The seven cut stone bridge piers were then constructed inside the cofferdams, starting from bedrock, building up to a level about 4 or 5 feet above the surface of the water in the strait. The bridge trusses had been prefabricated in Montreal by the Dominion Bridge Company, and were shipped to Grand Narrows. An iron forge was set up on the site for the express purpose of producing rivets, and assembly of the trusses was started, first onshore, and then completed on scows floating in the water. These completed trusses were then floated out into the strait, jacked up and lowered into their positions on the bridge piers. R.G. Reid built the Grand Narrows Bridge for the Intercolonial Railway for $530,000. Swing Span at the east end of the Grand Narrows Bridge open to permit the passage of marine traffic. The bridge operator's cabin is visible in the top of the bridge arch. Official opening At midnight on October 18, 1890, the five-car special train of Governor General Lord Stanley left Halifax, and arrived at Mulgrave in the early morning. The five cars were ferried across the Strait of Canso, and reassembled into a train at Point Tupper, with the Intercolonial Railway Company's locomotive #166 in front. At Iona, Lord Stanley (best remembered as the donor of hockey's Stanley Cup) formally declared the railway to Sydney open for traffic, and then himself drove the train across the Grand Narrows bridge. The official train reached Sydney at 7:10 pm, touching off celebrations that lasted well into the night. 1915 Truss upgrade By the time of the first World War, as rolling stock on the Sydney Subdivision had continually been getting heavier, it was determined the bridge needed to be upgraded to handle the loads. In 1915 A contract was issued and the spans were replaced, again by Isbester and Reid, with heavier, stronger ones using a method similar to the original placements. Rail traffic was not interrupted for more that 8 hours at a time during the changeover. Marine traffic Marine traffic through the Barra Strait has been logged since 1991, and has consistently ranged between 1700 and 2100 boats passing through the swing and bascule bridges each year, with a peak of 2100 passages recorded for 2002. Of these movements, an estimated 2% are commercial activity, 8% are government and 90% are recreational. When the swing span is opened for marine traffic the resulting channel is wide and deep. While the Barra Strait is considerably deeper at the bridges, channel depth is limited to by the presence of the wreck of the Zealandia which rests on the bottom of the strait, lying directly across the channel passage through the bridges. The Zealandia was originally built as a 3 masted, full-rigged clipper with an iron hull by C. Connell and Co. in Glasgow in 1869. She was later converted to a barge and used to carry dolomite to the Dominion Iron and Steel Company steel plant in Sydney. In July 1916 the Zealandia broke her tow during a gale and sank after crashing into the Barra Strait railway bridge. The wreck is 220 ft long by 40 ft wide and at the stern, it rises 30 ft off the bottom. On December 30, 2014 Genesee & Wyoming, the operators of the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway (CBNS), ceased rail service on Sydney Subdivision of the line. At that time the Grand Narrows Bridge was swung into the open position and has remained open ever since. Uncertain future The subdivision of the railway carried by the Grand Narrows Bridge ceased operations at the end of 2014 and it is uncertain if the bridge will ever carry rail traffic in the future. A study conducted for the Port of Sydney Development Corporation, carried out by Hatch Ltd, concluded that at minimum, $12,400,000 worth of work was required to put the bridge back in service at a minimum Class 1 standard, limiting rail traffic crossing the bridge to a maximum of only . Part of the expected work required would include a complete refit of the bride's electrical and mechanical systems. Bringing the bridge back up to a Class 3 standard () would cost considerably more.

The line is the northernmost German section of the route from Berlin to Stockholm.  Course  The line starts at Stralsund Central Station. Even before it leaves the station yard, it branches off from the Angerm√ºnde-Stralsund Railway and swings away to the northeast. A link curve to the south enables trains to run straight into Stralsund from the island of R√ºgen without having to change direction. After passing the branch to the port of Stralsund (Stralsunder Hafen), it reaches the R√ºgen Causeway (R√ºgendamm). Strelasund Bridge Shortly thereafter, the line passes over the 133-metre-long Ziegelgraben Bridge - a bascule bridge - to the island of D√§nholm off the Strelasund. Then it goes over the 540-metre-long Strelasund Bridge to the island of R√ºgen. The Ziegelgraben Bridge, the Strelasund Bridge and the embankments on the mainland and D√§nholm form the R√ºgen Causeway which has a total length of 2,500 metres. The line runs through Altef√§hr, Rambin, Samtens and Teschenhagen to Bergen auf R√ºgen, the starting point for the branch line to Lauterbach Mole. From Bergen it continues in a northeasterly direction along the north coast of the lagoon known as the Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden. In Lietzow the train crosses the causeway, built in 1869, that separates the Kleiner from the Gro√üer Jasmunder Bodden. Behind Lietzow the branch line to Binz branches off, a branch which is also worked by Intercity trains. About four miles further on, at Borchtitz, the connecting line to the Mukran Ferry Port branches off in a southeasterly direction. Both international passenger trains to Sweden, which use the so- called Kings Line ferry, as well as freight trains to Lithuanian Klaipƒóda pass along this four kilometre long section to the ferry. Trains to Sassnitz leave from Borchtitz carrying straight on. The track, which was previously only a few metres above sea level in most places, passes initially Sagard and reaches its highest point at elevation of about 70 metres above NN just before Lancken. Sassnitz station (called Sa√ünitz until 1993) is located north of the town centre and is designed as a railway terminus. From here, the connecting line to the old Sassnitz harbour (Sassnitzer Hafen) ran away in a long curve to the left, climbing a vertical height of almost 35 metres over a distance of about two kilometres. At Sassnitz Harbour there used to be ferry slips (F√§hrbr√ºcken) as well before the ferry operation was shifted to Mukran. The line is electrified over its total length using catenary carrying 15 kV, 16.7 Hz AC and, with the exception of the sections from Stralsund R√ºgendamm to Altef√§hr and Lietzow to Sassnitz Hafen/Sassnitz F√§hrhafen R√ºgen, also double- tracked.  History  Even at the time of the opening of the Angerm√ºnde- Stralsund Railway in 1863, efforts were being made to extend services through R√ºgen towards Sweden. It took another 20 years, however, until 1 July 1883, before the first short section was opened between the towns of Altef√§hr and Bergen auf R√ºgen. A fixed Strelasund crossing was considered, but none of the options was persuasive, so the Prussian state railways established a railway ferry instead, across the Strelasund between Stralsund Harbour and Altef√§hr. The Stralsund Ferry operated the railway ferry service over the Strela Sound from 1890 to 1936. Eight years later, on 1 July 1891, the railway was extended from Bergen via Lietzow to Sassnitz.The railway network in Stralsund and the Stralsund engine shed, accessed on 15 February 2009. To operate mailboat services between Sassnitz and Trelleborg, the line was extended by two kilometres on 1 May 1897 from Sassnitz station to the port of Sassnitz. For space reasons, the tracks from Sassnitz had to be run out to the southwest, allowing trains to and from the port in Sassnitz to make the necessary change of direction. The route, which climbs a height difference of about 30 metres, has a maximum gradient of 27 per mille. Twelve years later, the Kingdom of Sweden and the German Empire agreed to open a railway ferry between Sassnitz and Trelleborg. Each party built two ferries to operate the service. The port installations in Sassnitz were modified accordingly. The trains could transfer to the ships over two ferry slips after changing direction again at the port. The link was called the Kings Line because of the presence of the two monarchs at its opening ceremony. A pair of night trains was established running between Berlin and Stockholm and covering the distance in about 22 hours. As a result of the ferry services to Sweden, traffic on the railway increased steadily so that the question of a fixed crossing of the Strelasund came up again. In 1927, the first concrete proposals were submitted, the options of a bridge and a tunnel being eliminated because of the higher costs for the ramps. In 1931, the decision was taken in favour of a causeway combining embankment sections and bridges, the R√ºgendamm. The crossing was built in the years 1933 to 1936 for both rail and the envisaged road traffic and consists of five sections: * Mainland embankment * Ziegelgraben Bridge (133 metres) ‚Äì bascule bridge * D√§nholm embankment * R√ºgendamm Bridge (540 metres) * R√ºgen embankment The five sections have a total length of about two and a half kilometres. With the opening of the R√ºgen Causeway (R√ºgendamm) to railway traffic on 5 October 1936, ferry services between the port of Stralsund and Altef√§hr were discontinued. The journey time was shortened by around one hour. The Second World War caused damage to the line, especially in the area of Stralsund. On 1 May the Ziegelgraben Bridge was blown up and, two days later, the Strelasund Bridge was also demolished by retreating Wehrmacht soldiers. As a result, the R√ºgendamm was closed for the next two years and did not re-open until 15 October 1947 after the erection of temporary bridges, whereupon international traffic to Sweden could be resumed. The temporary bridges lasted until 1961 before being replaced by the Dessau Steelworks (Stahlbau Dessau). To increase the ferry capacity further, the GDR leadership decided to build a new ferry port in Sassnitz quarter of Mukran. Once this was completed, the port initially only handled goods traffic to Sweden, and the Port of Klaipƒóda in the Soviet Union (now in Lithuania). Because the latter ferry service linked to Russian broad gauge rail ferries with a track gauge of , change of gauge facilities were installed in Mukran. To connect to the ferry port a stub line was built from Borchtitz. Shortly after this branches off, the trackage spreads out into the Mukran marshalling yard, where the northern track system is standard gauge and the southern track system is broad gauge. There are two ferry slips leading onto the ferries for each gauge. Simultaneously with the construction of the port, the lines from Stralsund to Sassnitz and Borchtitz to Mukran were electrified, being completed on 27 May 1989. On Ziegelgraben Bridge a third rail was laid instead of the normal overhead catenary. At the same time the Deutsche Reichsbahn erected a power line over the Strela Sound to supply the island network whenever the Ziegelgraben Bridge was opened. Shortly after electrification, the Deutsche Reichsbahn electrification began the restoration of the R√ºgendamm in 1990 and a complete replacement of the superstructure. For example, the five bridge segments of the Strelasund Bridge were completely replaced between 9 and 13 May 1990 in an 84.5-hour break by the Dessau Steelworks. The parts were prefabricated in Mukran and then taken by two floating cranes to their destination. The Ziegelgraben Bridge was renovated two years later. During a 15-day closure between 6 and 22 May 1992, all essential elements of bridge were dismantled and replaced with new components. The mechanical drive of the bridge was replaced by a hydraulic one. The replacement of the bridge segments was again handled by floating cranes. After completion of the work the top speed of the line on the R√ºgendamm, which had fallen to just 30 km/h towards the end, was raised again to 90 km/h. On 7 January 1998, passenger ferry services from the old Sassnitz harbour were transferred to the Mukran ferry terminal following its conversion. About three years later, on 1 December 2000, the steep section of line to Sassnitz Harbour was closed.  Rail services and rolling stock  Ziegelgraben Bridge in the open position. The rod protruding from the bridge is used to attach the rigid power rail. The line is used for both long- distance and local passenger services as well as goods trains. In long- distance traffic individual trains on InterCity services (nos. 26, 27, 30 and 51) stop at the Stralsund and Bergen, before continuing to Binz. These trains are usually hauled by electric locomotives of classes 101 and 120. In addition, a single Berlin Night Express pair of trains runs between Berlin and the Swedish city of Malm√∂ without stopping on R√ºgen. The night train, which comprises sleepers and couchette cars, is hauled by Class 182 electric locomotives. Regional services are provided by RE line 9 between Stralsund and Sassnitz or Binz at 60-minute intervals. Until the transition to multiple units of Class 429/829 the trains comprised electric locomotives of Class 143 and double-decker coaches. Goods transport mainly consists of transit traffic to Lithuania, Russia and Sweden. Although this decreased dramatically after 1989, it still makes the largest proportion of the total volume of goods. The trains are usually headed by electric locomotives of Class 155. Broad gauge duties in Mukran continue to be carried out by Class 347 shunters, which were Class 346 engines modified for use on track gauge. Ferry service to Sweden ended temporarily on 13 March 2020, a decision made permanent the following month  Literature  *  References   External links  * Category:Railway lines in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Category:Stralsund Category:R√ºgen Category:Buildings and structures in Vorpommern-R√ºgen ","title":"Stralsund‚ÄìSassnitz railway"},{"id":"35759628","text":"Kur Gaz-e Bala (, also Romanized as K≈´r Gaz-e BƒÅlƒÅ; also known as KhuryƒÅs and K≈´reh Gaz BƒÅlƒÅ) is a village in Alqurat Rural District, in the Central District of Birjand County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Nissen Company was based on John Nissen's formula for an indelible ink to mark the stockings. While largely unknown outside of its industry, the JP Nissen Company's many innovations were significant to manufacturing and labor. Its products included Dye-Resist Markers and a black Bleach Proof marker. The markers were used to mark bolts of cloth prior to dying and bleaching. These products allowed the textile industry to use unskilled labor, replacing the higher skilled employees who previously embroidered lot numbers on the bolts of cloth. During World War II, the company manufactured markers that were used for the U.S. Navy personnel to mark their uniforms. The company sold these \\"clos-mar-king\\" markers to naval post exchanges until the 1980s. During WW II, workers at the Baldwin Locomotive Works which was producing tanks for the US Army at that time, were using Nissen textile markers to mark the steel plates. The company decided to produce ball-point Metal Markers to better fulfill this need. Both Textile Markers and the Metal Markers are still used by J.P. Nissen Company today. In the early 1970s, the company developed the first Low Chloride Metal Marker which was used for nuclear applications in defense works, nuclear- powered ships and nuclear power generating plants. Now more than 85 years old, the company sells its markers in over 81 countries. In 2009, longtime employee Robert Pali succeeded Peter Nissen as president and Chief Operating Officer. Robert Pali is currently serving his second term as the treasurer for the American Welding Society.http://www.aws.org/w/a/membership/officers.html Additionally in 2006 he was the American Welding Society's recipient of the National Meritorious Certificate Award in recognition for his years of service with the organization.http://www.aws.org/w/a/awards/past_winners.html Patents Amongst J.P. Nissen's many patented innovations are: \\\\- a printing roller which, according to the patent, \\"has been particularly useful in the printing of fabric, and especially hosiery, wherein designs, trademarks, and the like, are permanently applied\\" issued on Dec 18, 1928.patent 1695437 \\\\- a marking implement that, according to the patent, could be \\"cheaply manufactured, so that when the material is entirely used, the implement can be discarded\\" issued on Dec 29, 1931.patent 1839160 \\\\- an implement for applying fluent materials issued on Jul 5, 1941.patent 2249163 \\\\- a Design for a tip of marking elements (a nip) issued on Nov 18, 1941.patent D130436 \\\\- a Collapsible tube (essential to the evolution of the marking pen) issued on Dec 21, 1943.patent 2337264  References   External links  * Official Nissen Markers Webpage * Official AWS Webpage Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1923 Category:Manufacturing companies based in Pennsylvania Category:1923 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"J.

It was conceived and curated by Jessica Brewster, and co-produced by Roland Smith. Theatre Souk is related to promenade theatre, immersive theatre or site-specific theatre, in which each audience member is required to devise his or her own route through the performance and thus has a unique theatrical experience. The model of Theatre Souk was designed to be reiterated in different locations with different participants. The Theatre Souk model is that of a performance marketplace where emerging theatre companies to showcase their more experimental work, in an immersive theatrical environment governed by the principles of exchange and barter. The ‚Äúpop-up‚Äù theatre project was developed in the period following the economic downturn, which led to the increased availability of commercial buildings kept empty by delayed building projects. In response to these economic conditions, and the cuts in arts funding that resulted from them, Theatre Souk was devised as a theatrical experience structured around barter and persuasion, highlighting the negotiation of use value and exchange value that is inherent in the production, dissemination, and consumption of art. The first Theatre Souk opened as a pop-up theatre event in a derelict building at 3-4 Picton Place, the former offices of Uzbekistan Airways, in the West End of London, and ran from September 14 to October 16, 2010. Theatre Delicatessen invited sixteen other theatre companies (comprising over sixty artists and performers) to create theatre performances and installations in different parts of the building. Each performance centered on the theme of money. Audience members paid ¬£7 to enter the building and were then required to negotiate with performers to determine the fee for each individual performance. The ground floor bar, where a series of cabaret acts played throughout, adopted the aesthetics of a trading floor, with a large blackboard listing different floors, rooms, and performances. Further intervention into the audience‚Äôs decision-making process was provided by roaming, improvising performers who interact directly with the audience members in corridor and other intermediate spaces, offering advice and suggestions on ways to move through the souk and encouraging audience to get the best deal.

Word spread among Germany's conductors, such as Max Rudolf, about her achievements in the U.S., including her Cleveland debut where she played Dvorak's Violin Concerto.

Led primarily by Black Carib chieftain Joseph Chatoyer, the Caribs successfully defended the windward side of the island against a military survey expedition in 1769, and rebuffed repeated demands that they sell their land to representatives of the British colonial government. Frustrated by what they saw as intransigence, the British commissioners launched a full-scale military assault on the Caribs in 1772 with the objective of subjugating and deporting them from the island. British unfamiliarity with the windward lands of the island and effective Carib defence of the island's difficult mountain terrain blunted the British advance, and political opposition to the expedition in London prompted an enquiry and calls for it to be ended.

Early life and domestic service Ellen Margaret Steer's father Harry was seasonally employed as a house painter, and her mother Florence was a charwoman.

The book \\"prompted a storm of hurt letters\\".

The Cambridge History of Italian Literature Cambridge: 1996; revised edition: 1999, p.169. is a 14th-century Italian epic attributed to the Florentine Sostegno di Zanobi and likely composed between 1350 and 1360Luigi Pulci: Morgante: The Epic Adventures of Orlando and His Giant Friend a complete English translation by Joseph Tusiani. Introduction and notes by Edoardo L√®bano. (Indiana University Press, 1998) , notes, p. 765 and p. 890. The poem is in ottava rima, composed of 40 cantos (or cantari) each of about 40 octaves. The work is an adaptation of the story of Charlemagne's battles in Spain and the adventures of his nephew, the paladin Orlando (Roland), including the tale of his mortal duel with Ferraguto and his ultimate death at Roncesvalles. The material derives originally from the much translated and adapted Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle (Historia Caroli Magni, Book IV of the Codex Calixtinus, a Latin chronicle concerning the feats of Charlemagne from the middle of the 12th century). The story of the death of Roland is also treated in The Song of Roland. An adaptation of the Pseudo-Turpin material also occurs in the anonymous Franco-Venetian epic L'Entr√©e d'Espagne (c.1320; the author is thought to be from Padua).Jessie Crosland. The Old French Epic. New York: Haskell House, 1951, 261-2. La Spagna, which has been described by critics as \\"a darkly dramatic and often electrifyingly effective treatment of Ganelon's final treachery and Orlando's noble death\\", was an important source for the Italian romantic epics Morgante by Luigi Pulci (the last five cantos of Pulci's work are based on La Spagna), Orlando innamorato by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Orlando furioso by Ludovico Ariosto. Plot The poem is an imaginative retelling of the events of Charlemagne's war against the Moors of Spain commanded by King Marsilio, including the historical events of the siege of Pamplona, the siege of Saragossa and the rout of Roncesvalles. The author begins with Charlemagne's intention to subdue Spain and then give the crown to his nephew, the count Orlando. Charlemagne goes to Spain with his army and attacks several major cities, including Pamplona, ruled by King Isolieri. Orlando challenges the Saracen knight Ferragu/Ferra√π to a duel and kills him on a bridge (Ferragu converts to Christianity at the point of death) (the duel lasts three days and extends for 79 stanzas). Believed dead, Orlando has a series of travels and adventures that lead him to North Africa and elsewhere. In the end, the author tells the famous episode of the treachery of Gano of Maganza, envious of the glory of the family of Orlando. In the great battle of Roncesvalles, the main characters die, but are vindicated by Charlemagne, who is finally able to conquer Spain and to condemn the fraudulent Gano.

Among such cases are United States v. Simms (1803), United States v. More (1805), Ex parte Bollman (1807), United States v. Hudson (1812), Cohens v. Virginia (1821), United States v. Perez (1824), Worcester v. Georgia (1832), and United States v. Wilson (1833). During Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had no general appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases. The Court could review criminal convictions from the state courts, but not the lower federal courts, via writs of error. It only did so twice. The Court could hear original habeas petitions, but disclaimed the authority to grant the writ post-conviction unless the sentence had already been completed. Thus, the majority of the Marshall Court's opinions on criminal law were issued in response to questions certified by divided panels of the circuit courts by a certificate of division. Most of the Marshall Court's criminal opinions involved defining the elements of federal crimes. Criminal statutes considered by the Court during this period involved assimilative crimes, counterfeiting, embargoes, insurance fraud, piracy, and slave trading. But, the Court twice disclaimed the authority to define common law crimes not proscribed by Congressional statute. The Marshall Court also issued important opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although the Court did not explicitly cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain influential in interpreting the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and venue provision of Article Three. The Court also laid down the common law rules of evidence in federal courts, including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule. Background The Judiciary Act of 1789 Under the Articles of Confederation, there were no general federal courts or crimes.Kurland, 1996, at 21-25.Rossman, 1990, at 550. Although the Articles authorized a federal court to punish \\"piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,\\" of 1781, art. IX, para. 1. and the Congress of the Confederation in 1775 created the Court of Appeals in Prize Cases, (1977). Congress soon devolved this power to the states. Rather than creating additional crimes, the Congress merely recommended to the states that they criminalize acts like piracy and counterfeiting. Criminal law was considered in the framing of the Constitution. In addition to the criminal procedure provisions of Article Three, the Constitutional Convention discussed piracy, crimes against the law of nations, treason, and counterfeiting.Kurland, 1996, at 25-53. As Alexander Hamilton noted in Federalist No. 21, a \\"most palpable defect of the subsisting Confederation, is the total want of a to its laws. The United States, as now composed, have no powers to exact obedience, or punish disobedience to their resolutions . . . .\\", at 138 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). One of the first statutes passed by the First Congress, the Judiciary Act of 1789, divided original jurisdiction for the trial of federal crimes between the district courts and the circuit courts. The district courts were given jurisdiction over all federal crimes \\"where no other punishment than whipping, not exceeding thirty stripes, a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, is to be inflicted.\\"Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, ¬ß 9, 1 Stat. 73, 76-77. The circuit courts were given concurrent jurisdiction over these crimes, and exclusive jurisdiction over all other federal crimes.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 11, 1 Stat. 73, 78-79. The circuit courts also exercised appellate jurisdiction over the district courts, but only in civil cases.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 22, 1 Stat. 73, 84-85. In capital cases, the Act provided that \\"the trial shall be had in the county where the offence, was committed, or where that cannot be done without great inconvenience, twelve petit jurors at least shall be summoned from thence.\\"Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 29, 1 Stat. 73, 88. \\"No other procedural provisions were included, probably because the legislators were simultaneously considering amendments which would provide such security.\\", 1985, at 6. The Act of 1789 also placed the responsibility for prosecuting federal crimes in the United States Attorney for each federal judicial district. The Act provided that \\"there shall be appointed in each district\\" a \\"person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States in such district, who shall be sworn or affirmed to the faithful execution of his office, whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences, cognizable under the authority of the United States.\\"Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 35, 1 Stat. 73, 92-93. The Act authorized judges, justices, justices of the peace, and magistrates to issue arrest warrants.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 33, 1 Stat. 73, 91-92. The Act provided a right to bail in non-capital cases, and authorized bail in capital cases--by the district courts, circuit courts, and Supreme Court, or any individual judge of them--issued on an \\"exercise their discretion therein, regarding the nature and circumstances of the offence, and of the evidence, and the usages of law.\\" The 1789 act did not create federal prisons, but it did provide for the imprisonment of federal prisoners (presumably in state prisons) \\"at the expense of the United States.\\" Many of the substantive federal crimes during this period were created by two omnibus pieces of legislation: the Crimes Act of 1790 (authored and introduced by Senator and future Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth) and the Crimes Act of 1825 (authored by Justice Joseph Story and introduced by Representative Daniel Webster). Congress also passed a variety of single-subject criminal statutes, which were not centrally codified in any official publication. Between 1790 and 1797, only 143 or 147 criminal cases were brought in the circuit courts, and 56 of those cases were brought in the Pennsylvania circuit court concerning the Whiskey Rebellion.Rossman, 1990, at 560.Kurland, 1996, at 59. And, between 1790 and 1801, only 426 criminal cases were brought in all federal courts (the district courts and the circuit courts combined).Kurland, 1996, at 59 n.209. Between 1801 and 1828, a total of 2,718 criminal indictments were returned in the circuit courts: 596 resulted in guilty verdicts by juries; 479, not guilty verdicts by juries; 902, nolle prosequi; and 741, other (either no disposition recorded, abated, quashed, discharged, discontinued, or prison break)., 1985, at 46-47. Prior to Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had heard only two criminal cases --both by prerogative writ. First, in United States v. Hamilton (1795), the Court granted bail to a capital defendant charged with treason--as it was authorized to do by ¬ß 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and ¬ß 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793Judiciary Act of 1793, ¬ß 4, 1 Stat. 333, 334.--on an original writ of habeas corpus.United States v. Hamilton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 17 (1795). The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by ¬ß 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793.Judiciary Act of 1793, ¬ß 3, 1 Stat. 333, 334. Second, in United States v. Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy, as the French government argued to be required by the consular convention between the United States and France.United States v. Lawrence, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 42 (1795). Sources of jurisdiction =Writs of error= The Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized the Supreme Court to hear writs of error from the circuit courts and writs of error from the highest state courts in cases that involved the validity or construction of federal law.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß¬ß 22, 25, 1 Stat. 73, 84-87. Either a judge of the lower court or a justice of the Supreme Court would have to sign the writ of error (which was drafted and signed by counsel) before the Supreme Court could hear the case.White, 1984, at 11-12. Signing the writ of error was not a mere formality, but rather a preliminary assessment of the merits of the arguments in the writ. Circuit courts Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized writs of error from the circuit courts only in civil cases.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 22, 1 Stat. 73, 84. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801--which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtDistrict of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, ¬ß¬ß 3, 5, 2 Stat. 103, 105-06.--did not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except insofar as it required an amount in controversy.District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, ¬ß 8, 2 Stat. 103, 106. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue,United States v. Simms, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 252 (1803). See More, 7 U.S. at 172 (oral argument). in United States v. More (1805), the Court held that it had no such jurisdiction.United States v. More, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 159 (1805). More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.More, 7 U.S. at 172-73. More also rejected the argument that criminal writs of error were authorized by ¬ß 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (the \\"All Writs Act\\").More, 7 U.S. at 170 (oral argument). That section provided, in relevant part, that \\"all the before-mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to issue . . . all other writs, not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law.\\"Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 14, 1 Stat. 73, 81-82. Following More, the Court did not hear writs of error from federal criminal trials in the circuit courts for 84 years. In 1889, Congress created a right of appeal by writ of error in capital cases.Act of Feb. 6, 1889, ¬ß6, 25 Stat. 655, 656. The Judiciary Act of 1891 (the \\"Evarts Act\\") extended this right to serious crimes.Judiciary Act of 1891 (Evarts Act), ¬ß 5, 26 Stat. 826, 827. And, the Judicial Code of 1911--which abolished the circuit courts and placed original jurisdiction for the trial of all federal crime in the district courtsJudicial Code of 1911, ¬ß 24(2), 36 Stat. 1087, 1091.--granted general appellate jurisdiction.Judicial Code of 1911, ¬ß¬ß 238-240, 36 Stat. 1087, 1157. State courts Samuel Worcester Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized the Supreme Court to hear writs of error from state courts in cases > where is drawn in question the vaildity of a treaty or statute of, or at, > authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against > their validity; or where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, > or an authority exercised under any State, on the ground of their being > repugnant to the constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and > the decision is in favour of such their validity, or where is drawn in > question the construction of any clause of the constitution, or of a treaty, > or statute of, or commission held under the United States, and the decision > is against the title, right, privilege or exemption specially set up or > claimed by either party, under such clause of the said Constitution. treaty, > statute or commission . . . .Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 25, 1 Stat. 73, 85-87. Only twice did the Marshall Court hear criminal cases under ¬ß 25. In Cohens v. Virginia (1821), the Court upheld a state lottery law conviction because the federal lottery was authorized only in the District of Columbia.Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264 (1821). In Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the Court reversed Worcester's conviction for being present in Cherokee country as inconsistent with federal law.Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832). Section 25 was not a more significant source of criminal appeals in large part because--as Barron v. Baltimore (1833) held--the Bill of Rights (including its criminal procedure provisions) was viewed as inapplicable to the state governments.Akhil Reed Amar, The Future of Constitutional Criminal Procedure, 33 1123, 1124-25 (1996). This continued until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. =Original habeas= Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 provided, in relevant part, that > all the before-mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to > issue writs of . . . habeas corpus . . . . And that either of the justices > of the supreme court . . . shall have the power to grant writs of habeas > corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment.-- > Provided, That writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners > in gaol, unless where they are in custody, under or by colour of the > authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some court > of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify. The Marshall Court heard six original habeas cases of a criminal nature. All of the cases involved detention in the District of Columbia and prior proceedings in the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. Because the D.C. circuit court did not utilize the practice of riding circuit, certificates of division could not have been granted in these cases. In the first two cases, the Court held that it had jurisdiction to issue the writ in pre-conviction situations. In the next two cases, the Court held that it did not have jurisdiction to issue the writ in post-conviction cases. ;Ex parte Burford Burford concerned imprisonment of an \\"evil doer\\" in Alexandria County, D.C.. In Ex parte Burford (1806), the Court granted the writ of habeas corpus in a case of preventative detention.Ex parte Burford, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 448 (1806). Eleven justices of the peace of Alexandria County, D.C. had issued a warrant for Burford's arrest on the grounds that he was \\"not of good name and fame, nor of honest conversation, but an evil doer and disturber of the peace of the United States, so that murder, homicide, strifes, discords, and other grievances and damages, amongst the citizens of the United States, concerning their bodies and property, are likely to arise thereby.\\"Burford, 7 U.S. at 450-51. The D.C. circuit court initially granted Burford the writ of habeas corpus, but remanded him until he posted $1,000 bail.Burford, 7 U.S. at 451. The Court held that the \\"warrant of commitment was illegal, for want of stating some good cause certain, supported by oath.\\"Burford, 7 U.S. at 453. In his dissent in Bollman, Johnson indicated that he also wished to have dissented in Burford: > In the case of Burford I was one of the members who constituted the court. I > owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of > my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then > comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause > was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to > those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this > court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen > from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the > passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on > me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference > to the decision of my brethren.Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75, 131 > (1807) (Johnson, J., dissenting). ;Ex parte Bollman Ex parte Bollman granted the writ to two members of the Burr conspiracy (Aaron Burr pictured). In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court granted the writ to two members of the Burr conspiracy. Dr. Erick Bollman and Samuel Swartwout, having been apprehended in New Orleans, were transported to Charleston and then Baltimore on a navy vessel--notwithstanding the writs of habeas corpus issued by a territorial judge in New Orleans and a district judge in Charlestown.Freedman, 2000, at 559-60. The United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia issued an arrest warrant for Bollman and Swartwout (who were already in military custody), slated the case for trial in D.C., and denied the prisoners bail; Judge William Cranch (also the Supreme Court's reporter of decisions) dissented in part on the ground that there was no probable cause for the arrest warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment.United States v. Bollman, 24 F. Cas. 1189 (C.C.D.C. 1807) (No. 14,622). The Senate passed, but the House rejected, legislation that would have suspended the writ for three months and legalized Bollman and Swartwout's arrests.Freedman, 2000, at 560. Nearly every member of Congress attended the oral arguments in the Supreme Court.Freedman, 2000, at 561. Chief Justice Marshall's two opinions for the Court in Bollman addressed several issues. On February 13, Marshall held that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to issue the writ under Article Three and ¬ß 14.Bollman, 8 U.S. at 93-101. First, he held that the restrictive phrase \\"necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions\\" applied only to \\"all other writs, not specially provided for by statute,\\" not habeas corpus.Bollman, 8 U.S. at 95. Next, he held that the proviso applies both to the power of courts and individual justices to issue the writ, and that the scope of the writ was to be determined by reference to common law.Bollman, 8 U.S. at 96-100. Then, he held that original habeas was not preempted by the decision of a lower court to deny bail. Finally, he reaffirmed the holding of Burford that original habeas was a constitutional exercise of appellate jurisdiction.Bollman, 8 U.S. at 100-01. Justice Johnson dissented.Bollman, 8 U.S. at 101 (Johnson, J., dissenting). Johnson stated that his dissent was \\"supported by the opinion of one of my brethren, who is prevented by indisposition from attending.\\"Bollman, 8 U.S. at 132 (Johnson, J., dissenting). Scholars are divided on whether Johnson referred to Justice Chase or Justice Cushing.Freedman, 2000, at 563 n.92. Prof. Freedman has argued that Bollman erred in applying ¬ß 14's proviso to both courts and individual judges (as opposed to only individual judges) and thus that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did confer federal courts the power to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners.Freedman, 2000, at 575-600. The Reconstruction-era Congress granted federal courts this power in 1867.Freedman, 2000, at 539 & n.19 (citing Act of Feb. 5, 1867, 14 Stat. 385). The current version of this statute is found at 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2254. ;Ex parte Kearney In Ex parte Kearney (1822), the Court denied the writ to a prisoner who was imprisoned for criminal contempt.Ex parte Kearney, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 38 (1822). In an opinion by Justice Story, the Court's reasoning reached far further: > [T]his Court has no appellate jurisdiction confided to it in criminal cases, > by the laws of the United States. It cannot entertain a writ of error, to > revise the judgment of the Circuit Court, in any case where a party has been > convicted of a public offence. And undoubtedly the denial of this authority > proceeded upon great principles of public policy and convenience. If every > party had a right to bring before this Court every case, in which judgment > had passed against him, for a crime or misdemeanor or felony, the course of > justice might be materially delayed and obstructed, and, in some cases, > totally frustrated. If, then, this Court cannot directly revise a judgment > of the Circuit Court in a criminal case, what reason is there to suppose, > that it was intended to vest it with the authority to do it > indirectly?Kearney, 20 U.S. at 42. Story explained: > The only objection is, not that the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but > that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, then, > we are to give any relief in this case, it is by a revision of the opinion > of the Court, given in the course of a criminal trial, and thus asserting a > right to control its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect > which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a > habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the > jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this > court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or > set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.Kearney, 20 U.S. at 42-43. ;Ex parte Watkins In Ex parte Watkins (1830), the Court held that the writ did not lie after a federal criminal conviction even if the indictment failed to state an offense.Ex parte Watkins, 28 U.S. (3 Pet.) 193 (1830). Three years later, with the same petitioner, in Ex parte Watkins (1833), the Court did issue the writ because the petitioner was detained beyond his authorized sentence for non-payment of a fine; although the Court held that such detention would be permissible under the writ of capias pro fine (generally, a writ ordering the imprisonment of a defendant until a criminal fine is paid), it held that it was not under the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum (a civil law analog).Ex parte Watkins, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 568 (1833). After further proceedings in the D.C. circuit court, Tobias Watkins was discharged.United States v. Watkins, 28 F. Cas. 490 (C.C.D.C. 1833) (No. 16,650). ;Ex parte Milburn In Ex parte Milburn (1835), the Court denied an original habeas petition concerning pretrial detention holding that the forfeiture of bail for failure to appear did not satisfy a criminal indictment and that a prior granting of the writ of habeas corpus was no bar to a subsequent arrest warrant.Ex parte Milburn, 34 U.S. (9 Pet.) 704 (1835). =Certificates of division= Justice Joseph Story wrote than an appeal in criminal cases would result in \\"manifest obstruction of public justice.\\" Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the United States circuit courts were composed of a stationary United States district court judge and any two Supreme Court justices riding circuit.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 4 ,1 Stat. 73, 74-75. If one judge or justice disagreed with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend (as was authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1793Judiciary Act of 1793, ¬ß 1, 1 Stat. 333, 333-34.), and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practice was to hold the case over until the next term.United States v. Daniel, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 542, 547 (1821). If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, the opinion of the previous circuit rider broke the tie.Judiciary Act of 1793, ¬ß 2, 1 Stat. 333, 334. See Daniel, 19 U.S. at 547. Following a brief intermezzo with the soon-repealed Midnight Judges Act of 1801 (which briefly abolished circuit riding), under the Judiciary Act of 1802, the circuit courts were composed of a stationary district judge and one Supreme Court justice assigned to the circuit.Judiciary Act of 1802, ¬ß 4, 2 Stat. 156, 157-58. But, a single judge (either the district judge or the circuit rider) could preside alone.Judiciary Act of 1802, ¬ß 4 proviso, 2 Stat. 156, 158. In cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions were less likely to be resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).Daniel, 19 U.S. at 548. Accordingly, ¬ß 6 of the Judiciary Act of 1802 provided that the circuit courts could certify questions of law to the Supreme Court if the judges were divided on that question.Judiciary Act of 1802, ¬ß 6, 2 Stat. 156, 159-61\\\\. See generally White, 1984, at 1, 10-11, 20-30. Several scholars have argued that certificates of division were pro forma, and that the judge and justice would merely agree to disagree, often without writing opposing opinions., 1988, at 164-80; Alison L. LaCroix, Federalists, Federalism, and Federal Jurisdiction, 30 205, 238 n.113 (2012); White, 1989, at 730 n.14; White, 2009, at 321 n.4, 325 n.17. For example, with the circuit court decision leading up to United States v. Marchant (1827), the reporter records that \\"[t]he district judge concurred in this opinion; but as it was a matter of not infrequent occurrence, and important to the practice of the court, the judges afterwards divided in opinion for the purpose of obtaining a solemn decision of the superior court.\\"United States v. White, 28 F. Cas. 580, 584 (C.C.D. Mass. 1826) (No. 16,682). Similarly, the United States v. Ortega (1826) circuit court opinion notes that the \\"point was taken to the supreme court upon a proforma certificate of a division of opinion in this court.\\"United States v. Ortega, 27 F. Cas. 359, 362 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1825) (No. 15,971). Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story in particular were known for making use of certificates of division while riding circuit. For example, Justice Marshall was one of the divided judges in United States v. Klintock (1820), United States v. Smith (1820), United States v. Amedy (1826), United States v. Turner (1833), and United States v. Mills (1833); and Justice Story played the role in United States v. Coolidge (1816),Rowe, 1992, at 931-34. United States v. Bevans (1818), United States v. Palmer (1818),John H. Knox, A Presumption Against Extrajurisdictionality, 104 351, 362 n.64 (2010); White, 1989, at 730-31. United States v. Holmes (1820), and Marchant. But, Justice Story--in his opinions for the Court--cautioned against the too frequent use of certificates of division in criminal cases. In United States v. Gooding (1827), for the Court, Justice Story wrote: > We take this opportunity of expressing our anxiety, least, by too great > indulgence to the wishes of counsel, questions of this sort should be > frequently brought before this Court, and thus, in effect, an appeal in > criminal cases become an ordinary proceeding to the manifest obstruction of > public justice, and against the plain intendment of the acts of > Congress.United States v. Gooding, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 460, 467-68 (1827). The Judiciary Act of 1802 plainly did contemplate that certificates of division would issue in criminal cases. Section 6 provided that \\"imprisonment shall not be allowed, nor punishment in any case be inflicted, where judges of the said court are divided in opinion upon the question touching the said imprisonment or punishment.\\" And, while the statute provided only for the certification of \\"the point upon which the disagreement shall happen,\\" the justices sometimes took the liberty of enlarging the question. For example, in United States v. Hudson (1812), the question certified was \\"whether the Circuit Court of the United States had a common law jurisdiction in cases of libel?\\" but the question answered was \\"whether the Circuit Courts of the United States can exercise a common law jurisdiction in criminal cases?\\"Rowe, 1992, at 930. And, in United States v. Bevans (1818), the Court noted that \\"[i]t may be deemed within the scope of the question certified to this court\\" to inquire whether the murder was cognizable under ¬ß 3 of the Crimes Act of 1790, even though the defendant had only been indicted under ¬ß 8.United States v. Bevans, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 336, 389 (1818). But not every question or every case was eligible for a certificate of division. In United States v. Daniel (1821), the Court held that a motion for a new trial--as authorized by the ¬ß 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 17, 1 Stat. 73, 83.-- could not be the subject of a certificate of division; rather, the division would operate a rejection of the motion.United States v. Daniel, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 542 (1821). Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), the Court held that the question of whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified.United States v. Bailey, 34 U.S. (9 Pet.) 267 (1835). And, certificates of division began to fall into disuse as it became increasingly common for the circuit courts to sit with a single judge. 31-32, 79-80 (1928); Anthony G. Amsterdam, Search, Seizure, and Section 2255; A Comment, 112 378, 383 n.24 (1964); Peter D. Marshall, A Comparative Analysis of the Right to Appeal, 22 1, 7 n.41 (2011). As Chief Justice Marshall wrote, he did not have \\"the privilege of dividing the court when alone.\\"Letter from John Marshall to Joseph Story (July 13, 1819), in 8 The Papers of John Marshall 352, 352 (Charles F. Hobson ed., 1995). Defining federal crimes West Point (depicted circa 1828). =Assimilative crimes= Section 3 of the Crimes Act of 1825 enacted the first federal assimilative crimes statute, criminalizing conduct in violation of state law within areas under federal jurisdiction. Section 3 provided that: > [I]f any offence shall be committed in any [fort, dock-yard, navy-yard, > arsenal, armory, magazine, lighthouse, or other needful building under the > jurisdiction of the United States], the punishment of which offence is not > specifically provided for by any law of the United States, such offense > shall, upon conviction in any court of the United States having cognisance > thereof, be liable to, and receive the same punishment as the laws of the > state in which such [place aforesaid], is situated, provide for the like > offence when committed within the body of any county of such state.Crimes > Act of 1825, ¬ß 3, 4 Stat. 115, 115. In United States v. Paul (1832)--involving a criminal burglary at West Point, prosecuted via an 1829 New York statute defining burglary in the third degree --the Court held that the assimilative crimes provision was limited to state crimes in force at the time of the federal statute's enactment.United States v. Paul, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 141 (1832). The 1866, 1874, 1898, 1909, 1933, 1935, and 1940 re-enactments of the assimilative crimes offense explicitly incorporated this interpretation of Paul.In chronological order, 14 Stat. 13 (1866); Rev. Stat. ¬ß 5391 (1874); 30 Stat. 717 (1898); 35 Stat. 1145 (1909) (codified at ¬ß 289 of the Criminal Code); 48 Stat. 152 (1933); 49 Stat. 394 (1935); 54 Stat. 234 (1940). But, in 1948, Congress amended the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 13, to incorporate changes in state criminal law, as they occur, up until the commission of the charged conduct.Act of June 25, 1948, ¬ß 1, 62 Stat. 686, 686. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the revision in United States v. Sharpnack (1958).United States v. Sharpnack, 355 U.S. 286 (1958). Sharpnack held that: \\"There is nothing in [Paul] to show that the issue was decided as anything more than one of statutory construction falling within the doctrine calling for the narrow construction of a penal statute. So interpreted, the decision did not reach the issue that is before us.\\"Sharpnack, 355 U.S. at 291. =Common law crimes= Barzillai Hudson and George Goodwin were indicted for common law libel after their newspaper accused Congress, at President Jefferson's request, of appropriating $2M to bribe Napoleon. In United States v. Hudson (1812), without oral argument from either the defendants or Attorney General William Pinkney, the Court held that an indictment for a common law crime must be dismissed because all federal crimes (with the exception of contempt of court) must be established by statute.United States v. Hudson, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 (1812). Justice Johnson, for the Court, wrote: > Although this question is brought up now for the first time to be decided by > this Court, we consider it as having been long since settled in public > opinion. In no other case for many years has this jurisdiction been > asserted, and the general acquiescence of legal men shows the prevalence of > opinion in favor of the negative of the proposition.Hudson, 11 U.S. at 32. While riding circuit in Massachusetts, Justice Story--in addition to distinguishing Hudson under admiralty jurisdiction--argued for the overruling of Hudson: > [Hudson] having been made without argument, and by a majority only of the > court, I hope that it is not an improper course to bring the subject again > in review for a more solemn decision, as it is not a question of mere > ordinary import, but vitally affects the jurisdiction of the courts of the > United States; a jurisdiction which they cannot lawfully enlarge or > diminish. I shall submit, with the utmost cheerfulness, to the judgment of > my brethren, and if I have hazarded a rash opinion, I have the consolation > to know, that their superior learning and ability will save the public from > an injury by my error.United States v. Coolidge, 25 F. Cas. 619, 621 (C.C.D. > Mass. 1813) (No. 14,857) (opinion of Story, J.). On the certificate of division, in United States v. Coolidge (1816), three justices--Washington and Livingston in addition to Story--indicated their willingness to depart from Hudson, but since no counsel appeared for Coolidge, and since Attorney General Richard Rush refused to argue the point, Hudson was reaffirmed.United States v. Coolidge, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 415 (1816). According to Prof. Rowe, \\"[f]ew major controversies have ended with as slight a whimper as the battle over federal common law crimes that raged in the first two decades of the American republic.\\"Rowe, 1992, at 919. Rowe argues that \\"without acknowledging it, the Hudson Court disapproved at least eight circuit court cases, brushed off the views of all but one Justice who sat on the Court prior to 1804, and departed from what was arguably the original understanding of those who framed the Constitution and penned the Judiciary Act of 1789.\\"Rowe, 1992, at 920-21. Rowe views Hudson as a codification of an issue decided by public opinion, including during the 1800 presidential election: \\"Hudson set onto tablets the principles that guided the Jeffersonians during their wanderings in the desert.\\"Rowe, 1992, at 948. =Counterfeiting= The Court held that it was not a crime to counterfeit promissory notes (pictured)--as distinguished from bills--issued by the Second Bank of the United States. ;First Bank When it created the First Bank of the United States, Congress criminalized counterfeiting the bills of the bank.Act of June 27, 1798, 1 Stat. 573. \\"Read literally,\\" the statute required both that the bill be counterfeit and that the bill be signed by the President of the Bank of the United States.Whittington, 2009, at 1290. In United States v. Cantril (1807), without oral argument, the Court arrested a judgment of conviction under the counterfeiting statute, finding the statute invalid \\"for the reasons assigned in the record\\" (without further elaboration).United States v. Cantril, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 167 (1807). By the time Cantril was decided, Congress had already passed a new statute to correct the apparent drafting error.Act of Feb. 24, 1807, 2 Stat. 423. See also Whittington, 2009, at 1291. According to Prof. Whittington, Cantril was the first challenge to a federal statute under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to be considered by the Court.Whittington, 2009, at 1289. In later cases, the Court has noted the several possible holdings that could have been intended in Cantril.United States v. Howell, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 432, 437-38 (1870). ;Second Bank Congress passed a new counterfeiting statute in 1816 when it created the Second Bank of the United States.Act of Apr. 10, 1816, ¬ß 18, 3 Stat. 266, 275. In United States v. Turner (1833), interpreting the new act, the Court held that the offense of counterfeiting was committed even if the signatures forged were those of the wrong bank officers.United States v. Turner, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 132 (1833). But, in United States v. Brewster (1833), the Court held that the crime applied only to counterfeit bills, not counterfeit notes.United States v. Brewster, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 164 (1833) (per curiam). =Embargos= ;War of 1812 The Court held that cattle were a provision or munition of war. In June 1812, during the War of 1812, Congress passed a statute prohibiting the transportation \\"over land or otherwise, in any wagon, cart, sleigh, boat, or otherwise, naval or military stores, arms or the munitions of war, or any article of provision, from any place of the United States, to\\" Canada.Act of July 6, 1812, ¬ß 2, 2 Stat. 778, 779-80. In United States v. Barber (1815), the Court held \\"fat cattle\\" to be \\"provisions, or munitions of war, within the true intent and meaning of the act.\\"United States v. Barber, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 243, 244 (1815) (per curiam). In United States v. Sheldon (1817), decided after the war had ended, Barber was distinguished on the grounds that driving cattle on foot was not \\"transportation\\" within the meaning of the act.United States v. Sheldon, 15 U.S. (2 Wheat.) 119 (1817). ;Neutrality Act of 1818 The Neutrality Act of 1818 provided the arming of a vessel with the intention that it be employed against a people at peace with the United States.Neutrality Act of 1818, ¬ß 3, 3 Stat. 447, 448. In United States v. Quincy (1832), the Court decided several questions concerning the interpretation of the Neutrality Act.United States v. Quincy, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 445 (1832). First, the Court held that the elements of the offense did not require that the vessel be fitted out within the United States, but rather than an intention to fit the vessel out in an intermediary port was sufficient.Quincy, 31 U.S. at 463-65. Second, the Court held that a conditional intention (for example, an intention to so arm the vessel only if sufficient funds could be obtained) was insufficient to satisfy the elements of the offense.Quincy, 31 U.S. at 465-66. Third, the Court held that, if the defendant had a fixed intention to so arm the vessel upon leaving the United States, the frustration of that intention at the intermediate port was irrelevant.Quincy, 31 U.S. at 466-67. Fourth, the Court refused to distinguish between the statutory term of \\"people\\" and the concept of a \\"state.\\"Quincy, 31 U.S. at 467-68. =False statements= United States v. Bailey (1835) upheld an indictment for false swearing relating to a claim against the United States (as provided for by an 1823 statute) even though the officer administering the oath had been a state justice of the peace.United States v. Bailey, 34 U.S. (9 Pet.) 238 (1835). Justice McLean dissented.Bailey, 34 U.S. at 257 (McLean, J., dissenting). =Maritime insurance fraud= An 1804 criminal insurance fraud statute provided: > [I]f any person shall, on the high seas, wilfully and corruptly cast away, > burn, or otherwise destroy, any ship or vessel of which he is owner in part > or in whole, or in anywise direct or procure the same to be done, with > intent or design to prejudice any person or persons that hath underwritten, > or shall underwrite, any policy or policies of insurance thereon or of any > merchant or merchants that shall load goods thereon, or of any other owner > or owners of such ship or vessel, the person or persons offending therein, > being thereof lawfully convicted, shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of > felony, and shall suffer death.Act of Mar. 26, 1804, ¬ß 2, 2 Stat. 290, 290. In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court held that the federal criminal insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims.United States v. Amedy, 24 U.S. (11 Wheat.) 392 (1826). First, the Court held that the state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required no more than the state's seal to be authenticated.Amedy, 24 U.S. at 406-08. Second, there was no need to prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party.Amedy, 24 U.S. at 408-10. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company.Amedy, 24 U.S. at 410. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud.Amedy, 24 U.S. at 410-11. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.Amedy, 24 U.S. at 412. =Piracy and the high seas= The Marshall Court decided many controversial piracy cases (the capture of Blackbeard depicted). The piracy cases considered by the Marshall Court arose under two Congressional statutes: the Crimes Act of 1790 and the Act of March 3, 1819. Article One provides that Congress shall have the power \\"[t]o define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas.\\" art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 10. Five sections in the Crimes Act \\"were devoted to the subject,\\" but \\"[t]he principal provisions with respect to piracy were incorporated in section 8.\\"Dickinson, 1924, at 343. According to Prof. White, \\"from 1815 to 1823, piracy cases were among the most numerous and controversial of those decided by the Court.\\"White, 1989, at 727. ;Crimes Act of 1790, ¬ß 8 Section 8 of the Crimes Act of 1790 provided: > [I]f any person or persons shall commit upon the high seas, or in any river, > haven, basin or bay, out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, murder > or robbery, or any other offence which if committed within the body of a > county, would by thelaws of the United States be punishable with death; or > if any captain or mariner of any ship or other vessel, shall piratically and > feloniously run away with such ship or vessel, or any goods or merchandise > to the value of fifty dollars, or yield up such ship or vessel voluntarily > to any pirate; or if any seaman shall lay violent hands upon his commander, > thereby to hinder and prevent his fighting in defence of his ship or goods > committed to his trust, or shall make a revolt in the ship; every such > offender shall be deemed, taken and adjudged to be a pirate and felon, and > being thereof convicted, shall suffer death; and the trial of crimes > committed on the high seas, or in any place out of the jurisdiction of any > particular state, shall be in the district where the offender is > apprehended, or into which he may first be brought.Crimes Act of 1790, ¬ß 8, > 1 Stat. 112, 113-14. President John Quincy Adams called United States v. Palmer \\"a sample of judicial logic‚Äîdisingenuous, false, and hollow.\\" The first two decisions to interpret ¬ß 8 construed it not to apply to the crimes charged. In United States v. Bevans (1818), the Court held that the ¬ß 8 of the Act did not extend to a murder committed on a navy vessel within state waters.United States v. Bevans, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 336 (1818). In United States v. Palmer (1818), the Court held that the ¬ß 8 of the Act did not extend to piracy by U.S. citizen defendants, in the employ of a South American government at war with Spain, committed against Spanish ships and citizens.United States v. Palmer, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 610 (1818). See also Dickinson, 1924, at 344-45; Lenoir, 1934, at 547-48; White, 1989, at 730-33. President John Quincy Adams was a harsh critic of the decision in Palmer. He wrote in his diary that the Court had \\"cast away the jurisdiction which a law of congress had given, that its \\"reasoning [was] a sample of judicial logic‚Äîdisingenuous, false, and hollow,\\" and that it gave him \\"an early disgust for the practice of law, and led me to the unalterable determination never to accept judicial office.\\"John Quincy Adams, diary entry for May 11, 1819, in 4 (C. Adams ed., 1874-77). Following the Act of 1819, in 1820 the Court began to distinguish Palmer. In United States v. Klintock (1820), the Court distinguished Palmer--in a case involving piracy by a U.S. citizen, claiming to act under the authority of the Mexican Republic, committed against a Danish ship and citizens, under the fraudulent claim that the Danes were Spanish (Spain being at war with the Mexican Republic)--on the grounds that the victims in Palmer were not subjects of a nation recognized by the United States.United States v. Klintock, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 144 (1820). See also Dickinson, 1924, at 346-47; Lenoir, 1934, 543-44; White, 1989, at 732-33. In United States v. Furlong (1820), sometimes referred to as United States v. Pirates, authored by Justice Johnson (a dissenter in Palmer), the Court distinguished Palmer again, primarily on the ground that the pirate vessel had no nationality (it was an American ship prior to being hijacked).United States v. Furlong (Pirates), 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 184 (1820). See also Dickinson, 1924, at 347-48; Lenoir, 1934, at 546-47. United States v. Holmes (1820) distinguished Palmer on the same ground, further holding that the burden was on the defendant to prove that his vessel flew a lawful flag.United States v. Holmes, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 412 (1820). See Lenoir, 1934, at 545. ;Crimes Act of 1790, ¬ß 12 Section 12 of the Act provided: > [I]f any seaman or other person shall commit manslaughter upon the high > seas, or confederate, or attempt or endeavour to corrupt any commander, > master, officer or mariner, to yield up or to run away with any ship or > vessel, or with any goods, wares, or merchandise, or to turn pirate, or to > go over to or confederate with pirates, or in any wise trade with any pirate > knowing him to be such, or shall furnish such pirate with any ammunition, > stores or provisions of any kind, or shall fit out any vessel knowingly and > with a design to trade with or suppJy or correspond with any pirate or > robber upon the seas; or if any person or persons shall any ways consult, > combine, confederate or correspond with any pirate or robber on the seas, > knowing him to be guilty of any such piracy or robbery; or if any seaman > shall confine the master of any ship or other vessel, or endeavour to make a > revolt in such ship . . . such person or persons so offending, and being > thereof convicted, shall be imprisoned not exceeding three years, and fined > not exceeding one thousand dollars.Crimes Act of 1790, ¬ß 12, 1 Stat. 112, > 115. In United States v. Wiltberger (1820), the Court held that ¬ß 12 of the Act did not extend to a manslaughter committed \\"in a river such as the river Tigris\\" because such was not on the \\"high seas.\\"United States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 105 (1820). (Justice Washington had delivered an unrelated jury charge below.United States v. Wiltberger, 28 F. Cas. 727 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1819) (No. 16,738).) In United States v. Kelly (1826), the Court interpreted the phrase \\"endeavour to make a revolt\\" to refer to \\"the endeavour of the crew of a vessel, or any one or more of them, to overthrow the legitimate authority of her commander, with intent to remove him from his command, or against his will to take possession of the vessel by assuming the government and navigation of her, or by transferring their obedience from the lawful commander to some other person.\\"United States v. Kelly, 24 U.S. (11 Wheat.) 417, 418-19 (1826). Justice Washington, the author of the opinion of the Court, had written a slightly longer opinion below.United States v. Kelly, 26 F. Cas. 700 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1825) (No. 15,516). ;Act of March 3, 1819, ¬ß 5 In 1819, Congress enacted a new anti-piracy statute: Act to Protect the Commerce of the United States and Punish the Crime of Piracy. Section 5 of that Act provided: > [I]f any person or persons whatsoever, shall, on the high seas, commit the > crime of piracy, as defined by the law of nations, and such offender or > offenders shall afterwards be brought into, or found in, the United States, > every such offender or offenders shall, upon conviction thereof, before the > Circuit Court of the United States for the District into which he or they > may be brought, or in which he or they shall be found, be punished with > death.Act of Mar. 3, 1819, ¬ß5, 3 Stat. 510, 513-14. In United States v. Smith (1820), in an opinion by Justice Story, the Court upheld a conviction under the 1819 statute, holding that Congress could leave the definition of piracy to the law of nations.United States v. Smith, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 153 (1820). See also Dickinson, 1924, at 346; Lenoir, 1934, at 539-43; White, 1989, at 732-34. After reviewing the history of foreign (primarily English) law, Justice Story declared: \\"We have, therefore, no hesitation in declaring, that piracy, by the law of nations, is robbery upon the sea, and that it is sufficiently and constitutionally defined by the fifth section of the act of 1819.\\"Smith, 18 U.S. at 162. In a rare dissent, Justice Livingston argued that Article One, Section Eight, Clause Ten obliged Congress to define piracy with more specificity.Smith, 18 U.S. at 164 (Livington, J., dissenting). The facts in Smith were almost identical to those which Palmer had held could not be reached under the Crimes Act of 1790:Dickinson, 1924, at 345-46. a U.S. citizen pirate, commissioned by a government in Buenos Aires, had led a mutiny, seized a new ship, and then robbed a Spanish ship. Section 5 of the 1819 act was set to sunset at the end of the next session of Congress.Act of Mar. 3, 1819, ¬ß 6, 3 Stat. 510, 514. See Dickinson, 1924, at 348. Before that time, Congress made the provision permanent in an 1820 omnibus piracy bill that also defined additional offenses.Act of May 15, 1820, ¬ß 3, 3 Stat. 600. See Dickinson, 1924, at 348. Section 8 of the Crimes Act of 1790, ¬ß 5 of the 1819 act, and ¬ß 3 of the 1820 act were all separately codified in the Revised Statutes in 1874.Dickinson, 1924, at 349. Section 8 of the Crimes Act of 1790 was repealed by the Criminal Code of 1909.Dickinson, 1924, at 349-50. =Slave trading= A diagram of a slave ship used in the Atlantic slave trade The Slave Trade Act of 1818 prohibited the importation of slaves into the United States. The \\"fitting out\\" offense provided that: > [N]o citizen or citizens of the United States, or any other person or > persons, shall, after the passing of this act, as aforesaid, for himself, > themselves, or any other person or persons whatsoever, either as master, > factor, or owner, build, fit, equip, load, or otherwise prepare, any ship or > vessel, in any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States, > nor cause any such ship or vessel to sail from any port or place whatscever, > within the jurisdiction of the same, for the purpose of procuring any negro, > mulatto, or person of colour, from any foreign kingdom, place, or country, > to be transported to any port or place whatsoever, to be held, sold, or > otherwise disposed of, as slaves, or to be held to service or labour; and if > any ship or vessel shall be so built, fitted out, equipped, laden, or > otherwise prepared, for the purpose aforesaid, every such ship or vessel, > her tackle, apparel, furniture, and lading, shall be forfeited, one moiety > to the use of the United Slates, and the other to the use of the person, or > persons who shall sue for said forfeiture, and prosecute the same to effect; > and such ship or vessel shall be liable to be seized, prosecuted, and > condemned, in any court of the United States having competent > jurisdiction.Slave Trade Act of 1818, ¬ß 2, 3 Stat. 450, 451. and that: > [E]very person or persons so building, fitting out, equipping, loading, or > otherwise preparing, or sending away, or causing any of the acts aforesaid > to be done, with intent to employ such ship or vessel in such trade or > business, after the passing of this act, contrary to the true intent and > meaning thereof or who shall, in any wise, be aiding or abetting therein, > shall, severally, on conviction thereof, by due course of law, forfeit and > pay a sum not exceeding five thousand dollars, nor less than one thousand > dollars, one moiety to the use of the United States, and the other to the > use of the person or persons who shall sue for such forfeiture and prosecute > the same to effect, and shall moreover be imprisoned for a term not > exceeding seven years, nor less than three years.Slave Trade Act of 1818, ¬ß > 3, 3 Stat. 450, 451. In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court construed the elements of the fitting out offense.United States v. Gooding, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 460 (1827). First, the Court held that the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out.Gooding, 25 U.S. at 471-72. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose.Gooding, 25 U.S. at 472-73. Third, the Court held that--since slave trading was a misdemeanor--there was no distinction between principal and accessory.Gooding, 25 U.S. at 475-76. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States.Gooding, 25 U.S. at 476-78. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).Gooding, 25 U.S. at 478. =Treason= Article Three, Section Three, Clause One of the Constitution provides that: > Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against > them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No > Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two > Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. art. III, ¬ß > 3, cl. 1. Section 1 of the Crimes Act of 1790 provided that > if any person or persons, owing allegiance to the United States of America, > shall levy war against them, or shall adhere to their enemies, giving them > aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, and shall be thereof > convicted, on confession in open court, or on the testimony of two witnesses > to the same overt act of treason whereof he or they shall stand indicted, > such person or persons shall be adjudged guilty of treason against the > United States, and shall suffer death.Crimes Act of 1790, ¬ß 1, 1 Stat. 112, > 112. In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court held that conspiracy to wage war on the United States was not treason.Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75, 125-28 (1807). Further, Bollman held that the evidence against both Bollman and Swartwout was insufficient to justify pre-trial detention.Bollman, 8 U.S. at 128-35. Criminal procedure =Constitutional issues= ;Venue Bollman held that the venue provision of the Crimes Act of 1790 for crimes committed in \\"any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state\\" did not apply to crimes committed in the Territory of Orleans. While Ex parte Bollman (1807) is more famous for its holding that the Burr conspirators had not committed treason, the Court could not have ordered the release of the prisoners without also addressing the Neutrality Act of 1794, under which the conspirators were also charged.Bollman, 8 U.S. at 135-36. With regard to these charges, the Court conceded, \\"those who admit the affidavit of General Wilkinson cannot doubt.\\"Bollman, 8 U.S. at 135. But, Bollman held that venue for the Neutrality Act charges was improper in the District of Columbia.Bollman, 8 U.S. at 135-37. First, the Court rejected locus delicti venue (without reaching the question of whether such could exist outside of a U.S. state). \\"[T]hat no part of this crime was committed in the district of Columbia is apparent. It is therefore the unanimous opinion of the court that they cannot be tried in this district.\\" Second, the Court rejected statutory venue under section 8 the Crimes Act of 1790 (as permitted by Article Three for crimes not committed within a state). The Court held that the Territory of Orleans was not a place that triggered the alternative venue provisions of the Crimes Act. The Court held that the statutory term \\"any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state\\" applied only to \\"any river, haven, bason or bay, not within the jurisdiction of any particular state,\\" and only in \\"those cases there is no court which has particular cognizance of the crime.\\"Bollman, 8 U.S. at 136. ;Double jeopardy In three opinions, the Marshall Court considered questions of double jeopardy, without ever clearly referring to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. First, in United States v. Perez (1824), the Court held that there was no bar to a second prosecution after a mistrial was declared for \\"manifest necessity.\\"United States v. Perez, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824). For the trial transcript, see (New York: J.W. Bell ed., 1823). (Justice Story authored the opinion of the Court, espousing the position taken by Justice Thompson below.United States v. Perez, 27 F. Cas. 504 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1823) (No. 16,033).) Next, in United States v. Wilson (1833), the Court held that the protection of prior jeopardy extended to lesser included offenses; \\"[a]fter the judgment [of conviction], no subsequent prosecution could be maintained for the same offence, nor for any part of it.\\"United States v. Wilson, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 150, 159-60 (1833). But, Wilson held that, in order to receive the protection of a pardon, a defendant must accept the pardon and affirmatively plead its existence in court.Wilson, 32 U.S. at 160-63. And, finally, in United States v. Randenbush (1834)--where the defendant had first been acquitted of counterfeiting one note, and then convicted of counterfeiting a different note (which had been introduced as evidence at the first trial)--the Court held that double jeopardy did not run from the use of the same evidence for \\"entirely a distinct offence.\\"United States v. Randenbush, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 288, 290 (1834). ;Original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court In United States v. Ortega (1826), the Court held that it was not unconstitutional to vest original jurisdiction for the criminal trial of assaults on ambassadors in the circuit courts.United States v. Ortega, 24 U.S. (11 Wheat.) 467 (1826). The Court did not reach the question of whether the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court could be made concurrent with a lower court, instead holding that the criminal trial of an assault on an ambassador was not a \\"Case[] affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls\\" within the meaning of Article Three. Justice Washington, the author of the Court's opinion, had also delivered the jury charge below.United States v. Ortega, 27 F. Cas. 359 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1825) (No. 15,971). Two Supreme Court justices had previously disagreed on this question while riding circuit. In United States v. Ravara (C.C.D. Pa. 1793), an indictment for sending anonymous and threatening letters to a foreign minister with a view to extort money, Justice James Wilson argued that the circuit court could be given concurrent jurisdiction; Justice James Iredell argued that it could not; Judge Richard Peters, of the District of Pennsylvania, sided with Wilson, and the case continued.United States v. Ravara, 27 F. Cas. 713 (C.C.D. Pa. 1793). =Evidence= ;Burden of proof In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court held that the government must bear the burden of proof in criminal cases \\"unless a different provision is made by some statute.\\"United States v. Gooding, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 460, 471 (1827). ;Hearsay Also in Gooding, the Court approved of a hearsay exception for the statement of an agent of the defendant, holding that the doctrine should be the same in civil and criminal cases.Gooding, 25 U.S. at 468-70. ;Best evidence In United States v. Reyburn (1832), the Court again held that civil rules of evidence should be applied in criminal cases, recognizing an exception to the best evidence rule where \\"non production of the written instrument is satisfactorily accounted for.\\"United States v. Reyburn, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 352, 365 (1832). =Other= ;Facts found by a jury In United States v. Tyler (1812), without oral argument, the Court held that an error in a verdict sheet--referring to the goods in violation of the embargo as \\"pot-ashes\\" rather than \\"pearl-ashes\\"--was harmless because the jury need not find the value to be forfeited.United States v. Tyler, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 285 (1812). ;Sufficiency of an indictment In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court held that, in general, it is sufficient for a criminal indictment to merely repeat the text of the statute.United States v. Gooding, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 460, 473-75 (1827). Further, the Court held that--\\"under circumstances of an extraordinary nature,\\" \\"on very urgent occasions\\"--a challenge to the sufficiency of an indictment could be made post-conviction.Gooding, 25 U.S. at 478-79. In United States v. Mills (1833), the Court again embraced the general rule that a sufficient indictment need only follow the terms of the statute.United States v. Mills, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 138 (1833). ;Separate trials of co-defendants In United States v. Marchant (1827), the Court held that--even though a trial court has the discretion to sever the trials of co-defendants--a defendant has no right to insist upon being tried alone.United States v. Marchant, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 480 (1827). The Court recounted the history of criminal severance in English law, and concluded that the practice merely arose to prevent co-defendants from each using their peremptory challenges to deplete the venire such that too few jurors remained for trial. Justice Story was the author of the opinion of the Court, as well as a substantially similar opinion in the Massachusetts circuit court below.United States v. White, 28 F. Cas. 580 (C.C. Mass. 1826) (No. 16,682). ;Nol pros In United States v. Phillips (1832), the Court dismissed a criminal action, on the motion of the Attorney General, pursuant to the district prosecutor's filing of a nolle prosequi motion (a motion by the prosecutor to dismiss the case) in the trial court, even though the nolle prosequi motion was filed after the writ of error issued from the Supreme Court.United States v. Phillips, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 776 (1832) (per curiam). Phillips has been cited as an early example of judicial recognition of the norm of prosecutorial enforcement discretionSaikrishna Prakash, The Chief Prosecutor, 73 521, 532 (2005). and as an example of mootness (although the Phillips Court did not use that term).Constitutional Law: Application of Immunity Statute to Related Testimony Compelled During Pendency of Appeal, 66 178, 182 n.26 (1966). The underlying case had involved the prosecution of Zalegman Phillips, a prominent Philadelphia attorney, for interfering with diplomatic immunity, as protected by the Crimes Act of 1790,Crimes Act of 1790, ¬ß 26, 1 Stat. 112, 118. by filing a lawsuit against a former diplomat.Privileges of Foreign Agents, , May 18, 1830, reprinted in, , May 29, 1830. The question certified was whether the provision extended to former diplomats. Footnotes Notes References *Edwin D. Dickinson, Is the Crime of Piracy Obsolete?, 38 334 (1924). *Eric M.

More, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 159 (1805), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear appeals from criminal cases in the circuit courts by writs of error. Relying on the Exceptions Clause, More held that Congress's enumerated grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power to eliminate all other forms of appellate jurisdiction. The second of forty-one criminal cases heard by the Marshall Court, More ensured that the Court's criminal jurisprudence would be limited to writs of error from the state (and later, territorial) courts, original habeas petitions and writs of error from habeas petitions in the circuit courts, and certificates of division and mandamus from the circuit courts. Congress did not grant the Court jurisdiction to hear writs of error from the circuit courts in criminal cases until 1889, for capital crimes, and 1891, for other \\"infamous\\" crimes. The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished the circuit courts, transferred the trial of crimes to the district courts, and extended the Court's appellate jurisdiction to all crimes.Brent D. Stratton, Criminal Law: The Attenuation Exception to the Exclusionary Rule: A Study in Attenuated Principle and Dissipated Logic, 75 139, 139 n.1 (1984). But, these statutory grants were construed not to permit writs of error filed by the prosecution, as in More.Rossman, 1990, at 524 n.19 (citing United States v. Sanges, 144 U.S. 310 (1892)). More arose from the same Federalist/Jeffersonian political dispute over the judiciary that gave rise to Marbury v. Madison (1803) and Stuart v. Laird (1803). Benjamin More, a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia, argued that the repeal of statutory provisions authorizing compensation for his office violated the salary-protection guarantees for federal judges in Article Three of the United States Constitution. Below, a divided panel of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia had sided with More, interpreted the repeal act prospectively, and sustained his demurrer to the criminal indictment for the common law crime of exacting illegal fees under color of office. Background =United States presidential election, 1800= After inauguration, President Thomas Jefferson removed almost half all federal appointed officials. The Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party comprised the First Party System in the United States. Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist John Adams in the 1800 presidential election. Jefferson's party also took control of Congress in the House and Senate elections. After the elections, the lame duck Federalist administration passed the Judiciary Act of 1801 (the \\"Midnight Judges Act\\"), creating 16 new circuit judgeships to preside in the circuit courts (as opposed to the district judges and the Supreme Court justices riding circuit).Murrin, Johnson, McPherson, et al Murrin, Johnson, McPherson, et al Along with the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 (the \\"Organic Act\\"), the statutes created many judicial vacancies, and Adams filled nearly all of these judgeships on his last day in office. Marshall, in his dual role as Adams' Secretary of State, failed to deliver some of these commissions before leaving office. =Companion cases= Immediately after his inauguration, Jefferson instructed his Secretary of State, James Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions., 1985, at 19. Further, an act of March 8, 1802 abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts., 1985, at 19, 22. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madison-- concerning a confirmed D.C. justice of the peace who had not received his commission--as a test case for the constitutionality of the repeal. The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before the repeal would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system., 1985, at 20. More broadly, Jefferson removed 146 of 316 (46%) incumbent, second-level, appointed federal officials, including 13 U.S. Attorneys and 18 U.S. Marshals., 1985, at 22. Jefferson also displaced two district judges--Ray Greene and Jacob Read--citing technical flaws in their appointments. Further, District Judge John Pickering was impeached and removed from office on a party-line vote., 1985, at 23. The following day, the House impeached Justice Samuel Chase, but six Democratic-Republicans crossed party lines in the Senate to prevent his conviction by a single vote. In Marbury, the Supreme Court held that Madison's failure to deliver the commission to Marbury was illegal, but did not grant Marbury a writ of mandamus on the ground that ¬ß 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the Court to issue such writs under its original jurisdiction.Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). Stuart v. Laird --involving a civil judgment rendered by a circuit court constituted under the Midnight Judges Act and enforced by a circuit court constituted under the Judiciary Act of 1802--challenged the constitutionality both of abolishing the circuit judgeships and of requiring the Supreme Court justices to ride circuit. In a brief opinion, the Court rejected both challenges.Stuart v. Laird, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch.) 299 (1803). =District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801= Both the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and the D.C. justices of the peace were created on February 27, 1801 by the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801.District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, 2 Stat. 103. Unlike its better-known predecessor, the Midnight Judges Act,Judiciary Act of 1801 (Midnight Judges Act), 2 Stat. 89. the Organic Act survived repeal by the Jeffersonian Congress.John G. Roberts, Jr., What Makes the D.C. Circuit Different?: A Historical View, 92 375, 378 (2006). D.C. justices of the peace President Jefferson refused to deliver commissions to some of President Adams' confirmed D.C. justice of the peace nominees, like William Marbury (pictured). The D.C. justices of the peace were appointed by the President, in a number at his discretion, and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. A D.C. justice of the peace had jurisdiction over \\"all matters, civil and criminal, and in whatever relates to the conservation of the peace\\" within their county.District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, ¬ß 11, 2 Stat. 103, 107. The District of Columbia was divided into two counties: Washington County, east of the Potomac River, and Alexandria County, west of the Potomac.District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, ¬ß 2, 2 Stat. 103, 105. Justices of the peace were authorized to \\"inflict whipping, imprisonment, and fine as high as 500 pounds of tobacco\\" and to hear civil cases with an amount in controversy up to $20.More, 7 U.S. at 167 (oral argument). One year after More, in Ex parte Burford (1806), the Marshall Court's first original habeas case, the Court granted a writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner subjected to preventive detention by the D.C. justices of the peace.Ex parte Burford, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 448 (1806). As to compensation, the Organic Act provided that justices of the peace \\"shall be entitled to receive for their services the fees allowed for like services by the laws herein before adopted and continued, in the eastern part of said district.\\" A March 3, 1801 amendment to the Organic Act provided that: \\"[T]he magistrates, to be appointed for the said district, shall be and they are hereby constituted a board of commissioners within their respective counties, and shall possess and exercise the same powers, perform the same duties, receive the same fees and , as the levy courts or commissioners of county for the state of Maryland possess, perform and receive . . . .\\"Mar. 3, 1801, ¬ß 4, 2 Stat. 115, 115. On March 4, 1801, President John Adams's last day in office, Adams nominated and the Senate confirmed 20 D.C. justices of the peace for Washington County and 19 for Alexandria County.O'Fallon, 1993, at 43 & n.4. On March 16, President Thomas Jefferson issued 15 commissions to justices of the peace in Washington County, including 13 nominated by Adams, and 15 in Alexandria County, including 11 nominated by Adams; the remainder were of his own choosing. (Jefferson's list, submitted to the Senate on January 6, 1802, erroneously contained the name of John Laird, a confirmed Adams appointed who had not received a commission from Jefferson, instead of More.)O'Fallon, 1993, at 48 n.27. The plaintiffs in Marbury v. Madison (1803)--William Marbury, Dennis Ramsay, Robert Townsend Hooe, and William Harper--were among the confirmed Adams nominees not commissioned. On May 3, 1802, Congress eliminated both the fees for justice of the peace services, except travel expenses, authorized by the Organic Act and fees associated with the justices of the peace's role on the board of commissioners.Act of May 3, 1802, ch. 15, ¬ß 8, 2 Stat. 193, 194-95. These two sources represented the entirety of their compensation.O'Fallon, 1993, at 52. D.C. circuit court The three-judge United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia was populated by its own judges, rather than by a mixture of district judges and circuit riding Supreme Court justices like the other circuit courts. The D.C. circuit court had jurisdiction over crimes committed within the district.District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, ¬ß 5, 2 Stat. 103, 106. With regard to appeals from the D.C. circuit court, the Organic Act provided: :[A]ny final judgment, order or decree in said circuit court, wherein the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the value of one hundred dollars, may be re- examined and reversed or affirmed in the supreme court of the United States, by writ of error or appeal, which shall be prosecuted in the same manner, under the same regulations, and the same proceedings shall be had therein, as is or shall be provided in the case of writs of error on judgments, or appeals upon orders or decrees, rendered in the circuit court of the United States.District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, ¬ß 8, 2 Stat. 103, 106. The provision to which the Organic Act referred, that for writs of error from the circuit courts to the Supreme Court in the Judiciary Act of 1789, provided: :And upon a like process [as a writ of error from the district court to the circuit court], may final judgments and decrees in civil actions, and suits in equity in a circuit court, brought there by original process, or removed there from courts of the several States, or removed there by appeal from a district court where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of two thousand dollars, exclusive of costs, be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court, the citation being in such case signed by a judge of such circuit court, or justice of the Supreme Court, and the adverse party having at least thirty days‚Äô notice.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 22, 1 Stat. 73, 84. Unlike the appellate provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the appellate provision of the act of February 27, 1801 was not explicitly limited to civil cases (except insofar as it incorporated the former by reference). Further, because the D.C. circuit court was not constituted within the framework of the Judiciary Act of 1802, appeals to the Supreme Court by way of certificates of division could not issue. After More, the Marshall Court heard six appeals from the D.C. circuit court via original habeas.Ex parte Burford, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 448 (1806); Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75 (1807); Ex parte Kearney, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 38 (1822); Ex parte Watkins, 28 U.S. (3 Pet.) 193 (1830); Ex parte Watkins, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 568 (1833); Ex parte Milburn, 34 U.S. (9 Pet.) 704 (1835). =Criminal appeals= Justice Samuel Chase expressed his willingness to sign a writ of error in a criminal case while riding circuit in 1800. The availability of criminal appeals to the Supreme Court by means of writs of error from the circuit courts was perhaps an open question prior to More.Rossman, 1990, at 522-25. In England, the writ of error was available as of right in misdemeanor cases, but, in felony cases, required the express consent of the prosecutor.Rossman, 1990, at 523 n.17. The legislative history of the Judiciary Act of 1789 reveals little consideration of criminal appeals. Caleb Strong, a Senator at the time of its drafting, described ¬ß 22 of that act as follows: \\"Writs of Error from the Circuit to the Supr. Court in all Causes not criminal of which the Circuit Court has original Cognizance and the Matter in Dispute does not exceed 2000 Dolrs.\\"Rossman, 1990, at 556. Senator (and future Supreme Court justice) William Paterson noticed the lack of provision for criminal appeals in preliminary notes and a draft outline of a speech he gave on June 23, 1789.Rossman, 1990, at 557. According to Rossman, Paterson may have viewed the inability of the government to appeal (to a court in the nation's capitol) as a \\"protection for ordinary citizens.\\" The issue of criminal appeals was not mentioned in the House debates. Shortly after the Judiciary Act of 1789 took effect, Attorney General Edmund Randolph proposed, in a report to the House of Representatives, a criminal appeal similar to that in England: a writ of error as of right in non-capital cases, and no writs of error in capital cases.Rossman, 1990, at 557 n.184. Randolph's report was referred to the Committee of the Whole, which took no action. Prior to Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had heard only two criminal cases--both by prerogative writ. First, in United States v. Hamilton (1795), the Court granted bail to a capital defendant--as it was authorized to do by ¬ß 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 33, 1 Stat. 73, 91-92. and ¬ß 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793.Judiciary Act of 1793, ¬ß 4, 1 Stat. 333, 334. The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by ¬ß 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793.Judiciary Act of 1793, ¬ß 3, 1 Stat. 333, 334. In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court explained that its jurisdiction in Hamilton could only have been exercised via original habeas under ¬ß 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789.Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75, 100-01 (1807). Second, in United States v. Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy.United States v. Lawrence, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 42 (1795). In one criminal trial, United States v. Callender (C.C.D. Va. 1800), Justice Samuel Chase (who expressed no dissent in More) wrote: :[I]f I am not right, it is an error in judgment, and you can state the proceedings on the record so as to show any error, and I shall be the first man to grant you the benefit a new trial by granting you a writ of error in the supreme court.United States v. Callender, 25 F. Cas. 239, 251 (C.C.D. Va. 1800) (No. 14,709). In United States v. Simms (1803), the Court heard a writ of error, brought by the United States, on the merits from a criminal case in the D.C. circuit court.United States v. Simms, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 252 (1803). Simms was the first such case, and after Simms, the next criminal writ of error heard by the Court was More.Rossman, 1990, at 523. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia John T. Mason argued both Simms and More. Indictments Because the law of Virginia remained in force in Alexandria County, More was indicted for the common law crime of exacting illegal fees under color of his office. Benjamin More was one of two of D.C. justices of peace in Alexandria County of Jefferson's own choosing, receiving an interim appointment.O'Fallon, 1993, at 43. Jefferson proceeded to nominate More for a full five-year term, and the Senate confirmed More on April 27, 1802.O'Fallon, 1993, at 48. According to O'Fallon, \\"More appears to have been a man of moderate Jeffersonian sentiments and attachments, who nonetheless joined in a Federalist defense of judicial independence.\\"O'Fallon, 1993, at 45. He was \\"an unlikely character for the lead role in a Federalist attack on Jeffersonian principles.\\" O'Fallon hypothesizes that More's case was intended as a test case by all parties involved. \\"More has all the markings of a trumped-up case, manufactured to present the Supreme Court with the issues of principle raised by the repeal, without the embarrassment of direct conflict with the Executive.\\" More was indicted by the Grand Inquest for the County of Washington, during its July term, for taking unlawful fees for his services as a justice of the peace.More, 7 U.S. at 172.O'Fallon, 1993, at 44 n.9, 48. The indictment charged More with having taken the fees on July 17 and 24. A capias, returnable at the December 1802 term, was issued.O'Fallon, 1993, at 48-49. The members of the Inquest included five other D.C. justices of the peace: Daniel Carrol, Daniel Reintzell, Joseph Sprigg Belt, Thomas Corcoran, and Anthony Reintzell.O'Fallon, 1993, at 48 n.28. Another member of the Inquest was Thomas Beall, a confirmed Adams appointee who had not received a commission from Jefferson. More was indicted a second time at the December term for conduct on December 10, 1802.O'Fallon, 1993, at 49. More demured, and the case was continued until the July 1803 term. Only the latter indictment was mentioned in the United States Reports.More, 7 U.S. at 159-60. More's demurrer was opposed by U.S. Attorney Mason, a Jefferson appointee.O'Fallon, 1993, at 56 n.58. Mason argued that the D.C. justices of the peace were Article I judges established pursuant to Congress's enumerated power over the District of Columbia in Article One of the United States Constitution. Article One provides that Congress shall have power \\"[t]o exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States.\\" art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 17. Mason advanced a broad view that Congress's power over the District of Columbia was not limited any other constitutional provision.O'Fallon, 1993, at 49-50 & n.32. In support of his argument that the justices of the peace were not Article III judges, Mason argued that their jurisdiction was broader than that permitted by Article III.O'Fallon, 1993, at 50. According to O'Fallon, there were additional indicia--not cited by either party--that the justices of the peace were not Article III judges.O'Fallon, 1993, at 50-51. For example, the Organic Act authorized the President to appoint as many justices of the peace as he \\"shall from time to time think expedient.\\" This was a broad delegation to the President of Congress's power \\"[t]o constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court.\\" art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 9. More was not indicted under any criminal statue passed by Congress. Rather, his was \\"an indictment at common law . . . for having, under colour of his office, exacted and taken an illegal fee.\\"More, 7 U.S. at 160 n.* (C.C.D.C. 1803) (Kilty, C.J., dissenting). The Organic Act provided that the laws of Maryland and Virginia would continue in force in the portions of the district ceded from those states.District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, ¬ß 1, 2 Stat. 103, 103-05. Since More was a justice of the peace for Alexandria County, the common law of Virginia would have applied. Dismissal William Cranch both heard the case as a D.C. circuit court judge and reported the Supreme Court's decision. The D.C. circuit court judges hearing the demurrer were Chief Judge William Kilty and assistant judges William Cranch and James Markham Marshall (Chief Justice John Marshall's brother). Cranch and Marshall were Adams appointees; Kilty was a Jefferson appointee. Cranch, also the reporter of decisions for the Supreme Court, included the D.C. circuit court opinions in the margin of his report of the Supreme Court's decision in More. =Majority= Cranch, joined by Marshall, sustained More's demurrer based on the Compensation Clause of Article Three of the United States Constitution.More, 7 U.S. at 160 n.* (C.C.D.C. 1803) (Cranch, J., joined by Marshall, J.). That clause provides: \\"The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts . . . shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\\" art. III, ¬ß 1 (emphasis added). Cranch held that Congress's power over the federal district was limited by the remainder of the Constitution. In response to Mason's argument for unfettered power, Cranch replied: \\"[T]his is a doctrine to which I can never assent. Can it be said, that congress may pass a bill of attainder for the district of Columbia? That congress may pass laws ex post facto in the district, or order soldiers to be quartered upon us in a time of peace, or make our ports free ports of entry, or lay duties upon our exports, or take away the right of trial by jury, in criminal prosecutions?\\" Cranch held that More was an Article III judge sitting on a \\"Tribunal inferior to the supreme Court.\\" In response to the argument that his jurisdiction exceeded Article Three, Cranch replied that: \\"The causes of which they have cognizance, are causes arising under the laws of the United States, and, therefore, the power of trying them, is part of the judicial power . . . .\\" In response to the argument that the fees would never have been paid at a \\"time Stated,\\" Cranch replied that: \\"[I]t may, perhaps, be a compliance with the clause of the constitution, which requires that it shall be receivable at stated times, to say that it shall be paid when the service is rendered. And, we are rather to incline to this construction, than to suppose the command of the constitution to have been disobeyed.\\" Further, Cranch dodged the question of whether a five-year term was consistent with the Good Behavior Clause. \\"It is unnecessary in this cause to decide the question, whether, as such, he holds his office during good behaviour . . . .\\" Cranch stopped short of declaring the statute unconstitutional. He merely interpreted it as prospective, holding that it \\"cannot affect that justice of the peace during his continuance in office; whatever effect it may have upon those justices who have been appointed to office since the passing of the act.\\" Contemporary media accounts reported that the circuit court had held that fee-elimination provision of the May 23, 1802 act unconstitutional, rather than interpreting it as prospective.O'Fallon, 1993, at 51 n.42. According to O'Fallon, this is evidence that Cranch's published opinion (as reported by himself) may have differed from his oral opinion. =Dissent= Chief Judge Kilty's dissent noted the recent confirmation of the principle of judicial review in Marbury v. Madison. \\"According to the course which has been pursued by the supreme court, it appears unnecessary to say any thing about the power of a court to examine into the constitutionality of a law . . . .\\" Instead, Kilty proceeded by \\"taking the power for granted.\\" But, Kilty noted, \\"[i]n testing an act of the legislature by the constitution, nothing less than the positive provisions of the latter can be resorted to . . . .\\" Kilty briefly argued that More was not an Article III judge and that the fees in question were not compensation received at \\"times Stated.\\" But, the bulk of Kilty's dissent was devoted to the argument that Congress's power over the federal district was broad. He argued that \\"the district of Columbia, though belonging to the United States, and within their compass, is not, like a state, a component part, and that the provisions of the constitution, which are applicable particularly to the relative situation of the United States and the several states, are not applicable to this district.\\" \\"[W]hen congress, in exercising exclusive legislation over this territory, enact laws to give or to take away the fees of the justices of the peace, such laws cannot be tested by a provision in the constitution, evidently applicable to the judicial power of the whole United States, and containing restrictions which cannot, in their nature, affect the situation of the justices, or the nature of the compensation.\\" Yet, Kilty did not fully accept Mason's argument that Congress's power over the district was unlimited. He argued that the word \\"exclusive\\" meant only \\"free from the power exercised by the several states\\" and that \\"the legislative power to be exercised by congress may still be subject to the general restraints contained in the constitution.\\" He admitted that, even within the federal district, Congress was :restrained from suspending the writ of habeas corpus, unless in the cases allowed; from passing (within and for the district) a bill of attainder, or ex post facto law; from laying therein a capitation tax; from granting therein any title of nobility; from making therein a law respecting the establishment of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; and from quartering soldiers therein, contrary to the third amendment. Oral argument Mason argued the appeal of the United States before the Supreme Court.More, 7 U.S. at 159 (oral argument). Samuel Jones argued for More.More, 7 U.S. at 165 (oral argument). =Merits= Jones cited Marbury v. Madison for the proposition that a D.C. justice of the peace does not serve merely at the pleasure of the president.More, 7 U.S. at 166 (oral argument). According to O'Fallon, due to the President's power to remove most appointees from office, this could only have been a reference to the Good Behavior Clause of Article Three.O'Fallon, 1993, at 51 n.40. That clause provides that \\"Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.\\" Mason countered that Marbury only held that justices of the peace were entitled to hold their offices for five years of good behavior. Mason again pressed his argument that Congress's power of the federal district was unlimited: :The constitution does not apply to this case. The constitution is a compact between the people of the United States in their individual capacity, and the states in their political capacity. Unfortunately for the citizens of Columbia, they are not in either of these capacities. . . . Congress are under no controul in legislating for the district of Columbia. Their power, in this respect, is unlimited.More, 7 U.S. at 167-68 (oral argument). Marson also argued that More was not an Article III judge because \\"the judicial power exercised in the district of Columbia, extends to other cases [than those enumerated in Article III], and, therefore, is not the judicial power of the United States.\\"More, 7 U.S. at 168 (oral argument). \\"It is a power derived from the power given to congress to legislate exclusively in all cases whatsoever over the district.\\" =Jurisdiction= Just two years earlier, in United States v. Simms (1803), the Court had heard a criminal appeal from the same court concerning faro gambling (pictured). On February 13, sua sponte, Chief Justice Marshall raised his doubts to the Court's jurisdiction to entertain criminal appeals.More, 7 U.S. at 169 (oral argument).O'Fallon, 1993, at 44 n.9. Argument on this question commenced on February 22. Mason argued in favor of jurisdiction. No argument from More's counsel on this issue was reported, \\"although it was typical for the reporter to summarize the arguments on both sides.\\"Rossman, 1990, at 523 n.18. Mason acknowledged that, under Clarke v. Bazadone (1803),Clarke v. Bazadone, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 212 (1803) (holding that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to hear a civil writ of error from the General Court for the Territory Northwest of the Ohio). the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction required an affirmative grant by Congress.More, 7 U.S. at 170 (oral argument). Mason argued that such a grant was found in ¬ß 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (known as the All Writs Act), which authorized the Supreme Court to \\"issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs, not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of [its] jurisdiction, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law.\\" Mason's argument based on the All Writs Act was not necessarily limited to the D.C. circuit court. Said Mason: :There is no reason why the writ of error should be confined to civil cases. A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other. There is nothing in the nature of the cases which should make a difference; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case. They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings. Chief Justice Marshall replied that, if Congress had made no provision for appeals of any kind to the Supreme Court, \\"your argument would be irresistible.\\"More, 7 U.S. at 169-70 (oral argument). But, Marshall countered, under the Exceptions Clause, when Congress \\"has said in what cases a writ of error or appeal shall lie, an exception of all other cases is implied.\\"More, 7 U.S. at 171 (oral argument). The Exceptions Clause provides that \\"[i]n all [cases other than those in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction], the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\\" art. III, ¬ß 2, cl. 2. Mason replied, first, that the Exceptions Clause did not apply to the federal district, and second, that Organic Act differed from the Judiciary Act of 1789 by referring to \\"any final judgment, order, or decree,\\" rather than explicitly limiting appeals to \\"civil cases.\\" Mason suggested that the references to the amount in controversy could refer to criminal fines as well as civil judgments.More, 7 U.S. at 171-72 (oral argument). Finally, Mason pointed out that, just two years earlier, in United States v. Simms (1803), the Court had reached the merits in a criminal appeal from the same court.More, 7 U.S. at 172. Mason himself had argued Simms, and Marshall himself had authored the opinion. In response to the last point, Marshall replied that: \\"No question was made, in that case, as to the jurisdiction. It passed sub silentio, and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case.\\" Mason retorted: \\"But the traverser [Simms] had able counsel, who did not think proper to make the objection.\\" Opinion Chief Justice John Marshall dismissed the writ of error for want of jurisdiction. On March 2, 1805, writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice John Marshall dismissed the writ of error for want of jurisdiction.More, 7 U.S. at 172, 174. Justice Johnson was absent from the opinion announcement.More, 7 U.S. at 172 n.*. Marshall held that the partial statutory grant of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause to limit the jurisdiction of the Court in all other cases.More, 7 U.S. at 172-73. Marshall noted that \\"it has never been supposed, that a decision of a circuit court could be reviewed, unless the matter in dispute should exceed the value of 2,000 dollars.\\"More, 7 U.S. at 173. Thus, Marshall interpreted the $2000 amount in controversy requirement of ¬ß 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 as applying to the entire section, rather than only the last antecedent. Marshall rejected the argument that the Organic Act authorized criminal appellate jurisdiction. He interpreted the grant, in light of its $100 amount in controversy requirement, as \\"confined to civil cases.\\" \\"The words, 'matter in dispute,' seem appropriated to civil cases, where the subject in contest has a value beyond the sum mentioned in the act. But, in criminal cases, the question is the guilt or innocence of the accused. And although he may be fined upwards of 100 dollars, yet that is, in the eye of the law, a punishment for the offence committed, and not the particular object of the suit.\\"More, 7 U.S. at 173-74. A final footnote refers to United States v. La Vengeance (1796),United States v. La Vengeance, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 297 (1796). \\"where it seems to be admitted, that in criminal cases the judgment of the inferior court is final.\\"More, 7 U.S. at 174 n.*. La Vengeance was an admiralty libel case. There, at oral argument, Attorney General Charles Lee argued, in the alternative, that the case was a \\"criminal cause\\" and therefore \\"should never have been removed to the Circuit Court, the judgment of the District Court being final in criminal causes.\\"La Vengeance, 3 U.S. at 299 (oral argument). The Court summarily rejected Lee's argument: \\"we are unanimously of opinion, that it is a civil cause: It is a process of the nature of a libel in rem; and does not, in any degree, touch the persons of the offender.\\"La Vengeance, 3 U.S. at 301. Aftermath After More, no writs of error issued from federal criminal trials in the circuit courts for 84 years. In 1889, Congress created a right of appeal by writ of error in capital cases.Act of Feb. 6, 1889, ¬ß6, 25 Stat. 655, 656. In 1891, the Judiciary Act of 1891 (the \\"Evarts Act\\") extended this right to other serious crimes.Judiciary Act of 1891 (Evarts Act), ¬ß 5, 26 Stat. 826, 827. The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished the circuit courts and placed original jurisdiction for the trial of all federal crimes in the district courts.Judicial Code of 1911, ¬ß 24(2), 36 Stat. 1087, 1091. Appeal to the courts of appeals by writs of error was provided for all \\"final decisions,\\" in civil and criminal cases alike.Judicial Code of 1911, ¬ß 128, 36 Stat. 1087, 1133-34. Appeals to the Supreme Court were permitted directly from the district courts by writ of error, from the courts of appeals on certified questions, and by petition for certiorari.Judicial Code of 1911, ¬ß¬ß 238-240, 36 Stat. 1087, 1157. Without reported discussion of the jurisdictional issue, the Court did hear writs of error from criminal cases removed to the circuit courts.Blyew v. United States, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 581 (1871). (Recall that the Judiciary Act of 1789 explicitly authorized appeals in removal cases.) The Supreme Court had other, limited sources of appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases. The Court could hear criminal appeals from the state courts by writ of error, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 25, 1 Stat. 73, 85-87\\\\. See Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264 (1821). The Court could hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1802,Judiciary Act of 1802, ¬ß 6, 2 Stat. 156, 159-61\\\\. See United States v. Cantril, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 167 (1807). original habeas petition, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789,Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 14, 1 Stat. 73, 81-82\\\\. See Ex parte Burford, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 448 (1806). and mandamus, as authorized by the same act.Judiciary Act of 1789, ¬ß 13, 1 Stat. 73, 80-81\\\\. See Ex parte Taylor, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 3 (1852).

See Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 506 (1869). and after 1885,Act of Mar. 3, 1885, 23 Stat. 437. See Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241 (1886). the Court had jurisdiction to hear writs of error from habeas petitions (a civil action) in the circuit courts. Beginning in 1850, the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts.See Forsyth v. United States, 50 U.S. (9 How.) 571 (1850); Simpson v. United States, 50 U.S. (9 How.) 578 (1850). Attempts to utilize other prerogative writs as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful.Ex parte Gordon, 66 U.S. (1 Black) 503 (1861) (admiralty writ of prohibition). Analysis More had received far less scholarly attention than Marbury.O'Fallon, 1993, at 44. \\"The timing and the ground of decision may explain why historians of the battle over repeal have ignored More.\\"James M. O'Fallon, Marbury, 44 219, 241 n.72 (1992). \\"In a doctrinal summary of constitutional law, More stands only for the proposition that an affirmative grant of appellate jurisdiction by Congress carries with it an implicit negative of jurisdiction within the constitutional description but not mentioned in the grant.\\" According to O'Fallon, \\"More may have been part of a Federalist strategy to get the Court to intervene in the political struggle over the judiciary.\\" Given that Justice Samuel Chase was acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment case on March 1, 1805, the day before the release of the More decision, \\"[o]ne can imagine John Marshall passing a sigh of relief as he handed down the judgment in More.\\"O'Fallon, 1993, at 55. \\"[T]he dismissal of More marked the end of Federalist efforts to obtain a Supreme Court ruling, directly or by implication, that the repeal of the 1801 Judiciary Act was unconstitutional.O'Fallon, 1993, at 55-56. \\"More is of a piece with Marbury and Stuart v. Laird in its avoidance of an opportunity for an open clash with political critics of the courts. It further shares with Marbury the characteristic of declining an exercise of jurisdiction that the Court found to be unwarranted.\\"O'Fallon, 1993, at 56. O'Fallon argues: :Rather than seize the opportunity presented by More, John Marshall ducked. . . . Without questioning the soundness or propriety of Marshall's decision, it is worth noting that the Court had previously entertained criminal appeals from the district without raising any such jurisdictional problem. One might reasonably wonder if the Court wanted to avoid a decision on the merits. By March of 1805, the repeal question had lost its political immediacy, and the impeachment strategy of the Jeffersonians had faltered. There was little to be gained in reopening the sores of the repeal battle. And Marshall may have felt that he had had his say on the critical matters of principle with his opinion in Marbury.

The film surrounds a young man whose loyalties are torn between his band, girlfriend, and dealing weed. Attempting to elude arrest after a drug bust, he is accompanied by his teenage runaway neighbor. It stars Abby Elliott, Dylan O'Brien, and Rob Riggle. It also premiered at the 2011 Newport Beach Film Festival, where for Matt Walsh's directing, it won an honor for Outstanding Achievement in Filmmaking. Plot The comedy centers on Glen \\"Fitz\\" Fitzgerald (James Pumphrey), a young man, marijuana dealer, and former rock band drummer living in Los Angeles, California. His best friends dropped out of the band, Torigl, three months prior, causing the group to part and him to fall back on selling weed in his garage. He dates Monica (Abby Elliott), who works at a news company, and hangs out with his rebellious teen neighbor, Jimmy (Dylan O'Brien), who skips school. Fitz also believes in the \\"triangle theory\\", where everything in the world can connect in group of threes (a joke ran throughout the film). One day, after Fitz is nearly arrested in a weed bust of one of his clients, he leaves his girlfriend behind and flees to temporarily stay in Oakland, California to avoid arrest. Jimmy convinces him to join his trip so he can visit his mother there, as his father James Malone Sr (Rob Riggle) plans to send him to military school for missing and failing classes. Mistaken for a kidnap, James gets help from a police academy graduate and ally, Officer Fogerty (Joe Lo Truglio), setting out in search for his son through their own investigation. Along the way, Jimmy attempts to keep Fitz sober, preventing Fitz from smoking. They also plot and successfully switch cars to derail the cops from tracking them by trading vehicles with Fitz's ex-band mates Sheila (Lizzy Caplan) and Richie (Matt L. Jones), who have since become a tribute band in Bakersfield, California. Monica has become pregnant with Fitz's child, but encounters a brief affair with her married boss, Barry (Ed Helms), the latter which she informs Fitz about. Upset Fitz left her behind, she pursues his trail. In the other pursuit, James and Officer Fogerty eventually tracks and catches up to Fitz and Jimmy, who had slept overnight in their van after visiting a diner. They are nearly captured, but Jimmy deflates their car tire and escapes with Fitz. Fitz and Jimmy have a fallout and stop at a roadside, where Jimmy trips and breaks his hand, running back to their vehicle that is being towed. Faking their names, they stop at a clinic, where the peculiar doctor (Horatio Sanz) suspects Fitz has kidnapped and is molesting Jimmy due to his good looks. Once Jimmy has a cast and sling on, however, he leaves with Fitz, taking a taxi ride to a bar named \\"Berlin\\" in Oakland. At the bar, Fitz finds his estranged father, Arnie (Rich Fulcher) is the club owner and drag queen performer for the bar, but he thinks low of his dad. His girlfriend Monica turns up there as well and tells him she is pregnant from him, but he rejects the idea of fathering her child since she made out with her boss, before she storms off. Jimmy also admits his mom is dead. Upon the arrival of Jimmy's dad, James, and Officer Fogerty, a confrontation occurs where James attacks Fitz, believing in misinterpreted evidence he kidnapped and raped his son Jimmy. Jimmy opens up telling his dad the truth, thinking poorly of him for not being there to aid his problems, sharing the same feeling as Fitz about his father. However, they all reconcile in the end, with Fitz concluding that having a father rather than none is better. The next day, after turning down a promotion from her boss who ridicules Fitz for trying to make up with her, Monica reconnects with Fitz and the two later care for their newborn child.

In fluid mechanics, the Rayleigh‚ÄìPlesset equation or Besant‚ÄìRayleigh‚ÄìPlesset equation is an ordinary differential equation which governs the dynamics of a spherical bubble in an infinite body of incompressible fluid. Its general form is usually written as : R\\\\frac{d^2R}{dt^2} + \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{dR}{dt}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{4 u_L}{R}\\\\frac{dR}{dt} + \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{\\\\rho_LR} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta P(t)}{\\\\rho_L} =0 where :\\\\rho_L is the density of the surrounding liquid, assumed to be constant :R(t) is the radius of the bubble : u_L is the kinematic viscosity of the surrounding liquid, assumed to be constant :\\\\gamma is the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface :\\\\Delta P(t) = P_\\\\infty(t) - P_B(t), in which, P_B(t) is the pressure within the bubble, assumed to be uniform and P_\\\\infty(t) is the external pressure infinitely far from the bubble Provided that P_B(t) is known and P_\\\\infty(t) is given, the Rayleigh‚ÄìPlesset equation can be used to solve for the time-varying bubble radius R(t). The Rayleigh‚ÄìPlesset equation is derived from the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations under the assumption of spherical symmetry.  History  Neglecting surface tension and viscosity, the equation was first derived by W. H. Besant in his 1859 book with the problem statement stated as An infinite mass of homogenous incompressible fluid acted upon by no forces is at rest, and a spherical portion of the fluid is suddenly annihilated; it is required to find the instantaneous alteration of pressure at any point of the mass, and the time in which the cavity will be filled up, the pressure at an infinite distance being supposed to remain constant (in fact, Besant attributes the problem to Cambridge Senate-House problems of 1847).Besant, W. H. (1859). A treatise on hydrostatics and hydrodynamics. Deighton, Bell. Article. 158. Neglecting the pressure variations inside the bubble, Besant predicted the time required to fill the cavity to be :\\\\begin{align} t&=a\\\\left(\\\\frac{6\\\\rho}{p_\\\\infty}\\\\right)^{1/2}\\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{z^4\\\\, dz}{\\\\sqrt{1-z^6}} &= a\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\rho}{6 p_\\\\infty}\\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(5/6)}{\\\\Gamma(4/3)}  & \\\\approx 0.91468 a\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{p_\\\\infty}\\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\end{align} where the integration was carried out by Lord Rayleigh in 1917, who derived the equation from energy balance. Rayleigh also realized that the assumption of constant pressure inside the cavity would become wrong as the radius decreases and he shows that using Boyle's law, if the radius of cavity decreases by a factor of 4^{1/3}, then the pressure near the boundary of the cavity becomes greater than the ambient pressure. The equation was first applied to traveling cavitation bubbles by Milton S. Plesset in 1949 by including effects of surface tension.  Derivation  Numerical integration of RP eq. including surface tension and viscosity terms. Initially at rest in atmospheric pressure with R0=50 um, the bubble subjected to oscillatory pressure at its natural frequency undergoes expansion and then collapses. Numerical integration of RP eq. including surface tension and viscosity terms. Initially at rest in atmospheric pressure with R0=50 um, the bubble subjected to pressure-drop undergoes expansion and then collapses. The Rayleigh‚ÄìPlesset equation can be derived entirely from first principles using the bubble radius as the dynamic parameter. Consider a spherical bubble with time-dependent radius R(t) , where t is time. Assume that the bubble contains a homogeneously distributed vapor/gas with a uniform temperature T_B(t) and pressure P_B(t) . Outside the bubble is an infinite domain of liquid with constant density \\\\rho_L and dynamic viscosity \\\\mu_L . Let the temperature and pressure far from the bubble be T_\\\\infty and P_\\\\infty(t) . The temperature T_\\\\infty is assumed to be constant. At a radial distance r from the center of the bubble, the varying liquid properties are pressure P(r,t) , temperature T(r,t) , and radially outward velocity u(r,t) . Note that these liquid properties are only defined outside the bubble, for r \\\\ge R(t) . = Mass conservation = By conservation of mass, the inverse-square law requires that the radially outward velocity u(r,t) must be inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the origin (the center of the bubble). Therefore, letting F(t) be some function of time, : u(r,t) = \\\\frac{F(t)}{r^2} In the case of zero mass transport across the bubble surface, the velocity at the interface must be : u(R,t) = \\\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\\\frac{F(t)}{R^2} which gives that : F(t) = R^2dR/dt In the case where mass transport occurs, the rate of mass increase inside the bubble is given by : \\\\frac{dm_V}{dt} = \\\\rho_V\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\\\rho_V\\\\frac{d(4\\\\pi R^3/3)}{dt} = 4\\\\pi\\\\rho_VR^2\\\\frac{dR}{dt} with V being the volume of the bubble. If u_L is the velocity of the liquid relative to the bubble at r = R , then the mass entering the bubble is given by : \\\\frac{dm_L}{dt} = \\\\rho_LAu_L = \\\\rho_L(4\\\\pi R^2)u_L with A being the surface area of the bubble. Now by conservation of mass dm_v/dt = dm_L/dt , therefore u_L = (\\\\rho_V/\\\\rho_L)dR/dt . Hence : u(R,t) = \\\\frac{dR}{dt} - u_L = \\\\frac{dR}{dt} - \\\\frac{\\\\rho_V}{\\\\rho_L}\\\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\rho_V}{\\\\rho_L}\\\\right)\\\\frac{dR}{dt} Therefore : F(t) = \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\rho_V}{\\\\rho_L}\\\\right)R^2\\\\frac{dR}{dt} In many cases, the liquid density is much greater than the vapor density, \\\\rho_L \\\\gg \\\\rho_V , so that F(t) can be approximated by the original zero mass transfer form F(t) = R^2dR/dt , so that : u(r,t) = \\\\frac{F(t)}{r^2} = \\\\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\\\frac{dR}{dt} = Momentum conservation = Assuming that the liquid is a Newtonian fluid, the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equation in spherical coordinates for motion in the radial direction gives : \\\\rho_L\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial P}{\\\\partial r} + \\\\mu_L \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{r^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r}\\\\left( r^2\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{2u}{r^2}\\\\right] Substituting kinematic viscosity u_L = \\\\mu_L/\\\\rho_L and rearranging gives : -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_L}\\\\frac{\\\\partial P}{\\\\partial r} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial r} - u_L \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{r^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r}\\\\left( r^2\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{2u}{r^2}\\\\right] whereby substituting u(r,t) from mass conservation yields : -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_L}\\\\frac{\\\\partial P}{\\\\partial r} = \\\\frac{2R}{r^2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{dR}{dt}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\\\frac{d^2R}{dt^2} - \\\\frac{2R^4}{r^5}\\\\left(\\\\frac{dR}{dt}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{1}{r^2}\\\\left(2R\\\\left(\\\\frac{dR}{dt}\\\\right)^2 + R^2\\\\frac{d^2R}{dt^2}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{2R^4}{r^5}\\\\left(\\\\frac{dR}{dt}\\\\right)^2 Note that the viscous terms cancel during substitution.

In spherical coordinates, for a fluid with constant density and constant viscosity, : \\\\sigma_{rr} = -P +2\\\\mu_L\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial r} Therefore at some small portion of the bubble surface, the net force per unit area acting on the lamina is :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_{rr}(R) + P_B - \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{R} & = -P(R) + \\\\left.2\\\\mu_L\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right_{r=R} + P_B - \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{R}  & = -P(R) + 2\\\\mu_L\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r}\\\\left( \\\\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\\\frac{dR}{dt} \\\\right)_{r=R} + P_B - \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{R}  & = -P(R) - \\\\frac{4\\\\mu_L}{R}\\\\frac{dR}{dt} + P_B - \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{R}  \\\\end{align} where \\\\gamma is the surface tension. If there is no mass transfer across the boundary, then this force per unit area must be zero, therefore P(R) = P_B - \\\\frac{4\\\\mu_L}{R}\\\\frac{dR}{dt} - \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{R} and so the result from momentum conservation becomes :\\\\frac{P(R) - P_\\\\infty}{\\\\rho_L} = \\\\frac{P_B - P_\\\\infty}{\\\\rho_L} - \\\\frac{4\\\\mu_L}{\\\\rho_LR}\\\\frac{dR}{dt} - \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{\\\\rho_LR} = R\\\\frac{d^2R}{dt^2} + \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{dR}{dt}\\\\right)^2 whereby rearranging and letting u_L = \\\\mu_L/\\\\rho_L gives the Rayleigh‚ÄìPlesset equation : \\\\frac{P_B(t) - P_\\\\infty(t)}{\\\\rho_L} = R\\\\frac{d^2R}{dt^2} + \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{dR}{dt}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{4 u_L}{R}\\\\frac{dR}{dt} + \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{\\\\rho_LR} Using dot notation to represent derivatives with respect to time, the Rayleigh‚ÄìPlesset equation can be more succinctly written as :: \\\\frac{P_B(t) - P_\\\\infty(t)}{\\\\rho_L} = R\\\\ddot{R} + \\\\frac{3}{2}(\\\\dot{R})^2 + \\\\frac{4 u_L\\\\dot{R}}{R} + \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{\\\\rho_LR}  Solutions  Recently, analytical closed-form solutions were found for the Rayleigh‚ÄìPlesset equation for both an empty and gas-filled bubble and were generalized to the N-dimensional case. The case when the surface tension is present due to the effects of capillarity were also studied. Also, for the special case where surface tension and viscosity are neglected, high-order analytical approximations are also known. In the static case, the Rayleigh‚ÄìPlesset equation simplifies, yielding the Young-Laplace equation: :P_B-P_\\\\infty = \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{R} When only infinitesimal periodic variations in the bubble radius and pressure are considered, the RP equation also yields the expression of the natural frequency of the bubble oscillation.

Begun by the Caribs (who harboured long-standing grievances against the British colonial administration, and were supported by French Revolutionary advisors) in March 1795, the Caribs successfully gained control of most of the island except for the immediate area around Kingstown, which was saved from direct assault on several occasions by the timely arrival of British reinforcements. British efforts to penetrate and control the interior and windward areas of the island were repeatedly frustrated by incompetence, disease, and effective Carib defences, which were eventually supplemented by the arrival of some French troops. A major military expedition by General Ralph Abercromby was eventually successful in crushing the Carib opposition in 1797. The Caribs were deported from Saint Vincent to the island of Roat√°n off the coast of present-day Honduras, where they became known as the Garifuna people. References * *Sweeney, James L.

He served in that capacity until his death in 1933. Background He was born December 24, 1884, to Chun Akana and Harriet Kahema in the Kaihuwai district of Waialua on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, in the Territory of Hawaii. Akana was of hapa (mixed) ancestry, with a Chinese father and Hawaiian mother. He graduated from Kamehameha School for boys in 1903, and was assigned as a teaching assistant at his alma mater.; The ministry At the October 1906 annual meeting of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Akana delivered a speech in which he stated that his decision to enter the Christian ministry was a direct result of the groundwork laid by the Christian missionaries who set up churches in Hawaii decades before his birth. In encouraging the board to continue its work in Hawaii, the twenty-two-year-old Akana cited the Sabbath being broken in Hawaii by baseball and golf. He earned a bachelor's degree in pedagogy at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, where he was president of his graduating class.; During the period 1910-11, he was affiliated with the Home Missions Board of Massachusetts. After his return to Hawaii, he served with the Hawaiian Evangelical Association, and was the founder of the Young People's League of Honolulu. Ordained into the ministry in 1912, he was selected as chaplain of the territorial House of Representatives in 1913. When Rev. Henry Hodges Parker retired on January 27, 1918, after 54 years as Kahu of Kawaiaha ªo Church, Akana was called to serve as interim minister before being formally installed as Kahu on November 3, 1918. Music for the occasion was provided by ukulele virtuoso Ernest Ka ªai, the Correlli Brothers String Trio, and students of Kamehameha Schools. As noted by author Ethel Moseley Damon in her book on the church's history, Akana was the first Kahu of Hawaiian ancestry. The formation of a young peoples' choir had its beginning under Akana's leadership. While remaining well-liked among the congregation, he restored a quiet respect for God's house that he believed had been missing within its walls. Death and legacy Akana published a 1911 research report \\"An Inductive Study on the Effects of Tobacco on Human Life\\". In 1920, Akana appeared before the United States House of Representatives hearings on \\"Public Protection of Maternity and Infancy\\", where he delivered a lengthy report on the subject matter as it related to the Territory of Hawaii. Under his tutelage and encouragement, Alice Kahokuoluna became the first woman ordained by the Hawaiian Evangelical Association, and in her time was the only ordained woman Christian minister in Hawaii. He died February 16, 1933, and was buried at Liliuokalani Church Cemetery in Haleiwa, Hawaii. Akana died intestacy with an estate valued at $1,000.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. In this outing, Henry attempts to convince Emma Swan to remain in Storybrooke and Regina Mills devises a master plan with Jefferson that will force Emma into leaving forever while the events surrounding Snow White's attempted rescue of Prince Charming are revealed along with her plan to enlist the aid of her allies and defeat the Evil Queen once and for all. It was co- written by Jane Espenson and David H. Goodman, while Milan Cheylov served as director. Plot =Opening sequence= Snow White and the Seven Dwarves walk through the forest. =In the characters' past= In the Enchanted Forest, in the hours after having captured Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) for betraying him after he refused to marry Abigail, King George (Alan Dale) decides that Charming will be beheaded. But as the blade prepares to fall on him, The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla) turns the blade to water and then makes a deal with King George by trading Charming for all the riches he would have been paid if he had married Midas‚Äô daughter. The Evil Queen tells King George that he will be used to take down his one true love, Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin). Meanwhile, Snow White watches from a hill with the dwarves and Granny (Beverley Elliott). Red Riding Hood (Meghan Ory) appears and tells the group that The Queen is there, but despite the fact that her presence there might indicate that it may be a trap, the group decides to move in after King George anyway. Moments later, the Queen goes to see Charming in his cell where he tries to convince her to take his life instead of Snow White's, but she doesn't want his life. When Charming asks what her plan is, she laughs and closes the jail cell and walks away while holding a red apple up for him to see. Hours later, Snow White, with help from the fairies from above, storms King George's castle, but when she arrives at Charming's cell, she is disappointed to find him showing only in a mirror there. They speak quickly, but before anything more is said, the Evil Queen interrupts and requests a parlay with no weapons. The entire group warns her not to go, but Snow White is determined to settle her dispute with the Queen without implicating the others. At the stable where Cora murdered her true love, Daniel, the Queen waits for Snow White, who walks up behind her. The Queen leads Snow White to the place where she ran down her runaway horse and saved her life and reveals to Snow White the burial site of Daniel. The Queen explains that she believes Daniel died because of Snow White breaking her promise, and cannot forgive Snow White despite already robbing Snow of her father. The Queen then gives Snow White an apple and makes a deal with her that if she eats the apple, she will be entombed in her own body, filled with nothing but regret, but Charming will live. However, if Snow White doesn't eat the apple, then Charming will die. Unfortunately, as Snow White eats the apple and collapses, Charming feels her soul in his cell now that she took the deal. As Snow White falls to the ground, the poisoned apple rolls down the hill and gets sucked into a portal leading to Jefferson's (Sebastian Stan) hand waiting in Storybrooke. As Red Riding Hood uses Snow White's scent to get to the barn, they notice she has no breath. Back at her palace, the Queen chuckles in her tower, saying that Snow's sacrifice is overrated. =In Storybrooke= In the present day, Regina (Parrilla) and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) eat dinner in silence when the doorbell rings, even though Regina wasn't expecting any company. Regina opens the door and finds Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) there, saying that Henry had invited her. As Regina turns around, she finds Henry is not there. Regina then looks back on the doorstep to see the townspeople who had gathered to take her away. Regina sees Henry waiting behind her with a rope, ready to tie Regina to her apple tree which had been planted in the center of the town. As Regina pleads for her life, Emma tells her that because Regina took away everyone's happiness, it's their turn to take away hers. David (Dallas) then gives Emma a sword which she swings at Regina's head. Regina wakes up and realizes that it was a nightmare. She then runs into Henry's room to check on him, but she doesn't realize he is not there and left his bed pillows to form the shape of his body. As for Henry and Emma, Emma tells her son that she wants to leave Storybrooke right away, but Henry pleads with his mother and hijacks the steering wheel in order to convince her to return. The following morning, Emma returns to Mary Margaret's (Goodwin) apartment and discovers that Mary Margaret is upset for not having had the opportunity to say goodbye to her. When Emma explains she abducted Henry as well, Mary Margaret gets more furious and tells Emma to do what's best for Henry. As Emma questions her what that is, Mary Margaret tells Emma that she is the mother and she has to make that decision. Later that day, Henry goes to see August (Eion Bailey), who reveals to him that he is turning back into a wooden puppet, and thus, dropping himself off of Operation Cobra. Since he believes in the curse, Henry sees August's wooden arm, confirming his belief that the stories are true. At the same time, Emma talks with Archie (Raphael Sbarge), who tells her that Emma has no case against Regina and tells her Henry's been skipping school and has even endangered himself since her arrival, he makes her understand that the fighting between her and Regina will only hurt Henry. This emotional tug of war leads Emma to make her decision. Elsewhere in Storybrooke, Regina sees that her apple tree is dying and goes to Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle), who tells her the curse could be weakening. Regina wants to get rid of Emma, but knows that if Emma dies the curse will be broken. She tries to strike a deal with Mr. Gold, but he turns down the offer, telling her that once people start remembering who they are, they are going to be out for Regina's blood (just like in the nightmare Regina had). So the Mayor uses another ploy by leaving a white rabbit card on Paige's bicycle at school. Hours later, Jefferson goes to see Regina now that he received the message from Paige's bicycle. To Jefferson's surprise, Regina produces the hat that she kept when she was the Evil Queen back in the Enchanted Forest during their trip to Wonderland. It turns out that Regina wants Jefferson to go back with her to their land to get something to help her get rid of Emma. Jefferson only agrees if he can forget his double life and be reunited with his daughter and she agrees to his request. Regina and Jefferson then go into the cell where the hearts are kept. As Jefferson places the hat on the ground, the hat doesn't spin. Regina's attempts are not successful either, but when Regina, with tears in her eyes, produces the ring that her former love, Daniel, had given her, Jefferson tells her that it may have some magic and instructs her to drop the ring in the hat, which begins to spin slowly. A portal doesn't open, but Jefferson tells her that he can reach through and grab something from the other side, so Regina guides the hat to the location of the item. When Jefferson asks her what item she wanted to retrieve, Regina responded by telling him that they are looking for an apple. Jefferson then catches the apple that Snow White ate from the other side of the portal and gives it to Regina, who then tells Jefferson that she will not fulfill the deal until Emma takes a bite of the apple. Afterwards, Regina concocts a plan to get Emma to eat it by baking the apple into a turnover. That afternoon, Emma goes to see Regina about Henry, telling her that she is leaving town. Emma wants to still be a part of Henry's life, so she would rather they would get along than not. Regina then gives Emma the poisoned turnover as a parting gift. Unfortunately, as Regina goes to Mr. Gold about how she has obtained the poisoned apple from the other world, Mr. Gold reminds her that all magic comes with a price. Regina retorts by telling him that he can pay it since it is his curse. Later that evening, Emma tells Henry that she is leaving, but Henry tries to get her to stay, only to have Emma tell him that this isn't a story. He stares at her in disbelief that she still doesn't believe in the curse, but Emma tells him that all Regina has ever done is fight for him. As Henry sees the apple turnover on the counter, he tries to convince his mother not to eat it and tells her that he believes in her and proves it by taking a bite of the turnover. Unfortunately, Henry immediately collapses, falling into the same infamous sleeping curse as Snow White. Production \\"An Apple Red as Blood\\" was co-written by co-executive producer David H.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the series a rating of 43%, based on 35 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading, \\"Broad but likeable, 1600 Penn unfortunately doles out its jokes unevenly and lacks the cutting wit necessary to meet its satirical aims.\\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/1600-penn/s01/ On Metacritic the series has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". David Hinkley of the New York Daily News gave the series 1 out of 5 stars and said \\"[it] was clearly designed to be good silly fun. It nails one out of three. It's silly.\\" He called the First Family \\"annoying... sitcom stereotypes\\" and said that it \\"mines none of the more subtle and satisfying possibilities of poking fun at a staid institution. It's more like a drug-fueled Saturday Night Live sketch that won't end. Fortunately, 1600 Penn probably will.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com said that the show is \\"what happens when network executives think a screeching buffoon equals laughs\\" and that the jokes elicit responses of \\"mostly tumbleweeds and cricket chirps\\". Paste's Ross Bonaime also criticized the characters and said, \\"please, oh please, make the show actually funny... maybe it should just be put out of its misery.\\" Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger graded the show a \\"D\\" and said, \\"you'd be forgiven for thinking [it] was a relic of the 1980s or 1990s\\", adding that the show was looking for \\"viewers who have lax requirements about actual humor in their comedies.\\" Paul Meekin of Star Pulse noted that the show was unable to escape the footprint of The West Wing and wondered if it was \\"a years-late West Wing parody, a humorous and fresh take on presidential politics, or somewhere in between?\\" answering, \\"it's neither.

Education and personal life Anna Lomax Wood has a Ph.D. in Anthropology from Columbia University, with a concentration on Mediterranean religion and disaster relief. From 1977 until his death in 1992 she was married to Bill Chairetakis, a physicist from Crete, with whom she had a son, Odysseus. In 2003 she married Edmund R. Wood, a businessman. Biography Wood was born Anne Lyttleton Lomax, in New York City on November 20, 1944,John Szwed, Alan Lomax, the Man Who Recorded the World (New York: Penguin, 2011), p. 209. and grew up immersed in the folk music scene, both in New York City and abroad. While still in her teens she assisted her father's recording in the Caribbean. Later she helped him in his Cantometric and other research. While in college, she also worked as an assistant film editor on Lionel Rogosin's film Black Roots (1971) and on four films by independent filmmaker Les Blank. As a folklorist, Wood has researched the folkways of Italian, Greek, and Spanish immigrant communities in the United States. In the wake of the 1980 Irpinia earthquake, she did research on disaster recovery and reconstruction; the local impact of NGO disaster aid; and the impact of rural industrialization programs. She also has worked in children's mental health planning for the Children's Board of Hillsborough County, Florida, and designed mental health ethnographies for the Florida Mental Health Institute of the University of South Florida, where she also taught. Folklore activism In 1975, Wood (then known as Anna Chairetakis) began to work as a public folklore activist with first- and second-generation Italian-Americans in the United States. Along with Carla BiancoCarla Bianco is the author of the highly regarded ethnography, The Two Rosetos (University of Indiana, 1974). and Roberto Leydi, Wood was one of the first researchers to explore the folk repertoires of these communities. She also produced several short films, including, L'Italia Vive Anche in America (Italy Also Lives in America), (New York: RAI-TV, 1975) and In the Footsteps of Columbus (NBC-TV, 1976), nominated for an Emmy Award. In 1979, Wood produced and annotated two LP albums of Calabrian, Sicilian, and other regional Italian music recorded in New York State's Niagara region, New Jersey, and Rhode Island: In Mezz'una Strada Trovai una Pianta di Rosa. Italian Folk Music Collected in New York and New Jersey, Vol. 1: The Trentino, Molise, Campania (Avellino and Salerno), Basilicata (Matera) and Sicily, plus \\"Trallalero\\" from Liguria and Calabria Bella Dove T'hai Lasciate? Italian Folk Music Collected in New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island, Vol. 2: Calabria, both issued on the Global Village label.They were reviewed by Ralf Carriuolo, who called them \\"exemplary\\": see Ethnomusicology: 27: 3 [Sep., 1983]: 570-72. Music from the recordings was used in the (1984) Academy Award-winning documentary, The Stone Carvers. Music from a subsequent (1986) collection of four albums: La Baronessa di Carinini, Chesta e' la vuci ca Canuscite and Cantate con noi, also issued by Global Village, was excerpted for use in the soundtrack of Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather Part III (1990). While doing research in the Campania region of Italy, Wood began to work with Paulo Apolito, a cultural anthropologist at the University of SalernoPaolo Apolito's many books include Lettere al Mago (Liguori, 1980); Apparitions of the Madonna at Oliveto Citra: Local Visions and Cosmic Drama (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1998); and The Internet and the Madonna. Antony Shugaar, translator (University of Chicago Press, 2005). and the late folklorist Giovanni Cioffarelli,See Anna Lomax Wood, \\"Remembering Giovanni Coffarelli: High Priest of Neapolitan Music\\" on the website of the Center for Traditional Music and Dance. arranging to bring over outstanding Italian traditional performers to tour in America under the auspices of the Ethnic Folk Arts Center of New York (now renamed the Center for Traditional Music and Dance) and also to arrange with the Italian government to get funding to compensate the performers for time lost from work. These efforts resulted in a series of three consecutive annual tours of joint performances by Italian-American and South Italian traditional singers produced by the Ethnic Folk Arts Center in 1983, '84, and '85. Concerts were held in New York City and Long Island area; as well as in Lewiston, Binghamton, and Troy, New York; in Newark, New Jersey; in Middleton, Connecticut; in Memphis, Tennessee; and in Little Rock, Arkansas. Performers included artists from Campania, Calabria, Sicily, and Sardinia, singing and playing traditional instruments such as the chitarra battente, the zampogna (bagpipe) and ciaramella (an oboe-like wind instrument) that were little-known among second generation Italian Americans in this country, despite the fact that Italian-American songs had long been available on commercial recordings. During the 1980s Wood continued to present Italian- American artists at Ethnic Folk Arts Center events, at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, and elsewhere, extending her research to the Greek-American community. Two immigrant families of traditional musicians that she worked with received NEA National Heritage Fellowship Awards: Giuseppe and Raffaela DeFranco from Belleville, New Jersey, who perform with the group, Calabria Bella, in 1990 Giuseppe and Raffaela DeFranco: 1990 Lifetime Honors National Heritage Fellowship Recipients. and Greek-American bagpipe player, Nikitas Tsimouris, of Tarpon Springs, Florida, in 1991. Association for Cultural Equity On Alan Lomax's death in 2002, Wood oversaw the cataloging, digitization, and preservation of all Alan Lomax's recordings, manuscripts, correspondence, films, photos, and research made after 1942 for transference to the Library of Congress. Under her direction, ACE collaborates actively with the Library of Congress in keeping Alan's legacy alive.See the \\"Alan Lomax Collection\\" website at the Research Center of the American Folklife Collection at the Library of Congress. In 2005, Rounder issued the 8-CD box- set, Jelly Roll Morton: The Complete Library of Congress Recordings, which included a reissue of Alan Lomax's 1952, book, Mr. Jelly Roll. The set received two Grammy awards: for Best Historical Album (to Anna Lomax Wood and Jeff Greenberg, Executive Producers, and Steve Rosenthal, Sound Engineer) and for Best Album Notes to John Szwed. In 2009, Harte Records issued Alan Lomax in Haiti, a 10-CD box set of Alan Lomax's historic 1936‚Äì37 recordings from a trip undertaken for the Library of Congress, re-mastered and restored from the original aluminum discs.Alan Lomax in Haiti was made with major funding and support from Kimberley Green and the Green Foundation, see \\"This is Haiti\\" a website listing the various Haitian Relief organizations the Green Foundation has partnered with. The set included original 1937 photographs and film footage by Elizabeth Harold Lomax on disc; liner notes by ethnomusicologist Gage Averill; and a book of selections from Alan Lomax's Haitian diary, correspondence, and field notes, edited by Ellen Harold.The original Haitian correspondence papers from Lomax's trip are housed in the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress. See \\"Preserving Haitian Culture\\" (March 2010) on the Wise Guide to the Library of Congress Collections website. In 2011, it garnered two Grammy nominations: for Best Historical Box Set and Best Album Notes. Wood also worked with the Haitian government and the Green Foundation to repatriate the recordings that Alan Lomax made in the 1930s and to transfer a complete set of high grade digital copies of the music and films to the National Archives of Haiti, plus all the documentation and photos. In an interview filmed in Haiti on PBS's program, Need to Know, Wood said, \\"My hope is that this music will be incorporated into school curriculums and that it will be studied respectfully, as classical music is now studied\\".Quoted in an interview in the video Anthony Lapp√© and Laura van Straaten, producers, Haiti's lost music Need to Know PBS, August 30, 2010.

DMDD was added to the DSM-5 as a type of depressive disorder diagnosis for youths. The symptoms of DMDD resemble those of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), anxiety disorders, and childhood bipolar disorder. DMDD first appeared as a disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) in 2013 and is classified as a mood disorder. Treatments include medication to manage mood symptoms as well as individual and family therapy to address emotion-regulation skills. Children with DMDD are at risk for developing depression and anxiety later in life.  Signs and symptoms  Most parents of children with DMDD report that their children first showed signs and symptoms of the disorder during their preschool years. Children with DMDD show severe and recurrent temper outbursts three or more times per week. Although many children have occasional tantrums, youths with DMDD have outbursts that are out of proportion in terms of their intensity or duration. These outbursts can be verbal or behavioral. Verbal outbursts often are described by observers as \\"rages\\", \\"fits\\", or \\"tantrums\\". Children may scream, yell, and cry for excessively long periods of time, sometimes with little provocation. Physical outbursts may be directed toward people or property. Children may throw objects; hit, slap, or bite others; destroy toys or furniture; or otherwise act in a harmful or destructive manner. Children with DMDD also display persistently irritable or angry mood that is observable by others. Parents, teachers, and classmates describe these children as habitually angry, touchy, grouchy, or easily \\"set off\\". Unlike the irritability that can be a symptom of other childhood disorders, such as ODD, anxiety disorders, and major depressive disorder, the irritability displayed by children with DMDD is not episodic or situation-dependent. In DMDD, the irritability or anger is severe and is shown most of the day, nearly every day in multiple settings, lasting for one or more years. The DSM-5 includes several additional diagnostic criteria which describe the duration, setting, and onset of the disorder: the outbursts must be present for at least 12 months and occur in at least two settings (e.g. home and school), and it must be severe in at least one setting. Symptoms appear before the age of 10, and diagnosis must be made between ages 6 and 18. This new diagnosis was implemented to help children who, although may have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, their explosive rages were not being treated properly. = Comorbidity = The core features of DMDD‚Äîtemper outbursts and chronic irritability‚Äîare sometimes seen in children and adolescents with other psychiatric conditions. Differentiating DMDD from these other conditions can be difficult. Three disorders that most closely resemble DMDD are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and bipolar disorder in children. Additionally, in both community and clinical samples DMDD is highly comorbid with internalizing and externalizing disorders, particularly with ODD, and long-term functional outcome is likely poor.  ADHD  ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by problems with inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. Children with DMDD often show several features of hyperactivity and impulsiveness characteristic of ADHD. However, DMDD can be differentiated from ADHD in at least two ways. First, DMDD is a depressive disorder with severe mood components whereas ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder. A salient feature of DMDD is persistently irritable or angry mood. In contrast, children with ADHD do not typically display persistent irritability or anger (although emotional dysregulation is a common symptom). Second, DMDD is characterized by severe, recurrent temper outbursts that are not characteristic of ADHD. Although many children with ADHD act impulsively, they typically do not show so much verbal or physical aggression toward other people or property. Children with ADHD can be diagnosed with DMDD.  ODD ODD is a disruptive behavior disorder characterized by oppositional, defiant, and sometimes hostile actions directed at other people. Like DMDD, ODD emerges in childhood and is often characterized by both irritable mood and angry outbursts. Furthermore, the features of ODD and DMDD are both persistent; children with these disorders usually experience signs and symptoms for months or years. Features of ODD and DMDD also frequently co- occur. Nearly all children with DMDD also meet diagnostic criteria for ODD. However, only about 15% of children with ODD meet diagnostic criteria for DMDD. Some experts believe DMDD is a severe form of ODD in which children's mood problems are the most salient symptom. In DSM-5, children cannot be diagnosed with both disorders. If a child meets criteria for both ODD and DMDD, only DMDD (the more serious disorder) is diagnosed.{APA 2013} Despite their similarity, DMDD can be differentiated from ODD in several ways. First, like ADHD, ODD is a disruptive behavior disorder not a mood disorder. Although children with ODD can show irritability and angry outbursts, their most salient feature is noncompliant and defiant behavior, such as ignoring parents, refusing to do chores, or acting in a spiteful or resentful manner. Second, children with ODD direct their oppositionality and defiance toward specific people. For example, a child with ODD may act defiantly toward their mother, but be compliant with their father. In contrast, children with DMDD direct their anger and physical aggression toward most people and also objects. For example, a child with DMDD may have tantrums with both parents, show irritability with teachers and classmates, and break objects when upset. Third, DMDD and ODD differ in the duration and severity of children's outbursts. Whereas a child with ODD may ignore parents' requests or stubbornly refuse to comply with their commands, a child with DMDD might yell, scream, or hit their parents to express anger. The outbursts of children with DMDD often appear with little provocation and last much longer than expected. Finally, children with DMDD show different developmental outcomes than youths with ODD. Whereas youths with ODD are often at risk for developing more serious conduct problems, youths with DMDD are at greater risk for anxiety and depression in later childhood and adolescence. Bipolar disorder One of the main differences between DMDD and bipolar disorder is that the irritability and anger outbursts associated with DMDD are not episodic; symptoms of DMDD are chronic and displayed constantly on an almost daily basis. On the other hand, bipolar disorder is characterized by distinct manic or hypomanic episodes usually lasting a few days, or a few weeks at most, that parents should be able to differentiate from their child's typical mood and behavior in between episodes. The DSM precludes a dual diagnosis of DMDD and bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder alone should be used for youths who show classic symptoms of episodic mania or hypomania. Prior to adolescence, DMDD is much more common than bipolar disorder. Most children with DMDD see a decrease in symptoms as they enter adulthood, whereas individuals with bipolar disorder typically display symptoms for the first time as teenagers and young adults. Children with DMDD are more at risk for developing major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder when they're older rather than bipolar disorder.  Causes  The causes of DMDD are poorly understood. Youth with DMDD have difficulty attending, processing, and responding to negative emotional stimuli and social experiences in their everyday lives. For example, some studies have shown youths with DMDD to have problems interpreting the social cues and emotional expressions of others. These youths may be especially bad at judging others' negative emotional displays, such as feelings of sadness, fearfulness, and anger. Functional MRI studies suggest that under-activity of the amygdala, the brain area that plays a role in the interpretation and expression of emotions and novel stimuli, is associated with these deficits. Deficits in interpreting social cues may predispose children to instances of anger and aggression in social settings with little provocation. For examples, youths with DMDD may selectively attend to negative social cues (e.g., others scowling, teasing) and minimize all other information about the social events. They may also misinterpret the emotional displays of others, believing others' benign actions to be hostile or threatening. Consequently, they may be more likely than their peers to act in impulsive and angry ways. Children with DMDD may also have difficulty regulating negative emotions once they are elicited. To study these problems with emotion regulation, researchers asked children with DMDD to play computer games that are rigged so that children will lose. While playing these games, children with DMDD report more agitation and negative emotional arousal than their typically-developing peers. Furthermore, youths with DMDD showed markedly greater activity in the medial frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex compared to other youths. These brain regions are important because they are involved in evaluating and processing negative emotions, monitoring one's own emotional state, and selecting an effective response when upset, angry, or frustrated. Altogether, these findings suggest that youths with DMDD are more strongly influenced by negative events than other youths. They may become more upset and select less effective and socially acceptable ways to deal with negative emotions when they arise. Another study predicted that 6 year olds with DMDD at the age of 9 years would have greater functional impairment, peer problems and educational support service, after controlling for all psychiatric disorders at the age of 6 years.  Treatment  = Medication = Evidence for treatment is weak, and treatment is determined based on the physician's response to the symptoms that people with DMDD present. Because the mood stabilizing medication, lithium, is effective in treating adults with bipolar disorder, some physicians have used it to treat DMDD although it has not been shown to be better than placebo in alleviating the signs and symptoms of DMDD. DMDD is treated with a combination of medications that target the child's symptom presentation. For youths with DMDD alone, antidepressant medication is sometimes used to treat underlying problems with irritability or sadness. For youths with unusually strong temper outbursts, an atypical antipsychotic medication, such as risperidone, may be warranted. Both medications, however, are associated with significant side effects in children. Finally, for children with both DMDD and ADHD, stimulant medication is sometimes used to reduce symptoms of impulsivity. Recently, the use of mood stabilizers, such as Trileptal, have been used in combination with the medication Amantadine. A clinic in Austin, Texas has reported an 85% success rate in treatment for children with DMDD who have followed the protocol as prescribed. = Psychosocial = Several cognitive-behavioral interventions have been developed to help youths with chronic irritability and temper outbursts. Because many youths with DMDD show problems with ADHD and oppositional-defiant behavior, experts initially tried to treat these children using contingency management. This type of intervention involves teaching parents to reinforce children's appropriate behavior and extinguish (usually through systematic ignoring or time out) inappropriate behavior. Although contingency management can be helpful for ADHD and ODD symptoms, it does not seem to reduce the most salient features of DMDD, namely, irritability and anger.  Prognosis  Little is known about the course of DMDD. The chronic irritability and angry outbursts that characterize DMDD often last through early adolescence if left untreated, although well-designed prospective longitudinal studies are lacking. In terms of prolonged effects of DMDD and issues in adulthood, participants in a longitudinal study that exhibited a history of DMDD were more likely than their counterparts to come from impoverished families and single-parent homes. Additionally, participants with a childhood DMDD diagnosis were more likely to develop depressive or anxiety disorders as adults; had higher rates of poor health outcomes such as STD transmission, illness, and smoking; were more likely to engage in illegal or risky behaviors as well as be convicted of felony charges; and were more likely to be impoverished. DMDD at the age of 6 years also predicted current and lifetime depressive disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at the age of 9 years, after controlling for all age 6 years psychiatric disorders.  Epidemiology  There are not good estimates of the prevalence of DMDD as of 2015, but primary studies have found a rate of 0.8 to 3.3%. Epidemiological studies show that approximately 3.2% of children in the community have chronic problems with irritability and temper, the essential features of DMDD. These problems are probably more common among clinic- referred youths. Parents report that approximately 30% of children hospitalized for psychiatric problems meet diagnostic criteria for DMDD; 15% meet criteria based on the observations of hospital staff.  History  Beginning in the 1990s, some clinicians began observing children with hyperactivity, irritability, and severe temper outbursts. These symptoms greatly interfered with their lives at home, school, and with friends. Because other diagnoses, like ADHD and ODD, did not capture the severity of children's irritability and anger, many of these children were diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Longitudinal studies showed that children with chronic irritability and temper outbursts often developed later problems with anxiety and depression, and rarely developed bipolar disorder in adolescence or adulthood.Blader JC, Carlson GA: Increased rates of bipolar disorder diagnoses among U.S. child, adolescent, and adult inpatients, 1996‚Äì2004. Biological Psychiatry 62(2):107‚Äì114, 2007 17306773 Consequently, the developers of DSM-5 created a new diagnostic label, DMDD, to describe children with persistent irritability and angry outbursts. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) added DMDD to the DSM-5 and classified it as a depressive disorder.

The artefacts uncovered by archaeologists at St James' Square and Wyebridge Street included charcoal, flints, and bone fragments. The discovery has led to the conclusion that the site of Monmouth, adjoining the confluence of the rivers Monnow and Wye in south east Wales, was inhabited thousands of years earlier than previously believed. Background The earliest known settlement in Monmouth prior to the most recent find was about 2,500 years old. The excavations that took place in 2010 during the course of gas main replacement work at St James' Square and Wyebridge Street drew the attention of local archaeologists. The sites included the former riverbanks of the River Wye before its change in course. It initially ran along what is now St James' Street. Monmouth archaeologists, including Jane Bray and Stephen Clarke, had watched the excavation work closely and were intermittently evaluating the trenches. While monitoring the excavation process, Clarke, chairman of the Monmouth Archaeological Society, noticed a fleck of charcoal. It was in ancient sands, below thousands of years of Roman remains and river pebbles. The charcoal alerted the archaeologists to the possibility of additional significant findings. Findings The artefacts that the Monmouth archaeologists discovered were flint tools and bone fragments, in addition to charcoal. Archaeologist Clarke notified Elizabeth Walker, curator of Paleolithic and Mesolithic Archaeology at the National Museum Wales in Cardiff. She indicated that the flints were from the Mesolithic era. The curator initially estimated that they were about 6,500 to 7,500 years old. They included microliths, both flint arrow points and flint harpoon barbs that would have been attached to wood or antler. The microliths were used for fishing or hunting. Another artefact that was retrieved was a scraper that could have been used to clean animal skins or scrape bark and small branches. In addition to the stone tools, waste pieces of flint from the production of tools were found. Conclusions Examples of stone tools including Mesolithic microliths The archaeologists concluded that there was human settlement in Monmouth thousands of years earlier than formerly thought. The findings revealed that the River Wye supported a camp of settlers during the Mesolithic era of the Stone Age, the Middle Stone Age. Elizabeth Walker, the curator at the National Museum of Wales, initially suggested in October 2010 that the artefacts were consistent with hunter-gatherers utilizing the river for food and transport about 7,000 years ago. However, Walker examined and dated the artefacts and apparently revised her analysis following formal evaluation; in an article from November 2010, Monmouth archaeologist Stephen Clarke announced that the finds dated back to about 10,000 years ago. Walker indicated that the settlers were nomadic, speculating that they resided near the river in the winter and perhaps hunted in the hills during the summer. However, historian and author Jeremy Knight, chairman of the Monmouthshire Antiquarian Association, had a slightly different take on the migratory nature of the Mesolithic settlers. He indicated that there were few known Mesolithic sites, and all of those on the coast. The nomads spent their summers on the coast and migrated inland for the winter. Therefore, the Monmouth site represented the first known inland site, the half of nomads' lives spent during the winter months. Walker indicated that after the Ice Age, with improvement of the climate, plants, including trees, had returned. People had also returned to the British Isles, following the game that sought out plant food. She indicated that the settlers also relied on fish for their diet. While findings of the type discovered in Monmouth had been found previously in Monmouthshire, none had been located next to the river. Temporary, nomadic settlements of the era were generally thought to be about 25 meters in width. The discovery of the flints at two sites, St James' Square and Wyebridge Street, indicated that either the settlement was very large or there were two separate Stone Age camps. Radiocarbon dating of the charcoal was planned through the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, a collaborative facility owned by both the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow. In addition, it was anticipated that Wales & West Utilities, one of the largest gas pipeline companies in the British Isles, would fund the dating as well as the geological examination of the excavation site.

Early life Child was born on February 2, 1869, in Ypsilanti, Michigan, to Charles Chauncy Child and Mary Elizabeth (n√©e Manning) Child. He was the only surviving child to the couple. Growing up on a family farm in Higganum, Connecticut, Child enjoyed reading. After graduating from elementary school in 1882, Child attended Middletown High School in Middletown, Connecticut, until his graduation in 1886. Career Child was accepted to Wesleyan University in Middletown. In 1890 he graduated Wesleyan with a Bachelor of Philosophy and in 1892 he received a Master of Science degree from the same university, having served as a graduate assistant in biology at Wesleyan from 1890 to 1892. Working under Rudolf Leuckart at the University of Leipzig, Child graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy in 1894. Upon returning to the United States, he met Lydia Van Meter in 1895, and the couple married in 1899; they had one daughter, Jeannette Manning Child. He spent the majority of his academic career (1895‚Äì1934) at the University of Chicago, where he conducted research on regeneration, especially on Coelenterates and flatworms. In 1915, Child published Individuality in Organisms, which dealt primarily with \\"the problem of the nature, of the unity, and order in the organism\\", according to an American Social Hygiene Association review. He became a professor a year later, a position he held until his retirement in 1937. Wesleyan awarded Child the honorary D.D. degree in 1928 and also began a two-year stint as the first (Managing) Editor of the scientific journal Physiological and Biochemical Zoology. He became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1935. After retiring, Child and his wife moved to Palo Alto, California, in 1939, where he lectured at Stanford University. In 1941 Child published Patterns and Problems of Development, which summarized his life work. After having multiple surgeries due to cancer, Child died on December 19, 1954, in Palo Alto; he was cremated, and the ashes were sent to the Van Meter plot in Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore, Maryland.

College of Bablake The church was founded in 1344 by Isabella of France, who granted the guild of St John a piece of land called \\"Babbelak\\" for the construction of a chapel in honour of God and St John the Baptist. This was to be used for their own services, but included a chantry of two priests to sing daily Mass for the royal family. The eastern part was ready for consecration on 2 May 1350. In 1393 the number of priests was raised to nine. In the early part of the 16th century this was raised to twelve. The church was built as a guild chapel and through various enlargements and endowments was raised to collegiate status. It remained a guild chapel until all the religious guilds were dissolved in 1548. A wall was discovered in 1875 running north and south through the middle of the chancel, which is thought to have been the east wall of the first guild chapel, while bases of two piers, near the eastern tower were thought by Sir Gilbert Scott to belong to the same early chapel which was dedicated on 6 May 1350. In 1648, the church was desecrated and used as a prison for Scots soldiers taken at the battle of Preston. The college was dissolved in 1548; the priests were pensioned in sums varying from ¬£5 6s. 8d. to ¬£2 13s. 4d.

Ozone in the troposphere is primarily produced through the photolysis of nitrogen dioxide by photons with wavelengths (Œª) less than 420 nanometers, which are able to reach the lowest levels of the atmosphere, through the following mechanism: This series of reactions creates a null cycle, in which there is no net production or loss of any species involved. Since O (3P) is very reactive and O2 is abundant, O (3P) can be assumed to be in steady state, and thus an equation linking the concentrations of the species involved can be derived: : [\\\\ce{O3}]=\\\\frac{J_1[\\\\ce{NO2}]}{k_3[\\\\ce{NO}]} The Leighton relationship above shows how production of ozone is directly related to the solar intensity, and hence to the zenith angle, due to the reliance on photolysis of NO2. The yield of ozone will therefore be greatest during the day, especially at noon and during the summer season. This relationship also demonstrates how high concentrations of both ozone and nitric oxide are unfeasible. However, NO can react with peroxyl radicals to produce NO2 without loss of ozone: : RO2 \\\\+ NO ‚Üí NO2 \\\\+ RO thus providing another pathway to allow for the buildup of ozone by breaking the above null cycle. This relationship is named after Philip Leighton, author of the groundbreaking 1961 book Photochemistry of Air Pollution, as recognition of his contributions in the understanding of tropospheric chemistry. Computer models of atmospheric chemistry utilize the Leighton relationship to minimize complexity by deducing the concentration of one of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and nitric oxide when the concentrations of the other two are known.

The report states that the main sources of outdoor air pollution in Serbia include the energy sector (thermal power plants, district heating plants and individual household heating), the transport sector, waste dump sites and industrial activities, such as the petrochemical industry complex in Panƒçevo and Novi Sad; cement factories in Popovac, Kosjeriƒá and Beoƒçin; chemical plants and metallurgical complexes in Smederevo, Sevojno and Bor; thermal power plants in Obrenovac, Lazarevac and Kostolac. Other documented sources of air pollution include fossil fuel-based individual household heating in periurban and rural towns and increasing road traffic, especially in large cities such as Belgrade, Novi Sad and Ni≈°. In January 2020, hundreds of people, some wearing surgical masks and respirators, attended a protest in Belgrade, demanding the government tackle severe air pollution. In March, the Air Visual API website ranked Belgrade temporarily at the top of its global index of cities with the worst air pollution.  Small Hydropower Plants  Around 100 small hydropower plants have been built in Serbia, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The state power company offers strong incentives and commits to buying electricity generated by the plants at a price 50 percent higher than the market rate. Helped by environmental activists, villagers in Rakita have removed pipes installed to serve a new hydroelectric power plant on the Rakitska river.  Deforestation  According to Global Forest Watch, Serbia lost 52.8kha of tree cover from 2001 to 2019, equivalent to a 1.9% decrease in tree cover since 2000. TPP Nikola Tesla in Obrenovac.

It is currently closed to the public but reopening is planned. History The Kingston Marine Museum was incorporated by letters patent on August 29, 1975 with objectives to collect, conserve and display artifacts related to Great Lakes marine history, shipping and shipbuilding, construct an exhibition area for special exhibitions of both marine and non- marine character, encourage public participation in events and activities, develop a marine resource centre of archival material, books, publications, ephemera and items to permit research activity related to Great Lakes marine history by the public, students, researchers and historians and to develop educational programmes. The museum was originally located in the 1892 Kingston Dry Dock, a national historic site in Kingston, Ontario, Canada,. It should not be mistaken for Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard, which was a British naval base and home of the then Provincial Marine. Once an important construction and repair facility for ships on the Great Lakes, the Kingston Dry Dock was constructed in 1890 by the Canadian federal government in what had been the local riding of Canadian prime minister Sir John A. Macdonald. Opened in 1892 by the Department of Public Works as a repair facility for lake vessels,Kingston Dry Dock, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada the drydock provided dry working access to the ship below the waterline. MacDonald would live long enough to see the $344,276 project targeted with allegations of political patronage after the March 5, 1891 Canadian election. As he suffered a series of strokes in 1891, one of which proved fatal on June 6 of that year, he would never have the opportunity to see the facility open and in operation. The original 85.3 metre limestone dry dock was lengthened to 115.2 metres using concrete and leased in 1910 to the Kingston Shipbuilding Company; private companies would operate the Kingston Shipyards until 1968. During the Second World War naval vessels, notably corvettes, were built in this dry dock. The site consists of a solid limestone 1891 main building which houses the drydock pumps and engines, an annex building added in 1915 and a smaller free-standing building added in 1938. The shipyard's distinctive square stone chimney stands 90 feet above the downtown city waterfront. Facilities and Collections The Museum consists of seven galleries. The temporary gallery features changing exhibits (such as a Kingston Warships 1812‚Äì1814 exhibit for the War of 1812 bicentennial). The six permanent galleries include the Donald Page gallery which examines several stories including the Age of Sail on the Great Lakes, life as a sailor and changing ship technology. This room used to be the Air Compressor and Tool room of the shipyards. The newest gallery, the Eco gallery, explores issues such as pollution, water diversion and conservation, invasive species and sustainable development as they relate to the Great Lakes. The Shipwreck Gallery leads from the early days of wooden ship building through to the construction of modern \\"Lakers\\". This room used to be the shipyard's Dynamo room. The Calvin Gallery covers Garden Island, where the Calvin family ran a shipbuilding and logging business and includes stories from Kingston's maritime past. This used to be the shipyard's boiler room. The Pump Room explores the complexity of operating a shipbuilding dry dock. The pumps and engines in this room were used to drain the dry dock and move the dock's caisson gate. served as an on-site museum ship until 2016 The Kingston Drydock buildings were converted into a year-round museum in the 1970s; Canadian retired Coast Guard ship was decommissioned in 1985 and added to the site in 1986 as a museum ship. Displays cover Great Lakes shipping since 1678; artifacts and exhibits include ship's models and engines, relics and instruments of lake vessels under both sail and steam, the drydock pumps and engine room of the original factory, glass and china salvaged from Great Lakes shipwrecks, ship's bells, anchors, binnacles, navigational instruments and equipment, a gallery of artistic paintings about the sea and the history of the Calvin and Son shipyard which once employed 700 workers misidentifies Garden Island as \\"Green Island\\". on Garden Island. The museum has photographed historic shipwrecks at risk of being hidden by encrustations of zebra mussels which infested the Great Lakes in the 1990s. Archaeological exhibits commemorating the War of 1812 on the Great Lakes were added for that war's bicentennial. Publications of the museum include \\"FreshWater\\", a journal of Great Lakes marine history, a \\"Jib Gems\\" museum newsletter and several books on local marine history. Extensive archives and collections are maintained with the assistance of Queen's University, documenting 19th and 20th century Canadian Great Lakes marine heritage and ships and shipping from vessel design and construction through a ship's working life to shipwreck or retirement. Relocation The museum future was clouded by the 2016 federal government decision to sell the property and resulting new landlord Patry Inc. requiring the museum to vacate the facility to allow for residential re-development. The museum galleries closed and the collections were moved into storage until the museum could find a new property to reopen to the public. The marine museum office was moved to 53 Yonge Street. Since the closure of the museum, the Alexander Henry was stored elsewhere and finally transferred to Lakehead Transportation Museum in Thunder Bay, Ontario. In 2019 the museum received a donation from an unknown source, and repurchased the property after the re- developer could not come to agreement with the city on a residential high- rise. The museum plans to reopen after refurbishment and renovation.

Located a half-mile south of Hydro, Oklahoma and operated by Lucille Hamons from 1941 until her death on August 18, 2000, the site was added to the US National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Lucille Hamons' generous assistance to motorists on U.S. Route 66 during hard economic times at the end of the Great Depression would make her a US Route 66 legend, earning the nickname \\"Mother of the Mother Road.\\"  History  Opened by Carl Ditmore in 1929, this is one of the few remaining examples of a two-story fuel station with the owner's residence situated above the pumps on an upper floor. W.O. and Ida Waldroup changed the name to Provine Service Station after buying the station in 1934 and would later add tourist cabins to provide five motel rooms on-site. Lucille and Carl Hamons acquired the Provine Station in 1941, a few months before the US entry into World War II. Mobilisation for war brought wartime rationing of fuel and tires, causing civilian traffic on the highway to decline. Carl Hamons worked as an independent trucker, leaving Lucille to operate the station and the motel. Traffic on US 66 would then increase substantially during the 1950s and 1960s, only to vanish with the completion of Interstate 40 in the area in 1971. After the highway was bypassed, the motel closed and Carl and Lucille would divorce but Lucille's would continue to serve a largely local clientele. The station became known for vending very cold beer from its old cooler at a time when nearby Weatherford, Oklahoma (home of Southwestern Oklahoma State University) was officially a dry town. The last fuel was dispensed in 1986 and the station ultimately became a souvenir shop, with demand in the 1990s driven largely by nostalgia surrounding a road which by then had become not merely a decommissioned highway but a powerful symbol of a bygone era. The original \\"Hamons Court\\" motel sign was donated by the Hamons family in 2003 to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, where it is now displayed as part of an exhibition on \\"America on the Move\\".

Since, at any given time, the number of chemical plants is insufficient to use in a preliminary or predesign estimate, cost indexes are handy for a series of management purposes, like long-range planning, budgeting and escalating or de- escalating contract costs.Pintelon, L. & Puyvelde, F. V., 1997. Estimating Plant Construction Costs. Chemical Engineering, August, pp. 98-104 A cost index is the ratio of the actual price in a time period compared to that in a selected base period (a defined point in time or the average price in a certain year), multiplied by 100. Raw materials, products and energy prices, labor and construction costs change at different rates, and plant construction cost indexes are actually a composite, able to compare generic chemical plants capital costs. Calculations methods Although the available indexes are compiled in several ways, they are defined to encompass a specific set of conditions and items. Prices for these items can be obtained either through company‚Äôs purchasing department data or through published indexes, like those published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).Humphreys, K. K., 2005. Project and Cost Engineers' Handbook. 4th ed. s.l.:Marcel Dekker Both the CE and the IC indexes, from Chemical Engineering and Intratec, respectively, employs BLS‚Äô data. The weighting of such factors, which is defined by the realized degree of importance of each component in the specific index (or sub- index), aims to represent the costs variations typically found for chemical plants. Using a cost index To update an item cost (equipment, projects) from period A to period B, is necessary to multiply period A‚Äôs cost by the ratio of period B‚Äôs index over period A‚Äôs index, according to the following equation: \\\\text{Cost at B} = \\\\text{Cost at A}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\text{index at B }}{\\\\text{index at A }} As a rule-of-thumb, cost indexes permit fairly accurate estimates for cost escalation if the difference between period A and period B is less than 10 years. Differences between the actual equipment and labor prices and those predicted by the index tend to grow over the years, surpassing the typical error verified in budget-level estimates.Peters, M., Timmerhaus, K. & West, R., 2004. Plant Design and Economics for Chemical Engineers. 5th ed. s.l.:McGraw-HillVatavuk, W. M., 2002. Updating the CE Plant Cost Index. Chemical Engineering, January, pp. 62-70 Cost indexes in engineering The selection of the proper index to use depends on the industry in which it is applied. For example, while CE, M&S; or IC Index are typically employed for chemical process industries, the ENR (Engineering News-Record) construction index is used for general industrial construction and takes in account the prices for fixed amounts of structural steel, cement, lumber and labor. The majority of cost indexes demonstrate a time lag, due to data collection and its compilation for publishing. As stated before, some indexes use information published by other organizations and a delay in data may be verified (like those provide by the BLS). Exceptions to this are the ENR construction and the IC indexes, which present relatively current values. The main indexes available for process industries include: * Chemical Engineering Index, CE: composed of 4 major components ‚Äì equipment, construction labor, buildings, and engineering and supervision ‚Äì the index is employed primary as a process plant construction index, was established using a base period of 1957-1959 as 100. The CE Index is updated monthly and it lags in time by about 3 months. The CE Index was revised in 1982, to account for changes in labor productivity and, again, in 2002.Couper, J. R., 2003. Process Engineering Economics. s.l.:Marcel Dekker Published in each issue of Chemical Engineering.Albright, L.. 2008. Albright's Chemical Engineering Handbook. s.l.:CRC-Presshttp://www.chemengonline.com/pci/ * Marshall and Swift Cost Index, M&S; (originally known as Marshall and Stevens Index): a composite of two major components - process-industry equipment average and all-industry equipment average - was established in 1926 with a value of 100. Some industries considered in the process-industry equipment average are chemicals, petroleum products, rubber and paper. The all-industry average encompasses 47 different types of industrial, commercial and housing equipment. Published monthly in each issue of Chemical Engineering until April 2012.http://www.equipment-cost-index.com/ * Intratec Chemical Plant Construction Index, IC: a process plant construction index developed by Intratec, a chemical consulting company. Although cost indexes do not usually forecast future escalation, the IC Index stands out for presenting a smaller delay between release date and index date, besides a 12 months forecast. On the other hand, the index is only available from January 2000 (with a value of 100). A sample is available at Intratec‚Äôs website.http://www.intratec.us/ic * Nelson-Farrar Indexes, NF (originally known as the Nelson Refinery Construction Indexes): established in 1946 with a value of 100, the index is more suitable for petroleum or petrochemical business. Published once a month in the Oil and Gas Journal. Cost Indexes for different locations The standard indexes available are usually restricted to a particular region, as in the case of NF Index, which is accurate only to the region of the US Gulf coast (USGC). Likewise most of the data available for plant and equipment costs are mostly either in # US Gulf Coast Basis (USGC) # Northwest Europe Basis (NWE) Hence the Index values cannot be used to get accurate results in other regions of the world. This variation might be due various factors such as * Cost and availability of materials * Cost and availability of labor * Cost of transportation of equipment and labor * Import duties and local taxes * Currency exchange rates Of all these factors currency exchange rates is said to have the greatest impact in the variation of results. Cost indexes for international locations is published in \\"Process Engineering\\" journal as well as in the \\"International Journal of Production Economics\\" (formerly \\"Engineering Costs and Production Economics\\"). As of 2012 \\"Process Engineering\\" has not been publishing new indexes viewable by full access from EbscoHost. They mentioned in May/June 2012 that their analyst had fallen sick. Location Factor In order to be able to use the available standard indexes to locations where index data is not available we have to incorporate a new term called the Location Factor (LF) to the standard index value. It is a dimensionless value for a particular location relative to either of the above- mentioned basis. Cost in A = Cost in USGC x LF(A) where A is the location for which cost is being evaluated and LF(A) is the location factor for the location A relative to USGC Location factors are greatly influenced by currency exchange rates due to their significant effect on Index value and hence vary drastically with time. Over the past couple of decades the location factors for various locations are trending close to the value 1. However location factor for a particular region within a country can be easily determined by adding 10% to the index of the reference location for every 1000 miles. The reference location is usually a major industrial location closest to the location where the index is being determined. Location factors for various locations have been published and updated in various journals as in Aspen Richardson's \\"International Construction Cost Factor Location Manual (2003)\\".

History US Route 66 was designated in 1927; by 1929 Kansas and Illinois were the first to completely pave their respective segments of this highway. Little's Service Station installed its fuel pumps on the former site of the Banks Hotel (demolished 1933) at 119 North Main Street in Galena; an automobile repair shop was added later. Before Interstate 44 opened in the area in 1961, bypassing Kansas entirely, US Route 66 in Kansas was a vibrant part of the \\"Mother Road\\" which led from Chicago, Illinois to Santa Monica, California. In 1979, US 66 in Galena was taken off its former Main Street alignment (which came in from Missouri as Front Street, turned south on Main Street, then followed the current K-66 route to Riverton) and routed directly onto 7th Street, bypassing the station. US 66 would become Kansas State Route 66 in 1985, but the station sat vacant, closed and largely abandoned until its 2007 restoration. = Restoration = The Kan-O-Tex Service Station bears the branding of the former Kanotex Refining Company (1909-1953), a now-defunct regional fuel brand named for Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. The Kan-O-Tex logo was a Kansas sunflower behind a five-point star. The station is home to a 1951 International boom truck on which Pixar's animated character Tow Mater was based; Joe Ranft, a Pixar animator, discovered it during a research trip for the movie Cars. In April 2011, a Disney/Pixar crew returned to interview the station's owners for a DVD release of Cars 2. As the \\"Mater\\" name is a Disney trademark, the original truck has been named \\"Tater.\\" The station was restored in 2007 and renamed 4 Women on the Route. Following an ownership change and the death of one of the founders of 4 Women on the Route, it was renamed again, becoming Cars on the Route, to emphasize its connection with Cars. Located seven blocks north of the current (7th Street) Kansas Route 66, the station retains the original aesthetic design of the fuel pumps and exterior fa√ßade but places a diner-style lunch counter in what once would have been the service bay of the station's repair garage.

While the initial market was Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, Meyer Brothers Gas Station & General Store in Orchard Farm, Missouri sold Kan-O-Tex fuel in the late 1920s; by 1930, Kan-O- Tex products were advertised locally in St. Joseph, Missouri by the Home Oil and Gas Corporation, a chain of nineteen filling stations. The Kan-O-Tex brand and reporting mark were acquired by the now-defunct Anderson-Prichard Oil Corporation of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in October 1953 and are no longer in use. One Kan-O-Tex Service Station, the former Little's Service Station on U.S. Route 66 in Galena, Kansas, was restored in 2007 as a diner and souvenir shop as part of wider efforts to rebuild and market the historic U.S. Route 66 as a tourism destination.

He was first lieutenant on HMS Montagu at the Glorious First of June and assumed command after the death of Captain James Montagu. Promoted to post captain in June 1795, Donnelly was given in which he participated in the Action of 12 May 1796. Early life Ross Donnelly was born in 1764, son of Francis Donnelly of Athlone, County Roscommon. Career He joined the Royal Navy in the 1770s and served off the Eastern Seaboard of North America during the American War of Independence, seeing action at the Siege of Charleston. He was subsequently transferred to Newfoundland and, as a lieutenant, given command of the sloop HMS Morning Star for the remainder of the war. During the peace of 1783 to 1793, Donnelly joined the fleet of the Honourable East India Company, serving as a mate before rejoining the Navy at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Donnelly was assigned to the 74 gun ship of the line HMS Montagu under Captain James Montagu and served in the Channel Fleet, joining the fleet under Lord Howe that participated in the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 and fought at the Glorious First of June. Montagu was heavily engaged with the French ship Neptune and Captain Montagu was killed in the early stages, command devolving on Donnelly. Donnelly commanded the ship with skill and was commended, but due to his rank was denied the rewards that went to the victorious captains. In June 1795, Donnelly was promoted to post captain and took command of the frigate HMS Pegasus, serving with the North Sea Fleet and participating in the Action of 12 May 1796 off the Dutch coast.Donnelly, Sir Ross, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton and Andrew Lambert, (subscription required), Retrieved 10 May 2012 Donnelly later took command of HMS Maidstone and in 1801 escorted a convoy from Porto to Britain before taking command of the frigate HMS Narcissus and charged with returning the ambassador to Algeria before carrying out astronomical observations in the Aegean Sea. From there he joined the Mediterranean Fleet where Admiral Lord Nelson would later hold him in high esteem, commending him in letters and placing several of his proteges under Donnelly's command. In 1805 he accompanied the expeditionary force which invaded the Cape of Good Hope and the Rio de la Plata, where he was commended and rewarded on his return to Britain with command of the ship of the line HMS Ardent which he brought back to South America and continued serving in the campaign until its conclusion in 1807. In 1808, he took command of HMS Invincible, but was forced into early retirement in 1810 due to cataracts. His eyesight slowly recovered over the next two years, and at the end of the war he was on the verge of commissioning the new ship of the line HMS Devonshire. Retirement and health Postwar, Donnelly retired, although he remained in service and received steady promotions, becoming a full admiral in 1838. A year earlier he had been rewarded for his long service with a knighthood, becoming a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. In November 1839, Donnelly suffered from heart trouble, followed by rapid decline in his mental health that within months became advanced dementia. By July 1840, a lunacy commission was held to inquire into the admiral's state of mind, which heard from witnesses who testified that Donnelly was forgetful, confused, and prone to fits of abuse directed at his staff, several of whom he dismissed only to mistake them for new servants when they returned. His doctor testified that of historical matters, including his naval exploits, Donnelly spoke with great accuracy. When asked the month, Donnelly himself correctly stated it was July, but when pressed to state whether July was in winter or summer, he retorted that the season depended on whether one was in the southern or northern hemisphere, causing much laughter. Donnelly became confused when asked about the number of children he had who were still living. He chastised some of his daughters, but praised his son, a solicitor in Sydney, whom he wanted to manage his estate. The commission declared him of unsound mind since 15 November 1839. He died on 30 September 1840 at his home at 30, Harley Street, London. He is buried in the overgrown north-west quadrant of the inner circle at Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Family He was married and had eight children, six of whom survived to adulthood. His eldest daughter, Anne Jane (died 1855), married, on 18 April 1816, George Thicknesse-Touchet, 20th Baron Audley, and had issue.

The current building was built in 1882. In 1895 the brewery was bought by Julius Lehrkind, whose descendants still operate beverage businesses in Bozeman.  Description  The current building was constructed from 1882 to 1883 with brick in a Victorian Italianate architecture style for Jacob Spieth and Charles Krug, brewers who had immigrated to America from Germany. The 1867 structure burned down and was rebuilt in 1882. It had a similar architectural style at its corners but was frame instead of brick. The building is built over Bozeman Creek, which runs through downtown Bozeman. The waterway, particularly its rural portion, is also known as Sourdough Creek. The creek water was used for brewing and refrigeration. The upper floor has served as a dance hall. Daniel Maxey was the brewery manager in the early 1890s. In 1945 the Bozeman Trades and Labor Council remodeled the second floor, which became known as Union Hall. In 1983 the ground floor of the brewery building became the site of \\"John Bozeman's Bistro\\" for many years until the restaurant moved to a different building on West Main Street.  History  Jacob Friedrich Spieth was born on April 10, 1833, in Hegensberg near Esslingen, W√ºrttemberg, and died in Montana. He arrived in America on October 6, 1854, aboard the Eliza Challory. He spent some time on farms in Ohio and Illinois and moved to Alder Gulch, Montana, in 1863, where he began mining gold. Spieth also farmed and raised livestock. He moved to several Montana gold mining camps, where he met Charles Krug. The brewery business grew steadily for at least 20 years. Barbara A. Shock/Schok (1844‚Äì1931) married Spieth on July 10, 1871, in Hudson City, New York. They had four sons and one daughter. Spieth committed suicide using strychnine on April 10, 1892. Hellinger & Hansen bought the business and then sold it to Julius Lehrkind. Charles Krug was born in Germany in 1844 and came to America in 1856, originally settling in Missouri. He moved to Virginia City, Montana, in 1864 and began mining gold. Charles Krug died May 7, 1888. Upon Krug's death, Spieth inherited Krug's share of the brewery and saloon business. Spieth died almost exactly four years later in 1892. Both of them died intestate, leaving no will, and both men's estates were considered insolvent. In 1888, Anne Ryan had obtained a $9,000 judgement against the partnership, and when the judgement had not been paid by the time Spieth died, filed suit against the administrator of Krug's estate and Barbara Spieth, the administrator of Spieth's estate, claiming that the Spieths had conspired to give Barbara all of the business' assets in order to defraud its creditors‚Äîbut also claiming this alleged conspiracy began two years before Krug's death. The estate administrators objected to the lawsuit, seeking dismissal. The suit was dismissed by the local court, essentially because it was so poorly drafted, but also because Ryan had not exhausted her legal remedies. On appeal in 1896, the Montana Supreme Court agreed that the complaint was \\"uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible\\", also noted that the attorney who had drafted it had since been disbarred for \\"dishonorable and unprofessional conduct\\". The Court also found that although Ryan had not attempted to execute judgement on the Krug and Spieth estates, it was because she knew there were no assets, so an action to execute judgement would be useless. Noting the legal maxim that the law does not require a meaningless act, and finding that there were issues of equity involved, the state Supreme Court found that Ryan did have adequate grounds for the suit to be filed, no matter how poorly the initial documents had been drafted. Sympathetic to Ryan and her new attorney, the Court issued an unusual decision: the justices upheld most of the reasons for the trial court's dismissal, but also created a remedy for Ryan's alleged wrong: they remanded the case back to the lower court and did not fully affirm the dismissal; the law contained a possibility to allow the complaint to be amended to remove the objectionable sections, and so the District Court was instructed to give Ryan's new attorney 30 days to amend the complaint and re- file it so that the case could go forward, but if the new attorney did not properly amend the complaint, then the dismissal would be affirmed.  Lehrkind purchase  While the brewery was having legal woes, Julius Lehrkind, a German immigrant who spent the previous 26 years running a brewery in Davenport, Iowa, moved to Bozeman in 1895, bought the Spieth and Krug Brewery, moved it to the north end of town, and renamed it the Bozeman Brewery. He brought his extended family and a crew of experienced brewers with him. Bozeman Brewery opened in 1895 and was the largest building in Bozeman until 1957, when the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse opened at Montana State University. Lehrkind also ran the Red Lodge Brewery in Red Lodge, Montana. Soon after opening his own brewery in 1895, Lehrkind also entered the soft drink business, making sarsaparilla and lemon soda.

The brewery went out of business when prohibition came in 1919, but the Coca-Cola business is still in operation as Lehrkind's Coca-Cola Bottling.

This is an example of a stock market anomaly since it contradicts the central prediction of many financial theories that taking higher risk must be compensated with higher returns. Furthermore, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) predicts a positive relation between the systematic risk-exposure of a stock (also known as the stock beta) and its expected future returns. However, some narratives of the low-volatility anomaly falsify this prediction of the CAPM by showing that stocks with higher beta have historically under-performed the stocks with lower beta. Other narratives of this anomaly show that even stocks with higher idiosyncratic risk are compensated with lower returns in comparison to stocks with lower idiosyncratic risk. The low-volatility anomaly has also been referred to as the low-beta, minimum-variance, minimum volatility anomaly. Portfolios sorted on volatility: US stock market 1929-2018. Source: paradoxinvesting.com  History  The CAPM was developed in the late 1960s and predicts that expected returns should be a positive and linear function of beta, and nothing else. First, the return of a stock with average beta should be the average return of stocks. Second, the intercept should be equal to the risk-free rate. Then the slope can be computed from these two points. Almost immediately these predictions were empirically challenged. Studies find that the correct slope is either less than predicted, not significantly different from zero, or even negative. Black (1972) proposed a theory where there is a zero-beta return which is different from the risk-free return. This fits the data better since the zero-beta return is different from the risk-free return. It still presumes, on principle, that there is higher return for higher beta. Research challenging CAPM's underlying assumptions about risk has been mounting for decades. One challenge was in 1972, when Jensen, Black and Scholes published a study showing what CAPM would look like if one could not borrow at a risk-free rate. Their results indicated that the relationship between beta and realized return was flatter than predicted by CAPM.Shortly after, Robert Haugen and James Heins produced a working paper titled ‚ÄúOn the Evidence Supporting the Existence of Risk Premiums in the Capital Market‚Äù. Studying the period from 1926 to 1971, they concluded that \\"over the long run stock portfolios with lesser variance in monthly returns have experienced greater average returns than their ‚Äòriskier‚Äô counterparts\\".Haugen, Robert A., and A. James Heins, (1972) ‚ÄúOn the Evidence Supporting the Existence of Risk Premiums in the Capital Markets‚Äù, Wisconsin Working Paper, December 1972.  Evidence  The low-volatility anomaly has been documented in the United States over an extended 90-year period. Volatility-sorted portfolios containing deep historical evidence since 1929 are available in an online data library The picture contains portfolio data for US stocks sorted on past volatility and grouped into ten portfolios. The portfolio of stocks with the lowest volatility has a higher return compared to the portfolio of stocks with the highest volatility. A visual illustration of the anomaly, since the relation between risk and return should be positive. Data for the related low- beta anomaly is also online available. The evidence of the anomaly has been mounting due to numerous studies by both academics and practitioners which confirm the presence of the anomaly throughout the forty years since its initial discovery in the early 1970s. Examples include Baker and Haugen ( 1991),Chan, Karceski and Lakonishok (1999), Jangannathan and Ma (2003), Clarke De Silva and Thorley, (2006) and Baker, Bradley and Wurgler (2011). Besides evidence for the US stock market, there is also evidence for international stock markets. For global equity markets, Blitz and van Vliet (2007),Blitz, David C., and Pim van Vliet.

They explain why low risk securities are less in demand creating the low-volatility anomaly. * Constraints: Investors face leverage constraints and shorting constraints. This explanation was put forward by Brennan (1971) and tested by Frazzini and Pederson (2014).Frazzini, Andrea and Pedersen, Lasse (2014). Betting against beta. Journal of Financial Economics, 111(1), 1-25. * Relative performance: Many investors want to consistently beat the market average, or benchmark as discussed by Blitz and van Vliet (2007) and Baker, Bradley, and Wurgler (2011). * Agency issues: Many professional investors have misaligned interests when managing client money. Falkenstein (1996) and Karceski (2001) give evidence for mutual fund managers. * Skewness preference: Many investors like lottery-like payoffs. Bali, Cakici and Whitelaw (2011) test the ‚Äòstocks as lotteries‚Äô hypothesis of Barberis and Huang (2008). * Behavioral biases. Investors are often overconfident and use the representative heuristic and overpay for attention grabbing stocks.

Career  Born in Hinterbr√ºhl, Austria-Hungary, he was the son of playwright Carl Karlweis and younger brother of writer of Marta Karlweis. Karlweis abandoned his youthful law studies for the stage, first for eight years at Vienna's Stadttheater. After service in World War I, he was active with Max Reinhardt's Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna, followed by engagements at various theaters in Munich and Vienna, and then to the Berlin stage where he had a popular following playing singing and dancing roles, including as Prinz Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus. His general manner was humorous, charming, naive, and cheerful. In Berlin between 1930 and 1933 he worked as a recording artist and acted in more than a dozen German light comedy and musical films, most famously as one of Lilian Harvey's suitors in the hugely successful operetta film The Three from the Filling Station. With Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Karlweis, who was of Jewish descent, returned to the Austrian stage; but with the Nazi Anschluss in 1938 he was again forced to flee, first to Switzerland and then Paris where, at both locations, he took to the stage with fellow Austrian law school dropout, writer/director, and cabaret performer Karl Farkas. When German forces took Paris in 1940, Karlweis, along with his friend Austrian writer Friedrich Torberg, fled via Spain to Portugal, whence they made their way to New York. Not knowing English, Karlweis was at first limited to acting in German emmigr√© productions, but he soon got his English legs and appeared in eight Broadway shows in the early 1940s,Internet Broadway Database, ibdb.com including the title role in Franz Werfel's long-running \\"Jacobowsky and the Colonel,\\" garnering outstanding reviews.Life Magazine, April 10, 1944, p. 49 In the early 1950s Karlweis played supporting roles in TV productions and in several Hollywood and European films.Internet Movie Database He died in 1956 of a heart attack in New York, and is interred at the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery in Vienna. Personal life In 1946, Karlweis married theatrical and film producer Ninon Tallon, the niece of three-time Prime Minister of France √âdouard Herriot.Time Magazine, April 29, 1946.

Friedman (known in her business persona as the \\"Telephone Doctor\\") is an American customer service and telephone skills consultant. Nancy Friedman is founder and president of Telephone Doctor, a customer-service training company based in St. Louis, Missouri. In She also appears as spokesperson in the company's video training programs. Friedman controls the registered trademark and dotcom domain for \\"Telephone Doctor\\".  Biography  Friedman and her husband, Dick Friedman, were originally from Chicago. Friedman has one year of college from the University of Miami. Friedman worked as an actress in San Diego in the 1960s. In 1964, she and her husband bought a radio station and then in 1967, they bought another radio station in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1967, she and her husband moved to St. Louis. In St. Louis, she did promotions for a weather-forecast service, Weatherline, which she started up with her husband in 1968. She also continued to act, doing several shows a year and winning the Golden Globe Atlas Award for \\"best comedy actress.\\"  Career  In 1982, after being treated rudely in a routine call to her insurance agent, Friedman both canceled her policies and started the \\"desk drawer\\" one-woman business Telephone Doctor to train employees in telephone etiquette. The insurer company asked \\"how it should be done\\" and invited Friedman to demonstrate polite customer service to its representatives, leading to Friedman providing customer-service seminars to other corporations and associations. Friedman's first seminar earned 38 cents in profit. \\"Telephone Doctor\\" was named by Friedman's second client, a Davenport, Iowa newspaper editor. The company, Telephone Doctor, was founded by Friedman in 1983. By 1986, her business, co-owned with her husband, Dick Friedman and her son, David, was a subsidiary of Weatherline and Sportsline. By 1987, she was doing three to four seminars a week. She and her husband began creating training videos because she didn't have enough time to do all the seminars people were asking for. By 1994, Telephone Doctor employed 23 staff members and had annual worldwide sales of $2 million. The company moved to a new building with a theater that same year. Also in 1994, the company acquired World Telecom Associates. The company also did surveys to find out what phrases frustrated callers the most. Friedman tried going on television to increase her business's exposure, but later found that creating close relationships with clients worked better for her type of business. In 2007, the company made $3 million. Friedman's desire to teach businesses how to make better use of the telephone rather than to take it for granted has been called a \\"crusade\\" and a \\"quest to stamp out phone rudeness\\". In She explains that bad customer service translates into lower sales and lost business of hundreds of millions of dollars. Friedman is a speaker at corporate seminars in the U.S, She has been a keynote speaker at Fortune 500 and other corporate and association meetings. Her practices were recommended by Bear Stearns chairman Alan C. Greenberg for implementation by all employees.

He is especially known for his work as a portrait miniaturist and a numismatist. Biography Brenner was born in the parish of Storkyro in Ostrobothnia County, Finland. He was one of twenty children born to vicar Isaacus Henrici Brennerus and Susanna Werenberg. He first went to school in Nykarleby and Pori. In 1663, he was enrolled at Uppsala University where he first studied theology and later archeology. In 1668, he entered service as a draftsman in the Antiquity College (Antikvitetskollegium) which had been established at Uppsala by King Gustav II Adolf during 1667. He became a technical assistant and worked principally for Johan Hadorph (1630‚Äì1693) who was director-general of the Swedish National Heritage Board (Riksantikvarie√§mbetet). In 1673, he traveled along with Hadorph to join King Charles XI of Sweden on his extended Eriksgata which included a trip to Copenhagen. In 1672 he resigned from his position to engage as a portrait miniaturist and conduct research as a numismatist. He was appointed miniature painter at the Royal Court of Sweden in 1677. He continued to paint until his death in 1717. In 1691, his great work on Swedish coins Thesaurus nummorum Sveo-Gothicorum was printed. In the following year on a limited scale it began to be spread by the government as a gift to dignitaries and professionals. Its reception was very good and the book was mentioned with praise in foreign press. Brenner was appointed an extraordinary member of the Swedish Antiquity College in 1692 and received a considerable annual subsidy for his job of \\"further elaboration and perfection\\". The following year he was appointed Assessor there with a government salary. A new amended edition of Thesaurus was issued fourteen years after Brenner's death by Nils Piping. The number of images had then increased from 431 to 574, and histories of Swedish coin collectors and their collections had been added. Personal life Brenner was married twice. In 1676, he married Erengerd Stamm (1656‚Äì1679). In 1680, he married Swedish writer, poet, and hostess Sophia Elisabet Brenner (1659‚Äì1730). He died in Stockholm during 1717 and was buried at Riddarholm Church in Stockholm.

The school house is located at 40 Platoff Street in the National Historic District known as Niagara-on-the-Lake or Old Town. History The large two-storey brick building was built in 1859 as a public school, serving the town's children until 1948 when the new Parliament Oak School was built nearby. The construction of the school was a result of The Great Swap, the first and largest surrender of a portion of the military reserve around Fort Mississauga since its boundaries were created in 1796. The portion of land was sold to the Honourable James Crooks, who in 1854 sold a partial lot to the Town Council of Niagara for \\"uses of Common Schools and Grammar Schools in the Town of Niagara forever.\\" It has also been described as being on the military grounds, and historic photos show cadets or other soldiers lined up outside. One of its early principals was Janet Carnochan in 1872. The school house served elementary grades and had four classrooms, two on each floor. In 1882, the school began serving both Roman Catholic and Protestant students. The school was used until 1948, after which it was converted into a four unit apartment building. In 2002 a long renovation began, and in 2005 it was converted into a bed and breakfast named the Allison House Inn, renamed to the BranCliff Inn in 2012. The National Historic Site designation of the historic district, in 2003, includes buildings built from 1815 to 1859 in a 25 block area having \\"location close to the Niagara River on Front Street and extending approximately four blocks north to Castlereagh Street\\". Note: Supporting documentation is located at National Historic Sites Directorate, Documentation Centre, 5th Floor, Room 89, 25 Eddy Street, Gatineau, Quebec.

The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 by its original name Union Savings Bank and Trust. Originally, the building was built to house a bank and other professional offices. Although it was not the city's largest bank, and it was not in existence all that long, the building is still associated with Davenport's financial prosperity between 1900 and 1930. From 2014 to 2015 the building was renovated into apartments and it is now known as Union Arcade Apartments. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. History Third Street looking east. The lower level of the Union Savings Bank is shown at right before the upper floors were added. Brady Street facade Union Savings Bank was established in Davenport in 1891. The bank moved to its Brady Street location around the turn of the 20th century It had previously been the location of Davenport National Bank until Union Savings Bank took it over. The lower level of the present building was completed around 1915 and the upper floors of the building were completed in 1924 for $820,000 according to the designs by the Davenport architectural firm Temple & Burrows. Hoggson Brothers, a New York bank construction company, was the general contractor in 1924. As the bank grew it started to acquire other banks in the city. In the 1920s it merged with Davenport Savings Bank and Scott County Savings Bank and was renamed Union Savings Bank and Trust Company. After the start of the Great Depression many banks failed or were severely weakened. One of those banks was First National Bank, which Union Savings Bank and Trust took over before the Bank Holiday in 1933. The other Davenport banks who survived up to this time included: American Commercial and Savings Bank, Bechtel Trust Company, Northwest Davenport Savings Bank, and Home Savings Bank. The bank, however, was not one of the banks to emerge after the Bank Holiday. In 1946 a $75,000 renovation of the former banking hall created two floors of retail stores, which was when the building was renamed the Union Arcade. Davenport architectural firm Kruse & Parish designed the renovation and Tunnicliff Construction Company was the general contractor. Professional offices occupied the upper floors. Rodney Blackwell of Financial District Properties bought the Union Arcade in late 2013 for $1.65 million. In March 2014 a renovation project began to turn the building into 68 market-rate apartments with commercial space on the main level. The $16.65 million project was completed in May 2015. Three of the apartments are lofts and the rest are studios and one- and two-bedroom units. The mezzanine was converted into a resident lounge and a laundry room. The building's original marble floors were retained in the common areas, and the mail chute and historic doors were left in place for appearances. Architecture The building is a seven-story, L-shaped structure designed in the Neoclassical and the emerging Chicago Commercial Style. It is tall. The main fa√ßade of the building fronted Brady Street, with its secondary fa√ßade on East Third Street. It is built of limestone and it has a limestone foundation. The Neoclassical details are found primarily on the street level fa√ßade, which was the part of the building constructed around 1915. When it was built it had columns in the Ionic order at the street level side on Brady Street. On the north side, the columns become pilasters featuring the Corinthian order. The upper floors were constructed nine years after the lower level of the building. It is here that the Chicago Commercial Style is in evidence. The windows are stacked in pairs between the vertical piers and are themselves separated by decorative metal spandrel panels. with The top of the building features a heavy cornice. Kruse & Parish was the architectural firm that remodeled the building's storefront to function as the Union Arcade. It is probably at that time that the Ionic columns were removed from the building. The mezzanine level, which provides a transition to the upper levels, was also added at that time.

The band started as a skate punk trio and gained their first recognition releasing their third album Lady Karma on Broken English Records, in 2012. History =Formation and Roadkill (2005‚Äì2008)= The band was formed in the summer of 2005, in Haifa, Israel, as a skate/hardcore punk trio, with Eyal Reiner on lead vocals and bass, Yuval Segal on guitar, and Gideon Berger (younger brother of Useless ID's Ishay Berger) on drums and percussion, under the name Increase, though not long after formation, guitarist Yuval Segal decided to leave the band and was replaced with Lavy Josephson. Segal returned to the band not long after, and the band decided to stay as a four-piece with both Segal and Josephson on guitars. The band started playing live right away, playing their first live show at the Patiphone club in Tel Aviv. though their close connection to internationally known punk rock band Useless ID landed them many opening slots for Useless ID, as well as other big name Israeli bands such as Betzefer and Man Alive. In September 2005, the band opened for Australian Jewish punk rock band Yidcore and Useless ID on their co-headlining tour of Israel, at the show that took place at the Barby club in Kfar Saba. Not long after, Segal has once again left the band, and the band stayed as a trio. They then decided to record their first demo tape Short Notice, which included 7 songs and was self-released in February 2006. The band celebrated the release of the demo, opening for Useless ID and Whorecore at the City Hall club in Haifa, on February 10, 2006. On July 28, 2006, the band served once again as the opening act for Useless ID, along with ska punk band Cuban B, at the City Hall in Haifa. On December 6, 2006, the band self-released their first full-length album studio album Roadkill. The album was available only through the band and through the website Interpunk. Following the release of the album, the band served as the opening act of the 3-date Betzefer vs. Useless ID Hanuka Tour, opening for Useless ID and Betzefer, along with supporting acts The Fading and This Means You. Shows took place in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem. In the summer of 2007, the band went on their first tour of the US, playing for two months, mainly in the West Coast. Returning from their US tour in September, the band opened for NOFX on their first Israeli tour, at the Haifa show on September 7, 2007. The band then continued playing many shows throughout Israel, mainly Tel Aviv and Haifa, though then guitarist Lavy Josephson has decided to quit, and was replaced by Gal Pearlman. On April 8, 2008, the band opened for American nintendocore band HORSE the band on their first Israeli show, in Haifa. The band was also set to open for Sick of It All on June 18, 2008, as part of their Israeli tour, though this tour was eventually cancelled due to poor ticket sales. =A Postcard from Hell (2008‚Äì2010)= On October 4, 2008, the band participated in the show celebrating the release of the first Israeli punk rock compilation by the label High Fiber, which included a previously unreleased song by the band, entitled \\"Take Me\\". The release of the compilation took place at the Barby club in Tel Aviv. Around that time, the band was getting ready to record their second studio album, that they have started writing back in 2007. The band started recording their second studio album, with Useless ID frontman Yotam Ben-Horin as producer. In January 2009, the band was signed by Japanese label Radtone Music, who set a release date for their second album A Postcard from Hell, in May 2009, though only in Japan. Before the release of the album, throughout February‚ÄìMarch 2009, the band went on their first tour of the UK, when they decided to relocate to a London apartment for the time being, playing shows all around the London area, and promoting the band. A little bit after the release of the album, another major line-up change has been made, and Nadav Rotem has joined as the band's bassist, letting Reiner to focus solely on vocals, though the band then decided to add another guitar, with Reiner switching to rhythm guitar instead of bass. The Israeli release show for A Postcard from Hell took place on September 10, 2009, at the OzenBar. The band then played as an opening act for The Fading on a show that took place at the Sublime club on October 12, 2009, that saw for the first time as a four- piece, since 2006. On January 1, 2010, the band supported Man Alive on their 10-year anniversary show at the Barzilay club in Tel Aviv. Following that show, guitarist Gal Pearlman was replaced by Or Yaakov on the lead guitar position. The band continued to perform all around Israel throughout 2010, playing at the Showdown Festival on May 19, 2010, and opening for Frank Turner in Tel Aviv (June 4, 2010) and Haifa (June 6, 2010). =Lady Karma and signing to Broken English Records (2011‚Äìpresent)= In February 2011, bassist Nadav Rotem has decided to leave the band to focus on his other band Kids Insane and was replaced by Man Alive bassist Jonathan Shkedi. With Shkedi, the band flew to New York City in April 2011, to record their third studio album Lady Karma with producer John Naclerio, at Nada Recording Studio, where such bands as Polar Bear Club and The Audition have recorded. Recording took place between April 5‚Äì24, 2011. On October 30, 2011, the first song from the third album, \\"Apocalypse 101\\", was released for free streaming through SoundCloud. On November 11, 2011, the first official single from the album, \\"Monsters In My Bed\\", was released along with a music video. The album release show for Lady Karma took place on December 3, 2011, at the OzenBar in Tel Aviv. In February 2012, the band was signed by US label Broken English Records (Just Surrender, Asteria), making their third album Lady Karma available for the first time in the US, Canada and South America. The album was released on February 9, 2012, being the band's first album officially released outside of Israel and Japan. On March 6, 2012, it was announced that the band was signed by European label Fond of Life Records (This Is a Standoff, Failsafe) to release Lady Karma in Europe. On March 7, 2012, it was announced that drummer Gideon Berger will be joining Useless ID as their new drummer, following Jonathan Harpak's departure, though he will remain in both bands. On May 10, 2012, the band announced they will be shooting a music video for the second single off Lady Karma, \\"Apocalypse 101\\", over the weekend. The music video premiered on BlankTV on June 18, 2012. On December 29, 2012, the band played their final show for 2012, and last one with lead guitarist Or Yaakov, before his move to the United States, at the Wunderbar in Haifa, along with Kids Insane and Magnolia. On October 25, 2013, the band played their first show in almost a year, and their first with guitarist Roman Mishko of Chains of Past Decisions, who replaced Or Yaakov who was still out of the country. This followed the band going to a Japanese tour on November 1‚Äì4, 2013, supporting Useless ID.

This includes foodstuff, drugs, fuel (petroleum products) etc. The ECA was enacted in 1955. It has since been used by the Government to regulate the production, supply and distribution of a whole host of commodities it declares ‚Äòessential‚Äô in order to make them available to consumers at fair prices. Additionally, the government can also fix the maximum retail price (MRP) of any packaged product that it declares an ‚Äúessential commodity‚Äù. The list of items under the Act include drugs, fertilisers, pulses and edible oils, and petroleum and petroleum products. The Centre can include new commodities as and when the need arises, and take them off the list once the situation improves.  Usage  If the Centre finds that a certain commodity is in short supply and its price is spiking, it can notify stock-holding limits on it for a specified period. The States act on this notification to specify limits and take steps to ensure that these are adhered to. Anybody trading or dealing in the commodity, be it wholesalers, retailers or even importers are prevented from stockpiling it beyond a certain quantity. A State can, however, choose not to impose any restrictions. But once it does, traders have to immediately sell into the market any stocks held beyond the mandated quantity. This improves supplies and brings down prices. As not all shopkeepers and traders comply, State agencies conduct raids to get everyone to toe the line and the errant are punished. The excess stocks are auctioned or sold through fair price shops.  Instances  For instance, the Union Government on 14 March 2020 brought masks and hand-sanitisers under the act to make sure that these products, key for preventing the spread of COVID-19 infection, are available to people at the right price and in the right quality during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Govt has removed Masks & Hand- Sanitisers from Essential Commodity List from 1st of July.  Amendments  In May 2020, the Finance Minister of India, Nirmala Sitharaman suggested that the act will be amended and stock limit will be imposed only under exceptional circumstances such as famine or other calamities. There will be no stock limit for processors and supply chain owners based on their capacity and for exporters based on the export demand. It will also end some punitive measures. It will also deregulate agriculture produce such as pulses, onion, potato and cereals, edible oils and oilseeds, with aim of better price realisation for farmers. = Amendment by Ordinance = The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance 2020 was promulgated on 5 June 2020. The ordinance amends the Essential Commodities Act to allow the Government of India to delist certain commodities as essential, allowing the government to regulate their supply and prices only in cases of war, famine, extraordinary price rises, or natural calamities. The commodities that have been de-regulated are food items, including cereals, pulses, potato, onion, edible oilseeds, and oils. These can only be regulated in the extraordinary circumstances previously mentioned, by imposing limits on the amount of stocks of such items that can be held by persons. The Ordinance states that government regulation of stocks will be based on rising prices, and can only be imposed if there is a 100% increase in retail price (in the case of horticultural produce) and 50% increase in retail price (in the case of non-perishable agricultural food items). These restrictions will not apply to stocks of food held for public distribution in India. The Lok Sabha passed the ordinance to amend Essential Commodities Act on 15 September 2020.https://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lok- sabha-clears-bill-to-amend-essential-commodities-act/articleshow/78131275.cms The Rajya Sabha passed it on 22 September 2020.

He painted portraits, religious compositions, allegorical paintings and genre scenes. Moving to Italy early in his career, he became one of the first Flemish followers of Caravaggio whom he knew personally in Naples. He produced a number of copies after works by Caravaggio.Louis Finson at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He worked for a number of years in various cities in France where he created altarpieces and portraits. He is known for being the co-owner together with his fellow Flemish painter and business partner Abraham Vinck of two paintings by Caravaggio. Louis Finson played a major role in the Northern Caravaggesque movement through his own works as well as his role as an art dealer.Ludovicus Finson, David with the head of Goliath at Sotheby's  Life Finson was born in Bruges, the son of Jacob Finson and Maycken Bart. His father was a painter who had been in Bruges a pupil of Ambrosius Benson, an Italian painter active in Bruges who was part of the Northern Renaissance, and Rogier de Paeuw. Jacob Finson was originally documented as a cloth-painter (cleerscryver) or house painter (huusscruyver), an artisan who painted textiles and wall paper, but also statues. He was later registered as a regular painter. He held several functions at the Bruges guild and became its dean in the guild year 1583‚Äì1584. Louis Finson had two or three older brothers and a sister and was likely the youngest child of the family.Didier Bodart, Louis Finson: Bruges, avant 1580 - Amsterdam, 1617, Palais des Acad√©mies, 1970 Allegory of the Four Elements, 1611 After the death of Maycken Bart in 1580, his father married Jozyne vande Voorde. In the second half of the 16th century the Habsburg Netherlands were going through a period of violent religious conflict which had a heavy toll on the civil population. This likely caused the Finson family to leave Bruges in 1585 to settle in the town of Veere, on the island of Walcheren in the province of Zeeland. At that time Veere was an important trading and military port of the Dutch Republic. Jacob Finson remained in Veere until his death in April 1608. His son Arnoud was registered as a painter in Veere and died there before 1617.Paul Smeets (editor), Louis Finson, The four elements; R. Smeets, c. 2007 There are no records on the movements of Louis Finson between 1585 and 1604. He likely moved with the rest of family to Veere in 1585. At that time Louis was still young and he likely remained with his family until the late 1590s. Finson likely received his initial artistic training from his father. It is possible that he continued his studies in another town in the Dutch Republic, such as Amsterdam. Saint Sebastian He traveled to Italy where he was first recorded in Naples in March 1605 on the receipt of a payment for a painting. His initial commissions included portraits.Giovanna Capitelli, Louis Finson tra Europa e Mediterraneo in Giuditta decapita Oloferne. Louis Finson interprete di Caravaggio, catalogo della mostra (Napoli, Gallerie d'Italia, 2013), a cura di G. Capitelli, A.E. Denunzio, G. Porzio, M.C. Terzaghi, Napoli 2013, pp. 15-27 In Naples he befriended fellow Flemish painter and art dealer, Abraham Vinck, with whom he shared for some time a workshop and also a residence. Vinck had been in Naples since about 1598 and left the city around 1609 for Amsterdam.Abraham Vinck at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His relationship with Vinck likely enabled Finson to quickly find patrons in the city. The two artists were also business partners who operated an art dealing and copying business. It is likely that Finson and Vinck offered Caravaggio refuge when he arrived in Naples after fleeing Rome following his killing of a rival painter in a brawl. They may have arranged for him a place to work and connected him with patrons in Naples.Louis Finson, Saint Sebastian at Dorotheum Finson obtained commissions in Naples. On 24 August 1612 Finson received a final payment for an Annunciation made for the church of Saint Thomas of Aquino in Naples (now in the Museo di Capodimonte). It is to date Finson's only surviving commission for an altarpiece dating from his stay in Naples. He may not have been very successful with his paintings in Naples. This may be one of the reasons why he decided to leave the city. Nicolas- Claude Fabri de Peyresc by Finson Finson first spent a brief time in Rome in 1613. He left Italy around 1613 and may have traveled via Spain. He arrived in France no later than 27 February 1613 when he was recorded in Marseille. He was accompanied by the painter Martin Hermann Faber who may have been his pupil. Finson and Faber each painted around this time a self-portrait which they executed in a matching Caravaggesque style.Martin Hermann Faber (1587-1648), Autoportrait The French scientist and intellectual Nicolas- Claude Fabri de Peiresc, who was also a great friend of Rubens, became acquainted with Finson and was an admirer of his work. Peiresc was one of the first admirers and champions of Caravaggio in France after discovering Caravaggio's works in the Contarelli chapel in Rome in 1600 at the age of 20.Dossier de Presse, Les caravages de Peiresc, Conf√©rence de Presse Organis√©e par la mairie de Cavaillon et l‚Äôassociation des amis de l‚ÄôH√¥tel d‚ÄôAgar (reconnue d‚Äôint√©r√™t g√©n√©ral). Cavaillon salle du conseil le 21 Mars 2019 He gathered around him what has been called a 'caravaggesque workshop of Southern France' which included artists like Louis Finson, Martin Hermann Faber, Trophime Bigot and others.Olivier Morand, Le Finson de Toulouse, 2019 He arranged a number of commissions for Finson, including for history paintings and portraits. As a result, Finson gained a strong reputation in the Provence. He was able to sell some of the unsold paintings from Naples to French patrons. He also painted a portrait of Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peyresc. Peiresc was an avid art collector and relied on Finson's contacts in Italy to acquire two works of Caravaggio from the Pasqualini family of Rome. During his stay in France Finson was together with his partner Martin Hermann Faber in the possession of nine original works of Caravaggio. Finson worked in various cities in France where he painted religious works, altarpieces and portraits. He created works in Marseille (1613-1616), Aix-en-Provence (1613-1614), Arles (March 1614) and Montpellier (1614). After falling ill he was held up in Bordeaux in October and November 1614. In 1615, he made paintings in Poitiers, and then in Paris. Samson and Delilah He left Paris on 10 July 1615 and arrived in Amsterdam in 1616 or later. Here he linked up again with Abraham Vinck who was his landlord in the period 1616-1617 for a residence on the Oudezijds Voorburgwal in Amsterdam. He fell ill again and made on 19 September 2017 his will. In the will he left to Vinck his share in the two Caravaggio paintings which they had acquired from Caravaggio during their stay in Naples. He died soon afterwards and was buried on 1 October 1617 in the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam. His estate included a third painting by Caravaggio of the Martyrdom of Saint Andrew (private collection). Works Finson is mainly known for his religious compositions and portraits. He also painted an allegorical painting of the Four Elements (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston) and an allegorical genre scene representing the five senses. He further produced a number of copies of works by Caravaggio. Other than the copies after Caravaggio made after 1606, there are almost no known paintings by Finson before 1610. The signed but not dated Venus and Cupid with an unlikely couple (At Dorotheum on 13 October 2010 in Vienna, lot 352) was likely made in Italy not long after his arrival in Italy and before his exposure to the naturalism of Caravaggio. It shows that at this time Finson was still influenced by the Mannerist school of painting at the court of Rudolph II in Prague, with its preference for exploring erotic motives as well as by the Mannerist style of Antwerp painters such as Jacob de Backer. A Saint John the Baptist preparing himself for his martyrdom in a private collection was attributed to Finson in 2019 and is dated to approximately 1607. It shows Finson's confrontation with the work of Caravaggio. The painting offers an original interpretation of the subject. The foreground is dominated by the nude torso of the saint, shown in a submissive pose a few moments before his beheading. On the left are the heads of Salome and the old maid, who is close to the old maid in Caravaggio's File:Salome with the Head of John the Baptist-Caravaggio in the National Gallery in London.Viviana Farina, ‚ÄúCaravaggio Napoli‚Äù; iniziata la grande mostra a Capodimonte; About Art apre la discussione, Naples April 2019 A Caravaggesque painting of the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (Parish church of Rougiers, France) was previously dated 1615 but has now been dated 1610. This would place it in the Italian period of the artist. In 1610 he signed and dated the following paintings: the Resurrection (Church of Saint-Jean-de-Malte in Aix- en-Provence), David and Bathsheba (Sotheby's London sale of 3 December 2008 lot 30) and Adam and Eve (Marburg, Marburger Universit√§tsmuseum f√ºr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte). The David and Bathsheba and the Adam and Eve show the fusion of his Flemish training and the naturalist style arising in Naples under the influence of Caravaggio. The first painting recalls some of the stylistic characteristics of the work of Jacob de Backer in particular in the drawing of the bare shoulders of the servant of Bathsheba. In the second large-scale work he offers an original interpretation of the Paradise story showing Paradise as a lush Flemish still life of fruits which Adam and Eve are consuming in bliss. The two protagonists are drafted with Caravaggesque physiques and dramatic lighting. The Annunciation With the Four Elements painted in Naples in 1611 Finson created a dramatically new representation of the classic theme of the four elements. Packed with action, using powerful colours and strong lighting effects the work shows the influence of Caravaggio. The Four Elements are depicted in the form of four naked people, two male and two female, who are locked in a fierce struggle. In the upper right Fire in the form of a young man has stretched out his arms to control Air represented by young woman in the upper left and hold back Water represented by an old man in the lower left. Earth is depicted in the lower right of the painting as an old lady lying on her back, surrounded by brown earth. The martyrdom of St Sebastian Finson made more powerful works under the influence of Caravaggio such as the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (Dorotheum Vienna sale of 24 April 2018 lot 91). In this work he cites from Caravaggio's Conversion of Saint Paul in the Cerasi Chapel in the use of strong foreshortening. In his Self-portrait, which is a pendant to the Self-portrait painted by Martin Hermann Faber (c. 1613, both in the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Marseille), the artists show a great sense of self-awareness. The portraits depicting the artists muscular, semi-nude upper bodies have a certain grotesque flavor and evoke the mocking self-portraits by Caravaggio such as the Young Sick Bacchus (c. 1593, Galleria Borghese, Rome). They constitute a radical transformation of the typology of the genre of the artist self- portrait. Most of the altarpieces which Finson produced during his residence in France are signed and bear a trompe-l'oeil painted paper tag on the bottom left on which Finson's signature is affixed. In these works he uses Caravaggesque elements within Flemish, somewhat antiquated compositional solutions. He frequently quotes from Caravaggio within complex architectural settings, with figures that are always a little rigid, arranged in postures that accentuate their musculature, the bending of limbs and the crossing of the hands. He also produced altarpieces that were more indebted to 16th- century Flemish and Dutch art such as the Resurrection of Lazarus (1613, Chat√™au-Gombert church, Marseille), the Massacre of the Innocents (1615, Sainte-Begge church, Andenne), the Martyrdom of Saint Stephen, (1614, Church of St. Trophime, Arles), the Adoration of the Magi (1614, Church of St. Trophime, Arles) and the Circumcision (original copy in old chapel of the Jesuit College in Poitiers, unsigned copy by Finson in the Saint-Nicolas-des- Champs, Paris). During the latter part of his stay in France, Finson painted some altarpieces which were less convincing than his earlier work. It is possible that during his last few years in Amsterdam he created paintings such as the Musical company (Allegory of the five senses) (Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum) which treats a theme that was popular in the Northern Netherlands at that time. Finson treats the subject through its delicate color changes more as a genuine genre painting rather than as a personification of the senses. The Toulouse Judith: a Caravaggio or Finson's most expensive masterpiece? Judith beheading Holofernes (Toulouse) When Caravaggio left Naples on 14 June 1607, he left two paintings - the Madonna of the Rosary and Judith beheading Holofernes - in the studio in Naples that was shared by Louis Finson and his partner, the Flemish painter Abraham Vinck. Vinck likely took the two paintings with him when he moved to Amsterdam around 1609. Later Finson also moved to Amsterdam. The two paintings are mentioned again, this time in the will and testament dated 19 September 1617 prepared by Finson in Amsterdam, where he died. In his will Finson left all his interest in the two Caravaggio paintings that he and Vinck had owned in common since Naples to Vinck. Finson died not long after making his will and the paintings became the property of Vinck. Vinck in turn died in 1619 in Amsterdam and under his will his entire estate was left to his widow. His wife died two years later and a large portion of the estate, including a number of paintings, was sold through auctions held in Amsterdam. The Caravaggios were not among the paintings sold at the auctions.N. de Roever, 'Drie Amsterdamsche schilders. (Pieter Isaaksz, Abraham Vinck, Cornelis van der Voort.)' in: Oud Holland 3 (1885), pp. 171-208 The heirs sold the Madonna of the Rosary after 1619 for 1800 florins to a committee of Flemish painters and 'amateurs' led by Peter Paul Rubens for the Saint Paul's Church of the Dominican friars in Antwerp.Report written by Nicola Spinosa on the Toulouse Caravaggio The painting arrived around 1623 in Antwerp and was given pride of place on the chief altar of the church. In 1786, Emperor Joseph II of Austria, after ordering the closing of all 'useless' monastic orders in the Southern Netherlands, claimed the painting of Caravaggio for his art collection. It can now be admired in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Caravaggio's work, which was a pious gift of Antwerp's leading artists and an expression of their deep religious devotion had thus become the object of looting by the Austrian rulers.Caravaggio en de St. Paulus There has been no confirmed news about the second Caravaggio representing Judith beheading Holofernes co-owned by Vinck and Finson since its mention in the will of Finson dated 1617. It is known that the son-in-law of Vinck who was the executor of the estate tried to sell the more expensive paintings in the estate outside of the auctions. It is recorded that he sent a Caravaggio taxed at 600 guilders to a buyer in Rome but it is not noted what the subject of the work was. A painting of Judith beheading Holofernes said to have been discovered in an attic in Toulouse in 2014 is believed by some scholars and experts to be the lost Caravaggio. It resembles a painting of lower quality in the collection of the Intesa Sanpaolo bank in Naples which has traditionally been regarded as a copy after an original, lost work of Caravaggio made by Finson. Other scholars see in the Toulouse Judith an original creation of Finson rather than a copy after a lost Caravaggio. The Toulouse Judith has even been described as Finson's masterpiece. The work in the collection of the Intesa Sanpaolo bank is regarded by them as a copy by Finson or possibly his friend and pupil Faber after Finson's original creation. The Toulouse Judith was slated to be auctioned in June 2019 but was snapped up by hedge fund manager J. Tomilson Hill through a private sale at an undisclosed amount shortly before the auction was planned to go ahead.

To earn enough money to live in New York, he worked as a studio assistant for artists Al Held and Nancy Graves. In 1974, the Whitney hired him to work with curator Marcia Tucker, who, the following year, encouraged him to take a curator position in California at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art.

Configuration is achieved via plain text file and extending i3 is possible using its Unix domain socket and JSON based IPC interface from many programming languages. Like wmii, i3 uses a control system very similar to that of vi. By default, window focus is controlled by the 'Mod1' (Alt key/Win key) plus the right-hand home row keys (Mod1+J,K,L,;), while window movement is controlled by the addition of the Shift key (Mod1+Shift+J,K,L,;). Sway is another window manager with the goal of providing a \\"drop-in replacement\\" for i3 but uses the Wayland display server protocol instead of X11. Design goals * Possess well-written, documented code that encourages user contribution. * Use XCB instead of Xlib. * Implement multi-monitor features correctly, so that each workspace is assigned to a virtual screen, and monitor additions and removals are non- destructive of windows. * Implement different modes, similar to the text editor vi and vim. That is, keys have different functions depending on the mode that the window manager is in. * Use a tree as the abstraction (and underlying data structure) for window management. * Implement UTF-8 character encoding. Features * The configuration is done via a plain text file (found in ~/.config/i3/config). * i3 can be customized without programming. * Contrary to other popular tiling window managers, such as dwm, awesome, and xmonad, window management is left to the user in i3. Windows are held inside containers, which can be split vertically or horizontally. They can also optionally be resized. There are also options for stacking the windows, as well as tabbing them (similar to the interface that web browsers use). * Uses dmenu as the default program launcher, but it can be replaced. Floating pop- up windows Even though i3 is a tiling window manager, specific windows, such as password pop-ups, are not displayed as new tiles by default; they are always stacked in front of tiled windows, unless in full screen mode. These floating windows can be moved and resized freely, just as they can in popular desktop environments like GNOME or KDE Plasma. The authors of i3 intend floating windows to be used for pop-up windows only.

This forced him to find work in labor, including farming and building railroads. When he turned 18, McKenna had enough formal and informal education to ascertain a job at a rural Ohio public school. Eventually, he was offered a job at Creighton University which he held for two years. McKenna quit his profession and packed up for Oregon in 1889 with his wife Laura and son Coe. North McKenna avenue and McKenna park were named in honor of the University Park developer. His son, Coe, continued the family's real estate legacy. Early and personal life Francis I. McKenna was born on February 25, 1859 in Perry County, Illinois to William and Charity McKenna (n√©e) Burgoon. The McKenna family originally hailed from Belfast, Ireland. Francis McKenna was educated in public schools from age six to 12 for three to six months a year until his parents died. From there, McKenna was self-taught, taking odd jobs on farms and railroads until at 18 he was hired to educate at a public school in Ohio. Two years later he took a job at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska. He walked away from teaching in 1883. McKenna married Laura Linebaugh in 1884 in Chicago, Illinois. The couple had one child, a son, Coe A. McKenna. Coe McKenna would go on to graduate from George Washington University in 1910. Business career McKenna helped organize a Board of Trade amongst Portland's business community. McKenna served as the board's first chairman and in his first annual address, laid out a plan to attract manufacturing plants to the city. McKenna served as the president of the Portland Belt Company since its founding in 1893. Their main purpose was advocating the construction of a cable car from East Portland, Oregon to St. Johns, Oregon along the Columbia Slough. McKenna's project was originally approved, but when the Panic of 1893 came the line was canceled mid-construction. A re-approval of the project came in 1905. McKenna advocated for public control of the cable car, saying the city should construct the line and either contract the operation out or run it themselves. In 1903, McKenna secured a double-track electric streetcar line to the peninsula with the Portland Railway Company. =Land development= In 1889, McKenna moved to Portland, Oregon and invested in a large amount of land, the majority of which was in the University Park neighborhood. With the rapid growth of the city came a growth in investments for McKenna. His first newspaper advertisement appeared in 1890 where he was noted as the manager of the Conservative Real Estate & Trust Company. By 1892, McKenna was advertising as the sole agent for the University Park neighborhood. In 1894, McKenna constructed a three-story brick building in the heart of University Park. When the Archdiocese of Portland purchased the land of the former Portland University to erect a new University of Portland, they went to McKenna to secure more 23 acres of more land for $20,000 ($ adjusted for inflation). In 1910, McKenna purchased 1,280 acres of land for US$12,800 in a rural area near Chitwood, Oregon where he established a ranch. McKenna Park, named for the University Park developer, was created to accommodate the Portsmouth baseball team in the Tri-City League during the 1910 season. Officially the park was fenced off five years before, but it was not being used during that time. In 1919, the park was considered for the site of a new highschool, but eventually another plot was selected. The sites original boundaries stretched from to Lombard street on the Northside, McKenna avenue to the east and Dawson street to the south. McKenna owned land in other cities, including Bend, Oregon. In 1909, he made a large land acquisition from the University Land Company, buying most of their plots. McKenna's purchased included 500 lots for US$180,000 ($ adjusted for inflation). Political and civic advocacy Early in his land development career, McKenna devoted portions of his advertising to his personal opinions on politics and civic matters. His first opinion was published in his ad which appeared in the edition of April 2, 1893 of The Oregonian which stated his opposition to a miller regulation bill. In 1894, McKenna lobbied the Albina, Oregon city council to construct wide boulevards, which was approved. They were the first of the kind in the Portland area. McKenna subscribed to the City Beautiful movement, which was a push in urban cities to beautify the community. An early example of this was when McKenna worked for Dr. C. C. Stratton, then-president of Portland University, who advocated for Oregon to have an open immigration stance. McKenna established the United Artisans club in Portland. McKenna also founded the Initiative One Hundred, a community action committee. He announced his resignation from office in 1903,https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1903-09-06/ed-1/seq-16/ and again planned to resign following some controversy in 1907, but reconsidered and kept the position. He served as the Oregon Board of Trade chairman starting in 1901. Death and legacy McKenna died of a brain aneurysm on February 24, 1914 after battling severe mental health problems. His funeral was held on February 26, 1914 and he was interred at Mount Cavalry Cemetery. After his death, the McKenna estate was valued a US$187,748 ($ adjusted for inflation). His wife and son had to pay $711 a piece in inheritance taxes. Coe McKenna went on to take over the family development business. He later served on the Multnomah County planning board and in the Oregon Senate.

His practice is based on the principles of traditional studio craftsmanship, as well as the importance of studying under a master in the manner of the American artists who studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The beauty of nature is the primary theme of his artwork. He holds a unique position as a bronze sculptor trained as a goldsmith.  Philosophy  Lee Letts, Great Blue Herons, bronze, 2001, ht. 9 ft. Letts' philosophy of art is to follow the traditional techniques of the master craftsman, in sculpture, painting, and the art of the goldsmith. However, he stresses that the emotional content and the technical must be on even terms in order for a work to be better than good.  Early life  Frequent visits to Brookgreen Gardens during his youth influenced Letts' artistic development, experiencing in-depth the collection of American sculpture amidst its natural setting. This not only fostered his fascination with the natural world, but also engendered his ideals of the ennoblement of nature through fine art. Brookgreen is also where he first observed the foundry mark of Roman Bronze Works, which would prove to be an important milieu for the artist.  Education and apprenticeships  While in his teens, Letts' artistic abilities were recognized by a teacher who encouraged him towards a career as an artist. Family friend Truman Moore, a 1923 graduate of the Art Institute of Chicago, was also a mentor who encouraged Letts to further his studies in drawing and sculpture at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. There he became friends with professor and goldsmith David Austin, which led to an apprenticeship with John Franchot of Story Street Goldsmiths at Harvard Square in Cambridge. Studying art history at the Museum School, Letts grasped the importance of craftsmanship and the significance of the role of lost-wax casting in the history of art, especially in the creation of the bronze sculptures and gold objects of the Italian Renaissance. For his own works, Letts grounded his ideals in Classicism, drawing inspiration from artists of the American Renaissance such as Augustus St. Gaudens. Finding the School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston lacking the instruction he desired, Letts left for Europe and secured an apprenticeship at Court Jewelers 't Mannetje in The Hague, where he simultaneously studied drawing and painting at the Academy of Art. Returning to the US in 1978, Letts focused on sculpting life-size birds to cast in bronze. He worked from study skins in the collection of the Charleston Museum, and observation from life outside his studio at Longwood (part of the old rice plantation culture on the Waccamaw River) at the Santee Delta, and at the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge between Georgetown and Charleston, South Carolina. Lee Letts, Swallow- tailed Kite, bronze, 1981, ht. 16 in. In 1980 Letts met the American sculptor Donald De Lue (1897-1988), who was to become a personal friend and have a strong influence on his career. Letts was the only sculptor that De Lue ever accepted for critical instruction in the Beaux-Arts tradition. In 1981, De Lue critiqued and facilitated the acceptance of Letts' Swallow-tailed Kite to the permanent collection of Brookgreen Gardens. This was one of the last sculptures to go into the collection under the old auspices of Archer Huntington's standards, overseen by De Lue. At the time, Letts was the youngest sculptor ever to be included in the collection. De Lue wrote in 1985: > ... There was a fine school of pioneer artists who recorded so much of our > natural wild life now a national treasure of the finest quality. Audubon and > Catesby high on this list. Lee Letts, a native of South Carolina has worked > in this great American tradition. A most sincere artist devoted to the high > principals of his artistic and scientific forbears ...

Mr. Letts ... ably > continues as the recorder of native wild life ... He is a perfectionist in > all that he executes.  New York  For the five years from 1980 to 1984, Letts employed the craftsmen at The Roman Bronze Works in New York City to cast his sculpture. There he developed his work in bronze, applying his knowledge of the time- honored methods of lost-wax casting to carefully oversee the process that had been perfected by Riccardo Bertelli for the majority, if not all of the important American Beaux-Arts artists such as James Earle Fraser, Frederic Remington, and Hermon Atkins MacNeil, who taught Anna Hyatt Huntington (who with her husband, Archer Milton Huntington, founded Brookgreen Gardens). A particular interest in birds of prey led to the creation of the American bald eagle with outspread wings in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the national emblem of The United States. This bronze of Presidential Eagle was personally presented by the artist to President Ronald Reagan on May 23, 1983, in the Oval Office. The sculpture was cast at The Roman Bronze Works and exhibited in the first-floor east hallway of the West Wing of The White House during Reagan's term of office, and is part of the permanent collection of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California.1983.00451.01 Letts' bronzes have been exhibited at Hammer Galleries, J.N. Bartfield Galleries, and Hirschl & Adler Galleries, all of New York City. In 1986 Letts established a studio in New York City and continued his study of wildlife at The American Museum of Natural History, where he developed an interest in African birds and animals. During that time he attended two important Impressionist-Realist exhibits of animal painting and sculpture in New York, the work of Bruno Liljefors at The American Museum of Natural History, and the work in bronze of Rembrandt Bugatti (Wildenstein Gallery). These were the first major exhibits of these artists' works in America. Letts designs one-of-a-kind precious jewels in gold, platinum and fine gems, and in addition to working by private commission his jewelry is represented by Beretta's Madison Avenue gallery in New York City. Beretta is one of the oldest family owned businesses in the world, dating to the Italian Renaissance.  Influences  In addition to Donald Harcourt De Lue and Alexander Phimister Proctor (who produced the equestrians for Augustus St. Gaudens), other artists who have influenced Letts' career are John LaFarge, Paul Manship, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Daniel Chester French, and Benvenuto Cellini. An Animalier at heart, Letts draws his inspiration from many other great American painters as well, including Martin Johnson Heade. Especially influential artists have been Andrew Wyeth, Carl Rungius, and Bruno Liljefors. In the realm of precious metals and jewels, Letts admires the designs of Andrew Grima of London, Gilbert Albert of Geneva, and Verdura of New York. Letts' wife Marion is Director of The Charleston Art & Antiques Forum, a 501(c)3 non-profit lecture series. They have studios in Charleston, South Carolina and Atlanta, Georgia.

All three members share vocal duties. Hannah Lew plays bass, Raven Mahon plays guitar and Lillian Maring plays the drums. The band mentions in interviews their intentionally collaborative creative process, and their focus on sustainability in their music careers, opting to tour for only two weeks at a time to stay connected with friends and family. Songs are created together in their San Francisco practice space and all contribute equally to the work of the band. Members of the band are often asked about the fact that the band is all-women and about their feminism, and have responded with a quote from Gina Birch: \\"And you ask me if I‚Äôm a Feminist? Why the hell would I not be?!\\" They cite influences like Neo Boys and Kleenex, they also note Roy Wood's The Move and The Kinks as a major source of inspiration. The band dissolved circa 2013, members pursuing their respective projects.

Camp Thunder Cove, formerly Camp Justice is a United States Navy and Air Forces support facility within the US-UK Naval Support Facility on Diego Garcia, a small, strategically located, isolated island in the Indian Ocean. mirror The island is in the Chagos Archipelago, part of the British Indian Ocean Territory. United States forces have used Diego Garcia since at least the mid-1960s, under lease from the United Kingdom. The island has port facilities and an airstrip capable of handling large aircraft. Currently, 1,700 military personnel, mostly United States forces, with around 50 British troops, and a further 1,500 civilian contractors reside there. Structure The facility fills several roles. The installation serves as a support facility for both surface fleets and submarine units in addition supplying regional operations in conjunction with Military Sealift Command. The base is also home to a sophisticated radar, space tracking and communications facility along with a fully operational joint Navy and Air Force airfield. History Construction of Camp Justice was the impetus for the British government's expulsion of the Chagossians. The entire population of approximately 1,600 Chagossians were removed from 1967 to 27 April 1973, resulting in financial compensation being paid out to the former inhabitants as well as several legal challenges. Starting in 1990, the base saw another round of rapid improvement and expansion.

Nevertheless, in response to the urging of the residents, the Penang State Government granted a piece of land for the building of a new Hindu temple. Work on the new temple began in 1996.

It is part of the University System of Georgia and offers master's, bachelor's and associate degrees, as well as some certificates, to students on five campuses in Middle Georgia and online. The institution, originally known as Middle Georgia State College, was founded in 2013 through the merger of Middle Georgia College and Macon State College. Through these legacy institutions, Middle Georgia State University traces its history to 1884. In 2015, the institution adopted its current name to reflect its elevation to state university status. History Middle Georgia State is a relatively new institution in name, though it has been in existence in several forms for most of 130 years. =1884‚Äì1919= The institution's beginnings date to the establishment of New Ebenezer College, which occupied the site of the current Cochran Campus. New Ebenezer was established in 1884 by the New Ebenezer Baptist Association, which was composed largely of Baptist churches in Pulaski, Dodge, Laurens, and Telfair counties of Middle Georgia. The first building on the campus was completed in 1886, and classes were first held in 1887 with approximately 100 students. However, the association discontinued its financial support for their namesake college in 1898, forcing the school to close its doors. The college's building served as a high school for the city of Cochran until 1913, when the high school moved. No documentation exists regarding the facilities from 1913‚Äì1919, leading to the presumption that it was unoccupied during that time. =1919‚Äì1931= In 1919, the Georgia State College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts (a division of the University of Georgia) opened a branch dedicated to serving the needs of the 12th Congressional District in the building formerly used by New Ebenezer College. In 1927, the school's name was changed to Middle Georgia Agricultural and Mechanical Junior College, though it remained a branch of the state agricultural school. In 1929, the school's name was changed to Middle Georgia College and responsibility for its operation was given to a nine-person board of trustees. =1931‚Äì1965= Middle Georgia College was made an independent institution in 1931 when it was created as one of the original units of the newly created University System of Georgia. During World War II, Middle Georgia hosted the 50th College Training Detachment of the U.S. Army Air Force and graduated 17 classes of aviation students from March 1943 ‚Äì July 1944. In 1964, Dr. Louis C. Alderman Jr. became president and served 23 years, the longest term of any president of the college. Many new buildings as well as renovations of existing facilities marked his tenure in growing the college's reputation, academic excellence, campus beauty and athletic programs. Middle Georgia College continued to operate as a separate unit of the University System until the end of 2012. =1965‚Äì1995= In 1968, Macon Junior College was established on the western side of Macon, Georgia. The two year institution began its first year with 1,100 students which was the largest enrollment to this point for a new University System of Georgia institution. Middle Georgia College opened a Dublin Campus in 1984. In 1987, the Regents removed \\"Junior\\" from the Macon college's name, but Macon College remained a two-year school, and in 1991 it began offering classes in a building at an office park in Warner Robins. =1996‚Äì2011= In 1996, Macon College was renamed Macon State College. The first bachelor's degrees were awarded in May 1999. With support from the City of Warner Robins and funding from the General Assembly, the college constructed a new building and renovated another to establish a new campus in Warner Robins in 2003. Middle Georgia College also was expanding. A new program was added in 2007, when the college assumed the programs and facilities that had been the Georgia Aviation Technical College in Eastman. With that consolidation, Middle Georgia College had campuses in Cochran, Dublin and Eastman. While Middle Georgia College had residence halls, Macon State College, for its first 40 years, was strictly a commuter college. However, units in an apartment building near the campus opened as student housing for the fall 2010 semester. In 2010, Macon State also became the host of the International Cherry Blossom Festival's annual Tunes and Balloons event. =2011‚Äìpresent= From 2011 to 2015, the two institutions went through dramatic change, beginning in June 2011 when Dr. David Bell ended his 14-year presidency of Macon State. He was replaced in July 2011 by Dr. Jeff Allbritten.http://www.usg.edu/news/release/allbritten_named_president_of_macon_state_college Six months later, in January 2012, the Board of Regents set in motion the consolidation of Macon State College with Middle Georgia College. In May, the Regents decided on a name for the new institution‚ÄîMiddle Georgia State College‚Äîand also laid out a path for elevating the consolidated institution to university status after a review process. Allbritten left the presidency after only one year. In July 2012, he was replaced by Dr. John Black, who had retired as president emeritus of East Georgia State College. Black became interim president of Macon State, while Dr. Michael Stoy continued to serve as president of Middle Georgia College. In the fall of 2012, students at the two colleges selected a new mascot to replace the Blue Storm (of Macon State) and the Warriors (of Middle Georgia). More than 1,000 students on the campuses of the two legacy institutions voted to select Knights as the new mascot. Students also selected new school colors of purple, black and silver, and they voted among several choices on the design of the new mascot. The new mascot and color selections were at least partially influenced by the two institutions' previous identities. The Blue Storm was depicted as a horse in clouds, while the Warriors were fighting humans. Some students saw the \\"knight,\\" an armor-wearing fighting soldier often depicted as riding a horse, as a combination of the two former mascots. Selection of the new colors was similarly influenced by the past. The Blue Storm colors were blue and gold; the Warrior colors were red and black. The combination of blue and red form purple, a regal color often worn by knights. Students also proposed many names for the new mascot; the name \\"Duke\\" was selected in another student vote. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), the regional accrediting agency, gave its approval to the consolidation of the two colleges in December 2012. The Board of Regents voted to make the consolidation official, effective immediately, on Jan. 8, 2013. Black was re- appointed as interim president of the new institution, Middle Georgia State College. His term ended in December 2013, and Dr. Christopher Blake assumed the presidency on January 2, 2014. In March 2015, the Board of Regents approved the elevation of Middle Georgia State to a state university, which took place on July 1, 2015.

The Wealthy is an American apple cultivar, and was the earliest to thrive in the Minnesota climate. Horticulturalist Peter Gideon first grew it in 1868, after years of trial and error with various apple varieties. Before 1868, only crab apples grew reliably in Minnesota. Indigenous peoples in the area harvested other crops, but they did not grow apples. Early White settlers to Minnesota tried to grow apples using seeds and seedlings from their former homes to the east and the south, but their plants died, usually because of the region's harsh winters. Peter Gideon (1820-1899), creator of the cultivar In 1853, Peter Gideon moved to Minnesota for health reasons and took a homestead with his family on the shores of Lake Minnetonka, near Excelsior. He had learned fruit-growing as a child, and when he arrived on his new land, he planted a bushel of apple seeds he had brought with him from his former home in Illinois. In the years that followed, Gideon experimented with apple and fruit growing, planting thousands of trees, but most of his trees died within a few years, if not right away, and none of them bore much fruit. By 1861, Gideon and his family had only one surviving apple tree, a Siberian crab apple, and they were down to their last eight dollars. Determined to find an apple that would grow in Minnesota, Gideon sent the family's last dollars to an apple grower in Bangor, Maine, and got apple seeds and scions in return. Just one of the resulting trees, crossed with Gideon's Siberian crab apple, produced the apple that Gideon later named the Wealthy, after his wife, Wealthy (Hull) Gideon. He was a member of the Minnesota State Horticultural Society, and he shared his knowledge and his trees freely, giving seedlings away to anyone who asked for them. Soon, Wealthy apples were growing in many locations in Minnesota, as well as in other states, especially states in the Upper Midwest with similar climates. In 1870, Colonel John H. Stevens addressed the Minnesota Horticultural Society with these words: By the early 20th century, the Wealthy apple was one of the top five apples grown nationally, but beyond his employment at the state farm, Gideon never made any money from the Wealthy apple. The Wealthy apple also was the parent of other successful Minnesota apples, such as the Haralson, which was developed at the University of Minnesota's Fruit Breeding Farm in 1922.

Barnard (1886‚Äì1961) that presents a \\"theory of cooperation and organization\\" and \\"a study of the functions and of the methods of operation of executives in formal organizations.\\" It was originally published in 1938; a Thirtieth Anniversary edition, published in 1968, is still in print. The book is notable for its focus on how organizations actually operate, instead of previous approaches to organizations that emphasized \\"prescriptive principles.\\" It has been praised for being one of the first books to consider leadership from a social and psychological viewpoint. An article in Public Administration Review reported that an informal advisory panel voted it one of the most influential books in public administration published between 1940 and 1990. It was voted the second most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management, behind The Principles of Scientific Management by Frederick Winslow Taylor. Background Barnard attended Harvard University between 1906 and 1909 where he majored in economics; however, he did not obtain a degree. After rising through the ranks at AT&T; Corporation, Barnard became president of New Jersey Bell between 1927 and 1948. At New Jersey Bell, Barnard enjoyed \\"long hours of self-absorbed reflection and study.\\" In 1936, Barnard gave a lecture at Princeton University entitled \\"Mind in Everyday Affairs.\\" In the lecture, Barnard described the differences between \\"logical\\" and \\"non-logical\\" (i.e., \\"intuitional\\") mental processes. He encouraged the use of non-logical processes \\"for many conditions and purposes.\\" Barnard had many contacts with Harvard officials, for example in relation to fundraising activities. He and Lawrence Joseph Henderson were friends, and Henderson was a friend of Abbott Lawrence Lowell, who had been president of Harvard and founder of the Lowell Institute. Henderson suggested that Lowell invite Barnard to lecture at the Institute, and having read \\"Mind in Everyday Affairs\\" and another lecture by Barnard, Lowell did so. Barnard gave eight extemporaneous talks at the Lowell Institute in 1937 on the topic of \\"functions of the executive,\\" and on the invitation of Dumas Malone (the director of Harvard University Press who met Barnard through Arthur W. Page), he revised the material from the talks to create the book. Barnard's philosophy and thought processes in writing the book were characterized by humanism, empiricism, speculative philosophy (the interpretation of experience in a coherent framework), and analysis of the dichotomy of individualism and collectivism. As cited in the book, his intellectual influences included Arthur F. Bentley, Vilfredo Pareto, Lawrence Joseph Henderson, Talcott Parsons, W. H. R. Rivers, Frederic Bartlett, Elton Mayo, Fritz Roethlisberger, Mary Parker Follett, James Harbord, Alfred North Whitehead, and John R. Commons. His approach diverged from the \\"mechanistic conceptions\\" of Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henri Fayol. Summary =Introduction to the Thirtieth Anniversary Edition= In the 1968 edition, the Introduction by Kenneth R. Andrews evaluates the book and summarizes its place in the management literature. Andrews concludes that it is \\"the most thought-provoking book on organization and management ever written by a practicing executive.\\" He contrasts Functions of the Executive with the \\"classical\\" approaches to organizations found in books such as Principles of Management by Harold Koontz and Cyril J. O'Donnell. =Preface= Barnard gives an overview of his arguments in his Preface: > Formally this work is divided into four parts, but in a sense it consists of > two short treatises. One is an exposition of a theory of cooperation and > organization and constitutes the first half of the book. The second is a > study of the functions and of the methods of operation of executives in > formal organizations. =Part I= Part I is \\"Preliminary Considerations Concerning Cooperative Systems.\\" In Chapter I, \\"Introduction\\" (pages 3‚Äì7), Barnard notes that \\"formal organization is that kind of cooperation among men that is conscious, deliberate, purposeful,\\" and that \\"successful cooperation in or by formal organizations is the abnormal, not the normal, condition.\\" An individual may belong to many formal organizations, some of which may be short-lived. Chapter II, \\"The Individual and Organization\\" (pages 8‚Äì15), states that individuals can be characterized in many ways (e.g., physical, social, psychological), but that for the purposes of discussion the book is concerned with the functional relationships among individuals in organizations. Barnard distinguishes between \\"effective\\" and \\"efficient\\" actions: > When a specific desired end is attained we shall say that the action is > \\"effective.\\" When the unsought consequences of the action are more important > than the attainment of the desired end and are dissatisfactory, effective > action, we shall say, is \\"inefficient.\\" When the unsought consequences are > unimportant or trivial, the action is \\"efficient.\\" The remaining chapters in Part I elaborate on the relationships among people in a \\"cooperative system\\": * Chapter III: \\"Physical and Biological Limitations in Cooperative Systems\\" (pages 22‚Äì37) * Chapter IV: \\"Psychological and Social Factors in Systems of Cooperation\\" (pages 38‚Äì45) * Chapter V: \\"The Principles of Cooperative Action\\" (pages 46‚Äì61) =Part II= The book's second part concerns \\"The Theory and Structure of Formal Organizations.\\" Pages 65‚Äì81 contain Chapter VI, \\"The Definition of Formal Organization.\\" In the chapter, Barnard defines \\"formal organization\\" twice as \\"a system of consciously coordinated activities or forces of two or more persons.\\" The chapter outlines how Barnard developed the definition and explains that the concept of organization is abstract. It specifies that a formal organization is part of a \\"cooperative system,\\" a \\"complex of physical, biological, personal, and social components which are in a specific systematic relationship by reason of the cooperation of two or more persons for at least one definite end.\\" Chapter VII, \\"The Theory of Formal Organization\\" on pages 82‚Äì95, sets forth the three elements necessary for organizations: \\"(1) communication; (2) willingness to serve; and (3) common purpose.\\" Barnard suggests both: (1) that an organization that cannot accomplish its purpose cannot survive, and (2) that an organization that accomplishes its purpose has no reason for existence. Therefore, organizations are constantly adopting new purposes. Chapter VIII, \\"The Structure of Complex Formal Organizations\\" (pages 96‚Äì113), concerns the relationship of \\"superior\\" to \\"subordinate\\" organizations, the growth of organizations, and the relationship of small working \\"unit organizations\\" to \\"executive organizations\\" within complex formal organizations. In Chapter IX, \\"Informal Organizations and Their Relation to Formal Organizations\\" (pages 114-123), Barnard states that formal organizations coexist with informal organizations (groups of people who interact with each other outside a formal organizational structure). Benefits of informal organizations include the promotion of communication, cohesiveness, and self-respect. =Part III= Part III is titled \\"The Elements of Formal Organizations\\" and begins with Chapter X (pages 127-138) about \\"The Bases and Kinds of Specializations.\\" \\"The Economy of Incentives\\" is Chapter XI (pages 139-160). According to Barnard, \\"in all sorts of organizations the affording of adequate incentives becomes the most definitely emphasized task in their existence\\" Specific inducements range from \\"material inducements\\" to \\"ideal benefactions\\" (e.g., \\"pride of workmanship\\"), while \\"general incentives\\" include \\"personal comfort in social relations.\\" Barnard's conclusions on incentives were drawn \\"almost entirely from observations‚Ä¶ not from any reading.\\" Chapter XII, \\"The Theory of Authority\\" (pages 161-184) is notable for its summary of the conditions for authoritative communications, its explanation of \\"zone of indifference,\\" and its distinction between \\"authority of position\\" and \\"authority of leadership.\\" *Concerning authoritative communications, Barnard wrote: > A person can and will accept a communication as authoritative only when four > conditions simultaneously obtain: (a) he can and does understand the > communication; (b) at the time of his decision he believes that it is not > inconsistent with the purpose of the organization; (c) at the time of his > decision, he believes it to be compatible with his personal interest as a > whole; and (d) he is able mentally and physically to comply with it. *Barnard discusses the concept of \\"zone of indifference,\\" which is \\"perhaps the most well-known idea in the book,\\" as follows: > ...there exists a \\"zone of indifference\\" in each individual within which > orders are acceptable without conscious questioning of their authority‚Ä¶ The > zone of indifference will be wider or narrower depending upon the degree to > which the inducements exceed the burdens and sacrifices which determine the > individual's adhesion to the organization. It follows that the range of > orders that will be accepted will be very limited among those who are barely > induced to contribute to the system. *\\"Authority of position\\" is explained as occurring when people \\"impute authority to communications from superior positions‚Ä¶ to a considerable extent independent of the personal ability of the incumbent of the position.\\" In contrast, people with superior ability have \\"authority of leadership.\\" When a person has both types of authority, the subordinate will \\"accept[] orders far outside the zone of indifference.\\" In Chapter XIII, \\"The Environment of Decision\\" (pages 185-199), Barnard contemplates how personal decision-making and organizational decision-making differ. He states \\"The fine art of executive decision consists in not deciding questions that are not now pertinent, in not deciding prematurely, in not making decision that cannot be made effective, and in not making decisions that others should make.\\" Part III concludes with Chapter XIV, \\"The Theory of Opportunism\\" (pages 200-211). =Part IV= \\"The Functions of Organizations in Cooperative Systems\\" constitutes the final part of the book. It begins with Chapter XV (\\"The Executive Functions,\\" pages 215-234) and Chapter XVI (\\"The Executive Process,\\" pages 235-257). Chapter XVII on \\"The Nature of Executive Responsibility\\" (pages 258-284) discusses morality. Barnard observes that \\"cooperation, not leadership, is the creative process; but leadership is the indispensable fulminator of its forces.\\" In turn, morality is critical to leadership: \\"organizations endure‚Ä¶ in proportion to the breadth of the morality by which they are governed.\\" The \\"Conclusion\\" (Chapter XVIII, pages 285-296) highlights 16 major observations of the book and contemplates the relationship of science and art in management: > I believe that the expansion of cooperation and the development of the > individual are mutually dependent realities, and that a due proportion or > balance between them is a necessary condition of human welfare. Because it > is subjective with respect both to a society as a whole and to the > individual, what this proportion is I believe science cannot say. It is a > question for philosophy and religion. =Appendix= The Appendix (pages 301-322) contains the text of Barnard's 1936 \\"Mind in Everyday Affairs\\" lecture. Criticisms Criticisms of the book include: * It is \\"deadly‚Ä¶ [with] little meaning today.\\" * Its prose has been characterized as \\"difficult to read,\\" \\"heavy,\\" \\"turbid,\\" and \\"atrocious.\\" Even the Introduction to the Thirtieth Anniversary Edition notes the \\"ponderousness of Barnard's style.\\" * The definition of \\"efficiency\\" in Chapter II is confusing. * The definition of \\"formal organization\\" in Chapter VI has been subject to considerable scrutiny. Although Hal G. Rainey acknowledged that the definition did distinguish Barnard from the \\"classical theorists\\" of management, he characterized it as \\"completely inadequate.\\" Lyndall Urwick stated that \\"boy kisses girl\\" could qualify as an organization under Barnard's definition. * Statements such as \\"Personal aversions based upon racial, national, color, and class differences often seem distinctly pernicious; but on the whole they are, in the immediate sense, I believe, based upon a sound feeling of organization necessities\\" (page 147) have been assessed as \\"unenlightened\\" by today's standards. * Barnard's ideas about authority in Chapter XII have been summarized as a \\"bottom-up power\\" theory that fails to acknowledge the reality that it is \\"sometimes the job of corporate leaders to use power to control, repress, and arrest the actions of their subordinates.\\" * A passage on page 319 (\\"‚Ä¶It is consequently necessary to say things in a form which is not correct from the standpoint of the speaker or writer‚Ä¶\\") has been interpreted as \\"advocating lying.\\" * Barnard did not write in any detail about the relationship between an organization and the customers of that organization. * The book does not consider how an executive of a corporation interacts with the board of directors or stockholders. * There is no significant mention of the education of staff (i.e., the executive's role as a teacher). Legacy Cover of 30th Anniversary Edition (1968)The Functions of the Executive was to be the only book that Barnard ever wrote; however, he also wrote articles for journals, and collections of such articles have been published in books (e.g., the 1948 book Organization and Management). By 2010, the book had received over 8,000 citations in Google Scholar. Among other works, the book influenced: * Administrative Behavior by Herbert A. Simon (1947). In a 1988 interview, Simon was quoted as follows: > Of course I built squarely on Barnard, and have always felt deeply indebted > to him; science is a cumulative endeavor. My general debt is expressed in > the acknowledgements [p. xivii of the Second Edition]: \\"To Mr. Charles [sic] > I. Barnard I owe a special debt: first, for his own book The Functions of > the Executive.‚Ä¶\\" In the book itself there are fourteen references to > Barnard‚Ä¶. the notions of the contribution-inducement equilibrium, authority, > and zone of acceptance were all derived from Barnard‚Ä¶. What I would now > regard as the principal novelties in Behavior are the development of the > concept of organizational identification‚Ä¶, the description of the decision > process in terms of the processing of decision premises, and the bounded > rationality notions‚Ä¶. Most of the rest is highly \\"Barnardian,\\" and certainly > even those \\"novel\\" ideas are in no way inconsistent with Barnard's view of > organizations. * The Human Group by George C. Homans (1950). * The Human Side of Enterprise by Douglas McGregor (1960). * New Patterns of Management by Rensis Likert (1961). * A Behavioral Theory of the Firm by Richard Cyert and James G. March (1963). * Markets and Hierarchies: Analysis and Antitrust Implications by Oliver E. Williamson (1975). Barnard's book also anticipated In Search of Excellence by Tom Peters and Robert H. Waterman, Jr., the concept of management by objectives that Peter Drucker popularized, the two-factor theory of Frederick Herzberg, and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Examples of papers that have examined Barnard's \\"zones of indifference\\" concept include: * A 1994 textual analysis of Barnard's work. * A 2000 psychological study that compared leaders' and followers' ratings of the followers' willingness to perform assignments from the leaders. Leaders rated the assignments as \\"less enjoyable, undesirable, more above the call of duty, and more likely to be resisted\\" than the followers reported. * A 2001 qualitative study that examined how workplaces might have wider or narrower zones of indifference concerning the rights of employees infected with HIV under the Americans with Disabilities Act. As of 1961, the book had sold over 35,000 copies. As of 1982, the book had gone through 29 printings, and the Thirtieth Anniversary edition is still in print. It has been translated into many languages, including Arabic, Chinese, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish. In 1988, the University of California, Berkeley held a series of seminars to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the book's publication; eight of the lectures became essays in a 1995 book edited by Oliver E. Williamson. One issue of the International Journal of Public Administration in 1994 contained papers in honor of Barnard, many of which concerned the book. Joseph T. Mahoney of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign wrote that The Functions of the Executive \\"is the most high-powered intellectual contribution to organization or economic theory ever written by a practicing manager\\" and that it appears to inspire students by conveying an \\"aesthetic feeling of managing.\\" Although an informal advisory panel voted Administrative Behavior by Herbert Simon the most influential 1940‚Äì1990 book in academic public administration, \\"panel members had a tendency to associate Simon and Barnard,\\" and one panel member wrote that Barnard's book was \\"the truly seminal work.\\" The Functions of the Executive appeared in at least four lists of \\"best\\" or \\"most influential\\" management and business books between 2001 and 2011.

The oldest Hindu temple in Penang, Sri Mahamariamman Temple is located here.http://www.malaysiavacationsnet.com/penang/penang-sri- mariamman-temple.php This area bears many similarities to market streets in Chennai, Mumbai or Delhi. Its location at the centre of Penang Heritage Zone and nearby Penang's main finance centre, Beach Street make it one of the most famous and notable shopping spot in Penang among local and tourist. Little India is also famous for Malaysian Indian cuisine. It also serves as main commercial and cultural activities of Penang Indians. The place becomes more lively during festival times like Deepavali, Christmas and Thaipusam. Location The Penang's Little India located in the heart of Georgetown, the capital of Penang. It is in the centre of Penang Heritage Zone. Penang's Little India covered by 3 streets, which is: A board in Beach Street that showing direction to Little India * Chulia Street * Queen Street * Market Street But the Little India also can be expanded to Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling and Church Street due to large number of Indian business over there. Street view of Little India with Menara Sentral (Sentral Tower) as the background History During the early days of the settlement, Chulia Street was allotted to the Indian immigrants as their enclave.http://www.virtualmalaysia.com/destination/little%20india,%20penang.html However, over the years, the Chinese immigrant settler community grew in size, resulting in Little India being cocooned in the centre of the ever-growing Chinese community and bordering what is today referred to as Chinatown. The Indian immigrant settlers took up a variety of roles in the settlement, as agricultural labourers, money lenders and spice traders. This meticulously regimented network was among the earliest parts of George Town planned under the administration of Sir Francis Light, the English founder of Penang. =Early history= The area is hence now referred to as the \\"Francis Light Grid\\" - a rectangular network bordered by Leith Street, Beach Street, Chulia Street and Pitt Street (now Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling). Streets within the grid were pertinently named to reflect the period during which they were built. Names such as Market Street, King Street, Queen Street and Penang Street -all now form the heart of Little India - are still used today. Stevedores from south India lived along parts of King Street which the Tamils call \\"Padavukara Tharuva\\" or \\"the Street of Boatmen\\". Market Street, which now forms the heart of the Indian enclave, was called \\"Kadai Teru\\" or \\"Street of Shops\\". The British called it \\"Chola Place\\" or \\"Little Madras\\". Several other Indian communities, mainly merchants and traders, also arrived in large numbers over the years. These included the Gujaratis, Punjabis, Malayalees and Telugus. Many of these were traders who set up their businesses within the grid, contributing to the area's throbbing cultural milieu. It was in fact very common until only a few years ago, for folks to live on the top floor of their shophouses while operating their businesses on the ground floor. Also situated in Little India is Penang‚Äôs oldest Hindu temple, Sri Mariamman Temple, which was built in 1833. However, it was only in 1933 that the temple acquired its present form after undergoing extensive renovations. The temple features the Hindu goddess Mariamman in her various incarnations. Among the priceless possessions of this ornate building is a statue of Lord Subramaniam richly decorated with gold, silver, diamonds and emeralds.

Notable skyscraper in Little India were the Sentral Building (Menara Sentral) which home the Penang Sentral College. The most famous architecture in Little India are : * Sri Mahamariamman Temple, * Khoo Kongsi Related events and festivals =Religious Festival= The religious festival mostly take place in Sri Mahamariamman Temple Navarathri The most auspicious event for the temple is the Navratri festival (The Nine Night Festival). The festival begins with the lion flag raising ceremony and ends with a procession where the panchaloka deity of Mahamariamman is paraded in a decorated wooden chariot through the streets of Little India. (Navarathri is nine nights vegetarian festival). According to the Hindu Puranas (holy books), the festival is held to commemorate the victory of Goddess Parasakthi over the demon king Mahishasuran. It was stated that the evil king ill-treated the people that they turned to the goddess, who is the consort of Lord Shiva, to save them. Goddess Parasakthi fought a battle for nine days and ultimately destroyed him on the 10th day, which is known as Vijayadashami. Various Indian organisations and communities would sponsor the prayers for each nights. On the Final tenth day of the celebration, Vijayadashami is celebrated by Hindu Mahajana Sangam. The sangam organised the chariot procession for many years from Queen Street, Sri Mahamariamman Temple to Dhoby Ghaut in Air Itam. The festival celebration is concluded after shooting of arrows from the chariot in the evening in the Dhoby Ghaut. The chariot returns to the temple at about midnight the same day. Since the late 1970s, the organisation of the chariot procession had been taken over from the sangam by the Temple committee and the Hindu Endowments Board. The chariot procession is now confined to fort Cornwallis area in the Esplanade. However, the sangam still continues to celebrate the annual Navarathiri festival‚Äôs final tenth day Vijayadashami Ubayam every year without fail. =Chithra Pournami (Chitraparuvam)= The Hindu Mahajana Sangam, with notable among the festivals, the annual Chitraparuvam Festival which is celebrated in the Tamil month of Chithirai (April/May) every year, is organised with a chariot procession of the panchaloka deity of Lord Subramaniyaswami from Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman Temple. It is the day of the first full moon of the first Tamil month. In early years, the festival starts with special pooja and ubayam for the Hindu Mahajana Sangam ‚ÄúKoota Kadai‚Äù in Queen Street Mahamariamman Temple, the chariot procession commences in the early morning 7.00 am and reached Waterfall Dewan Mahatma Gandhi (Gandhiji Ashram) in the afternoon, the deity then carried and placed in the ashram until the return journey of the chariot to Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple in the evening of the same day. Since the early 1970s this festival is celebrated for three days. The deity of Lord Subramaiyaswami is brought in procession from the Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple passing through many street and roads before reaching the Waterfall Arulmigu Sri Ganesha temple. The deity is carried up to the Hilltop Arulmigu Sri Balathadayuthapani Temple. On the second day is the Chitraparuvam Festival where the deity is taken in procession around the hilltop temple compound in the evening. On the third day evening, the deity is carried down and placed on the chariot procession journey back to the Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple. In 1990, the Hindu Mahajana Sangam imported a new chariot from India, for the annual Chitraparuvam Festival celebration to replace the old chariot which was found to be not road worthy and in a decaying condition. On the first day, the chariot passes through Queen Street, Chulia Street, Chulia Street Ghaut, Victoria Street, Prangin Road Ghaut, C. Y. Choy Road, Magazine Road, Dato Keramat Road, Western Road and Waterfall Road before reaching the Ganesar Temple. The chariot stops at Kamatchi Amman Temple, Sivan Temple and Muneeswarar Temple along the way. Then the Lord Subramaniyaswami is carried up to the Sri Balathandayuthapani Temple at the hilltop. On the return journey, the Lord Subramaniyaswami is carried down and the chariot passes through Waterfall Road, Gottlieb Road, Tunku Abdul Rahman Road, Macalister Road, Anson Road, Burma Road, Transfer Road, Sri Bahari Road, Penang Road, Kimberley Street, Carnarvon Street, Chulia Street, Pitt Street, Church Street, Queen Street, China Street, King Street, Light Street, Penang Street, Chulia Street, King Street, China Street, Beach Street, Mrket Street and Queen Street before reaching the Sri Mahamariamman Temple. The chariot stops at Balathandayuthapani Temple, Meenatchi Sundaraeswarar Temple, ISKCON Centre, Muneeswarar Temple and Kunj Bihari Temple along the way. Thaipusam Celebrated on the Tamil month of Thai (January/February). Although it is celebrated in the Waterfall Arulmigu Sri Balathandayuthapani Hilltop temple, Sri Mahamriamman temple is not left behind as there are religious activities associated with this festival. The Hindu Mahajana Sangam members carry a traditional kavadi weighing approximately 80 kilos known as Atta Kavadi since 1926 from Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple in the evening to Dewan Mahatma Gandhi in the Thannirmalai Arulmigu Balathandayuthapani Temple compound with traditional Nadhaswaram accompanying the Atta Kavadi. A late night dinner is served in the Dewan Mahatma Gandhi after the arrival of the Atta Kavadi. In the early years the arrival of the Atta Kavadi signifies the conclusion of the annual Thaipusam festival celebration for the day and devotees are not expected to carry any kavadi after the Atta Kavadi reaches the Waterfall temple compound. The Penang Nattukottai Chettiar community hold prayers in this temple prior to the Thaipusam festival. This function is called the Kuthirai Vahanam (Horse Car) held on in the Tamil month of Markazhi (December/January). The prayers would start 10 days earlier where there would be ubayams on these days. On the tenth day, the decorated panchaloka deity of the Mahamariamman which carries a Vel would be placed on the Horse Car. The procession begins from Queen Street at the evening, displaying the Vel passing through various streets and roads and end up at Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple around mid-night. =Non- Religious Festival= There are various non-religious festival take place in Little India and most of the festival are mainly to promote Penang tourism. The 2014 Penang International Tamil Conference opening ceremony were held in Little India. Education Sentral College Penang located in the Little India Zone.

His non-fiction and fiction works alike reflected his strong interest and involvement in politics and law. He was born in Sale, Victoria, to banker Henry Baker Chomley and his wife Eliza (daughter of lawyer and politician Thomas Turner √† Beckett). He was nephew to prominent Victorians Arthur Wolfe Chomley (barrister) and Hussey Malone Chomley (Police Commissioner) and uncle to Martin Boyd, noted Australian novelist.De Serville, Paul H. \\"Chomley, Charles Henry (1862‚Äì1942)\\". Australian Dictionary of Biography, 1979. Web. 20 March 2012. Parents Henry Baker Chomley emigrated from Ireland to Australia with his mother, Mary Elizabeth Chomley, sister of Sir Richard Griffith, and his six brothers, following the death of their clergyman father, Rev Francis Chomley (1784-1847). In search of better opportunities and following the advice of her younger brother, Charles James Griffith and her older sister, Anne Greene who had arrived earlier, the Chomleys arrived on HMS Stag to Port Phillip, Victoria, in February 1849 and settled in Prahran, Victoria.Sussex, Lucy.

Australian Dictionary of Biography. Web. 30 March 2012. http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/a-beckett-william-arthur-2863 After spending the following year with his wife and her family in England, Chomley left the legal profession in 1893 to establish a farming partnership in Australia with his cousin, Frank Chomley. With a group of friends, he settled in the King River Valley in northeast Victoria. Chomley was an Oxley Shire councillor from 1896‚Äì99 (president in 1898), but heart problems forced him to retire to Melbourne around 1900.De Serville, 1979. Life as an editor The return to Melbourne signalled the launch of Chomley‚Äôs journalistic career, and in the same year as retiring to the city, he took up his first editorship position at the illustrated weekly Arena. Dedicated to the arts, politics, and society gossip, the magazine also demonstrated strong support of both the suffragette movement and free trade.Arena 1‚Äì3 (1900). Such political persuasions would become increasingly evident in Chomley‚Äôs later literary works. These works included novels, a biography, short stories, a children's book, and song lyrics, as well as various articles for the publications he contributed to or edited. Over the following few years, Chomley wrote and co-wrote several works, before setting sail for London in 1907. In 1908 he became editor of the British Australasian, a weekly tabloid that provided Antipodeans in London a link to news, markets, weather, and society information from home. Under Chomley‚Äôs editorship, the magazine developed a distinctly more artistic tone, with some summer numbers featuring sketches, poetry, short stories and interviews with prominent members of the Australasian arts community in London.Sleight, Simon. \\"Reading the British Australasian community in London, 1884‚Äì1924.\\" Australians in Britain: The Twentieth-Century Experience. Eds. Carl Bridge, Robert Crawford & David Dunstan. Melbourne: Monash University ePress, 2009. 07.1‚Äì07.12. Print. Themes he favoured in the Arena, such as the arts, politics and gossip, would become permanently infused in the magazine. Matters of religion were largely absent from its pages; after trialling several churches in Melbourne, Chomley had settled on Agnosticism.Niall, Brenda. The Boyds. Melbourne: Melbourne University Publishing, 2007. Print. Pg. 150 Chomley‚Äôs daughters Isla and Francie regularly assisted in the writing of social columns and reviews, with nephews Penleigh Boyd and Martin Boyd also making contributions.Sleight, 2009. 07.7. During this time, Chomley‚Äôs London home in Ladbroke Gardens became a social hub for his fellow Antipodeans; as Brenda Niall writes in her biography of the Boyd family, Chomley‚Äôs restless temper and radical ideas fostered an environment in which topics of any manner could be discussed.Niall, Brenda. The Boyds: A Family Biography. Carlton, Victoria: Melbourne University Press, 2002. Print. Pg 126 During this period of his editorship, a relationship was purportedly cultivated with fellow British Australasian contributor and his wife‚Äôs closest friend, Frances Fitzgerald Elmes (known as Frances Fawkner); it has even been suggested that Chomley fathered two of Elmes‚Äô children.Niall, Brenda. Martin Boyd: A Life. Carlton, Victoria: Melbourne University Press, 1990. Print. Pgs. 74‚Äì76Niall, 2007. 150. By 1914, the British Australasian was firmly established as a fixture of the Australasian community in London. Chomley would remain editor until his death in London in October 1942.Sleight, 2009. 07.6‚Äì07.8. Predeceased by his wife in 1940, Chomley left daughters Isla, Francie, and Betty and son Arthur Charles. Political interests One of Chomley's key interests as reflected in his professional and artistic endeavours was politics. The Australian political climate saw several dramatic changes around the turn of the 20th century, such as the women‚Äôs suffrage movement, alongside many party amalgamations. Australia gained its first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, in 1901 following the federation of the colonies. The 1906 federal election also created waves in Australian politics. This period and the previous years saw contentions by Protectionist, Labor and Free Trade (renamed as Anti-Socialists) Candidates. During this period, Charles Henry Chomley was secretary of the Victorian Citizens League, and had a consistent dialogue with leader of the Protectionist Party; Alfred Deakin.Loveday,P., Martin, A. and Parker, S. The Emergence of the Australian Party System. Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977 Chomley‚Äôs involvement in politics is evident in the literary works he produced. He was also a member of the Council of the Australian Free Trade and Liberal Association, 1904. Chomley published his novel Mark Meredith: A Tale of Socialism in 1905. The novel is important in Australian literary history as it provides an insight into the political state of Australia at this time and is a reflection of the emotions of the Australian peopleEncel, Solomon \\"Political novels in Australia\\": Historical Studies: Australia and New Zealand, 7:27 (1956), 303‚Äì313. Mark Meredith: A Tale of Socialism depicts a fictitious period in Australian history where socialism has been in place for numerous years. Chomley depicts a very negative view of socialism throughout this novel with the novel‚Äôs hero Mark Meredith rising against the socialist powers. Another politically inspired work by Chomley is Protection in Canada and Australasia published in 1904.https://archive.org/details/protectionincan00chomgoog It discusses the two federations of the British Empire in relation to free trade and protectionist battles. Tariff history, national policy and industrial welfare are all detailed by Chomley in this political non-fiction book. Legal interests Chomley's knowledge and interest in the law was also prominently reflected in his writing, influenced by his family's deep involvement in the colonial legal system. The True Story of the Kelly Gang of Bushrangers, published in 1900, was a highly researched biography of the notorious 19th- century Victorian family of bushrangers. Chomley wrote the biography using court documents, police records and court evidence. It is recognised as being one of the most accurate depictions of the story of Ned Kelly, particularly regarding the police involvement. In his discussion of The True Story of the Kelly Gang of Bushrangers, Paul Eggert writes: \\"He often expresses scepticism about the extant accounts of events and of motives, but his attitude is always one of confident understanding and conservative judgement\\".

Hussey Malone Chomley went on to become the Chief Commissioner of Police in Victoria (after F. C. Standish‚Äôs resignation). Chomley also published The Wisdom of Esau in 1901, another of his works that demonstrates an interest in the law. The novel was co-written with fellow farmer Robert Leonard Outhwaite. It is a fictional novel that examines land laws within Australia. Critical reception Chomley gained a largely positive critical reception for many of his works.

Chomley second from left) Charles Henry Chomley is a member of the Chomley, √† Beckett, and Boyd family who have been synonymous with the establishment, the judiciary, publishing and literature, and the arts since the 1800s in Australia. Several of its members have prolifically contributed to Australian history in artistic as well as in political and legal roles. The Chomley family name features most prominently in the legal sphere, particularly through accomplished family members Arthur Wolfe Chomley and Hussey Malone Chomley, in addition to several other Chomleys who studied and practiced law. The √† Beckett family were also well known for their involvement in the legal field. Sir William √† Beckett (1806‚Äì1869) worked as a solicitor, barrister, judge, and eventually Chief Justice. William Arthur √† Beckett (1833‚Äì1901) was a barrister, magistrate and a member of the Upper House.

In addition to his various legal roles, Sir William (Chomley‚Äôs great-uncle) was a writer, journalist and poet. Chomley followed a similar professional path, first pursuing a career in law before channeling his artistic interests into a career in writing.
