Career Early career Born in Cardiff, Evans competed in the Britcar championship in 2008, driving for XL Race Parts in a Porsche 911 GT3 Cup. He was partnered by three different drivers in the three races he entered: Roberts at Silverstone, Steve Bell at the first Brands Hatch round (where he got his best result, 17th, in the second race), and Mark Coleing at the second Brands Hatch round. In 2011, Evans won the Welsh Sports & Saloon Championship. British GT Evans first appeared in the British GT Championship in 2012, driving alongside fellow debutant Zoë Wenham for Century Motorsport in a GT4-class Ginetta G50. Having missed the first round due to licensing issues (with his seat being filled by Ginetta's Mark Simpson), Evans made his debut at the second round of the season, held at the Nürburgring GP circuit. He and Wenham finished third in the first race, and second in race two, in what proved to be a successful debut event for Evans. The season would prove to be a successful one; although a victory eluded the pairing of Evans and Wenham, Wenham was still competing for the title with two races to go (with Evans competing for the runner-up spot, as he had missed the first two races.) Following that event, however, Evans had to settle for third place, the title being won by Team WFR and their driver pairing of Jody Fannin and Warren Hughes. For 2013, Evans moved into the GT3 category, now driving for Blendini Motorsport, alongside team boss Tom Roche in an Audi R8 LMS. It would not prove to be a successful GT3 debut for him, as he and Roche were only able to finish 18th overall in both races. He competed in four more races during the season, but did not score any points. Personal life Evans has a son, Josh, whom competes in the Mazda MX5 Championship.

Background Mohamed Amekrane was born in the Rif in 1938. In 1963 he married Malika Amekrane (born 12 August 1939), a German national. They had two children. Raschid was born on 3 February 1964 and Yasmina was born on 26 February 1965. Lieutenant Colonel Amekrane became the commander of the Moroccan air force base at Kenitra. His command included Northrop F-5 fighter jets supplied by the U.S. Coup attempt In 1972 the Minister of National Defense, Mohamed Oufkir, launched an scheme to assassinate King Hassan II of Morocco. He was assisted by Amekrane and another senior officer. Amekrane's motives appear to have been patriotic, directed against the elite whom he considered to have looted his country following independence. On 16 August 1972 King Hassan II was returning from a trip to France in a Boeing 727 passenger airplane. Four F-5 jets from the Kenitra base attacked the king's plane when it entered Moroccan air space, but although it was hit by many bullets it was not disabled and the king was unhurt. The passenger plane was able to land safely at Rabat-Salé Airport. Later, airforce units attacked the Rabat-Salé Airport and the Royal Palace of Rabat, causing some deaths. Aftermath The same evening Oufkir was called to the palace, where he died of multiple bullet wounds. His death was officially said to have been from suicide. After learning that the attack had failed, Amekrane ordered the crew of a helicopter to transport him and another officer to Gibraltar, where he requested asylum. At first they were held in the officers mess, but later were imprisoned in Lathbury Barracks. They were told this was for their own protection. After brief negotiations between the British and Moroccan governments, a Moroccan air force unit landed in Gibraltar and took the fugitives back to Morocco. The British Foreign Secretary Sir Alec Douglas-Home later said that it was agreed they would not be executed. Amekrane was tried and sentenced to death by a Moroccan court. He was executed by firing squad on 13 January 1973. He was buried at Chefchaouen on 15 January 1973. A large crowd attended his funeral. Eleven pilots were sentenced to death after a short trial. Thirty-five others were given prison terms, which they served in solitary confinement in Tazmamart prison in the southeastern desert. The day after the attempted coup, Malika Amekrane left the country with her children and went into hiding. She appealed to the British for compensation under the European Convention on Human Rights. The British denied liability but made an ex-gratia payment of £37,500.

Life He was the son of John Turner of Narrow Street, Limehouse,a sailmaker and Dorothy Fowler. His sister Harriet married John Woolmore, the Member of Parliament.historyofparliamentonline.org Woolmore, John (1755-1837), of Hampton, Mdx. and Kingsterndale, Derbys. He was educated at Merchant Taylors School, London. The East India Docks on the River Thomas, East London, in the year 1806; the year of their completion Turner owned a sailmaking and canvas firm in Limehouse. He then in 1800 went into a local cordage business with Joseph Huddart, in partnership with Woolmore and Sir Robert Wigram, 1st Baronet. By 1809 he gave up government work for the Naval Board, as inspector of canvas, citing pressure of other business. William Cotton joined Turner's counting-house at age 15, and in 1807 became a partner in Huddart & Co. His father Joseph Cotton was a business associate of Turner in the East India Docks Company, being chairman while Turner was deputy chairman. In 1814 Turner gave evidence to Parliament on the shipping of the East India Company. He chaired the trust that constructed the East India Dock Road, as an extension of Commercial Road, and was also a director of the Phoenix Fire Office. James Walker in 1820 proposed a trial steam vessel voyage to Turner, from London to Edinburgh. It took place in June 1821 on the City of Edinburgh. After James Watt died in 1819, James Watt junior turned to friends to preserve his father's memory, among whom Turner was prominent. Turner went on to chair the committee of 1824 which financed Francis Chantrey's memorial to Watt. During Watt junior's campaign to assert his father's priority claim on the composition of water, Turner in 1839 acted as an intermediary with Robert Brown, to whom he gave some limited access to relevant correspondence (of Joseph Banks and Charles Blagden). Turner was elected a member of the Geological Society in 1813, of the Linnean Society in 1819, and of the Royal Society in 1821. In 1823 he served as High Sheriff of Surrey. He was also a member of the Horticultural Society, the Royal Institution, and the Athenaeum Club, and a manager of the London Institution.Hume Tracts , List of the proprietors and life subscribers of the London Institution, May 1818 (1818), at p. 3.

His portrait was painted by Martin Archer Shee. House and garden In 1817 Turner bought from Matthias Wilks \\"Rook's Nest\\", a house in 140 acres in Surrey. On the way from Tandridge to Godstone, it was described in 1873, when still in the Turner family, as a \\"stately semi- classical mansion with Ionic portico\\".James Thorne, Handbook to the Environs of London, alphabetically arranged, containing an account of every town and village, and of all places of interest, within a circle of twenty miles round London (1876) vol. 2 p. 603; archive.org. In 1838 Thomas Streatfeild commented on the house's busts of James Watt and John Rennie the Elder, portrait of Huddart, and galleries. Wisteria sinensis, from Curtis's Botanical Magazine. Captain Robert Welbank imported for Turner a variety of Camellia japonica, around 1810. It was through Turner's interest in gardening that the Chinese wisteria (Wisteria sinensis) was introduced to the United Kingdom. In May 1816 Welbank, as captain of the East Indiaman Cuffnells, brought a wisteria specimen to Turner as a gift. It may have been despatched by John Reeves, who was based in Guangzhou as a tea inspector for the East India Company; Reeves certainly sent another specimen in 1818, to Kew. It is known that Reeves had seen the plant in the garden of Consequa (his trading name: Pan Changyao 潘長耀), who was a leading hong merchant. The species came in fact from Zhangzhou in Fujian. Another captain, Richard Rawes, brought wisteria from the same garden, arriving a matter of days later: this time destined for a rival gardener, Thomas Carey Palmer of Bromley. Turner initially kept the wisteria specimen in its pot. The Mechanics' Magazine in 1827 identified Turner as a pioneer in steam heating of conservatories, about eight years previously. In fact Turner subjected his wisteria to summer heat (84 °F) in a peach house, where red spider was a problem, and then relative cold in a shady greenhouse after his gardener had repotted it. The plant began to flower in March 1819. Turner's success with wisteria was rewarded by a medal from the Horticultural Society, though his plant, in a pit, never thrived as the Society's one did. It is now regarded as a cultivar, and the name \\"Consequa\\" has been proposed. He had it propagated by the nurserymen Messrs. Loddiges; and switched to the water heating method of William Whale by the November 1827 issue of the Gardener's Magazine. Collections Miniatures by Ozias Humphry, left by Humphry to William Upcott, came to Turner as a bequest from Upcott in 1845. He also collected the works of George Jones, a personal friend. In particular he accumulated the drawings of battles, and chalk and sepia sketches, that Jones made.William Sandby, The History of the Royal Academy of Arts from its Foundation in 1768 to the Present Time vol. 2 (1862) p. 39; archive.org. Turner borrowed letters of James Wolfe from the Warde family, around 1827, to help Robert Southey with a planned biography of Wolfe. They turned up 30 years later, in the estate of Dawson Turner. Plate from Description d'une collection de minéraux, formée par M. Henri Heuland, et appartenant a M. Ch. Hampden Turner, relating to iron pyrites A noted mineral collection was owned by Turner, based on that of Henri Heuland. A catalogue was published in 1837, as Description d'une collection de minéraux, formée par M. Henri Heuland, et appartenant a M. Ch. Hampden Turner, by Armand Lévy (3 vols. and Atlas. London). According to the catalogue's introduction, the collection was founded by Jacob Forster. It was then built up by Heuland, in the period 1806 to 1820, when it was bought by Turner. Its later history saw the collection purchased by Henry Ludlam. It then went as part of a bequest to the Museum of Practical Geology.Albert Carl Ludwig Gotthilf, The History of the Collections contained in the Natural history Departments of the British Museum vol. 1 (1904), pp. 431–2; archive.org. Humphry Davy wrote on a rock crystal he found in Turner's collection. As a compliment to Turner, Lévy named a rare mineral \\"turnerite\\", also called \\"pictite\\". Later, in 1866, James Dwight Dana identified this mineral as monazite. Family Turner married Mary Rhode. Their only son was Charles Hampden, who graduated B.A. at Christ Church, Oxford in 1825, and married Henrietta-Fourness, daughter of Matthew Wilson of Eshton Hall.s:Page:Alumni Oxoniensis (1715-1886) volume 4.djvu/240 He died in 1842, leaving a son of the same name, known as a soldier, who died in 1867.

At times Get Dough or Die is reminiscent of the glory days of his Pimp Squad Clique, with Tip occasionally kicking up and hitting his stride with one of his trademark accelerated flows. But for the most part, the tape is merely a disappointing reminder that money stacks does not a throne make.\\"  Track listing  G.D.O.D. II G.D.O.D.

Background  In August 2014, in an interview with MTV, T.I. revealed plans to release the Grand Hustle compilation, which is tentatively due in December, following his ninth album Paperwork: \\"What's holding up the Hustle Gang project is that we have some new additions to the mix, and we didn't wanna put out the project out without including or allowing those new additions to be part of it. Maybe we'll do a stroke of midnight release on New Years. We did that with F**k Da City Up and it did well, so maybe we'll try that again.\\"http://www.rap- up.com/2014/08/15/ti-readies-paperwork-single-with-pharrell/ On September 19, 2014, the label released the second installment to the G.D.O.D.

Such order was to declare inter alia, that their purported dismissal on 10 December 1987 from the employ of the Transvaal Provincial Administration was wrongful and unlawful. The matter came before Goldstone J.  Facts  The relevant events preceding those of 10 December 1987 were common cause. The first and second respondents had been employed by the Administration as cleaners at the Vereeniging Hospital since 1974 and 1971 respectively. They had, since 1978 and 1976 respectively, been members of, and monthly contributors to, a pension scheme which now fell under the Temporary Employees Pension Fund ActAct 75 of 1979. On 27 October 1987, workers at the hospital went on strike. The reason for the strike was the refusal of the hospital's authorities to recognise the trade union to which the workers belonged and the subsequent dismissal of four of their leaders. The first respondent was on leave at the time, but she subsequently failed, when her leave ended, to return to work. The second respondent likewise stayed away from work. The Administration proceeded to dismiss workers participating in the stay-away. It did so without giving them a hearing. The first respondent and three of her co-workers thereupon brought an urgent application in the Witwatersrand Local Division for an order declaring their purported dismissal wrongful and unlawful and of no force and effect.  Judgment  The matter came before Goldstone J, who granted the application, holding that the applicants' membership of the pension scheme entitled them to a hearing before they could be dismissed, in accordance with the principles of natural justice enshrined in the maxim audi alteram partem. He stated, > That someone in the position of Mrs Mokoena or the other applicants who were > members of the pension scheme can be dismissed and the right to their > pension thereby destroyed on the whim of an official and without enquiry, > must be repugnant to any reasonable and decent person. The unfairness of it > is really patent.917G. He consequently held that the applicants were entitled to a hearing before a decision was taken to terminate their employment and so destroy their right to a pension upon retirement. He further stated that the official determining the question of their dismissal \\"would have been obliged to give honest and bona fide consideration to any representations made by them. Failure to have done so would have vitiated such a decision.918B. In addition to declaring the purported dismissal of the applicants wrongful and unlawful, Goldstone J also granted an order declaring that the applicants \\"remain in the lawful employ of the Transvaal Provincial Administration.\\" The effect of the judgment, therefore, was that the applicants were reinstated in their employment.  Appeal  The applicants appealed successfully against this ruling in Administrator, Transvaal v Theletsane.1991 (2) SA 192 (A).

Biographical notes and musical career Early life Rucher started playing the guitar when his father came back from the United States in 1933 and presented him with a guitar. His parents decided that he should take private music lessons. After a few years’ study, he started playing in public in his hometown and in Naples and Bari. American influence The presence of American troops in the province of Foggia (and particularly in the area of Manfredonia, Rucher's hometown), between 1943 and 1946 led to Rucher joining several Allied Army's orchestras, where he came into contact with American musical atmosphere and jazz. Pino Rucher with the Vitale Orchestra In 1946, Rucher entered the Carlo Vitale orchestra after coming first in a competition for the position of guitarist at Radio Bari. After the dissolution of the Vitale orchestra, Rucher went to work for Radio Milano as a member of the Carlo Zeme orchestra. In the 1950s and the early 1960s he also worked with two forerunners of Italian \\"swing\\", Pippo Barzizza and Cinico Angelini. Angelini Orchestra Angelini selected Rucher as a member of his orchestra, with which Rucher worked for about ten years. He participated in events including the First International Song Festival in Venice in 1955 and several San Remo Music Festivals, among which the 1957 Festival, where Claudio Villa came first with Corde della mia chitarra. Pino Rucher at the guitar with the Angelini Orchestra (1956) Pino Rucher collaborations Rucher took part in many musical events and radio and television broadcasts (San Remo Music Festivals, Naples Festivals, Festival delle rose, Mostra Internazionale di Musica Leggera in Venice, Canzonissima, Gran varietà, Studio Uno) playing in a number of orchestras and, at the same time, went on cultivating his passion for American music, as can be seen from his transcriptions, with his own arrangements. He devoted himself to jazz and performed in live concerts or in studios under the direction of many conductors. The influence of American music can be noticed from his performance of Italian songs E se domani, Una zebra a pois (sung by Mina) and Amore twist (sung by Rita Pavone). He also worked for orchestra conductor and composer Elvio Monti, who asked him to play in a number of his recordings. Rucher played the guitar in L’Estasi, a composition written by Monti for Andrea Giordana and Marina Solinas. Rucher took part in Sorella Radio, a production with the RAI orchestra. From the second half of the 1970s to December 1983, Rucher was engaged in playing in concerts as a guitarist in the RAI orchestra Ritmi moderni, which came to be known as the RAI Big Band. In 1984, owing to health problems, he stopped working for RAI, left Rome and retired. Pino Rucher is given a medal by Pope Paulus VI Other activities Rucher performed in film soundtracks from the late 1950s to the mid 1970s, with at least two hundred performances including those under the direction of orchestra conductors Luis Bacalov, Gianni Ferrio, Elvio Monti, Ennio Morricone, and Riz Ortolani. Rucher was the first guitarist to play the electric guitar in Italian westerns, performing as \\"electric guitar soloist\\" in A Fistful of Dollars. Rucher also appears in some shots from Sanremo - La grande sfida, a 1960 movie including scenes from the San Remo Music Festival. During his career he took part in musicals including Alleluja brava gente and his guitar ideas are present in numerous Italian songs, including Casetta in Canadà (sung by Carla Boni), Flamenco Rock (Milva), Se non ci fossi tu (Mina), Andavo a cento all’ora (Gianni Morandi), Che m’importa del mondo (Rita Pavone), L’edera (Nilla Pizzi) and Adesso no (Neil Sedaka). Rucher played not only the electric guitar, but also the folk (or acoustic), the classical, the bass and the twelve-string guitar, and then the banjo, the mandolin and the double bass. Awards * The Municipal Authority of Manfredonia dedicated a street to Rucher. * On October 5, 2008, the local authorities supported a commemorative event to Rucher in his home town. The event took place in Piazza Giovanni XXIII (Manfredonia's central square).

Removable Bolts negate the need to install permanent protection bolts to the wall, which can be costly and cause cosmetic damage. RBs are designed for use in bolting new sport climbing routes, setting temporary anchors on traditional routes, and on back-country expeditions where abandoning gear or placing permanent gear is not optimal. RBs are particularly popular when placing permanent bolts on steep walls with limited features, where other means of temporary protection, such as hooks, traditional camming devices, or slings, are not an option. By drilling a hole and inserting an RB, the bolter can ascend higher up on the rock before placing the next permanent piece of protection, thereby leaving a reasonable climbing distance between bolts on the finished route. RBs have also been designed and produced for fall prevention and safety in construction and mining operations. Originally produced in the mid 1990s, removable bolts were at first reported to become permanently lodged in the rock after anchoring a fall. In the early 2000s, several companies redesigned the RB and the equipment has received positive feedback from users. RBs are used almost exclusively in bolting and cleaning new lines, often steep limestone, which is soft enough to be drilled with relative ease, and is particularly difficult to bolt without some load bearing anchor. Removable bolts have been designed for particular climbing and industrial circumstances. ClimbTech's Kinder Edition Removable Bolt was designed for climber Joe Kinder, who required an RB that could be used on particularly dirty and moist rock. The additional surface area of the Kinder Edition RB provides better friction in these circumstances, and allowed Kinder and others to establish sport climbs in remote areas where variable rock quality necessitated careful bolt placement. The typical RB is a 1/2 inch stopper designed to fit into a mechanically drilled hole. Other sizes have been developed, and further customizations continue to appear.

It existed since the integration of Principality of Peremyshl into Kingdom of Ruthenia and until 1772, and was one of five lands (see ziemia) of Poland's Ruthenian Voivodeship. Its capital was at Przemyśl, where local sejmiks also took place. Together with Red Ruthenia, Przemyśl Land was annexed by King Kazimierz Wielki in 1340. It remained part of Poland in unchanged form until 1772, when, following the first partition of Poland, it became of Habsburg's province of Galicia. In the 15th century, Przemyśl Land was divided into the following counties: Przemyśl, Jarosław, Leżajsk, Łańcut, Mosciska, Rzeszów, Przeworsk, Sambor, Drohobycz, Stryj, Tyczyn and Zydaczow (the last one was later transferred to Lwów Land). By the 17th century, the number of counties was reduced to four (Przemyśl, Sambor, Drohobycz, Stryj). According to the 1676 royal census, Przemyśl Land had 32 towns and 980 villages. Przemyśl Land had the area of ; more than half of which was County of Przemyśl (almost ). Sambor County had the area of , Stryj County – , and Drohobycz County – only . In comparison to historic Lesser Polands voivodeships, Przemyśl Land was quite extensive – it was larger than neighboring Lublin Voivodeship, and half the size of Sandomierz Voivodeship. Boundaries of Przemyśl Land were not at first precise, so in 1541 royal commission marked its border with Lwów Land, in 1554 the border with Sanok Land was also marked. Some time in the mid-17th century, Przeworsk County was re-created out of northwestern part of Przemyśl County. It was densely populated, with 237 villages and 11 towns, and had its own tax office, located at Przeworsk. Zygmunt Gloger gave the following description of Przemyśl Land: \\"Przemyśl Land was divided into two counties: those of Przemyśl and Przeworsk (...) In 1676, County of Przemyśl had 18 towns and 657 villages, while County of Przeworsk had 18 towns and 221 villages. Przemyśl, known in Latin as Praemislia, and in Ruthenian as Peremysl, is located on the San river. It had an ancient castle and two cathedral churches – Roman-Catholic and Greek- Catholic. Przemyśl is one of the oldest towns, mentioned by Nestor the Chronicler, who wrote that before 981, it belonged to Poland. Since in those years gords were named after their founders (Kraków after Krak, Lwów after Lew), we can assume that it was named after a Lechite Duke Przemyslaw. Among towns of Przemyśl Land there also is Medyka, where in 1434 King Wladyslaw Jagiello listened to a nightingale, caught a cold and died at Grodek Jagiellonski.

Dreger engages in academic work and activism in support of individuals born with atypical sex characteristics (intersex or disorders of sex development) and individuals born as conjoined twins. She challenges the perception that those with physical differences are somehow \\"broken\\" and need to be \\"fixed\\". She has opposed the use of \\"corrective\\" surgery on babies whose genitalia are considered \\"ambiguous\\". She has criticized the failure to follow such patients in later life, and reported longer-term medical and psychological difficulties experienced by some of the people whose sex is arbitrarily assigned. She supported J. Michael Bailey in the face of controversy over his book The Man Who Would Be Queen (2003). Dreger has been criticized by transgender activist Lynn Conway for her support of psychologist Ray Blanchard's taxonomy of trans women. In an article in 2008 and in her 2015 book Galileo's Middle Finger, Dreger argued that the controversy had gone far beyond addressing the scientific theories presented in Bailey's book to become an attack upon the author, creating an out-of-control spiral of identity politics. Dreger has been a featured speaker at TED Talks. She has also worked as a journalist, founding East Lansing Info, a website that covers local affairs in East Lansing, Michigan. Education Dreger received her Ph.D. in History and Philosophy of Science from Indiana University Bloomington in 1995.  Early career  Dreger has taught at both Michigan State University, where she received a Teacher-Scholar Award in 2000, and at Northwestern University (2005–2015). During her doctoral work, Dreger became interested in \\"how and why it is that scientists and medical doctors work to mediate the relationships between our bodies and our selves\\" and \\"why it is we often look to scientists and medical doctors to read or even alter our bodies.\\" In 1995 she published a paper in Victorian Studies examining 19th-century British medical attitudes towards intersex people. In 1998 she published Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex and in 1999, Intersex in the age of ethics. Increasingly, she became engaged in intersex activism as well as scholarship, advocating that doctors accept a wide variety of genital structure rather than \\"correcting\\" babies' genitalia to conform to artificially gendered standards. More recently, she has criticized the prenatal use of dexamethasone to normalize female genitalia in cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and tried to charge that its safety has not been sufficiently tested by pediatrician Maria New. However, the FDA found nothing worth pursuing on this topic. In 2004, Dreger published One of us: conjoined twins and the future of normal, an examination of Conjoined twinning and of surgical practice. Described as \\"a book filled with warmth, humour and unexpected insights\\", it raises similar issues to her earlier work on intersex people: questioning the ways in which the surgical profession defines \\"acceptable limits of the normal\\" and enforces conformity to such norms. She criticizes the lack of long-range follow-up studies of separated children. Dreger also introduces more than twenty sets of conjoined twins, most of whom have adapted happily to the challenges of their situations. One reviewer states that Dreger's intent is to show us the humanity of people whose anatomies differ from ours. In The Man Who Would Be Queen (2003) J. Michael Bailey promoted a hotly disputed theory of transsexualism by Ray Blanchard that characterized male-to-female transsexuals into two groups in a way that was seen by many as deeply offensive. In 2008, Dreger published an article in Archives of Sexual Behavior, describing in detail the opposition to Bailey and his work. A major concern for her was the ways in which attacks targeted him as a person and a scholar, rather than addressing his ideas. Dreger asserted that a theory, even if found threatening or offensive, should be judged by its supporting evidence. She also argued against reduction of the controversy to a simple dualism, seeing the ideas and actions of all those involved as \\"significantly more complicated\\". As result of the paper, Dreger herself was perceived as attacking trans people, and drawn into an ongoing controversy. In 2009, Dreger received a Guggenheim fellowship to study conflicts between activists and scientists. She has examined a number of conflicts including the controversial career of Napoleon Chagnon. Dreger accepts that scientists, being human, have biases and ideologies. But, she argues, they must \\"put the truth first and the quest for social justice second\\" and try to \\"adhere to an intellectual agenda that [isn't] first and only political\\". Galileo's Middle Finger In 2015, Dreger published Galileo's Middle Finger, which covered her observations and experiences with controversies in academic medicine, especially those surrounding human sexuality. They include her work with intersex people, the career of Napoleon Chagnon, Dreger's criticisms of Maria New, and her defense of J. Michael Bailey and its consequences. The New York Times described Dreger's \\"smart, delightful book\\" as \\"many things: a rant, a manifesto, a treasury of evocative new terms (sissyphobia, autogynephilia, phall-o-meter) and an account of the author's transformation\\" from activist to anti-activist and back again. The book also received positive reviews from the Chicago Tribune, Chronicle of Higher Education, Salon, and activist and author Dan Savage. However, Galileo's Middle Finger also reignited controversy over her defense of Bailey and her discussion of transgender issues. Her book was removed from consideration for a Lambda Literary Award after complaints. One critic accused Dreger of transphobia, saying that her book promoted the idea that trans women are \\"just self-hating homosexual men who believe they could have guilt-free sex if they were female and heterosexual men with an out-of- control fetish (autogynephilia)\\". Dreger protested the removal in an open letter to Lambda Literary Foundation. Dreger herself has since reiterated her articulation of ideas in Galileo's Middle Finger that relate to trans women, stating that she considers both gender and sexuality to be relevant and valid concerns for people, and therefore finds value in Blanchard's dual categorization if not his terminology. Later career Dreger resigned from Northwestern University in August, 2015, citing censorship issues. The school had ordered her and other editors of Atrium, a bioethics journal, to take down an article about consensual oral sex between a nurse and patient. Although the article was eventually reposted, the university established its own editorial committee to approve future issues of the journal. Dreger is the founder of East Lansing Info, a non-profit local journalism web outlet covering the city of East Lansing, Michigan. She currently works as publisher, president, and reporter for East Lansing Info.

He translated work by Ignazio Silone and Sigmund Freud.'Eric Mosbacher', The Times, 10 July 1998, p.25 Life Eric Mosbacher was born in London. He was educated at St Paul's School and Magdalene College, Cambridge, graduating in 1924 in French and Italian. After working on local newspapers, he worked for the Daily Express and then the Evening Standard. He also worked as assistant editor of the weekly Everyman and editor of Anglo-American News, the London journal of the American Chamber of Commerce. Mosbacher's wife, Gwenda David, introduced him to the work of Ignazio Silone, and the pair translated Silone's anti-Fascist novel Fontamara in 1934. Often working in collaboration with his wife, Mosbacher continued translating in parallel with his other jobs. During World War II he worked as an interpreter interrogating Italian prisoners of war before joining the Political Warfare Executive in 1943, working alongside Sefton Delmer to produce a German-language newspaper to be dropped on Germany each night. In June 1945 he was sent to the Rhineland, now occupied by the British, to encourage a free press by starting two German-language newspapers there, Kolnischer Kurier and Ruhr-Zeitung. Demobilized in 1946 at the rank of lieutenant-colonel, Mosbacher was a public relations officer for the Ministry of Town and Country Planning before joining The Times as a sub-editor in 1948. Resigning from the Times in 1960, he continued to work at translation. Translations * (with Gwenda David) Fontamara by Ignazio Silone.

DOA5 Ultimate is an expanded edition of 2012's Dead or Alive 5, incorporating some features from the PlayStation Vita's Dead or Alive 5 Plus as well as additional content, including five characters that are new or returning to the series (including two Ninja Gaiden characters), a comprehensive story mode, as well as gameplay system tweaks and expansions, many of them in the online multiplayer tag team mode (including an introduction of two-on-two tag team battles). The game received generally favorable reviews. A free-to-play cut version of DOA5 Ultimate, titled Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate: Core Fighters, was released on the PlayStation Store alongside the retail game. The arcade edition Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate: Arcade was released on 24 December 2013, distributed by Sega. Ultimate was followed by Dead or Alive 5 Last Round in 2015. Gameplay Mr. Strong using the Power Launcher against Tina Besides having fixed all known bugs, Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate adds new training modes from Dead or Alive 5 Plus: Tutorial (a training mode designed to practice key moves and strategies and consisting of the lesson part and the mission part) and Combo Challenge (a special training mode designed to learn and practice combos), as well as Team Fight mode where the players choose up to seven characters. A new gameplay feature, called the Power Launcher and working similar to the Power Blow of DOA5 (that can be used only once per round when the player's character's health falls below 50%), launches opponents high into the air, allowing more advanced players to follow up with a combo. Returning characters also gain new combos. Some major changes were made to the Tag mode gameplay, which now features two-on-two tag battles in online multiplayer (introduced \\"due to high demand from DOA fans around the world\\"). Several of them are supposed to make the new tag team mode better suited for competitive play by high-level players, including a restriction to the amount of health that can be recovered by the character that is tagged out and stays in the background, and a new Tag mode specific attack, called the Force Out, which knocks the opponent's current character out of the ring and forces the opponent to use just the other tag partner for a period of time. The game also features many new tag poses and tag throws unique for various tag teams (depending on the characters that were chosen for the team), as well as new taunts and appeals. The developer Team Ninja also promised to smooth the online fights and shorten the match-finding wait times, while a new system of Character Points is supposed to let the players know how good their opponents are with the currently selected fighters (similar to Street Fighter IVs Battle Points), as well as their world rank. Similar to in DOA5 Plus, the players are also able to choose their own custom music outside Dead or Alive series for the fights; Ultimate also features' the returning characters' past themes. The game comes with new costumes for all characters and includes some of downloadable content (DLC) costume packs from the original game (now as just unlockable content); the remaining DLC costumes (Costume Packs 3, 6, 7 and 8) are not included in the game but can be used with DOA5 Ultimate if they were purchased for DOA5. The game features a total of 231 costumes (more than twice increase from 114 alternate outfits in the original DOA5) that are to be unlockable using new system of Grade Points the players might earn by winning the matches as Prize Fighters in four levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum).

She was added to the console versions in September 2014. Development Previously in 2012, the series' producer Yosuke Hayashi has stated they will not be releasing additional characters or stages as DLC for the original version of DOA5, as Team Ninja views it as unfair to players who cannot afford to pay for the DLC and because it will make it harder to balance the game. A teaser trailer showing Momiji in a new version of DOA5 was shown on April 28, 2013 at a Playse event in Tokyo. On May 8, Famitsu revealed it as Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate, set to be released sometime in fall 2013, and to include all of new content from Dead or Alive 5 Plus and to feature more characters and stages. Later that same month, the launch date was announced as September 3, 2013. The game's director Yohei Shimbori said: \\"Since we launched Dead or Alive 5, we received a lot of feedback from fans around the world. DoA5 Ultimate is a reflection of that feedback we received.\\" He added: \\"We received a lot of feedback on stages, and we've really heard our fans loud and clear on what they wanted.\\" The most requested stages to make a comeback included the Forest and Lost World stages from Dead or Alive 3; another popular request was for a stage with an uneven grounding, resulting in the creation of the Desert Wasteland stage. Team Ninja has held contests to design DLC costumes. Release Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was released first in North America on September 3, 2013, followed by Japan on September 5, Europe on September 6, and Australia on September 26. The official guide book was released in Japan on the same day as the game. Promotion It was announced that the game's Japan-only limited edition titled Kasumi-chan Blue & Momiji Red Package contains Dead or Alive 5 Original Soundtrack Volume 3, a set of 12 \\"I'm a Fighter\\" posters, \\"Kasumi-chan Blue\\" and \\"Momiji Red\\" 3D mousepads, Kasumi and Momiji themed playing cards, life-size tapestries and bath posters, and download codes for the \\"Ultimate Sexy\\" and \\"Idol\\" costume packs.

A standard collector's edition includes a soundtrack CD, \\"Kasumi-chan Blue\\" 3D mousepad, Kasumi playing cards, and a code for the \\"Ultimate Sexy Costume\\".

Exclusive costumes for Christie, Helena, Lisa, Rachel, Tina and Momiji were made available via indie retailers through CentreSoft. In Japan, first-print copies of Tecmo Koei's Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate (Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate) were bundled with DLC codes for special “Orochi” themed DOA5U costumes for Kasumi, Ayane and Momiji. Tokyo Game Show themed booth babe costume for Kasumi was released as a free downloadable content. Bonus DLC costumes for Ryu and Momiji were announced to come with the special edition of Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z. Core Fighters A free digital version of the game, titled Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate: Core Fighters, was released on the PlayStation Store alongside the retail version. Hayashi said he wants to introduce more people to the genre and make them interested, hoping it might help to bring back the fighting games' golden era of the 1990s. Soon after the announcement of Core Fighters, Namco Bandai announced and quickly released Tekken Revolution, their own take on a concept of a free-to-play fighting game. Core Fighters features four playable characters (Ryu Hayabusa, Kasumi, Hayate and Ayane) and almost all of the game's modes, whilst additional playable characters (for $4 each) and the game's Story Mode (for $15) may purchased separately as DLC (Core Fighters is compatible with DLC costumes from DOA5, but comes with no free additional costumes). The digital version has only been announced for PlayStation 3, with an Xbox 360 release slated as 'possible'. Arcade Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate: Arcade was the first DOA arcade game since Dead or Alive 2 Millenium in January 2000.

Famitsu gave it a positive first review and a total of 34/40 (9/9/8/8 out of 10 from the four reviewers). Eric L. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly recommended Ultimate for new players, adding that \\"hopefully, both this full release and Core Fighters will help revive interest in the game's competitive scene.\\" Hedi Kemps of Official Xbox Magazine wrote that \\"despite issues regarding its distribution method, DoA5 Ultimate remains a fun, gorgeous, and accessible fighter, made sweeter by the wealth of new content. There's no better time to hop into the ring.\\" Ryan King of NowGamer gave the PS3 version a score of 7.5/10, adding that \\"shallow but fun\\" Ultimate \\"has packed in a wealth of content alongside its solid fighting game core for a low price.\\" Tom's Guide's Mike Andronico, who awarded the both versions of game four out of five stars, wrote that it is \\"a satisfying update to the DoA experience, for just $40,\\" but cautioned that \\"casual fans content with last year's copy of Dead or Alive 5 might not want to buy another game so soon.\\" Angelo M. D’Argenio of Cheat Code Central opined that Ultimate is a must-have purchase only for those who are still playing Dead or Alive 5, giving the PS3 version a relatively low score of 3.2/5. According to Hardcore Gamer's Adam Beck, however, \\"there’s something here for everyone;\\" he rated the PS3 version a 4/5, calling it the series' \\"most complete and robust experience yet.\\" See also * Dead or Alive 5 Last Round * Ultimate Body Blows * Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 * Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 * The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match References External links * Category:2013 video games Category:3D fighting games Category:ALL.Net games Category:Arcade games Category:Crossover video games Category:Dead or Alive (franchise) video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Video games about ninja Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtua Fighter Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate"},{"id":"39338116","text":"A big cheese is a boss or other senior person, particularly in an organization.

Since 1993, the institute has published its own journal on the medical sciences and clinical research called Scielo. It is published six times per year. On May 26, 2000 the name was changed one more time to the current one, National Institute of Health Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubirán.

The case was heard on November 5, 1990; judgment was delivered on November 30. The respondents' attorneys were SV Khampepe, Johannesburg, and EG Cooper & Sons, Bloemfontein. The appellants had the State Attorney. The court found that an applicant may not seek to base a case on allegations contained in the respondent's answering affidavit where that case has not, in some way, been foreshadowed in the founding affidavit.199B.  Facts  The first and second respondents (as applicants) sought an order in a Local Division against the appellants (as respondents) declaring that their purported dismissal from the employ of the Transvaal Provincial Administration had been unlawful. The respondents' foundational allegation—that they were afforded no hearing—formed no part of the grounds upon which they obtained relief in the court a quo. That court, having regard to the averments made by the appellants (together with such facts as were common cause), held that, although the respondents had indeed been given a hearing, it had not been one which complied with the requirements of the audi rule.  Issues  The issue was whether the Provincial Administration had complied with the audi alteram partem rule in dismissing the respondents.  Arguments  The respondents denied that they had been afforded a hearing of any kind at all, while the appellants in their affidavits chose to show not only # that the respondents had been afforded a hearing; but also # that the hearing had been a proper and fair one. The respondents did not seek to rely on their foundational allegation on appeal; they contended instead that the matter could be decided on the appellants' affidavits. They based their arguments on the premise that it appeared from those affidavits that the hearing did not comply with the audi rule.  Judgment  Botha JA held for the majority (Smalberger JA dissenting) that it was not for the appellants to show that the respondents were given a proper hearing. They were called upon only to meet the specific allegations put forward by the respondents in support of the relief claimed. The appellants were required to answer a case founded on the allegation that the respondents were not given a hearing; they were not called upon in any other way to raise a valid defence to the relief sought. It was not permissible, the court determined, to consider the appellants' affidavits in isolation, divorced from the context of the case they were answering. To the extent that the appellants' affidavits went further than may have been necessary to answer the case as presented, it could not be said the appellants would not be prejudiced if their affidavits were relied upon to determine the nature and ambit of the hearing that took place: To do so would be unfair to the appellants and tantamount to reversing the onus. The court found that there was little scope, if any, for deciding matters of fact on the basis of a respondent's affidavits, where such affidavits dealt with facts not put forward directly in answer to the factual grounds of relief on which the applicant relied, particularly where the affidavits dealt equivocally with such facts, as was the case in the instant matter. As to the issue whether the audi rule had been complied with, it appeared from the appellants' affidavits that the respondents had been given the opportunity to make representations. It was not clear from these affidavits, however, whether this opportunity had been expressed to be an unlimited one embracing all reasons why they should not be dismissed, or a restricted one confined only to reasons as to why they stayed away from work. This ambiguity made it unfair to the appellants to decide the case against them purely on their own affidavits. In dealing with the equivocality of the contentions in the respondent's affidavits, it was not permissible to base factual findings regarding such contentions on a mere weighing up of the probabilities. The court went on to hold that, inasmuch as there was also nothing in the respondents' affidavits worthy of investigation by viva voce evidence, justice required that the application to refer the matter to viva voce evidence had to be refused. The appeal was thus allowed and the decision of the Witwatersrand Local Division, in Theletsane and Others v Administrator, Transvaal, and Others reversed.

Sudfeld's size and catching ability led at least one Patriots reporter to call Sudfeld a \\"baby Gronk,\\"http://www.csnne.com/new- england-patriots/volin-sudfeld-baby-gronk-0 referring to New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. During the Patriots' second preseason game, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Sudfeld scored on a two-point conversion from Tom Brady and on a 22-yard touchdown from Ryan Mallett. On October 3, 2013, Sudfeld was released from the Patriots, after lackluster performances, where Sudfeld made no receptions. New York Jets Sudfeld was claimed off waivers by the New York Jets on October 4, 2013. He caught 5 passes for 63 yards on the season. Sudfeld suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in minicamp and was waived on June 15, 2015. He cleared waivers a day later and was placed on the injured reserve list. On September 3, 2016, Sudfeld was released by the Jets as part of final roster cuts. Personal life Sudfeld has a twin brother named Matt, who is director of strategic development of a humanitarian organization that was started by his grandparents. He also has a brother named Nate, who is a quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles.

The use of the language is through an iPad or iPhone supporting Hopscotch.Hanselminutes Podcast, Show #417, Apr 04, 2014, titled \\"I am teaching my daughter to code with Hopscotch - Fitzgerald Steele\\", 30-minute interview with father whose daughter tried Hopscotch app on iPad. Software development The idea sprang from an already existing programming tool, Scratch, where the user drags blocks into scripts in succession to create a script. This is found much easier by children than typing out the code manually like other programming languages tend to use. The developers of Hopscotch wanted to take a step back from Scratch, making it slightly easier to grasp the concepts and easier to use, so removed many blocks and added some of their own. Hopscotch's notion of events, and rules combining conditions with actions, is similar to AgentSheets. Hopscotch includes basic programming blocks and functionalities such as variables, sprites (called objects) and text objects, but also features considered more advanced such as self variables, math functions and more.  Editor  Hopscotch iPhone editor 223x223px The Hopscotch app uses a UI very similar to that of Scratch. Use of the editor is simple, all one has to do is open the editor, tap the object and script you wish to edit, open one of the block tabs, and drag out code blocks. Most code blocks can have numeric, text, or math inputs. e.g. the \\"move\\" block. The editor work area is mainly based on a grid divided into X and Y-coordinates.  Editor history  The Hopscotch Editor is available on iPhone and iPad. The iPhone version only supported viewing projects until early 2016, when an update supporting editing and account functionality was released. The Hopscotch iPhone projects play in an iPhone format even on the iPad and web player.  When blocks/inputs  When inputs are the trigger for the script to activate, when a \\"when\\" block's input is true (the \\"when project starts\\" when the block is triggered when one opens the player or taps the refresh button) > list of \\"when\\" blocks: > play button is tapped > character is tapped > iPad (iPhone) is tapped > () is tapped > () is pressed > () bumps () > () is touching () > () is not touching () > iPad (iPhone) is tilted (up, down, left, right) > iPad (iPhone) detects a loud noise > iPad is shaken > () is swiped (up, down, left, right) > when I hear > () equals () > () > () > () < () > () ≠ () > object is cloned > (>,<,=,!=) (and, or) (>,<,=,!=)  Code blocks  Code blocks are the actions completed when the blocks are triggered, code blocks fall into 6 categories: abilities, movement, drawing, looks & sounds, values, and control flow. Drag these into and out of the scripts to modify them. Movement blocks make the character move physically on the screen. Ability blocks let you make your own subprogram blocks to duplicate code in a Hopscotch project. Drawing blocks make an object draw stuff. There are 2 “draw” blocks, Draw a Trail and Clear. Draw a trail that draws a trail of selected color and width. There are HSB and RGB options for color. Width is determined by the number of pixels in that trail (citation needed). Looks & sounds blocks are blocks that change the object's looks (such as size, invisibility, and color). Value blocks are blocks that set a value to a specific number or change a value by a specific number. Finally, control flow blocks can either repeat a code multiple or infinite times or add a condition which will make the code inside it execute only if the condition is matched. There is 1 exception, the “Create a Clone” block creates a clone of the object. The clone will not execute any of the code programmed for the original object. That's the job of the “When an object is cloned” block.  Drawing blocks  Drawing blocks in Hopscotch work similar to the turtle module in Python, allowing easy and more complex art to be coded.

Along Ocean Drive, the park shows grassy areas and palm trees, alongside volleyball courts and pull up bars. A wavy pedestrian walk, called the Promenade, separates the grass of the park and the beach up to 21st St, where it turns into boardwalk. The sidewalk is inspired by Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx's oceanfront walk along Copacabana Beach near Rio de Janeiro. The park is a great backdrop for photo shoots, which happen frequently, and it initially became the location for many scenes from the television series \\"Miami Vice\\". The Miami Beach park and the Deco streetscape along Ocean Drive continue to be featured in \\"Miami\\" location shots for television and movies, and can be seen in episodes of the USA Network's Burn Notice.

The Act was introduced by Sir Robert Peel, who had become concerned in the issue after a 1784 outbreak of a \\"malignant fever\\" at one of his cotton mills, which he later blamed on 'gross mismanagement' by his subordinates. The Act required that cotton mills and factories be properly ventilated and basic requirements on cleanliness be met. Apprentices in these premises were to be given a basic education and to attend a religious service at least once a month. They were to be provided with clothing and their working hours were limited to no more than twelve hours a day (excluding meal breaks); they were not to work at night. The Act was not effectively enforced, and did not address the working conditions of 'free children' (children working in mills who were not apprentices) who rapidly came to heavily outnumber the apprentices. Regulating the way masters treated their apprentices was a recognised responsibility of Parliament and hence the Act itself was non- contentious, but coming between employer and employee to specify on what terms a man might sell his labour (or that of his child) was highly contentious. Hence it was not until 1819 that an Act to limit the hours of work (and set a minimum age) for 'free children' working in cotton mills was piloted through Parliament by Peel and his son Robert (the future Prime Minister). Strictly speaking, it is Peel's Cotton Mills and Factories Act of 1819 which (although also ineffective for want of a means of proper enforcement) paved the way for subsequent Factory Acts that would regulate the industry and set up effective means of regulation; but it is Peel's Act of 1802 which first recognised by legislation the evils of child labour in cotton mills that the Factory Acts addressed.  Background  During the early Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom, cotton mills were water-powered, and therefore sprang up where water power was available. When, as was often the case, there was no ready source of labour in the neighbourhood, the workforce had to be imported. A cheap and importable source of labour was 'parish apprentices' (pauper children, whose parish was supposed to see them trained to a trade or occupation ); millowners would reach agreement with distant parishes to employ, house and feed their apprentices. In 1800 there were 20,000 apprentices working in cotton mills,. The apprentices were vulnerable to maltreatment by bad masters, to industrial accidents, to ill-health from their work, ill-health from overwork, and ill-health from contagious diseases such as smallpox, typhoid and typhus, which were then widespread. The enclosed conditions (to reduce the frequency of thread breakage, cotton mills were usually very warm and as draught-free as possible) and close contact within mills and factories allowed contagious diseases such as typhus and smallpox to spread rapidly. Typhoid (like cholera, which did not reach Europe until after the Napoleonic wars) is spread not by poor working conditions but by poor sanitation, but sanitation in mills and the settlements round them often was poor. Elevations of a large water-powered cotton mill In about 1780 a water- powered cotton mill was built for Robert Peel on the River Irwell near Radcliffe; the mill employed child labour bought from workhouses in Birmingham and London. Children were unpaid and bound apprentice until they were 21. They boarded on an upper floor of the building, and were locked in. Shifts were typically 10–10.5 hours in length (i.e. 12 hours after allowing for meal breaks), and the apprentices 'hot bunked' : a child who had just finished his shift would sleep in a bed only just vacated by a child now just starting his shift. Peel himself admitted that conditions at the mill were \\"very bad\\". In 1784 it was brought to the attention of the magistrates of the Salford Hundred that an outbreak of \\"low, putrid fever, of a contagious nature\\" had \\"prevailed many months in the cotton mills and among the poor, in the township of Radcliffe\\". The doctors of Manchester, led by Dr Thomas Percival were commissioned to investigate the cause of the fever and to recommend how to prevent its spread. They could not identify the cause, and their recommendations were largely driven by the contemporary view that fevers were spread by putrid atmospheres and hence were to be combatted by removing smells and improving ventilation: :* Windows and doors should be left open every night and during the lunch break : when the mill was running as many windows as possible were to be left open. ( Natural ventilation was poor because there were too few opening lights in the mill windows, and they were all at the same height (too high). :* The stoves currently used for heating did not give much airflow. Chimneys should be built in each work room and turf fires lit in them to give better ventilation and combat contagion by their \\"strong, penetrating, and pungent\\" smoke. :* Rooms should be swept daily and floors washed with lime water once a week. The walls and ceilings should also be whitewashed two or three times a year. :* The apartments should be fumigated weekly with tobacco. :* Privies should be washed daily and ventilated to ensure that the smell did not permeate to the work rooms. :* Rancid oil used to lubricate machinery should be replaced with purer oil. :* To prevent contagion and to preserve health, all employees should be involved in keeping the factory clean. Children should bathe occasionally. The clothes of those infected with fever should be washed in cold water, then in hot and be left to fumigate before being worn again. Those who died of fever should be wrapped promptly in cloth and those in the vicinity advised to smoke tobacco to avoid infection. The last recommendation expressed a much wider concern about the welfare of mill children: :* We earnestly recommend a longer recess from labour at noon, and a more early dismission from it in the evening, to all those who work in the cotton mills: but we deem this indulgence essential to the present health, and future capacity for labour, of those who are under the age of fourteen; for the active recreations of childhood and youth are necessary to the growth, vigour, and the right conformation of the human body. And we cannot excuse ourselves, on the present occasion, from suggesting to you, who are the guardians of the public weal, this further very important consideration, that the rising generation should not be debarred from all opportunities of instruction at the only season of life in which they can be properly improved. As a result of this report the magistrates decided not to allow parish apprentices to be indentured to cotton mills where they worked at night or more than ten hours in the day. Conditions at the Radcliffe mill were improved; in 1795 John Aikin's A Description of the Country from thirty to forty miles round Manchesterpp. 268–269 in the original;reproduced in said of Peel's mills \\"The peculiar healthiness of-the people employed may be imputed partly to the judicious and humane regulations put in practice by Mr. Peel, and partly to the salubrity of the air and climate.\\" Sir Robert Peel  Peel introduces his Bill In 1795, the medical men of Manchester (with Percival playing a leading part) formed the Manchester Board of Health, which promptly investigated the employment of children in Manchester factories, taking evidence from (amongst others) Peel Gaskell was a surgeon practising in Manchester, but - to anticipate an obvious question - no relation (even by marriage) of Mrs Gaskell now MP for Tamworth. The Board concluded: # It appears that the children and others who work in the large cotton factories, are peculiarly disposed to be affected by the contagion of fever, and that when such infection is received, it is rapidly propagated, not only amongst those who are crowded together in the same apartments, but in the families and neighbourhoods to which they belong. # The large factories are generally injurious to the constitution of those employed in them, even where no particular diseases prevail, from the close confinement which is enjoined, from the debilitating effects of hot or impure air, and from the want of the active exercises which nature points out as essential in childhood and youth to invigorate the system, and to fit our species for the employments and for the duties of manhood. # The untimely labour of the night, and the protracted labour of the day, with respect to children, not only tends to diminish future expectations as to the general sum of life and industry, by impairing the strength and destroying the vital stamina of the rising generation, but it too often gives encouragement to idleness, extravagance and profligacy in the parents, who, contrary to the order of nature, subsist by the oppression of their offspring. # It appears that the children employed in factories are generally debarred from all opportunities of education, and from moral or religious instruction. # From the excellent regulations which subsist in several cotton factories, it appears that many of these evils may be in a considerable degree obviated ; we are therefore warranted by experience, and are assured, we shall have the support of the liberal proprietors of these factories in proposing an application for parliamentary aid (if other methods appear not likely to effect the purpose) to establish a general system of laws for the wise, humane and equal government of all such works.\\" Peel (presumably one of the liberal proprietors with excellent regulations who assured his support) introduced his Bill in 1802. In doing so Peel said that he was convinced of the existence of gross mismanagement in his own factories, and having no time to set them in order himself, was getting an Act of Parliament passed to do it for him but (given his dealings with the Manchester Board of Health) this may well have been a pleasantry, rather than the whole truth. . In 1816 Peel introduced a further Factory Bill; his explanation to the consequent Select Committee of the need for further legislation included this account of the origins of the 1802 Act: > The house in which I have a concern gave employment at one time to near one > thousand children of this description. Having other pursuits, it was not > often in my power to visit the factories, but whenever such visits were > made, I was struck with the uniform appearance of bad health, and, in many > cases, stinted growth of the children; the hours of labour were regulated by > the interest of the overseer, whose remuneration depending on the quantity > of the work done, he was often induced to make the poor children work > excessive hours, and to stop their complaints by trifling bribes > Finding our own factories under such management, and learning that the like > practices prevailed in other parts of the kingdom where similar machinery > was in use, the children being much over-worked, and often little or no > regard paid to cleanliness and ventilation of the buildings; having the > assistance of Dr Percival and other eminent medical gentlemen of Manchester, > together with some distinguished characters both in and out of Parliament, I > brought in a Bill in the 42nd year of the King, for the regulation of such > parish apprentices. The hours of work allowed by that Bill being fewer in > number than those formerly practised, a visible improvement in the health > and general appearance of the children soon became evident, and since the > complete operation of the Act contagious diseases have rarely occurred: text > taken from extract in The Act met little opposition in Parliament, although there was discussion as to whether it should be extended to all manufactories and all workers. The amendment was dismissed as the Act only served to ensure education for apprentices not to improve conditions in factories. Provisions Child apprentices in a cotton mill Under the Act, regulations and rules came into force on 2 December 1802 and applied to all mills and factories employing three or more apprentices (unless the total workforce was less than twenty). It stated that all mills and factories should be cleaned at least twice yearly with quicklime and water; this included ceilings and walls. There was a requirement that the buildings have sufficient windows and openings for ventilation. Each apprentice was to be given two sets of clothing, suitable linen, stockings, hats, and shoes, and a new set each year thereafter. Working hours were limited to 12 hours a day, excluding the time taken for breaks. Apprentices were no longer permitted to work during the night (between 9 pm and 6 am). A grace period was provided to allow factories time to adjust, but all night-time working by apprentices was to be discontinued by June 1804. All apprentices were to be educated in reading, writing and arithmetic for the first four years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much time should be set aside for it. Educational classes should be held in a part of the mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices were to be taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed. Local magistrates had to appoint two inspectors known as visitors to ensure that factories and mills were complying with the Act; one was to be a clergyman and the other a Justice of the Peace, neither to have any connection with the mill or factory. The visitors had the power to impose fines for non-compliance and the authority to visit at any time of the day to inspect the premises. The Act was to be displayed in two places in the factory. Owners who refused to comply with any part of the Act could be fined between £2 and £5.  Effect of the Act  A small water- powered cotton mill and its power source The Act required magistrates to appoint visitors, whom it empowered to inspect mills and report on their findings, but it did not require them to exercise their powers. Consequently, unless local magistrates were particularly interested in the issue, the Act was poorly enforced. Where factories were inspected, the visitors were amateurs (as indeed they were) in comparison to the paid Factory Inspectorate set up by the 1833 Act. Furthermore, the Act applied only to apprentices, and not to 'free children' whose fathers' right to dispose of their children's labour on whatever terms they chose were unaffected by the Act. Improvements in the generation of rotary motion by steam engines made steam-powered cotton mills a practical proposition; they were already operating in Manchester in 1795, using free children drawn from the local population. The great advantage parish apprentices had had was that they were tied to the mill, no matter how remote the mill had to be to avail itself of water power. If the mill no longer had to be remote, it became a problem that the mill was tied to the apprentices. Apprentices had to be housed clothed and fed whether or not the mill could sell what they produced; they were in competition with free children whose wages would fall if the mill went on short time (and might not reflect the full cost of housing clothing and feeding them, since that was incurred whether they were working or not) and who could be discharged if sick, injured or otherwise incapable of work. Consequently, the use of free children came to predominate: the Act became largely a dead letter within its limited scope, and inapplicable to most factory children. In 1819, when Peel introduced a Bill to introduce an eleven-hour day for all children under 16 working in cotton mills, a Lords Committee heard evidence from a Bolton magistrate who had investigated 29 local cotton mills; 20 had no apprentices but employed a total of 550 children under 14; the other nine mills employed a total of 98 apprentices, and a total of 350 children under 14. Apprentices were mostly found in the larger mills, which had somewhat better conditions; some even worked a 12-hour day or less (the Grant brothers' mill at Tottington worked an 11.5 hour day: \\"This establishment has perfect ventilation; all the apprentices, and in fact all the children, are healthy, happy, clean, and well clothed ; proper and daily attention is paid to their instruction ; and they regularly attend divine worship on Sundays.\\"): in other mills children worked up to 15 hours a day in bad conditions (e.g. Gortons and Roberts' Elton mill: \\"Most filthy; no ventilation; the apprentices and other children ragged, puny, not half clothed, and seemingly not half fed; no instruction of any sort; no human beings can be more wretched\\"). Although the Act was largely ineffective, it has been seen as the first piece of Health & Safety legislation, leading the way to subsequent regulations covering industrial workplaces; its requirement for factory walls to be whitewashed continued to be a legal requirement until the Factories Act 1961. Opinions differ as to the deeper significance of the Act. Some scholars have linked the Act to a move away from laissez-faire capitalism, or see it as marking the point where the state began to recognise its responsibility for very poor children, and to address the conditions in which they were living; it has also been seen as presaging subsequent legislation regarding the health of towns. Others see it as at heart one of the last manifestations of the old Elizabethan Poor Law, which directed that destitute children should be apprenticed in a trade; (more accurately of the Statute of Artificers of 1562 which set up systems for regulating apprenticeships): during Parliamentary debates on the Bill that interpretation was successfully urged against any attempt to widen its applicability.

He played in the Midland League for York City, and also played non-league football for Easington Colliery Welfare and Washington Colliery. Life and career Merritt was born in Shiney Row, County Durham, in July 1897. He played for Easington Colliery Welfare before the First World War, and afterwards signed for South Shields of the Football League Second Division. He made his Football League debut on 8 April 1922, in a 4–0 defeat away to Blackpool, and played once more the following season, before moving on to Durham City of the Third Division North. He was a first-team regular in the side for two seasons, making 73 appearances, and was popular with the supporters, despite a tendency to shoot from unlikely positions on the pitch. He was transfer-listed at the end of the season, then spent a season with another third-tier club, Lincoln City, half the time in the first team and the rest with the reserves in the Midland League. Having failed to find a new employer at Football League level, Merritt was very briefly attached to Washington Colliery before joining Midland League club York City for the 1926–27 season. He played and scored regularly for a season and a half before breaking his ankle during a match in January 1928. He regained fitness in time to play in the last match of the season, and was selected for the annual match between the league champions, in this case Gainsborough Trinity, and an eleven representing the rest of the league. He finished his three seasons with York City with 31 Midland League goals from 70 matches, and was again selected for the Rest against champions Mansfield Town. He signed for Second Division Notts County for the 1929–30 season, but although he scored freely for their reserves in the Midland League, he found it difficult to break through the first team. He made his debut on 30 November 1929 against Tottenham Hotspur, but that was his only first-team appearance and was given a free transfer at the end of the season. He returned to the north east and played for his former club, Easington Colliery Welfare. The 1939 Register finds Merritt living with his wife, Edith, and two children in Henry Street, Houghton-le-Spring, and working as a general labourer. He died in Sunderland in 1978 at the age of 80.

New Suburbanists seek to establish an alternative between a dichotomy of the centripedal city and centrifugal suburb, by features such as rear-loading garages and walking-focused landscaping. The design strategy for New Suburbanism differs from the traditional postwar suburban development. In contrast to post-war suburbanism where the homebuyer had few options in regards to customization, new suburban communities feature customization through packages and add-ons as well as larger homes in denser communities. Postwar suburban developments have since filled in with homes and businesses began emerging there, outside of the city- center. This created new communities, not just suburban housing. Suburban sprawl is associated with negative effects because it often takes over farm land, disrupts ecosystems, has low-density housing, and car-dependent communities.

From 2008 to 2010 he was director of the Archives of the Security Service of Ukraine. In 2010-2011 he was senior visiting scholar at the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University, working in particular with the archival documents of Mykola Lebed. In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election Viatrovych was number 25 on the election list of European Solidarity. Viatrovych is seen as a controversial figure in both Ukraine and abroad. He has been accused of whitewashing the history of Ukraine, marginalizing or suppressing the facts about involvement of chauvinism motivated Ukrainian nationalists in genocide against Polish Nation, involvement of Ukrainian nationalists in Shoa and their collaboration with German Nazis, and promoting laws restricting free speech and scientific freedom.  Biography and academic career, 1994 to present From 1994 to 1999 Viatrovych was a student at the history faculty of Lviv University (West Ukraine) where he specialised in Ukrainian history. In 2004 he defended his doctoral thesis: “UPA raids beyond Ukrainian borders as part of the creation of an anti-totalitarian national-democratic revolution among the nations of East-Central Europe”. (He had already issued a book on the subject in 2001.) From November 2002 to March 2008 Viatrovych was director of the Centre for the Study of the Liberation Movement, based in Lviv. In 2005 and 2006 he lectured at the Ukrainian Catholic University. During that time he drew up the first course in Ukrainian higher education on “The Ukrainian Liberation Movement from the 1920s to 1950s” for students of the historical faculties of the Catholic University and the Ivan Franko Lviv University. From August 2005 to December 2007 Viatrovych was a research associate at the I. Kripyakevich Institute for Ukrainian Studies at the National Academy of Sciences in Kyiv. In 2010-2011 he worked in the US at the Ukraine Research Institute at Harvard University. Viatrovych subsequently became director of the Center for the History of State-Building in Ukraine at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.\\"The New Director of the Ukrainian National Memory Institute says that Historical Memory Policy is a Safeguard Against Repeating the Crimes of the Past\\", Center for the Study of the Liberation Movement (website), 23 March 2014.  National Remembrance, 2007 to 2019  Volodymyr ViatrovychBetween May 2007 and January 2008 Viatrovych was a representative of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance for Lviv Oblast. In 2008 he served as research consultant to the international project, “Ukraine Remembers, the World Acknowledges” which aimed to popularise the subject of the Holodomor, the 1932-3 famine in Ukraine, and, through international lobbying, to gain world recognition that this was an act of genocide. From January to October 2008 Viatrovych was head of the archives department at Ukraine's Institute of National Remembrance. From October 2008 to March 2010 Viatrovych was adviser on research to Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, the head of the SBU or Security Service of Ukraine (2006-2010). Viatrovych was a moving force behind the idea of putting Stalin and other Soviet leaders of the time on trial for genocide for their part in the Holodomor. They were found guilty in January 2010 by the Court of Appeal in Kyiv (prompting an indignant reaction from certain Russian officials).\\"Yushchenko brings Stalin to court over genocide\\", RT.com, 14 January 2010. Viatrovych has been a trustee of the Lontsky Prison National Museum-Memorial to the Victims of Occupation Regimes (Nazi and Soviet) in Lviv, since it was set up and opened to the public in 2009. From March 2008 onwards he has chaired the research council of the Centre for the Study of the Liberation Movement (Lviv). On 25 March 2014 Viatrovych was appointed Director of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance. In September 2019 the Cabinet of Ministers dismissed Viatrovych from the position of the Director.\\"Ukraine fires historian criticised for rehabilitating wartime nationalists idolised by the far right\\" (retrieved September 23, 2019)  Political activism, 2004 & 2013-2015  When the Orange Revolution took place in 2004 Viatrovych took an active part, supposedly as a leader of the Pora (\\"It's Time!\\") youth movement. During the Euromaidan protests in 2013 Viatrovych called for active measures against the authorities.Mariana Petsukh, \\"Volodymyr Vyatrovich: 'We are obliged to leave the Maidan as an organised force',\\" Evropeiska Pravda website, 23 December 2013 (in Ukrainian). He coordinated mass demonstrations and led a column of activists to block the government buildings and the parliament (Verkhovna Rada). Speaking of the rotation of Euromaidan activists he recalled the activities of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army or UPA: “In the 1940s and 1950s conditions in the underground were worse: people did not leave temporarily to go back to work, but because a comrade had gone forever. That is why we shall succeed!” He also commented: “We do not intend to halt after the regime has changed in Ukraine, when we have got rid of the rule of Yanukovych.”Mariana Petsukh, \\"Volodymyr Viatrovych: 'We are obliged to leave the Maidan as an organised force',\\" Evropeiska Pravda website, 23 December 2013 (in Ukrainian). In May 2015 President Petro Poroshenko approved four laws concerning Decommunization in Ukraine. Volodymyr Viatrovych was involved in the drafting of two of these laws. The criminal sentences imposed by these acts and their phrasing came in for criticism within the country and abroad. The law \\"On access to the archives of repressive bodies of the communist totalitarian regime from 1917-1991\\" placed the state archives concerning repression during the Soviet period under the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance, then headed by Volodymyr Viatrovych.Halya Coynash, \\"'Decommunization' in Ukraine Carried Out Using Communist Methods\\", Human Rights in Ukraine website, 9 June 2016.  2019 election to parliament  In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election Viatrovych was number 25 on the election list of European Solidarity. Only the first 23 candidates were elected. But after Iryna Lutsenko gave up her mandate Viatrovych did replace her and he was sworn in as People's Deputy of Ukraine on 3 December 2019.

Viatrovych as historian (2002-2012)  The first Volodymyr Viatrovych's book about the rallies of Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in Czechoslovakia was written based on his PhD thesis. It was devoted to a little explored area, and that this work has been appreciated and probably resulted in Viatrovich's appointment a director of TsDVR (Centre for the Study of the Liberation Movement).  Army of the Immortals, 2002  His third book Army of the Immortals (2002) was discussed some years later on the Polit.ru website by Professor Alexei I. Miller of the Central European University in Budapest and Ukrainian historian Georgy Kasyanov from the National University of Kyiv- Mohyla Academy. In Miller's view the book was essentially glorification of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). Many historical sources were disregarded in the book's writing, says Miller, and falsified stories were cited. Viatrovych preferred to ignore all criticism of the Army of the Immortals that originated within the academic community, says Miller. In 2013 similar concerns about discussion of the past, the role and influence of Volodymyr Viatrovych, and the impact of divergent views on the present were raised in a discussion following a Columbia University workshop on “Russian and Ukrainian Nationalism: Entangled Histories”Taras Kuzio, \\"This is not how Ukrainian history should be debated\\", The Ukrainian Weekly, 19 May 2013.Discussion of David Marples, \\"The Limits of Tolerance\\", Current Politics in Ukraine website; contribution by Halya Coynash, 3 June 2013.  OUN attitudes towards the Jews, 2006  This book provides a one-sided view on the OUN's attitude towards Jews.Taras Kuryło, John-Paul Himka, “Iak OUN stavylasia do ievreiv? Rozdumy nad knyzhkoiu Volodymyra Viatrovycha”, Ukraina Moderna 13 (2008), pp.252-265 The book portrays the Ukrainian nationalists and UPA as a \\"national liberation\\" movement and deny any accusations in their collaboration with Nazi Germany and involvement in the Holocaust. In his book Viatrovich presents only one critical article on OUN's anti-semitism, with the only purpose to immediately dismiss it. John-Paul Himka and Taras Kurylo describe Viatrovich's methodology as follows: Other authors agree that this book is an attempt to deny the crimes of Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) on Jews and to dismiss the allegations of its anti-Semitism.Per A. Rudling, \\"The OUN, the UPA and the Holocaust: A Study in the Manufacturing of Historical Myths\\", The Carl Beck Papers in Russian & East European Studies, No. 2107, November 2011, , pp.28-31Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe, \\"Debating, obfuscating and disciplining the Holocaust: post-Soviet historical discourses on the OUN–UPA and other nationalist movements\\", East European Jewish Affairs, 42:3, pp. 207-208 In the opinion of Kurylo and Himka, this work does less to understanding history, but does much to distort it, however it contains an interesting material and forms the basis for further discussions on the relationship of the OUN and UPA to Jews.Taras Kuryło, John-Paul Himka, “Iak OUN stavylasia do ievreiv?..., p.264 As an example of alleged collaboration of Jews with UPA and as an evidence of the Ukrainian nationalist forces' lack of anti-semitism, Viatrovych mentions Leiba Dubrovskii, an alleged Jewish member of UPA and genuine Ukrainian nationalist. However, in reality Dubrovskii was a Soviet POW who concealed his ethnicity when was captured by Germans. He never disclosed his real ethnicity to UPA members and was no enthusiastic supporter of Ukrainian nationalism.  The Second Polish-Ukrainian War, 2011  In this book, Viatrovych is trying to address arguably the most terrible, atrocious issue in the history of OUN and UPA: Volynian massacre. In attempts to exonerate Ukrainian nationalists, Viatrovich presents the UPA's massacre of Polish civilians as a part of a military conflict, i.e. as a war between Poles and Ukrainians, which he calls The Second Polish-Ukrainian War, thereby implying that the events he describes were a continuation of the Polish-Ukrainian war (1918–19). Viatrovych tries to prove that there was no order of OUN's leadership for the extermination of the Polish minority, and the Volynia massacre was just a spontaneous rebellion of Ukrainian peasants provoked by the Poles. \\"The Second Polish-Ukrainian war\\" was met in West Ukraine with uncritical enthusiasm.Portnov (2012), p. 326.Abstract.Андрей Портнов, \\"Истории для домашнего употребления\\", p. 326 However, Viatryovych's attempts to downplay or conceal OUN-UPA's military crimes have been condemned by several scholars. Ivan Katchanovski (University of Ottawa) states that the aim of Viatrovych in disseminating his narrative was to \\"restore Bandera's good name\\" mostly in the mass media and in non- academic or unscholarly publications.I.

It can also be formed geometrically, by gluing together n/3 − 1 triangular prisms on their triangular faces. This graph, and graphs closely related to it, have been frequently used in graph drawing to prove lower bounds on the area requirements of various styles of drawings. Polyhedral representation Triangular bifrustum The nested triangles graph with two triangles is the graph of the triangular prism, and the nested triangles graph with three triangles is the graph of the triangular bifrustum. More generally, because the nested triangles graphs are planar and 3-vertex- connected, it follows from Steinitz's theorem that they all can be represented as convex polyhedra. An alternative geometric representation of these graphs may be given by gluing triangular prisms end-to-end on their triangular faces; the number of nested triangles is one more than the number of glued prisms. However, using right prisms, this gluing process will cause the rectangular faces of adjacent prisms to be coplanar, so the result will not be strictly convex. Area lower bounds for graph drawings Grid drawing of a nested triangles graph. This layout uses less area than but unlike theirs does not generalize to maximal planar supergraphs of the nested triangles graph. The nested triangles graph was named by , who used it to show that drawing an n-vertex planar graph in the integer lattice (with straight line-segment edges) may require a bounding box of size at least n/3 × n/3. In such a drawing, no matter which face of the graph is chosen to be the outer face, some subsequence of at least n/6 of the triangles must be drawn nested within each other, and within this part of the drawing each triangle must use two rows and two columns more than the next inner triangle. If the outer face is not allowed to be chosen as part of the drawing algorithm, but is specified as part of the input, the same argument shows that a bounding box of size 2n/3 × 2n/3 is necessary, and a drawing with these dimensions exists. For drawings in which the outer face may be freely chosen, the area lower bound of may not be tight. showed that this graph, and any graph formed by adding diagonals to its quadrilaterals, can be drawn within a box of dimensions n/3 × 2n/3. When no extra diagonals are added the nested triangles graph itself can be drawn in even smaller area, approximately n/3 × n/2, as shown. Closing the gap between the 2n2/9 upper bound and the n2/9 lower bound on drawing area for completions of the nested triangle graph remains an open problem.. Variants of the nested triangles graph have been used for many other lower bound constructions in graph drawing, for instance on area of rectangular visibility representations,. area of drawings with right angle crossings. or relative area of planar versus nonplanar drawings..

A native of Williamsburg, Virginia, Montgomery attended Bruton High School, and was drafted by the Yankees out of Longwood University in the 11th round of the 2011 MLB draft. He won the Yankees' Kevin Lawn Award for 2012. Career New York Yankees Montgomery began his career with the Class A- Staten Island Yankees of the New York–Penn League in 2011 where he pitched four games before being promoted to the Class A Charleston RiverDogs for the rest of the year. Between the two teams, he had a 1.91 ERA, 51 strikeouts, 13 walks, and 15 saves in 26 games with 28.1 innings pitched, with no win-loss record. The next year, Montgomery pitched for the Yankees' A+ and AA teams, the Tampa Yankees and Trenton Thunder. He went 7-2 with a stellar 1.54 ERA in 46 games/64.1 innings pitched with 99 strikeouts, 22 walks, and 15 saves once again. In 2013, Montgomery started the year with the AAA club of the Yankees, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. Besides a four- game stint with the GCL Yankees, he spent the whole season with the RailRiders. For the season, his ERA regressed slightly from his first two years, settling at a still-respectable 3.38 in 29 games (four of which were starts with the GCL Yankees) and 45.1 innings pitched to go along with his 59 strikeouts, 25 walks, and 2-3 record. Montgomery's 2014 season was split between Trenton and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, with 17 appearances in AA and 22 in AAA. For the season between the two teams, he held a 2-1 record, 2.10 ERA (including a microscopic 0.81 for Trenton), 51 strikeouts, 26 walks, and 4 saves in 51.1 innings pitched. Detroit Tigers Montgomery signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers on November 25, 2017. The deal included an invitation to the Tigers' 2018 spring training camp. Montgomery was assigned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, where he made 12 appearances with a 1.98 ERA in innings pitched. He was released on July 8, 2018, reportedly after suffering a potentially season-ending elbow injury. Boston Red Sox On July 20, 2018, Montgomery signed with the Boston Red Sox, in a minor league deal to run through the 2019 season. In August, Montgomery pitched for the Gulf Coast League Red Sox and the Class A-Advanced Salem Red Sox on rehabilitation assignments, making two relief appearances with each team and allowing a total of four earned runs in innings pitched. Montgomery started the 2019 season on the injured list with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. He was released from the Red Sox organization on May 16, 2019.

Keller Library and Community Center is located in the Broadmoor neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. It stands on the corner of Napoleon Avenue and South Broad Street which serve as the north/south, east/west markers in the neighborhood. The library is a branch of the greater New Orleans Public Library System. The Broadmoor branch serves as one of the only centers for community engagement in the neighborhood and hosts adult education classes, art workshops, after- school activities for children, and community events throughout the year. It opened its doors on March 17, 2012. Early history The original building housing the Rosa F. Keller Library served as a private family residence for many years before being sold to the city in 1990. One of the first homes in the area, Mrs. Ethel Aubert Hardie purchased the eight-room stucco home after its completion in 1918 at a cost of $9500. It was one of the most recognizable landmarks in the neighborhood. After the Hardie family enlarged the property and sold it in 1924, ownership transferred once more before the home's final resident, Dr. Ida Finkelstein Fattel, sold it to the city of New Orleans for $215,000 in 1990. Due to its architectural significance, the New Orleans Historic Districts/Landmarks Commission designated the home a historic landmark under the name of Hardie-Fattel House in 1986. The home opened as the Broad Branch of the New Orleans Public Library in November 1993.  Rosa Keller Dedication  The branch was named in honour of civil rights advocate and New Orleans Public Library pioneer, Rosa Freeman Keller in October of 1999. Rosa Freeman Keller was born in New Orleans in 1911. A white heiress to a Coca-Cola bottling fortune, Keller could easily have chosen to live out her days quietly and comfortably in her Uptown home, with little social reflection. Instead, she used her finances and influence to launch a lifelong fight for racial equality in the city of New Orleans. She became the first woman to serve on a citywide board in New Orleans as a member of the board of the New Orleans Public Library, and used that position to push for the integration of the library system. Keller received numerous honors for her work on racial issues in New Orleans, including the Times-Picayune Loving Cup Award, which honors New Orleans residents who have worked unselfishly for the community without expectation of public acclaim or material reward. She also received an honorary alumnus degree from Newcomb College and an honorary doctorate from Dillard University. She died on April 15, 1998, in New Orleans. The Keller Family Foundation, established in 1949, continues to provide monies to sustain and improve the New Orleans community. The Rosa F. Keller Library & Community Center at 4300 S. Broad was named for her. Construction after Katrina Topographically one of the lowest points in New Orleans, Broadmoor suffered extensive damage due to Hurricane Katrina. In 2006, the neighborhood was deemed a drainage point in the city's reconstruction plan under the Bring New Orleans Back Commission that was led by former mayor Ray Nagin. The proposal was met with strong opposition as residents rallied to save their neighborhood from disinvestment and destruction. The Keller Library became an important symbol of Broadmoor and a natural locus for redevelopment efforts with the Broadmoor Improvement Association, founded in 1930, touting the notion of an education corridor as central to its neighborhood vision. This corridor consists of the expanded Keller Library and Community Center, the Andrew H. Wilson Charter School and the Broadmoor Arts and Wellness Center. The result of a lengthy process of planning, fundraising and review was the total rehabilitation of the historic home with the construction of an entirely new wing, designed by renowned New Orleans architecture firm Eskew+Dumez+Ripple. Gibbs Construction served as the construction company. The new construction had a cost of $6.8 million, and the area was to be . While the house was to be renovated and serve specifically as a community center, the 1993 building was to be demolished. A technology center with 28 computers and the Green Dot Cafe were to be placed in the new library building replacing the previous one. Both the house and the new library building were to be connected by a corridor. During the recovery, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Louisiana Recovery Authority planned a $15.8 million effort to build or rebuild six libraries in the region. Keller was awarded $3.4 million toward building a state-of-the-art library and community center to serve as the local community's learning and cultural hub. FEMA was to pay for the costs of demolition of the previous library and construction of the new library since the previous facility had been, according to FEMA's estimation, over 50% damaged by Katrina. The features and amenities present in the new facility that were not in the previous facility were financed by other sources, including New Orleans municipal bond sales and funds from the Louisiana Recovery Authority. The \\"design-build\\" process, one specially allowed only in parishes affected by Hurricane Katrina under Louisiana law, was used to rebuild this library and four others. The library also benefitted from a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Foundation, which the Broadmoor Improvement Association secured independently through private-public partnerships established during the recovery process. The total cost of the renovation and expansion was $6.8 million. Building design The use of natural sunlight is key within the library where access to books, social interaction and connectivity to the internet are all equally important. As much a social hub as it is an academic center, the library was rebuilt within the framework of a 21st-century model to allow technological access for community members that may not have it at home. The floor of the new addition is aligned with the renovated home, both built on raised footings above the Base Flood Elevation line. At its center, the new building contains a small courtyard surrounded by glass walls that is visible from within the main library. The buildings largest and most expansive space holds the computer and reading tables, main desk and library office, which functions as an enclosed light in green glass, illuminating the space. The design takes a more sustainable approach to wood paneling which uses recycled wooden slats around the parameter of the reading space. Shaded skylights filter harsh sunlight allowing the space to be naturally cooled during hot weather. The tinted glass light well also helps to vary the natural light across the space and throughout the day. Other areas are clad in perforated metal panels meant to mimic the textured stucco of the original home. Though the uses are separate, both the library and the community center complement each other in design by including a semi-raised horizontal axis that reaches its lowest point at the entrance. Cultural significance The library stands as a model for Post- Katrina development and symbolizes the triumph that Broadmoor has achieved after the storm. Visually different from the residential buildings surrounding the structure, the Rosa F. Keller Library and Community Center highlights the architectural innovation that certain communities have embraced with rebuilding. The neighborhood is a demographic microcosm of New Orleans with 67 percent African American, 26 percent white, and 4 percent Hispanic, all of whom are served by the establishment of the library and the resources it has.

The concept goes back to the 1980s with video games, but only in the 1990s with three-dimensional graphics and the 2000s with the use of motion sensors for realistic movements (motion control) has the technology been able to simulate the real situation. The most common type of surgery taught through this method is laparoscopic surgery, although it has also been used to do a trial run before other kinds of procedures. Cataract surgery and other ophthalmic procedures are also widely taught using surgical simulators. Uses Surgery simulators are generally used to train medical students and surgeons in specific types of procedures without the use of animals or cadavers before working with live patients. They are best suited for two types of skills needed for surgery, eye–hand coordination and the ability to perform three dimensional actions using a two-dimensional screen as a guide. Eye–hand coordination is improved because the simulation can give both visual feedback, by way of a screen, as well as tactile feedback that simulates the manipulation of organs and tissue. This kind of virtual reality is most often used in the training of surgeons in laparoscopic procedures, as in reality it is not possible to see the operation being performed. The simulator uses a computer screen displaying a three-dimensional graphic of the organs being operated on. Various surgical tools or gloves are connected to motion sensors and haptic or tactile feedback mechanisms where the user can physically feel the difference in simulated tissue and organs. The user can \\"perform surgery\\" upon the virtual organs by manipulating the tools, which are also displayed on the screen as the user moves them, and the tools also provide force-feedback and collision detection to indicate to the user when they are pushing on or moving some organs or tissue. By inputting data from computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans the patient can be replicated in the virtual environment. The simulations can also provide more intensive training activity with the introduction of rare pathological cases and complications. However, the use of these simulators has its limitations. While significant gains have been seen with their use in novices, their effectiveness diminishes as the procedure is repeated with students reaching a plateau. For more experienced surgeons, the use of these simulators have had very limited use. Development of the technology Virtual surgery as a means to simulate procedures and train surgeons grew out of the video game industry. Video games for entertainment has been one of the largest industries in the world for some time. However, as early as the 1980s, companies such as Atari began working on ideas of how to use these video environments for training people in different tasks and different professions. Younger trainees in the medical field showed greater eye–hand coordination and quick thinking abilities over those who had never played. Although graphics were extremely limited, Atari began developing several types of simulators related to health care. This type of training met with strong skepticism until studies in the mid-1980s began to show that the concept had promise. However, the graphic and interactive limitations of video games hindered their development and usefulness until the 1990s, when companies such as Nintendo and Sony began to produce three dimensional polygon graphics to produce the concept of “virtual reality.” This improved more with the introduction of Wii systems what allowed more realistic manipulation of the virtual reality through motion sensors. Studies at this time showed that the new interaction method improved coordination and space perception. The advances also allowed the technology to move from “game” to “simulator.” DaVinci Surgical System programmed their first simulator for laparoscopic surgery in 2005, and its accuracy and design made it quickly accepted by surgeons. While most of this technology has been used for general surgical training, it has also been used to plan specific surgeries as well. The first virtual surgery (where actual surgery followed the virtual practice) was performed on 17 August 2009 when Dr. David Clarke in Halifax, Nova Scotia removed a brain tumour 24 hours after removing a simulated tumour. By 2010, numerous hospitals had some kind of simulation technology available for medical professionals, especially for the training of laparoscopic procedures. The use of this kind of simulation technology continues to be important, especially with younger generations of medical students. These students have grown up with both entertainment video games and serious games, those developed for educational purposes, making the use of simulators both more acceptable and effective. These students have been shown to more readily benefit from this kind of training, especially in areas of laproscopic procedures and suturing. Examples The most widely used simulator for laparoscopic surgery today is the da Vinci Surgery Simulator. It is the newest way to practice these procedures that involves the surgeon in the surgery and control of the device. The simulator is a tutorial that prepares a surgeon for the real surgery at the da Vinci Surgical System. It contains real time images, identical controls of the original device and potential problems that may occur during a real surgery. In a study of another program, the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR), participants were tested on 10 consecutive times within a 1-month period. Assessment of laparoscopic skills included time, errors, and economy of hand movement, measured by the simulator. One of the more popular games/simulators has been Trauma Center, a game based around solving puzzles and problems that might occur during surgery. The objective of the game is attending to patients that have suffered accidents, broken bones, internal bleeding and trauma, as well as responding to various diagnoses and performing various surgical procedures. The objective of the game is to make the user think faster and increase their ability to solve problems at the surgical table. Surgeons and health experts say that the game is perfect to accelerate the time of decision making at the surgical desk because it is a game based on placing pressure on the user by giving the user a time limit. The EyeSi is a virtual reality simulator for intraocular surgery training. The HelpMeSee Eye Surgery simulator is another virtual reality simulator with realtime haptic feedback, that is used to train trainees for Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery.

Its notable members include: *Jirair Sefilian, Lebanese-born Armenian military commander of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, known for his role during the Capture of Shusha *Tigran Khzmalyan, filmmaker *Larisa Alaverdyan, Armenia's former Ombudsman *Alexander Yenikomshian, convicted terrorist, former member of the terrorist Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia *Hranush Kharatyan, ethnographer Arrests On April 7, police in Yerevan arrested five members of Pre- Parliament: its chairman, Garegin Chugaszyan, founding member Jirair Sefilyan, as well as Varuzhan Avetisyan, Pavel Manukyan, and Gevorg Safaryan. Police searched the men's homes and Pre-Parliament’s office, and seized wooden bats, kitchen knives , a stun gun, and a publicly available Pre-Parliament pamphlet published last year. The police also seized flags of Armenia, Nagorno- Karabakh, and the Pre-Parliament. On April 9 the Special Investigation Service charged all five men with planning a mass disturbance (art. 225 part 1 of the Criminal Code) and preparation of a crime (Art. 35). Lawyers for the men told Human Rights Watch that the charges stem from Pre-Parliament’s plans to hold a rally in Yerevan on April 24, the day of commemoration of the 100-year anniversary of the Armenian genocide. The group had applied for permission to hold the rally, which the Yerevan authorities approved near the Erebuni Library. Pre-Parliament advertised a rally that would not interfere with events commemorating the anniversary of the genocide. According to the men's lawyers, the charges are also based on the Pre-Parliament’s booklet, which describes the group’s aim of a change of government of Armenia through peaceful means, including civil disobedience. On April 10, the Kentron Nork- Marash district court in Yerevan approved the investigation’s request for remand detention and sent all five men to pretrial custody. Following the court’s ruling, authorities transferred Sefilyan, Avetisyan, and Manukyan to the Vardashen prison, and Chukaszyan and Safaryan to the Nubarashen prison where they are in custody with the general prison population. Their lawyers have expressed concern about over crowding in some of the cells. After his April 7 arrest, Pavel Manukyan declared a hunger strike that lasted several days and ended some time before April 13. One of Safaryan’s lawyers reported that he declared a hunger strike on approximately April 20, possibly in response to mistreatment by cellmates. At the time he was in a cell with 17 people and only nine beds. After Safaryan declared a hunger strike, a doctor examined him to assess his general health and he was moved to a cell with other people on hunger strikes. As of April 27 he had not received further visits from any medical personnel. The Pre-Parliament members are being targeted for their peaceful political beliefs and that the charges are intended to interfere with their right to freedom of thought, expression, and assembly as protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Armenia is a party. Article 225 of Armenia’s Criminal Code, under which the men are charged, prohibits “organizing mass disorder accompanied with violence, pogroms, arson, destruction or damage to property, using fire-arms, explosives or explosive devices, or by armed resistance to the representative of the authorities.” Pre-Parliament’s booklet and advertisement for the rally call for civil disobedience and peaceful political change. Further, pre-trial detention should be considered a last resort. Article 9(3) of the ICCPR states that, “It shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody.” The United Nations Human Rights Committee, which provides authoritative interpretation of the covenant, has determined that bail should be granted except in cases in which there is a likelihood that the accused would abscond, destroy evidence, or influence witnesses. Given Pre-Parliament’s nonviolent views and in the absence of a lawful and credible basis for detention, the men should be freed, pending investigation. The men, who are currently under investigation, were in custody with convicted criminals in violation of international standards on pre-trial detention. ICCPR article 10(2)(a) mandates that accused persons shall be segregated from convicted persons and accorded treatment appropriate for their status as non-convicted persons. According to their lawyers, the prison authorities have not allowed the men to receive visits from family members, which are permitted during pre-trial detention at the discretion of the prison authorities. Such discretion should not be used to withhold privileges to punish the men for their political beliefs or affiliations. In light of these concerns, Human Rights Watch called upon Armenia's Prosecutor General's office to: \\\\- Independently review the charges, which appear intended to interfere with the Pre-Parliament members’ rights to expression and assembly; \\\\- Release all five men from custody, pending a prompt, impartial, and credible investigation into their charges; \\\\- Until such time as they are released pending an independent investigation into the charges: \\\\- Take immediate steps to ensure that Chugaszyan, Sefilyan, Avetisyan, Manukyan, and Safaryan are held in facilities separate from convicted inmates, and have access to appropriate medical care and independent legal counsel. \\\\- Ensure that Chugaszyan, Sefilyan, Avetisyan, Manukyan, and Safaryan may receive family visits as permitted by regulations. \\\\- Investigate allegations that Safaryan has been subjected to ill-treatment by his cellmates and take appropriate measures to ensure his safety.

He amassed over 300 Football League appearances in a career spanning 13 years, collecting two Third Division winners medals with Hereford and Shrewsbury in the process. Career West Ham United Born in Hamilton, Lindsay began his career with West Ham United in the Football League after joining from amateur club Possilpark YMCA in Scotland. He signed on professional terms with the club in summer 1966, initially as a striker, making his first-team debut coming on as a substitute in a 3–1 away defeat to Burnley on 8 October 1968. He found it difficult to break into the first-team, scoring his first goal ten months after he was handed his debut, in a 2–1 First Division defeat to Stoke City. In three years as a professional with the club, Lindsay scored twice in 39 league appearances, with his second and final goal for the Hammers coming on 31 January 1970 during a 3–2 defeat at Burnley, the club he made his debut against, and played his final game on 10 April 1971, a 1–0 defeat to Nottingham Forest. Watford Lindsay was signed by Watford for £20,000 from West Ham in May 1971. He scored 12 goals from midfield in 65 league games for the club between 1971 and 1974, making his debut in a Second Division 3–0 defeat away at Fulham. At the end of his first season with the club, Lindsay was placed on the transfer list with a valuation of £20,000, but remained with the club until he was released two years later. He played his final Watford game in a 1–0 FA Cup victory over Chelmsford City on 24 November 1973. Colchester United Colchester United signed Lindsay on a free transfer from Watford in July 1974. He was a regular figure in the first-team for Colchester during the 1974–75 season, his only season with the club, making 45 league appearances and scoring six goals. He made his debut for the U's on 17 August in a 1–1 draw with his former club Watford at Layer Road, and scored his first goal in the following game, a 1–0 League Cup win over Oxford United. He scored his final goal for the club on 22 April 1975 in a 2–0 win over Blackburn Rovers and made his final appearance in the final game of the season, a 3–2 home win against Bury. In the summer of 1975, he was sold to Hereford United for £15,000. Hereford United After making his debut on 16 August 1975 against Port Vale, Lindsay was ever-present during his first season with Hereford, scoring twice in 46 league appearances on the way to helping the club win the Third Division title. In total, he made 79 appearances and scored six goals in two seasons with the Bulls, but couldn't prevent the club from being relegated back to the Third Division in his second season. He made his final appearance for Hereford on 14 May 1977 against Leyton Orient. Shrewsbury Town Lindsay signed for Shrewsbury Town in August 1977 from Hereford and would make 86 appearances for the club, including helping the club finish first in the Third Division in the 1978–79 season. Personal life Once he had retired from the game, Lindsay settled in Shrewsbury and now runs a pub in the town.

Mpati DP, Cameron JA, Heher JA, Ponnan JA and Mhlantla AJA presided. Judgment was handed down on March 10, 2008. Counsel for the appellant was EJJ Spamer; SC Goddard appeared for the respondents. The appellant's attorneys were Kyriacos & Co, Cape Town, and Webbers, Bloemfontein. The respondents' Attorneys were EQM Hunter, Cape Town, and Honey Attorneys, Bloemfontein. The case was an appeal from a decision of the full bench in the Cape Provincial Division (Thring J, Blignaut J and Bozalek J) regarding spoliation. The court considered, first, the requirements for a mandament van spolie. What was required was unlawful dispossession of property, not necessarily accompanied by violence or fraud, provided that the property was taken without the consent of the person dispoiled, and also illicitly, in a manner not countenanced by the law. The court also dealt with the question of whether or not possession of the keys to property could be considered to amount to possession of that property. It found that to make duplicate keys available to another does not always amount to giving up physical possession of the property in question The party raising a dispute of fact in motion proceedings, the court found, must seriously and unambiguously address that fact. This will indicate that the dispute is real, genuine or bona fide. If the disputing party necessarily possesses the knowledge and ability to show the facts in question to be untrue or inaccurate, but nonetheless fails to do so, instead resting on a bare or ambiguous denial, there is no bona fide dispute of fact.  Facts  The appellant was a building contractor who had entered into an agreement with the first respondent (represented by the second respondent) to perform certain construction work on the first respondent's property. He was placed in possession of a full set of keys to the premises upon commencement of the work and subsequently delivered duplicates of certain of the keys to the second respondent for the limited purpose of facilitating inspection of the premises by the respondent. When a dispute arose between the parties, the respondent engaged other contractors to complete the work and, using the duplicate keys delivered to him by the appellant, provided the new contractors with access to the premises. When the appellant thereafter arrived at the premises, he was refused access, apparently on the respondent's instructions. The appellant contended that this constituted spoliation and unsuccessfully applied for restitution ante omnia, and for ejectment of the second respondent.  Judgment  On appeal, the court held as follows: > A real, genuine and bona fide dispute of fact can exist only where the court > is satisfied that the party who purports to raise the dispute has in his > affidavit seriously and unambiguously addressed the fact said to be > disputed. There will of course be instances where a bare denial meets the > requirement because there is no other way open to the disputing party and > nothing more can therefore be expected of him. But even that may not be > sufficient if the fact averred lies purely within the knowledge of the > averring party and no basis is laid for disputing the veracity or accuracy > of the averment. When the facts averred are such that the disputing party > must necessarily possess knowledge of them and be able to provide an answer > (or countervailing evidence) if they be not true or accurate but, instead of > doing so, rests his case on a bare or ambiguous denial the court will > generally have difficulty in finding that the test is satisfied. I say I > \\"generally\\" because factual averments seldom stand apart from a broader > matrix of circumstances all of which needs to be borne in mind when arriving > at a decision. A litigant may not necessarily recognise or understand the > nuances of a bare or general denial as against a real attempt to grapple > with all relevant factual allegations made by the other party. But when he > signs the answering affidavit, he commits himself to its contents, > inadequate as they may be, and will only in exceptional circumstances be > permitted to disavow them.Para 13. In the previous paragraph, it found that > an applicant who seeks final relief on motion must, in the event of > conflict, accept the version set up by his opponent unless the latter's > allegations are, in the opinion of the court, not such as to raise a real, > genuine or bona fide dispute of fact or are so far-fetched or clearly > untenable that the court is justified in rejecting them merely on the > papers.Para 12. Violence or fraud, the court found, was not an essential act of dispossession, provided that the act was done against the consent of the person despoiled, and illicitly, meaning in a manner which the law would not countenance.Para 27. The mere fact of making duplicate keys available to another (who happened to be the owner of the premises) did not always equate to the giving up of physical possession.Para 27. Accordingly, on the facts, the court decided that the appellant had not lost physical possession of the premises by delivering the duplicate keys to the respondent. He was, however, dispossessed when the respondent used the keys illicitly and against his consent to provide the new contractors with access to the premises.Para 29. The appeal was therefore upheld and the decision of Thring J (Blignault J concurring and Bozalek J dissenting), in Wightman t/a JW Construction v Headfour (Pty) Ltd and Another,2007 (2) SA 128 (C). reversed.

An Islamic television network may be considered a form of alternative media that appeals to some Muslims’ socio-religious values. Historical Context During the launch of TV broadcasting in the 1950s and 1960s, many Islamic programs were created. Many scholars identify the Islamic Iranian Revolution in 1979 as another factor that accelerated the growth of Islamic programming. The emergence of the Arab satellite TV landscape contributed to an exponential increase in Islamic networks and programming since the 1990s. While many Islamic television networks are owned by Arab Muslims, other Islamic television networks exhibit considerable diversity in terms of the ethnicity, language, and madhhab (schools of thought). Increased Internet access in the 2000s enabled online Islamic television networks gain popularity almost globally. Some imams are interested in using the Internet and satellite media as platforms through which they may develop a more direct and widespread connection with their audience. Prior to the emergence of Islamic satellite networks, most imams in the Arab world had no official satellite media platform. They mainly spread their ideas through delivering sermons at mosques, which were often recorded and distributed as cassette tapes, cds, and books. In addition to Sunni and Sunni-Salafist stations, there are a number of Islamic television stations in other languages, such as Persian, which often cater to Shi’a audiences. Most Sunni and Sunni-Salafi Islamic television programs are hosted by imams who are not affiliated with Al-Azhar University. Al-Azhar scholars often debate and critique aspects of Islamic television stations. Some Islamic satellite stations are considered Salafi or Wahabi in orientation. These programs tend to enjoy greater popularity amongst middle class Muslims in the Arab world, especially those who have lived in or emigrated to Arab States of the Persian Gulf countries. For Muslim minority and immigrant communities, Islamic television channels can help individuals cultivate a sense of Pan-Islamic identity. Islamic television networks deal with a wide variety of issues related to the diverse ways in which Islam is practiced globally, and should be distinguished from Islamist television stations. An Islamist television station denotes a station that is perceived as espousing “fundamentalist” or “extremist” religious interpretations. Growth “Iqraa” was the first Arab Islamic television network launched by the Saudi businessman Saleh Abdullah Kamel in 1998 as part of the Arab Radio and Television Network (ART). Within three years, at least 27 new Islamic satellite networks were established, leading many to postulate that a palpable “phenomenon of religious channels” was appearing. This phenomenon has since grown, with more than 80 Islamic television networks in existence today. Furthermore, more than 600 Arab satellite stations are carrying Islamic programs of varying types.

The Institute maintains a library and media resource center that includes published and unpublished text, films and photographs on the subject of Laban Movement Analysis.Simons, Linda K. The performing arts: a guide to the reference literature (1994) Libraries Unlimited.  History  In 1925 Irmgard Bartenieff met Rudolf Laban, a dancer and theoretician celebrated for his radical ideas in dance notation and movement. From 1925 to 1927 she studied with Laban, and then continued to work and teach with him in the schools he had founded throughout Germany. In the early 1960s, Irmgard taught courses in Effort/Shape at the Dance Notation Bureau in New York City, where she had been a senior faculty member since 1943.Bartenieff, I., Lewis, D. Body movement - Coping with the environment (1980, 2002). New York: Routledge. Before that she was already applying Effort/Shape to various areas, such as psychology, physical therapy, child development, anthropology and performing arts. As a physical therapist for example, she led polio patients through imagery to experience shapes and dynamic qualities in their movement exercises.Ferri, Fernando. Visual languages for interactive computing (2008). IGI Global. In 1965 Bartenieff, with her assistants Forrestine Paulay and Martha Davis, started the Effort/Shape department at the Dance Notation Bureau to extend the notation training to observations of affinities between shaping and the dynamic aspects of movement. In 1973 the Dance Notation Bureau initiated an in-depth, graduate program of training that combines of Laban and Bartenieff's theories and practices of movement study and analyses. In 1978 Bartenieff branched off to found her own Laban Institute of Movement Studies, which in 1981, the year she died, was renamed the Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies (LIMS). The Institute is dedicated to training professionals in the analysis system and furthering its development and application. LMA concepts are used in a variety of contexts, and like Labanotation, its use requires extensive training.Fraleigh, Sondra Horton; Hanstein, Penelope. Researching dance: evolving modes of inquiry (2000).

In 1962 he and his KIALOA I crew won the San Diego-Acapulco race in record time. Within two years, KIALOA II had been designed with even faster speeds in mind. KIALOA III, a maxi yacht, was the dominant sibling, winning the 1975 Sydney-Hobart race with a record time that stood for 21 years. A 1982 article described her legacy this way: \\"From her debut in 1975 until her retirement last year, Kialoa (a Hawaiian word for 'long, beautiful canoe') took part in 24 SORC (Southern Ocean Racing Conference) races. Time and again she was first across the line only to have some little 42-foot creep bring the wind from behind and beat her on corrected time. Still, Kialoa won four of her 24 SORC tests on corrected time — a remarkable showing, considering that in the same period only three other biggies out of a total of 19 won so much as one race without benefit of age allowance.\\" Kilroy followed up with KIALOA IV and KIALOA V. A 1988 New York Times profile of maxi-yacht owners noted that \\"Kilroy is remarkable for his dogged participation in all phases of the sport. After the boat is launched, he is skipper, primary helmsman and personnel director. He and his sailing team run their own program for the development of sails, and they wrote the computerized performance guidelines for his boats long before the personal computer was popular.\\" In his memoir about racing, business and life, Kilroy described being born in Ruby, Alaska, on May 1, 1922, and then growing up in Southern California during the Great Depression. In 1940 he was hired at Douglas Aircraft, where he started off as an inspector and quickly studied manufacturing processes. After serving in the US Army Air Corps Reserve (1944–46) and no longer with Douglas, he began to realize the potential of commercial real estate. Kilroy focused on prime sites across Southern California airports, founding Kilroy Realty Corp, which today is a major Real Estate Investment Trust. In 2011, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by Real Estate Forum and GlobeSt.com at their annual conference. In 2014 Kilroy was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame. Having set up the John B. and Nelly Llanos Kilroy Foundation, Kilroy said proceeds from his memoir would go to benefit youth.

It is native to the interior western United States, where it occurs in the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. This species is a perennial herb growing up to 1.5 meters tall. The leaves line the stem but disappear from the lowest part of the stem by the time the plant blooms. The leaves are somewhat rounded in outline and are divided into several lobes. The tall inflorescence bears up to 50 flowers at a time, but a plant may produce hundreds of flowers. Each is borne on a pedicel up to 6 centimeters long. The flower has five dark purple-blue sepals with whitish or yellowish hairs inside. The fruit is a follicle up to 2.2 centimeters long. The plant is long-lived, capable of exceeding 75 years of age. It occupies wet habitat types in subalpine and alpine climates. It is a dominant member of the herb layer in many places. It can often be found growing beneath aspens. This Delphinium commonly hybridizes with its relative, Delphinium glaucum. Hybrids may be more common in the habitat than individuals of the parent species. The hybrid is sometimes called the duncecap larkspur (Delphinium × occidentale). D. barbeyi also hybridizes with Delphinium ramosum and D. sapellonis. Bumblebees and hummingbirds use the nectar from the flowers. The bee species Bombus nevadensis, Bombus insularis, Bombus appositus and B. flavifrons and the hummingbirds Selasphorus platycercus, S. rufus, and Stellula calliope have been observed. Both types of pollinators prefer the larkspurs with the largest flower displays. The sphinx moth Hyles lineata and anthomyiid flies also visit the flowers. All members of the genus Delphinium are toxic to humans and livestock. Many species of larkspurs are known for being poisonous, and as hazards to livestock. This species is notorious as one of the toxic plants most commonly responsible for livestock death, especially cattle fatalities on the rangelands of Colorado and Utah. Sheep are much less susceptible. Up to 15% of a cow herd can be lost to poisoning in areas where this larkspur and its hybrids are common. The cost to ranchers is in the millions of dollars. Abundance of larkspur has persuaded ranchers to remove their animals from some areas of rangeland, or use the land only at certain times of the year. The plant contains many toxic alkaloids. The alkaloids barbinine and barbinidine were first isolated from this species. The most hazardous are called methyl succidimido anthramoyl lycoctomine (MSAL) diterpenoids. About two kilograms dry weight of the plant is estimated to provide a fatal dose of alkaloid. Paralysis occurs and death is caused by respiratory paralysis. Toxicity reactions in animals, sometimes called larkspur toxicosis, can be treated with physostigmine. Ranchers sometimes attempt to kill this larkspur with the herbicide tebuthiuron. Glyphosate and picloram have been effective in research trials, but these chemicals kill nontarget plants as well, accelerating the invasion of weeds into the habitat.

This article was republished in full as last chapter in Diemer's 1910 \\"Factory organization and administration.\\" In the 1921 revised editions of this work Diemer presented a revised bibliography. This biography was limited the description to some on the works of scientific management by Taylor and Gantt, and additional gave a listing of about 300 publications in the field.  Index to the literature of Industrial Engineering  Diemer's 1904 bibliography was supplemented with an index to the literature of Industrial Engineering\\"An index to the literature of Industrial Engineering\\" in: Engineering Magazine. Vol. 27. pp. 644–658. prepared by the Editors of the Engineering Magazine. This index listed about 15 subjects, with more than 400 articles listed: * Apprenticeship (30) * Cost keeping (53), depreciation (4), foundry (10), and Patterns (3) * Drawing room (34) * Wage systems (36), bonus systems (3), piece work (22), premium plan (28), and profit sharing (20) * General management (140), Equipment and plant (33), Foundry (21) In 1920 Harry George Turner Cannons published a \\"Bibliography of industrial efficiency and factory management,\\"Cannon, H. G. T. Bibliography of industrial efficiency and factory management. George Routledge, London (1920). which contained about 3.500 referenced works. In this listing still a few dozen authors (most already mentioned by Diemer) published 5 or more publications, and thousands of people published one or some articles in the emerging field of Industrial Management.  Industrial engineering at Penn State University  At the turn of the 20th century, Penn State had developed a national reputation for its engineering curriculum, but industrial engineering was only beginning to emerge as an academic discipline. Noted efficiency expert Frederick Taylor recommended that university president James A. Beaver hire Hugo Diemer, a professor from the University of Kansas, in the hope that Diemer would create an industrial engineering curriculum at Penn State. A two-year option was ready by 1908, and a four-year bachelor's degree program emerged the following year, the first of its kind in the world. At the time, courses consisted of modern industrial engineering fundamentals such as time and motion study, plant layout optimization, and engineering economics, in addition to courses on advertising and sales. The new department also took over the instruction of manual shop skills, including carpentry and metalworking.

The house along with outbuildings, landscaped gardens and grounds (including a gardner’s cottage, family museum, tea house, granary and funeral chapel) are now open to the public and managed by Parks Canada who became the custodians in 1993; the site represents one of the most treasured heritage locations in the area surrounding La Petite-Nation and in the greater Ottawa River region. It was designed primarily to commemorate Louis-Joseph Papineau (1786-1871), the man who was to become a leading figure in Canadian politics during the 19th century, as the first French-Canadian nationalist leader. He later became the first seigneur of La Petite-Nation. The sumptuous house was built after Louis-Joseph Papineau returned from political exile in Europe, during the mid-1800s; he lived in the manor from 1846 with his wife and four children until his death. His descendants lived on at the house until the 1920s. Some of the more notable of these included his youngest daughter Azélie, mother to Henri Bourassa the famous journalist and founder of Canadian newspaper Le Devoir. Also, Talbot Mercer Papineau (great grandson of Louis-Joseph Papineau) lawyer and decorated soldier, one of four Canadians featured in the book Tapestry of War: A Private View of Canadians in the Great War, by Sandra Gwyn. Major Papineau was portrayed by his fifth cousin, twice removed, then future Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's telefilm, The Great War. Built by Louis-Joseph Papineau between 1848 and 1850, the Manoir Papineau occupies a prominent spot overlooking the Ottawa River at Montebello, Quebec, Canada.Manoir Papineau National Historic Site of Canada The building’s architecture, according to Parks Canada, “represents a blend of stylistic influences similar in many respects to that which is encountered in contemporaneous neoclassical villas. Its sculpted decor recalls the Greek Revival style. From the river, the house appears as a monumental elevation flanked by two corner towers. The facade and hip slopes of the roof present an overhang of unusual proportions, in a muted reference to the Regency style. The conic roof atop the stair tower built following a fire in 1892 is representative of the Queen Anne Revival. Finally, interior door openings between adjoining rooms were aligned to create particular interior perspectives, in keeping with French architectural tradition. The spiral staircase located in one of the towers also shows the influence of this tradition. The unusual positioning of the main reception rooms to the back of the ground floor, combined with the abundant fenestration on the lower two levels of the east tower, recall that a conservatory was once located here.” The interior of the Manor House is splendid, and is furnished with its original décor. Guided tours include the dining room; the grand salon (yellow room); the blue room; the bedroom of Louis-Joseph Papineau; and the seigneur’s office and library tower.

Built in 1901, the library was paid for by George E. Goodman and built on land donated by Goodman. Architect Luther M. Turton designed the building in the Richardson Romanesque style, which can be seen in its use of rusticated stone, round arch windows, and massive scale. The design represented a shift in Napa architecture, which was mainly Victorian prior to the library's construction. History The Goodman Library is the longest- operating library in California, partially due to a clause in Goodman's donation of the building. Goodman stipulated that the building would remain in the city's possession as long as it served as a library but would otherwise revert to his heirs. When Napa moved its city library to a different building in the 1970s, the Napa County Historical Society acquired the building for its research library so it would still satisfy its original purpose. The library now houses both the historical society and Napa County Landmarks. The library was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 21, 1974. The building was damaged by the 2014 South Napa earthquake. A $1.75M contract to repair damage to the building including bracing and a new roof was awarded in January 2017. The work began in April 2017 and is expected is expected to be completed in early 2018.

Description The viaduct had two spans and two arches, which carried the LD&ECR;'s Chesterfield Market Place to Lincoln Central double track main line over the Midland Railway's \\"Brampton Branch\\" and the industrial \\"Boythorpe Railway\\" a few hundred yards East of Chesterfield Market Place Station. Photographs of the viaduct are rare and mentions in the literature even rarer, the clearest are collected on a DVD, repeated by Booth. An image taken between closure and demolition is on the internet.Boythorpe Viaduct at track level The viaduct lay approximately one third of the way between the Park Road brick arch bridge and Horns Bridge with embankments separating the three structures. History The viaduct was opened in 1897 along with the rest of the line. The section between Chesterfield and Langwith Junction (by then renamed Shirebrook North), was closed to passenger traffic by British Railways in December 1951, due to the unsafe condition of Bolsover Tunnel and concerns over the safety of Doe Lea Viaduct, both of which were affected by colliery subsidence. Bolsover South and Scarcliffe were closed completely. Boythorpe Viaduct remained in use until March 1957 when goods traffic to and from Chesterfield Market Place Station ceased. Tracks were lifted over the structure in the next two years. No trace remains of the viaduct, or indeed of any of the massive LD&ECR; presence to the West of the Midland Main Line at what is now the Horns Bridge roundabout. The Brampton Branch outlived the LD&ECR;, but is now no more, as is the Boythorpe Railway.

Varied but expansive architecture, not portable artifacts. Phases III and IV developed a \\"momentum\\" of increased polity. The Middle Horizon (600–1000 AD) * Moche V – 600–700 AD. Biochrome/polychrome painted vessels/jars represent Moche V artistic tradition. Diversity in architectural structures exists to a further extent than Moche IV. * Wari culture (or Huari) and Tiahuanaco – 700–800 AD. The rectangular enclosures and settlement plan are evidence of Huari Empirical domination and development. The Late Intermediate Period (1000–1450 AD) * Chimu culture – 1000–1400 AD The Late Horizon * Inca – 1476–1534 AD There is surprisingly little Inca pottery or materials left from their dominance until the arrival of the Spaniards. There is little evidence left from pre-Moche II phases. If there were any significant evidence left behind, much of it would have been destroyed by the later Moche civilization phases. According to Shimada, the \\"post-Moche V developments in the region remain largely unknown.\\" This makes Moche phases II–V the most examined periods.  Excavation and research history  The site was excavated with a large team of students and professionals for the Royal Ontario Museum Project starting in 1973, and continuing through 1975. Dr. Kent C. Day, Izumi Shimada, Melody Shimada, Andrew Ignatieff, Martha Anders, Hans Knapp, John Haas, Manuel Arboleda, and Juan Cabanillas all participated in the excavation from 1973–1975. Many of these participants helped in some way in the interpretation of the site as well. In addition, Terry D'Altroy, Christine Krueger, Ciro Hurtado, and Christopher B. Donnan were also involved in the interpretations at Pampa Grande. Starting in 2004, Llana Johnson worked at the site for her dissertation at UCLA. Late Moche period During the late Moche V period, Pampa Grande became one of the largest Moche sites anywhere, and occupied the area of more than 400 ha. Starting around 600 AD, new constructions were laid out and built in a short period of time, including an enormous ceremonial complex. At the heart of the complex is Huaca Grande, also known locally as Huaca Fortaleza—the tallest ceremonial platform in Peru.  Agriculture and economy   Crops and agriculture  The villages surrounding the urban center at Pampa Grande were likely small agricultural villages, which farmed for themselves and the Moche elite. Elaborate irrigation systems leading to the valley floors that stemmed from nearby rivers supported the rural farmers and led to intensification in agricultural production. Another large landscape change was the mound of Huaca Grande. Huaca Grande, a large pyramid structure, was constructed with adobe bricks. It arose as the Pampa Grande Elite gained political and economic power.Johnson,Ilana 2010 Households and social organization at the Late Moche period site of Pampa Grande, Peru. Published Ph.D dissertation, UCLA Macrobotanical remains show us that the non-urban farmers cultivated domestic plants such as beans, maize, squash, sweet potatoes, peanuts, chili pepper, gourd, algorrobo and cotton. Storage facilities \\"revealed pollen spores from the fern and monocot families. These types of plants were likely used for medicinal purposes and/or as animal fodder\\". The paleobotanical collection also has several wild species that could have been used for \\"fuel, building materials, animal fodder, medicine, and herbs\\". Several types of lithic artifacts were discovered in and around Pampa Grande. The stone adzes, which were bifacially flaked with appendages in order to be hafted to wooden handles, were used for tilling and harvesting. Batáns, large grinding stones, and manos, which were smaller hand-held grinding stones, were found in most every household. (Johnson, 2010: 119–120) In addition, scarce amounts of copper were found. Including fishing net weights, needles and fishhooks.  Hunting and faunal remains  There seems to be little evidence of hunting within Pampa Grande, as most of the 1,200 animal bones found were from domesticated animals. The tools were primarily agricultural focused with the exception of butchering tools. However, there were nearby sites that hunted for sea lions, deer, and snails. In addition to domestic animal remains, marine shells, and guinea pig feces were found. The many faunal remains include, but are not limited to, marine invertebrate and vertebrate remains like shellfish, bony fish, and sea lion. Some of the terrestrial vertebrates uncovered include dog, guinea pig, iguana, llama and alpaca and rodents. There were \\"extensive marine species, large quantities of camelid (alpaca and llama), and moderate quantities of small terrestrial mammals\\".  Trade  In the Late Moche Period households lost autonomy and became reliant on elites and specialists, and integrated into the complex urban economy. \\"As agriculture intensifies and populations become concentrated in cities, the transmission of valuable goods and land increases in importance as resources become more limited\\". This led to specialization. Specialized items such as ceramics, figurines, beads, ornaments and spindle whirls were traded among urbanites at Pampa Grande. Exotic foods such as \\"white-tailed deer, sea lion, coca leaves, aji peppers, and many types of fruits\\" are found rarely in domestic contexts, but appear in elite households, which suggests the powerful had greater trading capability. However, there seems to have been a steady flow of shellfish from the nearby Pacific Ocean. High quality polychrome vessels have been found that source to the Wari Empire. This civilization was located in the Central Andean Highlands.  Specialization  We see specialization occur for two specific reasons at Pampa Grande. Johnson explains that, \\"agricultural intensification around Pampa Grande, coupled with periodic droughts, left much of the valley without sufficient water for agriculture. This resulted in a large population in need of work and subsistence goods, thus requiring valley inhabitants to aggregate at Pampa Grande and find specialized non-agricultural work\\". In addition to this, \\"standardization is a good indicator of specialization because it reflects the producers' concern with efficiency and homogeneity. At Pampa Grande there were numerous elite-sponsored workshops, which had minimal evidence of habitation. These workshops had controlled access, so as to keep the materials inside of them. Though many of the specialists in these workshops were commoners, elites also took part in craft production. Family and households also produced specialized goods, but on a much less controlled basis. Family units often organized their labor by kinship relations and operated in independent and domestic compounds. Such workshops were more loosely monitored by local authorities. And often, only checked up on when goods were expected as tribute to the elite. Urban households would have been reliant on economic and social relationships in order to acquire specialized household utilitarian products. The production of material and agricultural goods seems to have been gendered. The \\"female roles in the household included more daily and maintenance activities related to child rearing and food preparation, while males engaged in more specialized activities related to the production of craft and agricultural items\\". We see standardization, by using molds, among many of the vessels, including: \\"stirrup-spout bottles figurines, rattles, whistles, and trumpets. Many storage vessels were made with out molds as well, however by the later Moche phases, there was a significant increase in vessels produced using molds.  Artifacts and architecture   Types of architecture  There are two types of structures found at Pampa Grande, the elite Huacas and the common housing and occupational \\"Units\\". Huacas are earthen pyramids made from large adobe bricks built during the Middle Moche Period. They served as spaces for public and private rituals and housed the elite. The tops of the Huacas were platforms standing over public plazas. Huaca Grande is the largest Huaca located at Pampa Grande out of twenty-two Huacas. The units can be divided into two groups. In general, there are occupational units on the outer edge of the urban area and the residential units placed all around the site. The urban center had many residential compounds, both for the higher-class elite and the lower class. The high-class compounds were built with higher quality materials and craftsmanship and commonly have high privacy walls that distinguish them. The materials used in construction at Pampa Grande seem to be the locally accessible materials rather than culturally ideal materials. The adobe bricks were basic sun-dried mud bricks that are found as one of the main architectural components. In addition to adobe brick, quadrangular rock was a common building material. For mortar, many techniques were used. Often found, there was dirt interior with clay on the exterior, or mud with fragments of utilitarian ceramic were used as mortar. Walls were also \\"constructed using a core-and-veneer masonry style. This architectural style is common at Moche sites and consists of rubble interior surrounded by nicely- shaped stones that form an external veneer\\". For elite housing, large pieces of rock would have been carried from a nearby source on the backs of camelids (alpaca, llamas) and cut to size as construction took place. This technique was also used in constructing the Huacas.  Changes in architecture  As in most cases, the architecture at Pampa Grande developed as the society developed socially, economically, and politically. At the time of the Late Moche Period, larger urban areas developed around the \\"necks of some valleys in order to control access to water\\". The earlier household units were constructed of multiple differing structures with different functions. As time went by the more common household unit was an apartment style building divided internally for different functionality. Ethnicity, status, wealth and religious ideologies can often be determined from decoration on utilitarian and elaborate, valuable items. \\"However, very little evidence for the presence of different ethnic groups has been found at Moche cities during any time period\\". The \\"indicators of socio-economic status are household size, architectural design, and household artifacts\\". As mentioned above, more elite classes had higher quality materials and better craftsmanship in their household units as a way of differentiating between elite and common people. This included more durable materials for higher walls and foundation, and core-and-veneer masonry style of construction. This is contrasting to the mortar used by the non-elites made of dirt and clay. Elite dwellings also have additional patios and extra living space in comparison to common dwellings. These extra spaces are often used for exclusive or special economic and social events and activities.  Common artifacts  The most commonly found artifacts at Pampa Grande are ceramic artifacts. The difference between elite and common housing units can be determined by the type of ceramics found in the unit as well as the architecture of the unit. Utilitarian ceramics make up the majority of the ceramic artifacts. These utilitarian pieces include the common \\"large storage vessels (also referred to as tinajas, paicas, or urns), ollas (short-neck/neckless vessels with large openings), jars (globular vessels with restricted openings and short to tall rims), and to a lesser extent fineware ceramics, such as floreros (flaring-rim bowls), and stirrup- spout bottles (Gayoso and Gamarra 2005). Other vessel forms include single- spout and handle bottles, dippers, bowls, and plates\\". Many of these ceramic artifacts were mass-produced by using molds. However, it was not until the population at Pampa Grande developed over time that the mass-production of molded ceramics became popular. Utilitarian, mass-produced storage ceramics are often associated with lower economic class. Face-neck jars are storage vessels recovered from all over, which is one way we can tell they are signifiers of lower socio-economic class. These jars frequently depict a human or animal face on one side. However, a small number of the face-neck jars are made without molds and are stamped with the face design into the neck. This is would be an example of higher quality but common utilitarian vessel. \\"Higher quality, labor-intensive vessels such as painted stirrup spouts and high burnished blackware bowls\\" are associated with higher socio-economic status and are found less often at Pampa Grande.  Leadership and inequality   Government and leadership  Because of Pampa Grande's geographical location, at the neck of the river in the valley, centralization of power was important to maintain control over the water source in order to protect against drought. As agricultural intensification led to drought, Pampa Grande inhabitants needed new forms of work that a new bureaucratic government helped establish and oversee. However, speculations on governmental and elite structures are generalized and talked about as the Moche elite, and no specific claims are made about Pampa Grande as a single site. After the new system of production was created, the elite members managed different specialists directly, or indirectly. Household hierarchies were based on kin relationships. There was significant ancestor worship sponsored by the state. The basis on which elites rise or are put in power are never discussed in any of the sources.  Evidence of inequality  Architecture is one way to differentiate between socio-economic classes. The Huaca living quarters and the common unit living quarters are one obvious and extreme difference in architecture that shows the socio-economic class difference. The pyramids, like Huaca Grande, were signs of power for the Moche. They were constructed quickly with a timesaving method in order to have immediate power and likely put poor people to work and subordinate them. Within the Huacas there were smaller rooms that likely served at living and cooking quarters for the servants to the elite. Such social segregation is evidence of oppression or coercion of the poor inhabitants. There is debate about how rigid the social class boundaries were at Pampa Grande. Izumi Shimada believes there were strictly four social classes; \\"(1) the highest class of elites, religious specialists, and administrators, (2) elites that played key roles in the procurement and allocation of valuable raw materials and production of wealth items, (3) supervisors and managers of production activities with a certain degree of social mobility, and (4) the lowest and largest class of laborers who commuted to work in the fields and craft production workshops\\". IIana Johnson, on the other hand, concludes that there were much less rigid social boundaries. She sites the evidence of differing architectural sectors correlating with naturally occurring topographical differences. This gives leads her to the conclusion that they were not so strictly segregated. There has been no specific reporting on burials or skeletal remains. We do know, however, that most of the burials were inside building (domestic) complexes/units or inside workshops. Some artifacts that were found among such burials are spindle whorls, copper plates and knives, many ceramic artifacts and occasionally gold and silver that indicated higher or elite status. This indicates that people were buried with materials related to their occupation and status, which seem to be related.  Religion and ideology   Deities  There are two common types of representations of iconographic art on ceramic materials; fineline painting and three-dimensional forms. Fineline drawing tradition is common late Moche style. Many iconographic representations have realistic animal and human images in the Moche culture. Paintings portraying deities are most commonly found on ceramic stirrup bottle spouts. Identical motifs of \\"bird-with-bowl, ritual runners, and deities fighting\\" can be found at Pampa Grande and Galindo, which is 160 km away. Figures resembling an anthropomorphized iguana and an elderly individual, described as wrinkle face, were significant characters towards the beginning of Phase V in the Moche period. 'Wrinkle face', a mythological deity, is recognized from its \\"wide round eyes, snarling-fanged mouth, and dense wrinkles over the entire face\\". 'Wrinkle face', carved or stamped three-dimensionally onto face-neck jars, is frequently depicted fighting supernatural creatures. Nude, bound warriors are often depicted on neck-jars. These depictions are not likely mythical creatures, but rather, ritualistic representations of warriors. According to ethno historical records it was the men who were involved in the specialized activities, whereas women were child bearers and domestic individuals. Therefore it might be likely that it was the men who performed any ritualistic duties. However, there is no ethno historic evidence specifically concerning mythical or ritual aspects of Pampa Grande society. However, at some point, most of the traditional Moche \\"iconographic elements ceased to be depicted\\". The realistic animal and human imagery, commonly found on utilitarian ceramic ware, was replaced with geometrical patterns. These new designs are suggested to be abbreviated versions of the earlier detailed images and motifs in Moche traditional art. The \\"Temple of the Stairway and Wave\\" is a geometrical band motif that is assumed to have been symbolic of the place where rituals and human sacrifice took place. There is no evidence of written records from Pampa Grande.  Religious rituals  Huacas were the equivalent of palaces or temples. They served as spaces for public and private rituals and housed the elite. The tops of the Huacas were platforms standing over public plazas. Huaca Fortaleza (Huaca Grande) is the tallest man-made earthen structure in South America. It includes numerous murals, like previous ceremonial Moche pyramids. Some of the murals were on the lower, exterior, visible from public areas, while some were on upper terraces. This suggests that the Huacas at Pampa Grande were used for ritualistic (public) ceremonies. The murals on the first terrace featured a reoccurring red and orange reptile, resembling an iguana.Haas, Johnathan, 1985 ”Excavations on Huaca Grande: an initial view of the elite of Pampa Grande”. Journal of Field Archaeology 12(4):391–409 (Haas, 1985: 400) There is also evidence of concentrated luxury goods and foods in the lofty, spacious rooms in the Huaca that suggest it was the residence for the ruling elite. There are amulets and votives figurines recovered that are believed to have been used in shamanistic practices among households. There is a presence of patios in domestic structures. These were likely used for domestic events and rituals, like home worship. No altars are found on the huacas at Pampa Grande, like other similar sacrificial Moche sites.  Elites in religious life  The only priest figures mentioned are the Bird priest and the Priestess, which are major Moche icons, but not found at Pampa Grande. Shamanistic traditions were performed using figurines in order to cure illness, help with pregnancy and fertility, and to recognize rights of passage. The social standing of the shamans have never been discussed in the sources. The evidence for domestic ancestor worship suggests the elite were also partaking in ancestor worship. This means their ancestors would have probably been wealthy and their fortune was passed down in the family and had the most influence in development of the state.  Death   Treatment  There has been little reporting on burials or skeletal remains. We do know, however, that most of the burials were inside building (domestic) complexes/units or inside workshops. Some artifacts that were found among such burials are spindle whorls, copper plates and knives, many ceramic artifacts and occasionally gold and silver that indicated higher or elite status. This indicates that people were buried with materials related to their occupation and status, which seem to be related. Other than potential looting, the few burials that were mentioned seemed to have been left at peace by the residents of Pampa Grande. From the few burial artifacts, we can see that the women are buried with things related to their occupation, which was frequently domestic. Primarily, we see spindle whorls and threading weights at the female burials. In male burials there are typically copper-metal smelted artifacts, along with ceramics. There is one case of a burial in a communal plaza, located inside of a domestic complex. This suggests kinship ties among the complex, and also contributes to the theory that Pampa Grande residents practiced ancestor worship, because the burial was in a ritualistic plaza. It is more likely to find evidence of external influence in the burials of the elites. As Shimada explains, the elite would have more contact with external figures and would be more likely than the commoners to integrate external art into their burial goods. Also, elites were commonly buried with larger amounts of status items than commoners. It seems as though there were no wars or battles at Pampa Grande, so there would be no evidence for how enemies/foreigners were treated differently from local residents.  Causes of death  There was a pottery workshop discovered that had two potters (who likely worked in the workshop) buried with large amounts of high status artifacts. These potters were likely highly skilled elite members of society. They both were afflicted by \\"professional traumas.\\" \\"They suffered from rheumatism in the hands and arthritis on the backbone, hands, and knees, which correspond with activities related to long-term pottery manufacture\\". This case is the only case from excavated parts of the site to have evidence of disease or trauma.  Warfare and violence   Evidence  There is no evidence of trauma on the very limited skeletal remains. No mass graves were found. The location and architecture were agriculturally focused, rather than militarily focused. There are no historical written records, and little ethno-historic evidence for warfare or violence.  Organized warfare vs. localized violence  There is no evidence for conquest of Pampa Grande or that Pampa Grande made any advances on other polities. The artistic styles seemed to have evolved over-time not in relation to conquest. There were numerous elite-sponsored workshops, which had minimal evidence of habitation. These workshops had controlled access, so as to keep the materials inside of them. Family and households also produced specialized goods, but on a much less controlled basis. Local authorities more loosely monitored family and household workshops. It is likely that they only checked up on household workshops when goods were expected as tribute to the elite. However, there is no evidence suggesting the tribute paid to or from anywhere outside of the town and closely surrounding areas.  Writing, art, and symbolism   Writing system  There has been no evidence or discovery of a writing system at Pampa Grande.  Symbolic motifs  There are a few different recurring motifs that appear at Pampa Grande. The most common motifs are the \\"bird with a bowl\\" or bird priest, waves, \\"wrinkle face\\" and iguana figures. The bird priest appears commonly on ceramics in the Moche culture, but is scarcely found at Pampa Grande. However, this is such a common Moche figurine, that it is important to consider when looking at Pampa Grande. This motif is part bird and part human, and would have been part of sacrificial or other ceremonies. It is often displayed in scenes fighting other deities. However, its meaning and interpretation is contested. Waves are frequently found at Pampa Grande, primarily on ceramics/pottery. The waves have two different interpretations. Often waves appear in conjunction with right triangles or \\"stairs\\". These geometric shapes would have served as an abbreviated version of earlier and more complex motifs. The first way this geometric motif has been interpreted is symbolizing marine life and its importance. Expert, Ilana Johnson, explains one way the waves can be interpreted. They \\"…could have been an abbreviated version of the stylized catfish or double-headed serpent motif found in panels on the murals at Huaca de la Luna and Huaca El Brujo [other Moche sites]\\". The second way these wave motifs are interpreted are as the Temple of the Stairway and Wave. This is said to have been a ceremonial place where ritual human sacrifice took place. The wave motif is often found in several places on one piece of pottery. \\"Wrinkle face\\" was likely a deity or religious/political figure at Pampa Grande. He is often painted (fineline) onto pottery. The pottery typically depicts Wrinkle face as a snarling, wrinkled face with large, round eyes. Similarly to the bird priest, Wrinkle face is often shown battling other mythological deities or shown in a burial scene. Murals on the first terrace of Huaca Grande featured a reoccurring red and orange reptile, resembling an iguana. (Haas, 1985: 400) The iguana figures were most commonly found in Huaca Grande. It is likely that iguanas were eaten at Pampa Grande because they are found to be a luxury dish in current day Peru. It is possible that the iguanas were also represented by Wrinkle face, however that is an uncertain interpretation. Their purpose in the terraces of Huaca Grande along with their symbolic meaning is unclear. (Haas, 1985: 400)  The End   Abandonment  The abandonment of Pampa Grande took place not long after 700 AD. No experts discuss the evidence of abandonment, but rather discuss it as a known point in Pampa Grande's history. They instead discuss the details of the different theories as to why and how the site was abandoned and what evidence supported such theories. Three theories exist about the abandonment of Pampa Grande. However, Shimada explains that these theories have issues because the \\"available data pertaining to this problematic time period are largely ambiguous because of their fragmentary nature…\\". Nevertheless, the arguments for each theory have data to support them. First, a flood possibly due to unusual rains, followed by El Nino sparked the abandonment. Excavations have found \\"thick and uniform deposits of water-borne sand and silt\\" on floor surfaces. It is suggested that the deposits are a result of a single large flood. In addition to the existence of the silt deposit, it covers everything presumed to have been on the floor surface at the time of abandonment. Shimada cautions, however, that the date of the flood is difficult to pinpoint. Also, the deposit is possibly a result of numerous floods. External invasion by the Huari Empire is another theory, however weak; Shimada explains it could have led to the abandonment of Pampa Grande. There are Huari style objects that are found at Pampa Grande. In addition to the Huari objects, almost all domestic rooms had large amounts of carbonized wood. This suggests that these spaces were burned as part of the Huari invasion. However, this interpretation loses credibility because of the isolated occurrences of Huari style artifacts. This evidence is not \\"adequate proof\\" of a Huari invasion. Internal forces and conditions weakened the society making it susceptible to forces and events. The establishment of Pampa Grande was so rapid. The governing body and system was never firmly established, which led to changes in the way Pampa Grande was run. This made the structure of the economy susceptible to unrest and other events. There is evidence of a redistributive economy made possible by tributes made to the elites. With such a model, if a large environmental problem occurred, accompanied by increasingly complex population, tributes would only be plausible up to a certain point. This is one possible way Shimada discusses for the revolt of the people as the cause of abandonment. =Structures damaged by fire= The theory of revolt is the most widely accepted. The violent ending is interpreted with the data of widespread intensive burning of domestic and other structures, as mentioned above in the Huari invasion theory. There also is a large amount of burnt corn and beans in storage facilities. The burnt roofing that lays directly on burnt floor surfaces may indicate that the fire and abandonment occurred around the same time. One stray piece of evidence in this theory is that many adobe units that show no sign of destruction by fire. In addition to this, the burnt adobe structures do not necessarily show signs of intentional destruction. Many of the artifacts are intact.  After abandonment/ later occupation  There is evidence for Huari and/or Tiahuanaco cultural occupation shortly after the abandonment. However, there is little evidence of the extent to which the site was occupied at this time. The Chimu culture shows up in the surrounding areas a significant amount of time after the Huari. The Inca have clearly had a presence at Pampa Grande dating from 1476 to the early 1500s. However, there is little pottery or material remains until the arrival of the Spaniards in 1532.

He was Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones in the government of Abdallah Ibrahim (1958-1960). He was co- organizer with Colonel M'hamed Ababou of the coup against King Hassan II of Morocco of 10 July 1971.  Career Mohamed Medbouh was a Berber from the Rif, and He was born in 1927, son of a leader of Aknoul who fought for the French under General Hubert Lyautey against the Rif rebels under Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi. His father's throat was cut during the fighting, but he survived. He gained the nickname \\"Medbouh\\", meaning \\"Cutthroat\\", which he passed on to his son. Mohamed Medbouh received a military education with the elite Cadre noir, and then served in Indochina. Medbouh supported King Mohammed V of Morocco in the push for independence in 1956. In January 1957 there was an armed revolt against the king by Brahim Zedki Addi ou Bihi, the governor of Tafilalt province. Captain Mohamed Medbough was leader of one of two infantry battalions that moved into the mountains to suppress the revolt, which was achieved without difficulty. He became governor of Casablanca and then Minister of Posts. King Hassan II succeeded to the throne on 26 February 1961. Medbouh was made the king's chief aide-de-camp. In July 1963 an alleged plot by the leftist National Union of Popular Forces party to kill the king in his bed was foiled. The plotters were said to have obtained detailed plans of the palace from Major Mohamed Medbouh, although Medbouh was not implicated. He was made head of the Royal Military Cabinet in 1967. He often went riding with Hassan II, or played golf with him. Medbouh was one of the king's closest supporters. Skhirate coup attempt In the summer of 1971 Medbouh went to the United States for medical treatment. While there, at the request of King Hassan II, he made inquiries into the reason why Pan American World Airways had decided against building an Intercontinental Hotel in Casablanca. He was told the company had decided not to proceed after they had been asked by government officials for sizable \\"commissions\\". On hearing this, the king fired four of his cabinet ministers. Some said that the dismissals took place only after the ministers had made enough money from corrupt practices and it was time for others to take their turn. Medbouh felt the dismissals were not sufficient: the ministers should be tried and punished. He plotted a coup with Colonel M'hamed Ababou, the commander of the Military Training Academy. Colonel Larbi Chelouati was another leader. The attack was made on 10 July 1971 at the king's palace at Skhirat, on the Atlantic coast about south of Rabat, during the celebrations of the king's forty-second birthday. About 800 senior government members, military officers and other members of the elite were present. About 1,200 military cadets attacked, firing automatic weapons into the crowd at random, and killing almost 100 guests. The cadets had been told they were protecting the king against insurgents who had taken over the palace. They ran out of control when they saw the luxury of the gathering. In a squabble between the coup leaders, M'hamed Ababou apparently shot Mohamed Medbouh at an early stage. Medbouh reportedly wished only for Hassan II to abdicate whereas Ababou had more radical demands. According to historian Michel Abitbol Medbouh's death occurred \\"under mysterious circumstances\\". The king and his aides hid in a bathroom to avoid the shooting, then reasserted authority after being found. General Mohamed Oufkir arranged for loyal soldiers to oust the cadets from a radio station in Rabat from which they were proclaiming the end of the monarchy. Ababou was killed in a shoot-out. Ten of the leaders of the coup were executed, and others received harsh prison sentences.

Early life and education Vučinić graduated with a degree in international law from the University of Belgrade in 1985 and attended the General Manager Program at Harvard Business School in 2000. In 2003, he attended the Private Equity Executive Education Course at Harvard Business School. Career Non, B-92, and Soros Vučinić began his journalistic career in 1979 as a member of the staff of the Belgrade political newsweekly Non. He became editor-in-chief of Non in 1989. In 1990, he was named editor-in-chief and general manager of B-92, a Serbian radio station. From April 1990 to April 1993, Vučinić was the general manager and editor-in- chief of Radio B92 in Belgrade, one of the few independent news outlets that operated in Yugoslavia during Slobodan Milošević's regime. He established B92 as a legal entity and was its first CEO. From April 1993 to May 1995, Vučinić worked as a media consultant to the Soros Foundation Network in Prague. MDIF (previously MDLF) In 1995, with seed money from George Soros's Open Society Institute, Vučinić and the late Washington Post journalist Stuart Auerbach formed the Media Development Investment Fund (MDIF), an international non-profit organization based in New York City, Prague, Hong Kong, and Singapore with the goal of establishing a fund to provide loans to independent press organizations in new democracies with histories of government oppression of the media. In July 2005, Vučinić recorded a TED talk in Oxford, UK, in which he noted that 83% of the people in the world live in countries without an independent press and thus don't know what's really going on in their homelands. The “information” they receive is twisted and colored, and as a result they “are deprived of understanding their reality.” On May 4, 2006, Bruno Giussani of TED reported that Vučinić's idea had become reality: “for the first time a social cause will be listed on a major stock exchange.” He explained that the MDLF, the Swiss bank Vontobel, and a Zurich firm, responsAbility, were jointly introducing “a security that mobilises private investment to support a free press – basically a bond with a social element.” By 2012, MDLF had made over $100 million in loans to newspapers, magazines, radio stations and websites around the world, funding over 200 projects in 30 countries; by the same year, over 36 million people in the developing world were getting their news from media financed by MDLF. Vučinić served as the CEO and Managing Director of MDLF until 31 March 2011, when he stepped down and was succeeded by Harlan Mandel, his deputy managing director for the previous 13 years. MDLF changed its name to the Media Development Investment Fund in 2013.http://moonofthesouth.com/mdlf-rebrands-media-development/ IndieVoices Vučinić founded IndieVoices, a crowdfunding portal that raises funds for independent media, mostly in the developing world.

The campus, situated on the east shore of the Hudson River, offers sweeping views of the Catskill Mountains and is within the Hudson River Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. Almost all campus buildings built prior to 1950 are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as contributing features to the historic district. The campus contains more than 70 buildings with a total gross building space of . Campus buildings represent varied architectural styles, but the campus remains heavily influenced by the Collegiate Gothic and Postmodern styles. Bard's historic buildings are associated with the early development of the college and the history of the Hudson River estates (see Bard College History). During a late twentieth century building boom, the college embraced a trend of building signature buildings designed by prominent architects like Robert Venturi, Frank Gehry, and Rafael Viñoly. Campus Organization Route 9G, a New York State highway, provides access to the Bard campus at Annandale Road, Campus Road, and River Road. The geographic organization of the campus is centered around Annandale Road, which serves as the de facto campus thoroughfare. The campus comprises three distinct, but unified, regions due to its size and historical development: Central, North, and South Campus. Each historically-rich region is host to both historic and contemporary architecture. Additionally, the campus includes the undeveloped woodlands as far west as the Tivoli Bays Wildlife Management Area, which consists of the North Tivoli Bay, South Tivoli Bay, Cruger Island, Magdalen Island, and many acres of upland forest. Central Campus and Historic Core Central Campus serves as the administrative and academic core of the college. Central Campus also includes the historic core, the geographic area that encompasses the majority of Bard's historic buildings. Buildings within the historic core are heavily influenced by the collegiate gothic style and were designed by prominent American architects between the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth-century. Outside of the historic core, central campus is significant for its postmodern structures built after the 1980s. Library Complex The library is a complex of three buildings, each built in different architectural styles. Hoffman was constructed in 1893, Kellogg in 1973, and Stevenson in 1993. The greek revival Hoffman Memorial Library was named after trustee and donor Charles Hoffman. When constructed, the library was the only building on campus not designed in the Collegiate Gothic style. The terra-cotta brick temple, built in the ionic order, cost $73,000 to construct and was one of the first fireproof structures in the nation. The building was designed to be a physical representation of the college's early emphasis on Classical studies. The Kellogg Library wing, designed by S.M.S. Architects in New Canaan, CT, was added in 1973. Following a trend among college campuses, the wing was built in the brutalist style. It strikingly juxtaposes with the original Hoffman Library. The postmodern Stevenson addition was constructed in 1993 and designed by acclaimed architect Robert Venturi. In addition to designing the new 27,500 square foot wing, Venturi renovated the existing 25,000 square foot Hoffman and Kellogg complex. In designing the interior, Venturi, following in the footsteps of Louis Kahn, placed the stacks in the center of the building, whereas seating areas were designed near the windows. The Venturi addition is a contemporary counterpart to its neighboring temple. The south elevation of the building prominently features colorful, vertical, rhythms that mimic, yet contrast, the columns of the Hoffman Library. The west elevation features a patterned, tan-colored, brick facade. The north facade is plain tan-colored brick that relates with the Kellogg wing. Venturi incorporated three different facades in order to relate the Stevenson wing to Hoffman and Kellogg. Additionally, Venturi designed a propylaeum that evokes of classicism, with a contemporary flare. The propylaeum leads into an outdoor entrance plaza that provides dramatic views of a muddy field and the Catskill Mountains to the west. F.W. Olin Humanities Building The Franklin W. Olin Humanities Building, built in 1987 and designed by Cathy Simon of Simon Martin-Vegue Winkelstein Moris (prior to its merger with Perkins+Will), serves as the main academic building for the anthropology, history, philosophy, religion, literature, creative writing, foreign languages, art history, and music history department. The building comprises small lecture rooms, seminar rooms, an art history room, and a poetry room. Behind the main academic building, a 380-seat concert hall is attached to the main building by a glass lobby that features a circular interior colonnade. In designing the building, Simon was influenced by postmodern historicism, a trend that calls for the exploration and reinterpretation of past architectural traditions. The building subtly echoes the nearby collegiate gothic structures in color, shape, and size. The Olin building had to complement its surroundings due to its unique location; the building forms, and serves as the anchor of, a quadrangle that did not exist prior to its construction. Bard Hall Built in 1854, Bard Hall was commissioned by the John Bard family in order to serve as a chapel and parish school for Annandale village. The building was built before the founding of the college, in 1860. The building was designed in the gothic revival style. Chapel of the Holy Innocents The Chapel, built in 1859, was commissioned by the John Bard family in 1857. The original chapel was designed in the gothic revival style by Frank Wills. In 1858, two days after Christmas, the chapel was destroyed by a fire caused by a defective flue. Because the chapel was uninsured, a new building was constructed at the cost of $34,000. The existing chapel was constructed in 1859 by Charles Babcock. In 1915, the interior of the chapel was redesigned by acclaimed architect Ralph Adams Cram. A well on the north side of the church, dedicated in 1888, was fundraised by ladies of the parish to commemorate John Bard's First Wife. An inscription on the well reads \\"St Margaret's Well, erected in 1887, in loving memory of Margaret Johnston Bard. 'I was thirsty and ye gave me a drink.\\" Ludlow and Willink Ludlow and Willink was built in 1869 and currently serves as the main administrative building on campus. It houses the Offices of the President, Vice President for Administration, Dean of the College, and the Registrar. The building, which cost $53,000, was designed in the collegiate gothic style with second empire detailing by renowned architect Richard Upjohn. North Campus North Campus was formed in 1963, when Bard purchased the Ward Manor estate. North Campus, excluding the Fisher Center, consists entirely of student dormitories. Postmodern architecture and historicism is distinctly evident in this part of campus. Dormitories like Cruger Village and New Robbins evoke, with a contemporary flare, the historic agricultural buildings that existed in the area. Ward Manor The first residence constructed on the Ward Manor property was commissioned by General John Armstrong Jr. around 1790. At the time, the estate was named The Meadows. In 1914, Louis Gordon Hamersley purchased the estate and erected a Tudor Revival style mansion and gatehouse designed by Francis Hoppin, what today is Ward Manor House and the Ward Gatehouse. Hamersley expanded his estate, acquiring several farms to the north, and finally the Cruger's Island estate in 1920. In 1926, William B. Ward purchased the combined estate in memory of his father Robert (founder of the Ward Baking Company, and immediately donated it to the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor. The mansion was renovated as a retirement home, and an annex was added in 1931. Both Manor House and Manor Annex served as a retirement home until Bard purchased the estate in 1963. Today, the Ward Manor complex serves as a student dormitory. Manor Cafe is located on the first floor of the building, and the Manor lounge serves as a student study space, open on weekdays until 2a.m. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts The Fisher Center for the Performing Arts is a metal-clad, deconstructivist building designed by acclaimed architect Frank Gehry. South Campus In addition to undergraduate academic and residential buildings, South Campus is home to the Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture, The László Z. Bitó Conservatory Building, and Blithewood Manor, home of the Levy Economics Institute. Bertelsmann Campus Center The postmodern Campus Center, designed by Cathy Simon of Perkins+Will, is a 30,000-square-foot facility that opened in 1999. The facade incorporates tan- colored brick and blue EIFS. The spacious building features oversized windows and, like Simon's Olin Humanities Building, exhibits a distinct separation of functions. Weis Cinema, a 100-seat theater, protrudes from the South side of the building, whereas the Multi-Purpose Room encompasses the entire building footprint on the eastern end. In addition to lounge areas and student space, the Campus Center is host to several student-oriented offices, like the Career Development Office, the Trustee Leader Scholar Office, and the Student Activities Office.  Blithewood Manor  The name Blithewood dates back to Robert Donaldson Jr. of North Carolina who purchased the estate in 1830 and hired landscape designer Andrew Jackson Downing to transform the grounds. In 1853, John Bard purchased a corner of the Blithewood estate to found St. Stephens college, which would eventually become Bard College. Captain Andrew C. Zabriskie purchased the land from Bard in 1899 and commissioned Francis Hoppin to build a manor house and gardens on the estate. The manor was built in an English influenedd Beaux-Arts style. Zabriskie's son would eventually donate the estate, along with its manor to Bard College in 1951. In 1987, the college designated the estate to be under the ownership of the Levy Economics Institute. Aside from the Levy Economics Institute, the Blithewood manor houses offices for Bard scholars and staff, a library, and lecture and meeting rooms. Forest The forest to the west of Bard extends from Sawkill Creek in the south to Cruger Road in the north. This mixed hardwood forest lies on a series of valleys descending from Bard College campus to South Bay, which lies separated from the Hudson by a railroad. The forest is relatively young and light competition and density are high. The forest contains several ruins in the form of cellars and foundations. Archaeological studies of this area's use by native Americans are currently underway by resident archaeologist Christopher Lindner. This forest and the surrounding area suffer from an overpopulation of deer; Accordingly, undergrowth foliage is sparse and Lyme disease is very common among deer ticks in this area.

Upon experiencing a failed marriage, Bai Liusu's large and extended family feels she has shamed the family through divorce which resulted her situation at home to become unbearable. The story then begins with Bai Liusu receiving news of her ex- husband's death and her refusal to attend the funeral. Fan Liuyuan is a bachelor who had just returned from England and was working closely in the mining business with Mr Xu, the matchmaker Mrs Xu's husband. While Mrs Xu attempted to introduce Bai Liusu's sister, Bai Baolu, to Fan Liuyuan, Fan became interested in Bai Liusu instead. When Fan Liuyuan left to Hong Kong for work, Bai Liusu follows to Hong Kong to win the love of Fan in hoping to get a legitimate marriage status and economic stability. Although everything was going quite smooth in Hong Kong, Bai Liusu thinks that she cannot trust Fan Liuyuan. Thinking that Fan Liuyuan will not marry her, Bai Liusu decides to return to Shanghai. Upon returning home, her family finds her useless coming back and bringing shame to the family. Later, Fan Liuyuan calls on her and she decides to return to him. Throughout the story, they undergo many trials and tribulations together, while both doubting the other's true commitment and love for each other. However, it was through the fall of Hong Kong that they realize that their love for each other is far more enduring and valuable. The city and their love share an antithetical relationship as their love triumphs with the city being defeated during the Japanese invasion.Chang, Eileen. Love in a Fallen City and Other Stories.

Bai Liusu is subjected daily to her family members' taunts and insults as she has “no money to maintain a respectful position in the household nor the youth to qualify as a desirable bride on the marriage market”.Kong, Belinda. \\"Shanghai Biopolitans: Wartime Colonial Cosmopolis in Eileen Chang's Love in a Fallen City and J. G. Ballard's Empire of the Sun.\\" Journal of Narrative Theory, vol. 39, no. 3, 2009, pp. 280-304. Bai is also “aware that she occupies the lowest rung on the family hierarchy\\". Bai's character illustrates the idea of the fetters placed on women of feudal China. Fan Liuyan Fan Liuyan is a rich 32-year-old bachelor who is known to be a womanizer and has just returned to China from Britain. Fan feels troubled by his life outside China and lack of an authentic Chinese identity. Fan tries to find his Chinese identity through people around him and from his clan but fails. Thus, Fan's absent Chineseness is translated into wanting a “real Chinese woman”Meng, Qiao, and Noritah Omar. \\"Pure Ethnicity in Hybridization: A Returnee’s Quest for Chineseness in “Love in a Fallen City.” Ariel: A Review of International English Literature, vol. 45, no. 1, 2014, pp. 59-77. which he believes Bai Liusu embodies. Although Fan seeks for a pure Chinese identity, he has a hybridized identity due to his background. Princess Saheiyini Princess Saheiyini arrives in Hong Kong with an Englishman who takes care of her at the beginning of the story. She claims to be the daughter of Prince Krishna Kramupa, but that her mother had lost the prince's favor which resulted in her being exiled with the need to flee from her own country. Saheiyini dresses fancily every time she meets with Bai and Fan. After the war begins, Saheiyini seems to become impoverished, and she says that the Englishman had been imprisoned and ended up living with an Indian policeman's family. Fourth Mistress The Fourth Mistress is the wife of the fourth Master of the Bai Family. Fourth Mistress enjoys gossiping and badmouths Bai Liusu. After Bai Liusu and Fan Liuyan gets married in Hong Kong, Liusu realizes that Fourth Mistress was divorced from the fourth Master in one of her returns to Shanghai. Fourth Master of the Bai Family The Fourth Master of the Bai Family enjoys playing the huiqin. He does not have power in the Bai household and ends up in a divorce from the Fourth Mistress. Bai Baolu Bai Baolu is 24 years old and the seventh young lady of the Bai family. She was originally intended, by Mrs Xu, the matchmaker, to meet Fan Liuyuan. However, during their meeting, the family follows along and Bai Liusu takes the chance to dance with Fan Liuyuan instead. After the dance, Fan chooses Bai Liusu over Bai Baolu. Mrs. Xu Mrs. Xu is the matchmaker who introduces men to the Bai family, hoping to make a match for the young ladies in the family. Mrs. Xu's husband, Mr. Xu, does business with Fan Liuyuan. Upon knowing the affection between Bai Liusu and Fan Liuyuan, Mrs Xu helps Bai Liusu to go to Hong Kong to find Fan Liuyan.  Themes of the novella   Individualism in crisis  One of the dominant theme in Love in the Fallen City is the anxiety of self-identity. Due to the persistence of traditional forces, ethical-moral values, various domestic and international conflicts and wars, a bourgeois self-identity becomes difficult to establish.Xiaoping Wang. “Eileen Chang's Cross-Cultural Writing and Rewriting in Love in a Fallen City (《 倾城之恋》).” Comparative Literature Studies, vol. 49, no. 4, 2012, pp. 565–584. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/complitstudies.49.4.0565.  Matrimonial anxiety  Another thematic focus of the story is matrimonial anxiety in the traditional social institution. In the novel, middle-class women such as Bai Liusu and Fourth Mistress aim to grab any opportunity to increase their class status in order to secure their financial security. The anxiety generated by marriage and love is a response to the social-political dilemma. Under this robust womanhood, “in its core, it harbors a profound cultural and historical nihilism.” Historical background of the novella At the ending paragraphs of the Love in a Fallen City, Shanghai has come under full-scale Japanese occupation, Hong Kong has lost its brief battle, and China faces its darkest years as a nation under siege.Kong, Belinda. \\"Shanghai Biopolitans: Wartime Colonial Cosmopolis in Eileen Chang's Love in a Fallen City and J. G. Ballard's Empire of the Sun.\\" Journal of Narrative Theory, vol. 39 no. 3, 2009, pp. 280-304. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/jnt.0.0038  Wartime background  Nicole Huang made a comment on Eileen Chang's essays which could be equally applied onto her fictions under wartime background: \\"Here, Chang’s vision of wartime life is presented as caught between the territory of historical reality (war, turbulence, blockade, hunger, death, and scarcity) and the domain of imagination (fantasy, emotional yearning, and artistic creativity). The persistence of the singing voice in a night she describes as so “big,\\" so “broken,” and so “cruel\\" is, of course, Eileen Chang's own reading of an individual's relation to the larger and, at times, overwhelming historical reality. Instead of writing about how routines of life are disrupted by the aggression of war, she chooses to focus on how the experience of urban life is actually intensified despite the fact that the outside world is gradually being shattered.\\"Nicole Huang, \\"Introduction,\\" in Eileen Chang, Written on Water, translated by Andrew F. Jones (New York: Columbia University Press, 2005), xv. When the novella was first published in 1943, it was still during the Sino-Japanese war, and both Shanghai and Hong Kong were under the Japanese occupation. The Chinese-controlled parts of Shanghai was first fallen to the Japanese in 1937, and the foreign concessions had also been taken down by the Japanese imperial troops in 1941 with the beginning of the Pacific War.Allison, Rottmann (2007). Resistance, urban style: The New Fourth Army and Shanghai, 1937--1945 (Ph.D.). University of California, Berkeley, Shanghai had since become one of the two ‘fallen’ cities in Eileen Chang's novella. Before the Japanese invasion, Hong Kong had already been a British colony for more than 100 years. the city was also captured by the Japanese forces after the defeat of the British, Canadian and Indian forces on the Christmas Day as the Governor of Hong Kong Mark Aitchison Young, accompanied by other British colonial officials surrendered at the Japanese headquarters,Courtauld, Caroline. Holdsworth, May. [1997] (1997). The Hong Kong Story. Oxford University Press. . pp. 54–58, the local people had referred to the day as “Black Christmas”Hong Kong's 'Black Christmas'\\". China Daily. 8 December 2008. Retrieved 19 December 2013, Hong Kong too, had become the second ‘fallen’ city in the novella.  Writing inspiration  In her essay, “Reflections on ‘Love in a Fallen City’” (回顧傾城之戀, 1984), Chang relates that during the summer break in her studies at the University of Hong Kong in 1941 she often went to the Repulse Bay Hotel to visit her mother and her mahjong friends. Later, the members of the mahjong group all fled to Singapore and Hanoi. Two, however, stayed in Hong Kong and lived together. Chang claims that Love in a Fallen City is based on the story of this couple who remained in Hong Kong. In her words, “The motive for writing ‘Love in a Fallen City’— at least in relation to their story—I think it was because they were the most affected by the war in Hong Kong among my acquaintances.” According to Chang, then, the “original” idea for the tale came from the real-life experience of a couple she knew. The couple's love story might in fact replicate conventional cultural codes of behavior and fictional or non-fictional historical episodes. Therefore, Love in a Fallen City to some extent can be seen as an adaptation of a true story. Literary critics Love in a Fallen City seems to be a melodramatic romance that finally comes to fruition. Typical of the writer's stories about social mannerisms, this novelette is “filled with witty conversations and relentless gossip,” “intricate codes of dress, dining, and socializing,” and “arabesque mannerisms in both private and public domains,” which are “taken as matters of life and death for those leisurely regulars.”Wang, Xiaoping. \\"Eileen Chang's Cross-Cultural Writing and Rewriting in Love in a Fallen City (《 倾城之恋》).\\" Comparative Literature Studies, vol. 49 no. 4, 2012, pp. 565-584. Wang Xiaoping, an associate professor of Chinese and comparative literature in the school of Chinese at Xiamen University, China, indicated that \\"the predominant thematic focus of Zhang’s stories is a matrimonial anxiety by which middle- class women aim to cash in on any opportunity to unabashedly transcend their class status to secure financial security and a boost in their social status. In its response to the crisis of marriage and love as social institution, this anxiety articulates, crystallizes, and projects the social-political dilemma and predicament of this class. Yet more often than not it produces nothing but utter failure or illusionary success. The feeling that “we have been deserted,” articulated by the writer, echoes this sentiment of a fundamental crisis. Together with the pessimism generated by the social turmoil and human costs of the “war,” a sense of resignation appears, which, while it sometimes impersonates itself as robust womanhood, in its core it harbors a profound cultural and historical nihilism\\". Fu Lei (Chinese:傅雷）)praised her talent and art but criticized the content of her fiction “taken up by flirtation” and “it’s all a spiritual game of cynical hedonists.” He continues to criticize that despite love and marriage is the author's central theme, the couple in the story is often “pestered by this nightmare of a romantic problem between man and woman” and the flippancy depicted in her somber prose ruins the art of her writing. Chang later wrote a self-defensive essay called “My Own Writing” to articulate her aesthetic principles, cenci de duizhao, which Karen Kingsbury considers it more than just elaborating theme and character, but also operating at the level of narrative style, “in the teasing voice of the narrator, and the frequent shuttling between, for instance, self-mockery and self-indulgence, fantasy and reality, satire and sympathy.” Liu Zaifu, the famous Chinese littérateur, ideologist and humanist mentioned in his article that “At first glance, Eileen Chang’s best works, including “The Golden Cangue” and “Love in a Fallen City,” describe the details of family activities, love relationships, and marriages that occupy mundane life in places like Shanghai, but they in fact reveal the eternal mysteries in human nature that lie beneath the surface of life, mysteries of human desires for power and money.”Zaifu, Liu, “Eileen Chang’s Fiction and C.T.Hsia’s A history of Modern Chinese Fiction”, translated by Yunzhong Shu, 2009, MCLC Resource Center Liang Wendao: \\"A lot of people tend to ignore the connection between Eileen Chang's work and the Sino Japanese War. But there was a connection. Just like in Love in a fallen city, where she didn't mention how the people in Hong Kong escaped from the gunfire, or what happened between the British and the Japanese forces on the battlefield. What she did mention was how people had lived their daily life under the war, such as life between the two lovers in this novella. It does affect the way we view that war or our society during the war. She had shown us the real life of the most common people. Yes, there was a war; Yes, the Japs had occuiped our land. But life still had to go on. You still had to eat and drink. And of course there would be love and even sex. Eileen Chang had shown us during wartime, in such a big city like Shanghai, how the ordinary people had lived through their life. Would there be any story in such a way of life? Yes, but it must have been covered by a touch of sadness or Eileen Chang's most favourite word, desolation.Liang Wendao, \\"YiQianLingYiYe\\", uploaded by Youku, Youtube, 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf7ESfQpRHI Adaptations  Movies  *Love in a Fallen City, a 1984 film starring Cora Miao and Chow Yun-fat; directed by Ann Hui  TV series  *Love in a Fallen City, a 2009 TV series starring Chen Shu and Huang Jue; produced by the China Television Production Center and released to several channels in the Mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction : Cleavage of Xaa-Asp, Xaa-Glu and Xaa- cysteic acid bonds =History= Peptidyl-Asp metalloendopeptidase was first discovered when it was isolated from the supernatant of Pseudomonas fragi. Originally, it was thought that this bacteria produced only a single proteinase, but later it was discovered that P. fragi can produce more than one proteinase species. This is of interest due to the fact that one of the mutants identified has a cleavage specificity that was previously unknown and can be used in protein sequencing. This enzyme became commercialized as endoproteinase (Asp-N). =Overview= The structure consists of a single chain protein with a molecular mass of 24,440 kDa when analyzed with a mass spectrometer. In an SDS gel, the band lies within the 27,000 kDa region. The protein sequence contains a HEXXH pattern which can be utilized as a zinc binding site. It belongs to the M72 family MEROPS. This enzyme is useful because it cleaves specific peptide bonds in aspartic acid (Xaa-Cya) and cysteic acid (Xaa-Cya) residues at the N-terminus however this enzyme is unable to cleave isoaspartic acid. Typically cleavage of glutamic acid requires specific conditions, but is much slower than the aspartyl peptides. This cleavage can be controlled by reducing the concentration of enzymes in the digestion process and cutting down the incubation time. There are a few ways to determine the activity of this enzyme. This can be accomplished by performing a proteinase assay using proteins as substrates, using a fluorescence assay looking for self quenching detrimeric peptide. Succinimide is an intermediate that is formed when the alpha carbon on Asp or Asn is lost, this is a very specific event which occurs in Asp 58 and Asn 151 of alpha crystalline. This is common among beta amyloids that are received from the elderly, thus leading to believe that there is involvement with this mutation and aging. Isoaspartic acid (isoAsp) has also been shown to have involvement with aging, autoimmune disorders, cancer and neurodegeneration. This acid is created when asparagine undergoes deamination or isomerization of aspartic acid occurs. This is concerning for the pharmaceutical industry because it can cause aggregation or even disrupt enzyme activity. However, it is difficult to conduct further research because of the similarity in mass and chemical properties of isoAsp and Asp.

She spent her short career in minelaying operations in the North Sea before striking a mine and sinking in 1918. Construction and commissioning Vehement was ordered in July 1916. She was laid down on 25 September 1916 by William Denny and Brothers at Dumbarton, Scotland, and, per a British Admiralty order of 12 January 1917, was fitted to carry 60 naval mines. She was launched on 6 July 1917 and was completed later in 1917 and commissioned into service. Her original pennant number, F1A, was changed to F12 in January 1918 and to H2A in June 1918. Service history Upon completion, V- and W-class destroyers, including Vehement, were assigned to the Grand Fleet or Harwich Force Vehement herself was assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla in February 1918.Smith, p. 39. In 1918, the 20th Destroyer Flotilla was engaged in a major British effort to lay minefields in the North Sea to close the Heligoland Bight to passage by German ships and submarines. On 31 May 1918, Vehement put to sea from Immingham with the flotilla to lay mines in the Dogger Bank area.Smith, p. 66. On the night of 4–5 June 1918, the flotilla again deployed from the Humber estuary to mine the same area, bringing the total number of mines laid in the two expeditions to 330.Smith, pp. 66–67. Vehement′s next sortie from Immingham on 21 June 1918 ended almost as soon as it began when her propellers suffered damage after striking a cable while she was leaving the harbour, forcing her to remain in port for repairs. She was back in service in time to join her flotilla in laying a North Sea minefield on 27 June 1918. On the night of 5–6 July and again on the night of 8–9 July 1918, she joined her flotilla in laying a field of 384 mines in 18 rows in the North Sea.Smith, pp. 68, 70. On the night of 13–14 July 1918, Vehement and the destroyers , , and laid a field of 224 mines in the North Sea. On the night of 17–18 July 1918, her flotilla laid another North Sea minefield of 424 mines with cover for the operation provided by the 7th Cruiser Squadron, but German forces did not interfere.Smith, p. 70. Vehement′s next minelaying operation on 24 July 1918 involved the entire flotilla laying 496 mines in the North Sea in 22 rows; during the operation, Vehement detected two periscopes. The flotilla sortied from the Humber again at 13:00 hours on 28 July 1918 and during the night of 28–29 July laid a North Sea field of 416 mines in 18 rows.Smith, pp. 73–74. On 1 August 1918, the 20th Destroyer Flotilla departed the Humber to lay a minefield in the North Sea at the seaward end of one of the German-swept channels through the German minefield in the Heligoland Bight. At 23:47 hours the force was within 20 nautical miles (37 km) of the area it was to mine when Vehement struck a mine at . Its explosion caused her forward ammunition magazine to detonate, blowing off the entire forward section of the ship forward of the forward funnel, killing one officer and 47 ratings.LITHERLAND AT WAR 1914–1918 Petty Officer Stoker PETER CULSHAW 1877–1918Smith, pp. 74–85. As the force manoeuvered to clear the German minefield it had entered, the destroyer also struck a mine at 00:10 hours on 2 August and, in a repeat of what had happened to Vehement, suffered a magazine detonation that blew off the entire section of the ship forward of the whaleboat′s davit. Ariel sank at about 01:00 hours, with the loss of four officers and 45 ratings,Smith, pp. 79–81. but Vehement remained afloat, and by about an hour after she struck the mine her crew had put out all of her fires. She was taken in tow by the destroyer in the hope of saving her, but at 04:00 hours on 2 August Vehement′s stern rose into the air, making further towing impossible. Vehement′s surviving crew opened all of her hull valves to speed her sinking and abandoned ship. Telemachus and Vanquisher then sank Vehement with gunfire.

Life Margaret Rizza was born in 1929 into a musical family, where her mother played piano and her father was the organist for his local parish church. She attended the Royal College of Music from age 17, to study piano, at which she admits she was not particularly proficient. However, she soon switched to studying singing, and completed her training first at the National School of Opera in London and then at Siena and Rome in Italy, after which she pursued a career as an opera singer, using the name Margaret Lensky, for 25 years. During this time she sang at many of the leading venues for opera, working with conductors including Leonard Bernstein, Benjamin Britten and Igor Stravinsky. She married George Rizza, who emigrated from Italy to Scotland with his family aged 11, and who managed Chester Music and Novello for nearly forty years. Together they have one son and one daughter. From 1977 to 1994, she taught singing at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. From 1986 onwards, she was increasingly involved in projects to bring music to the community and in aspects of spirituality. The community work involved taking groups of student musicians into prisons, hospitals, hospices, inner city schools, centres for sufferers from Multiple Sclerosis, schools for the blind, and working with people with physical and learning difficulties. She also worked with the World Community for Christian Meditation, leading retreats, workshops on vocal and choral skills, and days of prayer and music. Until 2008, she also conducted vocal workshops and masterclasses at the Dartington International Summer School. She turned to composing music relatively late in life, when Sister Pamela Hayes, who was a good friend, asked her to write some music which would form an introduction to prayer at an international conference. Despite an initial reluctance, she produced six pieces of music for the conference, and in 1997 released them on a CD. Most of her composition has been of church music, and she has been involved in training and directing choral groups and choirs since 1989. By 2013, she had been involved in the production of ten CDs of choral music, acting principally as conductor. As well as her work in Britain, she has conducted conferences and seminars featuring her music in Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States. BBC Radio Kent gave her an award in 2003 for the best interview on prayer and music, and in 2004 she received an Andrew Cross Award for religious journalism. In 2007, the English conductor Harry Christophers commissioned her to write a choral work for The Sixteen, a choir and period instrument orchestra. This led to her developing a new style of writing, which she calls \\"classical contemporary\\", and the composition entitled Ave Generosa was released on CD, sung by The Sixteen and conducted by Christophers. It premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on London's South Bank in 2008, and in the United States in 2009.

It is traditionally made with sun-dried leftover cooked white rice that is fried and coated with syrup. Etymology Ampaw means \\"puffed grain\\" in Philippine languages. Though it applies predominantly to the rice version, popcorn can also be referred to as ampaw (more accurately as ampaw na mais, \\"puffed corn\\"). In Cebuano slang, ampaw is also a euphemism roughly equivalent to the English idiom \\"[a person] full of hot air\\". Ampaw should not be confused with Chinese red envelopes, ampao or ang pao, a close homonym in Philippine Hokkien. Description Ampaw is made with cooked white rice (usually leftovers). It is dried in the sun for around four hours. They are then fried in hot oil to make them puff up. The oil is drained thoroughly after frying. The sugar glazing is cooked separately using muscovado sugar or molasses (or corn syrup), salt, butter, and vinegar or calamansi juice. The glazing is poured unto the puffed rice and mixed until the grains are evenly coated. It is then allowed to cool and shaped into the desired form before it fully hardens.

It was written in 1949 but not recorded until 1956, and many times more since then. It is one of the standard songs celebrating the city of Amsterdam, and one of the best-known and most popular songs in the Netherlands. Structure and content The song is a waltz, in 3/4 measure. Typical accompaniment is the accordion. The first verse recounts a childhood experience in the house of the grandparents, a house now occupied by other people and partly converted to office space. The second explains that after having traveled widely the speaker still longs to return to the city \\"on the Amstel and the IJ\\". A transitional verse suggests that the trees, high above traffic, and the boats on the water are unchanged. According to the refrain, the speaker has given his heart to the Amsterdam canals; Amsterdam fills his thoughts, and nothing could be better than to be an Amsterdammer. History Goemans was inspired to write the song in 1949 while walking across the bridge where the Prinsengracht and the Leidsegracht intersect. It wasn't supplied with sheet music and recorded until 1956, when an arrangement was written by pianist Dick Schallies (then a member of the Metropole Orkest) since (Schallies explained) Goemans couldn't write music. Schallies denies rumors that Enrico Neckheim was responsible for the music. Goemans published the song under a pseudonym, Peter Shott; he was a diplomat's son and his father allowed him to be associated with the popular music industry only if he did so under an assumed name. Henk Visscher, singer as well as guitar and bass player with Johnny Kraaijkamp, was the first to sing and record the song, though other sources have Kraaijkamp sing it first, in the Café de Paris near the Leidseplein. In 2006, Visscher, a friend of Goemans from the cafe, explained that he had been asked to record a demo for the song the morning after Goemans and Schallies had finally put music to the lyrics, with Schallies playing piano. Goemans had wanted Kraaijkamp, but knew better than to call him early in the morning; he called Visscher, since he did not drink. The first recording that was released was made in 1956 by singer/soccer player Hans Boskamp in a duet with his wife Nan; the spelling on that recording is still the old-fashioned \\"Amsterdamsche\\". A page dedicated to the song on the web site of the Amsterdam City Archives plays that first released recording. Other notable artists of the 1950s and 1960s to record the song include Tante Leen. Of all renditions Wim Sonneveld's (1962) is probably the best known. It was covered by foreigners as well, including Belgian singer Louis Neefs, and by experimental jazz musician Willem Breuker. Recent versions were made by Huub van der Lubbe en André Rieu. Legacy Goeman's ashes (he died in 2000) were spread over the Prinsengracht. A plaque is affixed to the bridge, commemorating the place of inspiration for the song, and in 2008 the bridge was named for him. The annual Prinsengrachtconcert is traditionally closed with a (classical) rendition of the song. The carillon of the Westertoren plays the song every half hour on Tuesday; on a list of the top 100 Dutch songs compiled by Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool the song occupies first place.

It is a Non-Governmental Organisation. Founded in 1856, the Chamber is intended to \\"inspire and influence business vitality\\". As of 2013, the Chamber claims a membership of 12,000 business owners. History The Chamber was founded in 1856, at a meeting of merchants on 24 January, during a period of economic depression. Active in the 1860s, the Chamber floundered somewhat before an 1869 reorganisation that opened its ranks to a wider variety of merchants, on an annual subscription basis. Following its inception it focused on issues ranging from remedying trade abuses and obtaining adequate facilities for businesses, to standardization of grain weights and simplifying the customs tariff. Core activities The Chamber hosts events and training courses. As at 14 May 2013, courses offered included 'Organisational Mentoring', 'Customer Service Skills', 'Accounting for Non-Accountants' and 'Successful Business Communication'. The Chamber also maintains a media presence predominantly through its Chief Executive Officer, Michael Barnett, who has commented on topics including Auckland Transport, Water Charges, Council Rates and the National Convention Centre. The Chamber seeks to provide work opportunities to jobseekers through such initiatives as the CadetMax programme, with the New Zealand Ministry of Social Development, and the New Kiwis, with Immigration New Zealand. Other services The Chamber offers international services such as documentation and certification, advice and market intelligence, banking and finance, services for inbound trade delegations and letters of introduction.

It was constructed from 1915 to 1917 as the first permanent home of a Duluth Public Library branch first established in 1892. The Lincoln Branch Library was built of brick and limestone in the Late Gothic Revival style. It was the last of the three Carnegie libraries built in Duluth. Library services moved to a new facility in 1990. Two years later the Duluth Art Institute (DAI) purchased the vacated library building. The DAI uses the venue to host studio space, classes, and events. In 2013 the Lincoln Branch Library building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its local significance in the theme of social history. It was nominated for reflecting the evolving emphasis of the Carnegie Foundation and Duluth Public Library on branch libraries and on providing services in working-class neighborhoods. Description View from the west with garage addition on left The Lincoln Branch Library is a rectangular, single-story building in Late Gothic Revival style. The original structure measures , with a addition. The exterior facade is brown and dark red brickwork, arranged in Flemish bond, contrasted with limestone trim. The southeast face of the building is symmetrical and features the library's main entrance. Leading to the entrance is a concrete stairway with a brick and limestone railing on each side. The entrance consists of a pair of wooden, glass-paned doors framed by limestone. The line of the eaves is interrupted by a pediment carved with an acanthus leaf design. In the middle of the pediment a shield motif bears the initials \\"DPL\\", standing for Duluth Public Library. Immediately above the doorway is carved \\"Lincoln Branch Library\\". The entrance is flanked by original, square lanterns. The ground level features two series of five 10/15 double-hung windows. The first level has two bands of seven windows flanking the entrance just below the eave. The ground and first floor are separated by a beveled limestone belt course, above which are symmetrically arranged carved stone shields. The stairway was rebuilt in 1996 using the original limestone. The southwest façade features a large gable end with a three-tiered Gothic window framed in limestone. The window is flanked by two stone shields, and above it is a limestone band near the gable's peak in the shape of an \\"ɪ\\". The ground level 10/15 windows continue, along with the belt course separating the first and ground levels. There is a ground- level entrance to the west under a flat roof portion, consisting of a pair of wooden doors with arched glass panels. The entrance is topped by a pediment inscribed with \\"Club Room\\". A set of steps leads to the entrance, flanked by brick and limestone railings. The entrance sits on a two-story, pentagonal bay with windows wrapping around it on the first level. At the window head is another limestone course which wraps around the building's west side. Along the northwest face is where the garage addition was built, obstructing the original façade. According to original blueprints, the addition forced the removal of windows and possibly an entrance. At ground level, four window openings appear to have been bricked over. There are two rows of three windows on the first level on the exposed area of the northwest gable end. Near the peak of the gable are three narrow, vertical windows. The northeast face is similar to the southwest; the gable has the same window, stone shields, and \\"I\\"-shaped band. The belt course continues around the facade, and six 10/15 windows are arrayed at ground level. At the building's north corner is a rectangular brick chimney, capped by stone with a quoin at each corner. The corner also features five windows with a limestone course at the window head. The building has undergone a number of renovations over its life, but most were performed to comply with building codes and did not significantly impact the library's historic integrity. The property is minimally landscaped. A large conifer stands at the southern corner of the building, and there is a deciduous tree east of the main entrance. There is garden space next to the building along the southeast and southwest facades. The building is surrounded by a cultivated lawn. History Detail of main entrance on the southeast face In 1891, a committee of neighborhood citizens met with the Duluth Library Board to establish a library in Duluth's West End (known as Lincoln Park since 1996). The West End Branch Library, as it was initially called, opened in 1892 in a room of the Irwin–Sloan Block. It operated until the Panic of 1893 and funding cuts forced its closure. It reopened in 1895, but again faced closure in 1896. A Duluth resident made a gift to the library which helped for a time, but the library again closed around the end of 1900. The library opened again in January 1908 and, over the next several years, shifted among a number of locations but remained in operation. An appropriation of $4,300 () was made in April 1915 to purchase two lots in the West End, which were acquired in May. A request for $30,000 () for a permanent library was made of and subsequently granted by Andrew Carnegie. Abraham Holstead and William J. Sullivan were chosen as the architects and Joseph Hanson served as contractor. Designs and blueprints for the library were completed by April 1916. The library was named for its proximity to Lincoln Park, located in the West End. Construction lasted through 1917. The library held its grand opening on August 30, 1917, with 500 people in attendance for a gala ceremony. The library publicly opened on September 1. The Lincoln Branch Library was the third and last Carnegie library built in Duluth, following the 1902 Duluth Public Library and the West Duluth Branch Library. In 1966, a garage was built on the library's northeast face to house two bookmobiles. The building operated as a library until October 1990, when a new library assumed service for western Duluth. The building was bought by the Duluth Art Institute in November 1992. According to the institute, it was purchased to acquire more space and to \\"reach under- served communities.\\" In 1997, the garage addition was renovated, including the replacement of the garage doors with windows.

It was one of the best known Australian films of the 1960s.From the Tropics to the Snow at A Place to Think It was produced under the auspices of the Commonwealth Film Unit (CFU), later reincorporated as Film Australia. It was co-directed by Jack Lee and Richard (Dick) Mason, and featured Reg Livermore (in his first film role) as one of the 'narrators'. One of the regular duties of the CFU at this time was the production of short films that were purpose- made for overseas distribution and were intended to promote Australia as an attractive destination for migrants and tourists. From the Tropics to the Snow marked a significant break with the traditional style of such features, and is noted for its subversive and satirical approach to its subject. Rather than using the stilted, authoritative single-voice narration that was typical of such 'promotion documentaries' at the time, Mason and Lee opted for a strikingly reflexive approach, using a lively (and frequently tongue-in-cheek) multi-voice narration, which is introduced through the dramatic device of a production planning meeting between the film's Producer-in-Chief (Alexander Archdale), the director (Alastair Smart) and the screenwriter (Livermore). This allowed the film to become an ironic critique of itself, humorously examining the mechanics of \\"documentary\\" film construction, and the competing pressures and choices that faced filmmakers when creating such films. It also gently parodied Lee and Mason's own situation as \\"young turks\\" charged with turning out what were in essence \\"production-line\\" propaganda films for a hidebound government department.ABC - \\"A Place To Think: From the Tropics to the Snow\\" The film co-won the Australian Film Institute's Gold Medal for Best Film in 1965.

Maximillian Hugo \\"Max\\" Starcke (November 11, 1884 – June 29, 1972) was a businessman and then a government official in Texas for 37 years, first as Mayor of Seguin, Texas, from 1928 to 1938 and then as Managing Director of the Lower Colorado River Authority from 1940 to 1955. Born and raised on a farm in the York's Creek area about 12 miles north of Seguin, Max Starcke was the son of Hugo and Ida (Eberhard) Starcke, and the grandson of German immigrants. He attended Seguin public schools, then Texas A & M University and a San Antonio business college. Starcke married Meta Blumberg of Seguin in 1908, and they had two daughters, Lucile and Maxine, before her death in 1938. In 1940 he married Evelyn Quinn of Ackerman, Mississippi, and they had one daughter. Businessman and Civic Leader In 1906 he clerked in the law office of state senator Joseph B. Dibrell of Seguin. Starcke also worked as a real estate developer, then established a funeral home, and helped organize Farmer’s State Bank in Seguin. From 1917 to 1938, Starcke worked as a bank officer, first in Farmer's, then at Seguin State Bank & Trust after it took over the smaller bank. After helping to revive the local Chamber of Commerce, he headed its effort to recruit the Chicago White Sox for two seasons of spring training in Seguin, in 1922 and 1923. He also served as president of the South Texas Chamber of Commerce. He was active in the Texas League of Municipalities (later the Texas Municipal Leaguehttp://www.tml.org/history) and served as its president in 1934.http://www.tml.org/pastpres Mayor for 10 years Starcke was an alderman from 1909 to 1912, before being elected mayor in 1928 and re- elected for five terms. He was an dynamic, successful, and highly popular mayor. Not long after he took office, in 1929, the Darst Creek Oil Field came in, about 15 miles east of Seguin. The resulting oil boom carried the town through the worst years of the Depression, as local stores sold supplies and residents rented out rooms to the oil patch workers. The local taxes collected were used to match federal grants for make-work projects that created jobs when the oil rush subsided. Toward the end of his service as mayor, Starcke totaled up the trophies that had transformed his hometown, including the city's first water-filtration plant, a new post office, a new municipal building, a new courthouse, a new jail, new storm sewers and sidewalks, a fountain in the town square, a small park built by the Civilian Conservation Corps along the banks of a stream fed by Walnut Springs, and a park that stretched for a mile along the beautiful Guadalupe River. Also three swimming pools: one for Anglos in the new park, one for blacks at William Ball High School, and one at Juan Seguin School for the Tejanos. Seguin's new show-place park was designed by Robert H.H. Hugman, now famed for his River Walk in San Antonio. Financed largely by the Works Progress Administration, it was built by members of the National Youth Administration. Besides the fine swimming pool, it boasted a golf course, picnic tables and bar-be-que pits along a scenic river drive, a pavilion for parties, a Recreation Building with a rooftop space for dancing under the stars. It was named Max Starcke Park in his honor, and dedicated in 1938, his last year as mayor. During his years as bank officer and Mayor, Starcke bought a small rent house less than two blocks from his workplaces. He hired the Seguin-born architect Marvin Eichenroht to almost double its size behind a handsome Spanish colonial revival exterior of white stone. His yard protected a towering live oak known as the Charter Oak, where the first property owners had signed his hometown's founding document a hundred years before.  At the L.C.R.A.  In 1938, Starcke was hired as the first operations manager of the Lower Colorado River Authority, and he moved to Austin. The authority was constructing several hydroelectric dams that form what are known today as the Highland Lakes. Starcke's chief responsibility was to sell the electricity generated by the LCRA, and at the urging of then- Congressman Lyndon Johnson, to make it as inexpensive as possible to poor consumers. Starke led the efforts to sign up cities and towns as new customers, at rates usually half what they had been paying. At the same time, the LCRA built transmission lines to carry the power into distant areas, which came to be served by rural electric coops organized under laws that Franklin Roosevelt got through Congress. These efforts brought light and power to many thousands of rural homes in Central Texas and the Hill Country. In 1940, Starcke was promoted to general manager of the LCRA in Austin, a position he held until December 31, 1955. Under his leadership the authority built two more dams for hydroelectric power on the Colorado River, using proceeds from revenue bonds. The LCRA extended its services to 33 cities and 11 rural electric coops over a 41,000-square-mile area. Again at the urging of Lyndon Johnson, in the late 1940s, not long after World War II ended, Starcke led the LCRA into an extensive soil conservation effort. The LCRA ran education programs, loaned equipment to poor farmers, and established \\"example farms\\". The effort wound down in the 1950s as the federal government began a nationwide program of soil conservation. Max Starcke Dam near Marble Falls. After his retirement in 1955, Starcke worked as a paid consultant to LCRA for another 10 years, and was president of the Texas Water Conservation Association from 1957 to 1962. In 1962 the LCRA dam near Marble Falls was renamed Max Starcke Dam. In 1966 Silurian outcrops near Llano, not previously recorded in Central Texas, were named Starcke Limestone in his honor. A natural salesman and a gregarious politician, Starcke was active in the Elks, the Masons, the Lions, the Rotary, and the Sons of Hermann, as well as serving as a deacon at the University Presbyterian Church in Austin.

Therefore, listric faults and monoclinal folds in the hanging wall are typical structures linked by transfer zones; however, complexities do exist. The terms interbasin and intrabasin transfer zones have been proposed to delineate the magnitude of the transfer zone. Transfer zones can be described according to the fault dip directions; synthetic or conjugate and according to their deformation style; convergent or divergent. Transfer zones can be farther identified by its maturity or (fault propagation evolution); whether the major fault relationship is approaching, overlapping, collateral or collinear. Since transfer zones are normally found in extensional settings many studies have been done within the East African rift system and the Gulf of Suez rift system. Transfer zones have also played a role in hydrocarbon exploration and extraction within the Albertine graben.  Interbasin transfer zones  Interbasin transfer zones are often deal with major boundary rifts. Interbasin transfer zones could be interbasin ridges, broad faulted highs, or major relay ramps; all which have a large influence on the rift system..  Intrabasin transfer zones  Intrabasin transfer zones are within the constraints of the interbasin transfer zones and are normally an order of magnitude smaller. Intrabasin transfer zones could be relay ramps within en echelon normal faults, or minor fault jogs. The southern margin of the Gulf of Evvia near Atalanti shows the magnitude of difference between interbasin transfer zones with accommodating distances up to 10 km as well as intrabasin transfer zones that accommodate approximately 1 km or less.  Synthetic transfer zones  Synthetic transfer zones must have major normal faults dipping in the same direction. This includes relay ramps. Relay ramps have been studied within the East African rift system (Lake Malawi) and the Gulf of Suez rift system. Transfer zone drainage basins consist of any sediments that will eventually travel through the transfer zone and in the half graben. The Gulf of Evvia is an example where a relay ramp plays a major role in drainage. Footwall drainage is limited in the Gulf of Evvia while transfer zone drainage is more pronounced. Since size of the drainage basin is one of the major controls on sediment flux, both interbasin and intrabasin synthetic relay ramp type transfer zones must have a major influence on sedimentation into the overall system. While intrabasin transfer zones are smaller they still act as a conduit for sedimentation.  Conjugate transfer zones  Conjugate transfer zones must have major normal faults dipping in the opposite direction. This classification can be farther divided into convergent and divergent transfer zones.  Convergent transfer zones  Convergent transfer zones dip toward each other and in result more complex faulting and folding can occur in the zones between them.  Divergent transfer zones  Divergent transfer zones dip in opposite direction and often result in topographical highs.  Transfer zone fault propagation evolution  Major fault boundaries within rift systems tend to expand with time based on the assumption that the extensional stress and strain is consistent in a given rift system. Transfer zones have been identified according to the fault propagation evolution; they include approaching, overlapping, collateral, and collinear. This classification assists in visualization and deformational history of the transfer zone.  Approaching  When transfer zones are in the approaching stage the major boundary faults have not propagated past one another yet.  Overlapping  Transfer zones are in the overlapping stage when the major boundary faults have propagated past one another. This only includes faults that are partially overlapping.  Collateral  Collateral transfer zones include area where faults are completely parallel and overlapping. The geometry is frequently seen in horst and graben structures.  Collinear  Collinear transfer zones include areas which the major fault boundaries are in line with one another. In many cases this geometry relies on the faults to splay at their terminations and interfinger with one another.  Transfer Zones in the East African Rift  While the East African rift system is experiencing profound extension the transfer zones that link major extensional faults do not experience this extension. Transfer zones within the East African rift are most commonly in the overlapping stage but every stage has been observed. Here, transfer zones are generally high areas with complex internal fault geometries. These general high areas generally are conjugate divergent type zones and have been observed in the Tanganyika rift and Albertine rift of Uganda. These broad highs can have vast effect of drainage as they can potentially split basins. Synthetic relay ramp style transfer zones are frequently observed in Lake Malawi. Brief examples have been given but all types within the synthetic and conjugate classification have been observed in the East African rift system.  Transfer zones in the Gulf of Suez rift  Suez rift transfer zones are similar to the East African rift transfer zones in that potentially any classification type and stage can be seen. However a study has shown that the transfer of deformation in transfer zones can be accomplished in two ways; through faults or accommodation zones between two opposite dipping normal faults in a horst and graben. A few kilometers south of Cairo there are en echelon minor faults between two major faults that produce a relay ramp style transfer zone. In the northern part of the Suez rift system the Gharandal transfer zone accommodates deformation in a broad anticlinal structure between two listric faults in a collateral horst and graben.  Transfer zones and hydrocarbon exploration  Transfer zones such as relay ramps can affect drainage within basins which in return can produce thickness trends. Understanding the drainage network in these extensional setting allows geologist to better identify lateral and vertical depositional facies. The Kaiso-Tonya, Butiaba-Wanseko, and the Pakwach transfer zones in the Albertine graben all contain hydrocarbons. The Kaiso- Tonya is a full graben style transfer zone much like conjugate convergent collateral types. The Butiaba-Wanseko, and the Pakwach transfer zones are relay ramp style transfer zones.

Early life and education Brennan was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on November 27, 1925. Her father was a shipyard superintendent and her mother, Nellie (Valentine) Brennan, was a homemaker and inventive home cook. Ella grew up in New Orleans and graduated high school in 1943. Career Her brother Owen owned the Old Absinthe House on Bourbon Street and Ella Brennan worked there as a teenager. He also opened the Vieux Carré Restaurant on Bourbon Street. Plans to move the restaurant to Royal Street were interrupted when Owen suddenly died and banks pulled out of the venture. Acquiring her own backing, Ella did open the new restaurant in 1956, the first Brennan's Restaurant. This tactic was very successful and Ella worked behind the scenes, as well as out front to ensure the quality of the dishes. A family dispute dislodged her from the restaurant completely, and she countered by taking over a restaurant of her own with her siblings Adelaide Brennan, Dottie Brennan, John Brennan and Dick Brennan.

History Upon the album's CD release in 2003, writer Ellis Widner noted that the original release came at a point at which \\"Mathis knew it was time to refresh his music and renew his career. It had been four years since his last hit\\" on the Billboard Hot 100 (1969's number 96 entry, \\"Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet (A Time for Us)\\"). Bell was fresh off of a series of hits with The Delfonics, The Stylistics, and The Spinners. \\"Following several smashes on both the pop and R&B; charts, Bell was ready to approach what he calls 'the sterling of sterling: Mathis. I kept hearing Mathis in my mind. You work hard reaching that pinnacle to work with him. And that’s what I did. I worked as hard as I could. After I started with the Spinners is when I told my manager, \\"I’d like to grab Mathis.\\"'\\" Before writing the songs for the album, Bell and Creed did extensive interviews with Mathis to get his \\"'thoughts about different things.'\\" \\"'They're like internal musings,'\\" said Mathis about the material that resulted. Bell recalls how moved the singer was by what they presented for him to record and how he explained, \\"'That's the reason we sat with you—to see what kind of person you are, to see what makes you tick.'\\" Bell also chose to present Mathis's voice in a different way. \\"'Everyone who recorded him had recorded his voice high,' he says. 'I took him from way in the air and brought him down. He has a much more mature, rich sound singing a little lower. He was so relieved. He couldn't believe I was taking him down.'\\" Reception Billboard recommended the album. \\"When Mathis is provided with the proper material for his voice, sparks fly, and that's the case here.\\" They enjoyed several of the selections, including \\"I'm Stone in Love with You\\", \\"which he does majestically. His recent single-LP title tune is superb listening, as are 'And I Think That's What I'll Do', 'Life Is a Song Worth Singing' (a production masterpiece), and 'A Baby's Born'. Mathis sings with an inspired feeling, turning 'Stop Look and Listen to Your Heart' into a delightful thought for repeating.\\" AllMusic's Craig Lytle wrote retrospectively: \\"Most of these numbers have that Stylistics, Spinners, and even Temptations aura, and are good listening songs.\\" Track listing All songs written by Thom Bell and Linda Creed except as noted: Side one # \\"I'm Coming Home\\" – 3:24 # \\"I'd Rather Be Here with You\\" – 3:47 # \\"Foolish\\" (T.

The specific epithet foetida refers to the unpleasant smell of this plant. Taxonomy Lorenz Chrysanth von Vest, after whom the genus Vestia was named in the year 1809. The genus Vestia was named in honour of Austrian botanist and physician Lorenz Chrysanth von Vest (1776 - 1840) in 1809 by German botanist and pharmacist Carl Ludwig Willdenow (1765 – 1812). Vestia foetida was described by Johann Centurius Hoffmannsegg, the description being published in his Verzeichniss der Pflanzenkulturen in den Grafl. Hoffmannseggischen Garten zu Dresden und Rammenau... [translation: \\"Directory of plants cultivated in the Dresden and Rammenau gardens of Count Hoffmannsegg\\"]: 119 (pub. Dresden 1824).Vestia foetida in Trópicos Uses A yellow dye has been extracted from the leaves and stems, and infusions of the plant have been used in the folk medicine of Chile (with due recognition of the toxicity of the medication) to treat dysentery and appendicitis. Austrian priest and ethnologist, Martin Gusinde (1886-1969), an expert on the ethnomedicine of Chile, records the following concerning medicinal use of Vestia by the Mapuche and Huilliche: > Huevil: Vestia lycioides...it is used for [medicinal] baths. It is an > efficacious remedy for chavalongo and dysentery and also for contagious > diseases. The natives today use only the term ifɘlkoñ.Gusinde, Martin, > Plantas Medicinales que los indios Araucanos recomiendan, part I, in > Anthropos Bd. 31, H. 3./4. (May - Aug., 1936), pp. 555-571 (17 pages) [Note: The term chavalongo designates a Chilean disease concept which, in the past, could encompass not only typhoid and typhus but a variety of life- threatening diseases (mostly fevers) having in common their introduction to Chile by Europeans - see page Chavalongo on Wikipédia España]. To the observations of Gusinde may be added further information provided by another missionary active in Chile: Capuchin friar Ernest Wilhelm Mösbach (1882-1963) who notes in his Botánica Indígena de Chile that Vestia foetida causes sneezing and has a very bitter taste. He also lists three further medicinal uses, noting that infusions of the plant possess tonic, stomachic and anthelmintic properties.Mösbach, Ernesto Wilhelm, Botánica indígena de Chile, pub. Andrés Bello, Santiago de Chile, 1992) [Note: there is a page 'Ernesto Wilhelm de Moesbach' on Wikipédia España] Sanchez (2001), quoting several previous authors, supplies not only a rationale for the use of Vestia in medicinal baths (- as a type of topical analgesic for arthritic pain), but also an evocative definition of the folk ailment chavalongo: > Huevil: Febrifugal plant. (Cañas) See also entry huelcún. Ruiz and Pavón say > that the natives take [both] the decoction and the infusion of huévil to > 'mitigate the ardour of the blood' in cases of chavalongo (bilious fever) > and also in cases of dysentery. It is also used, in baths, in certain cases > of rheumatism, both acute and chronic. (Murillo : 620).Sánchez, Manuel Romo > Folklore Médico de Chiloé, Ediciones del Orfebre, Santiago de Chile, 2001. A comparison of a cluster Chilean vernacular names used for Vestia foetida, Cestrum parqui and even the unrelated, Apocynaceous Cynanchum lancifolium (= Diplolepis pachyphylla) - as recorded by Gusinde, Mösbach and Sanchez - while revealing a measure of potential confusion in identification of medicinal species in the literature, demonstrate nonetheless a native Chilean grasp of similarity of characteristics and effects. Mösbach records the names Ifelcón and Echuelcún for V. foetida. The first of these is a variant form of Gusinde's Ifəlcoñ (also recorded as designating Vestia). Toxicity: Stock Poison Like many plants belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, Vestia is poisonous and alkaloidal.Armando T. Hunziker: The Genera of Solanaceae. A.R.G. Gantner Verlag K.G., Ruggell, Liechtenstein 2001. A scientific paper of 2005 noted that V. foetida has caused fatalities in sheep, goats and cattle which had browsed its foliage, death being attributable to hepatotoxic compounds present in the plant. The paper further noted that stock poisoning caused by Vestia resembles closely that caused by Cestrum parqui - another (closely related) Solanaceous plant native to the region (the genera Vestia and Cestrum both belong to tribe Cestreae of the Solanaceae - as does a third genus, Sessea). Insecticidal Properties Vestia foetida exhibited modest activity in a recent investigation into the insecticidal properties of some plant species native to Chile. Extracts from V. foetida were evaluated against the pest beetle species Sitophilus granarius, the Granary or Wheat Weevil. Total extracts at concentrations of 2.5 percent w/w in diet over a period of 6 days displayed insecticidal effects, with V. foetida causing the mortality of 56 percent of insects (as compared with a more impressive 87.5 percent for Drimys winteri and 80 percent for Lobelia tupa).(2018) Assessment of insecticidal responses of extracts and compounds of Drimys winteri, Lobelia tupa, Viola portalesia and Vestia foetida against the granary weevil Sitophilus granarius Paz, Cristian, Burgos, Viviana, Céspedes-Acuña, Carlos L. et al.

Another steroidal compound present both in Cestrum and Vestia is the obscure insonuatigenin. Cultivation Although frost-hardy, the plant requires some protection from winter winds.

Danielyan describes the event as follows: Danielyan managed to escape from that camp the very next day with the help of some of his friends who lifted up the barbed wire. He \\"snaked\\" his way through and escaped. Danielyan would later remark, \\"However, the guards were shooting at me, but I was able to get away. So I made my way east with the intention of joining my army.\\" While walking on foot, Danielyan was captured five times by the German and Italian troops and sent to five POW camps. Danielyan managed to survive and escape from the other camps he had joined. He found that escaping the Italian camps were easier since they were less strict. When German troops arrived in Rostov on Don, Danielyan lost hope of reaching the Soviet frontier. He turned back and went to a town called Taganrog, hoping to find food, water and shelter: Famine was widespread throughout the town and Danielyan had no other choice but to go to Germany. While in Germany, he worked in a pipe manufacturing plant and lived in a camp in the Saar region on the bank of the Rhine River. Post-war period In the summer of 1945, after the defeat of the Germans, Danieyan returned home to Armenia and worked as an electrical technician. In 1947 he was charged by the Soviet government for being a traitor and was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in a Soviet prison camp: Danielyan was sent north of Siberia to Ukhta where he would build factories, towns, buildings, mines and power stations. After working in Ukhta for 5 years, he and other prisoners were transferred to another camp. From there he was transferred still farther north to the Taymyr Peninsula, 2,000 kilometers north of Krasnoyarsk, to build the town of Norilsk. He was in the Arctic Circle near the North Ocean. When Stalin died in 1953, Danielyan was released from the camps and head back to Yerevan, Armenia. He married Nyna Khoetsyan in 1959. They have one daughter, Gohar.

After becoming a subsidiary of the Valsetz Lumber Company in 1955, the name was changed to Templeton Lumber Company. In 1960, the company was again sold and the name changed to Boise Cascade, La Grande. History Stange's Sash, Door and Blind Factory in Merrill, Wisconsin. Used with permission by T. B. Scott Free Library. Early in the 20th century August H. Stange, owner of the Stange Sash, Door, and Blind Company in Merrill, Wisconsin, began to understand that the forests around Merrill could no longer support his need for lumber. For economic reasons, loggers had clear-cut their land without reforestation, and the demand for timber was approaching its supply. On average, the Merrill plant needed 125,000 board feet of lumber each day. Stange may also have known that the United States Forest Service had begun to award large timber contracts to lumber companies in the Pacific Northwest. For example, the Oregon Lumber Company would soon receive an award of sale of 124 million board feet of lumber in 1916. Stange had been impressed with the quality of Pacific Northwest lumber that arrived by Union Pacific railroad, and in 1910 he and his son, August J. Stange, ventured west to survey the forests around Mt. Emily in Eastern Oregon. With his father's money, A. J. Stange formed the Mt. Emily Timber Co. and purchased in excess of 100,000 acres of forest land, estimated to contain over one billion board feet of lumber. He lived in La Grande, Oregon until 1913. During that time he prepared to build a sawmill with access to the Union Pacific railroad. From there he would send lumber by rail to his father’s door and sash company. When his land acquisitions had concluded, Stange returned to Wisconsin to continue work in his father's business interests. He owned a land speculation company and worked for the Charles Kinzel Logging Company, owned by his brother-in-law, until 1920. In that year he returned to La Grande and created the Mount Emily Lumber Company from the assets of the Mt. Emily Timber Co. The company officers were * August J. Stange, President (President and General Manager of the Union Land Co. of Merril, WI, Officer of Charles Kinzel Lumber Co., and son of August H. Stange) * August H. Stange (father of August J. Stange, owner of Stange Sash, Door, and Blind Co. and officer of the First National Bank of Eagle River, Wisconsin) * Charles H. Stange (vice president of Stange Sash, Door, and Blind Co. and son of August H. Stange) * Charles J. Kinzel (owner of Charles Kinzel Logging Co. and son-in-law of August H. Stange) * Leslie K. Kinzel (son of Charles J. Kinzel) * E. W. Ellis (President of Wisconsin-Michigan Lumber Co., president of the First National Bank of Eagle River, Wisconsin, and son- in-law of August H. Stange). August Stange stands next to a log at the Mount Emily Lumber Company, 1922 Only August J. Stange and Leslie K. Kinzel relocated to Oregon when the new company began. The other officers remained in Wisconsin. The sawmill was sited next to La Grande’s failed sugar mill, part of the Amalgamated Sugar Company. p. 3 The first log entered the mill on November 15, 1925. The log pond of the new lumber company leached various toxins, and nearby residents complained for years that they could taste the log pond in their drinking water. In 1925 the company purchased The Grande Ronde Lumber Co. and its short-line railroad. Railroad access enabled the movement of logs from Mt. Emily to the sawmill in La Grande. The rated capacity of the new sawmill was 50,000,000 board feet per year. By comparison, the Wisconsin-Michigan Lumber Co. milled about 15,000,000 board feet per year. Charles Kinzel continued his logging operations in Wisconsin for a time, ending his own rail operations in 1926 and closing his sawmill in 1930. The 1939 Polk Directory placed him in La Grande and revealed that he had become president of the Mount Emily Lumber Company. Former president August J. Stange had been demoted to vice president. Upon the death of Kinzel in 1942, Stange was once again named president of the company. The Camas Creek timber sale In 1930 the Forest Service began mapping the Mount Emily Lumber Company holdings in the Umatilla National Forest. The Forest Service anticipated a purchase application by the company for over 221,000,000 board feet of lumber and began a survey of sites in the Umatilla National Forest and the Wallowa–Whitman National Forest. A Forest Service prospectus was prepared in 1937 that contained many confidential financial records of the company, including a description of the short line railroad and revenue and expense information. Armed with this information, the Milton Box Company of Milton, Oregon was able to outbid Mount Emily Lumber Co. by over $35,000 and subsequently received the contract. The Milton Box Company moved to Pendleton, Oregon and received pre-arranged free land from city leaders and an incentive of $10,000 cash. After many public protests and an investigation, no criminal charges were filed. Sale to Valsetz Lumber Company In January, 1955, Stange announced that Valsetz Lumber Company had bought all of the corporate shares for an undisclosed amount. In February, the Stange's celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Valsetz immediately increased wages and production. The mill closed 1955 with 58,000,000 board feet of lumber shipped, up 22,000,000 from 1954. Valsetz also shut down the short line railroad, which had become more expensive to operate than a fleet of logging trucks. Camp Elkanah In November, 1956, Valsetz donated Mount Emily's main logging camp to the Blue Mountain Conservative Baptist Association of Eastern Oregon. The camp included residences and other structures plus 12 acres of forest. The Mount Emily Shay steam locomotive in Prineville Since the beginning of the Mount Emily Lumber Company, logs were transported down the mountain behind a Shay steam locomotive on a short line railroad. This practice was common in the logging industry until the development of more powerful log trucks and better logging roads. Mount Emily owned four Shays, and after Valsetz bought the company and began hauling with trucks, one engine was donated to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. From there it was donated to the Oregon Historical Society, and through a lease agreement the Shay is operated by the City of Prineville Railroad.

The CACSW was established by the Canadian federal government in 1973 in order to educate and inform the public about women's concerns. The CACSW was also empowered with the task of advising the federal government as to the effect public policy had on women. Such direct access to government was significant in that it legitimized women's issues in large-P politics. The economic boom of the 1960s ensured that fiscal resources were available to support groups such as the CACSW. Additionally, global activist movements fostered an appropriate cultural environment for the acknowledgement of rights at the state level. Both these factors mitigated the process of discourse on women's issues with prominent political actors. As such, the CACSW was empowered with influencing the government agenda on subjects related to the feminist struggle, including: wage equity, access to employment traditionally dominated by men, education, female reproduction, child care, maternity benefits, and political representation. CACSW and the feminist movement An argument can be advanced that the creation of the CACSW was the government's response to the second wave of feminism in Canadian society. Following the suffrage movement of the first wave of feminism, the second wave ultimately challenged the patriarchal norms which delegated women to their primary role of wife/mother, and that any additional roles, such as wage earning, was perceived as secondary to that primary role (and therefore, less important). The 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms Prime Minister Trudeau recognized the need to entrench basic rights into the constitution. However, prior to 1982, the constitution was still under the mandate of the British Parliament. His attempt to repatriate the constitution was met with hostility from the provinces. As such, interest groups within Canadian society viewed provincial governments as unsympathetic to equality rights, and therefore much public support was garnered for the repatriation of the constitution by the federal government. Under the presidency of Doris Hilda Anderson, the CACSW championed the explicit inclusion of women's equality in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The result of the active mobilization of women's groups, such as CACSW, resulted in the entrenchment of two separate provisions, Section 15 (equality rights) and Section 28 (gender equality provision), in the Canadian Constitution Act of 1982.

He was known for his scruples in good governance, judgment of character, and for being the first of the Three Ducal Ministers after the end of the Eastern Han dynasty to be enfeoffed as a marquis. He was from Dongwu County, Qinghe Commandery, Ji Province, which is in present-day Zhucheng, Shandong. Service under Cao Cao Although Cui Lin was a member of the influential Cui family of Qinghe Commandery, his extended family was not well- acquainted with him, and only his relative Cui Yan thought him exceptional. In 200, following Cao Cao's conquest of Ji Province, Cui Lin was summoned to be Chief of Wu County (), in present-day Shanxi. He drew such a pitiful salary from this position that he could not even afford a horse and carriage.Records of the Three Kingdoms, 24.679 Zhang Zhi (), the inspector of Bing Province, recommended Cui Lin to Cao Cao as the village chief whose governance was the most virtuous. As a result, Cui Lin was promoted to higher offices in the central administration of Ji Province, and shortly thereafter transferred to Cao Cao's office. In 213, Cao Cao was enfeoffed as the Duke of Wei (), and Cui Lin was promoted to Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk (), a powerful position overseeing correspondence from the provincial inspectors and their subordinates. When Cao Pi established the state of Cao Wei in 220, Cui Lin was sent out to be the Inspector of You Province on the northeastern frontier. He held this office for one season, then took the office of Administrator of Hejian Commandery (). The base text of the Records of the Three Kingdoms says that Cui Lin voluntarily gave up control of You Province to make way for Wu Zhi to unite the northern frontier forces, which Cui Lin considered a better way of dealing with the non-Han Chinese frontier peoples. However, Pei Songzhi notes a memorial by Xin Pi stating that Huan Jie, at that time holding the post of Supervisor of the Masters of Writing, felt Cui Lin was incapable as a provincial inspector and demoted him.Records of the Three Kingdoms, 24.680 n 2 As Minister Herald From the Administrator of Hejian Commandery, Cui Lin rose to the position of Minister Herald, in charge of interstate affairs with foreign dependencies. In 222,Records of the Three Kingdoms, 2.79 while Cui Lin occupied this post, the King of Kucha sent a son to study under and be sinicised by the Wei court, which richly rewarded the king for sending his son such a long way. Sensing opportunity, the other border states each sent a prince to study at the Wei court. Cui Lin feared some of the envoys sent to collect their princes' ransoms were unreliable, so he stamped and sealed their rewards and attached to their return missions groups of mercantile border people who guarded the treasure the entire road back.Records of the Three Kingdoms, 24.680 At Dunhuang, Cui Lin had the imperial decrees promulgated, and engraved important stories from Chinese history to ensure their endurance. In 226, Cao Rui granted Cui Lin the landless title of a Secondary Marquis, and promoted him to Minister of the Household ()At the point in time when it was conferred upon Cui Lin, the title Minister of the Household (光祿勳) was in the process of becoming a purely honorary title. See Hucker, 288, at 3347. and Colonel-Director of Retainers, one of the Three Venerables (). Late career As Colonel-Director of Retainers, Cui Lin wielded supervisory power over officials in and around the capital region. In the areas he controlled, he fired all government officials who had engaged in illegal conduct or committed multiple transgressions. He enforced honesty in governance, streamlined process, and protected the body politic, earning him lasting acclaim. A future Colonel-Director of Retainers under Cao Fang, Wang Jing, was a farmer from the same commandery as Cui Lin, whom Cui Lin plucked from obscurity out of an infantry squad.Records of the Three Kingdoms, 24.682 n 1 In 238, following a strong recommendation from the imperial adviser Meng Kang (孟康), Cui Lin was promoted to Minister of Works, one of the Three Ducal Ministers, the highest positions in the civil government. He was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Anyang Village, with a marquisate of 600 taxable households.Records of the Three Kingdoms, 24.681 After spending his entire stipend, he was promoted to a district marquis, although his fief was later split and part given to a son of Cao Rui. Cui Lin died in January or February 245 and was succeeded by his elder son, Cui Shu (). His younger son, Cui Sui (), served as a Supervisor of the Masters of Writing () under the Jin dynasty. One of Cui Lin's grandsons, Cui Wei (), served as a Right Commandant of the Guards of the Heir Apparent () during the Jin dynasty.

Career Lee began his basketball career playing for the University of Portland in the 1998–1999 season, appearing in eight games and scoring an average of 1 points. He transferred to Seattle Pacific University in 2000. After his graduation, he went on to play on professional teams in Luxembourg and Germany before coming to South Korea in 2006. In South Korea, Lee joined Yonsei University's team in March 2006. Lee's participation in university basketball was controversial because he was not a South Korean citizen and he had previously played in professional leagues in Europe. Even after he naturalised, Korea University continued to object to his participation due to his professional experience; after he was ruled ineligible, a physical altercation broke out at a September 2006 match between Yonsei University and Korea University. Coming to South Korea was a difficult adjustment for Lee in terms of culture and language. Philippine Olympic Committee president Monico Puentevella stated in media interviews that Sandrin had told him \\"he couldn’t relate with the Koreans because they hardly speak English … he felt more comfortable with our team. Nevertheless, Lee stated that he relished the opportunity to live in the country and learn more about his roots. Lee would go on to play professionally in the Korean Basketball League for the Daegu Orions. He later moved to the Seoul Samsung Thunders. In January 2013 he and elder brother Lee Seung-jun were booked on assault charges in Mapo District, leading to controversy over whether they should be permitted to play in the then-ongoing KBL All-Star Games.

Other Delphinium species may be called tall larkspur, such as Delphinium barbeyi. D. exaltatum is native to the central and eastern United States, where it can be found in Kentucky, Maine, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, and Missouri. This plant is a perennial herb producing a stem up to 2 meters tall from a long, thick taproot. The base of the stem may have a reddish tinge and it is free of leaves by the time the plant blooms. The leaves are somewhat circular or pentagonal in outline and are divided into a few wedge-shaped lobes. The leaf blade is borne on a petiole up to 15 centimeters long. Flowering occurs between July and September. The inflorescence is a raceme of up to 30 flowers. The sepals are any shade of dull blue to purple or lavender, or occasionally white. The fruit is a follicle roughly a centimeter long. This species occupies wooded areas and prairie habitat and tolerates sunny and shady areas. It grows on slopes facing most any direction. The substrate is often rocky, with calcareous stone such as limestone, sometimes with chert. It may grow on amphibolite or diabase. It withstands an amount of disturbance and can persist in disturbed habitat remnants such as road cuts, ditches, fence rows, and fields. Associated plant species include upland boneset (Eupatorium sessilifolium) and staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina) in Maryland, barren strawberry (Waldsteinia fragarioides), fourleaf milkweed (Asclepias quadrifolia), eastern leatherwood (Dirca palustris), and prairie trillium (Trillium recurvatum) in Missouri, upland bentgrass (Agrostis perennans), orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata), mountain oatgrass (Danthonia compressa), Philadelphia lily (Lilium philadelphicum), timothy-grass (Phleum pratense), three-toothed cinquefoil (Sibbaldiopsis tridentata), and self-heal (Prunella vulgaris) in North Carolina, eastern green violet (Hybanthus concolor), American bladdernut (Staphylea trifolia), and yellow horse gentian (Triosteum angustifolium) in Pennsylvania, and barrelhead gayfeather (Liatris cylindracea), Chinese bushclover (Lespedeza cuneata), smooth aster (Symphyotrichum laeve), eastern smooth beardtongue (Penstemon laevigatus), downy skullcap (Scutellaria incana), and hoary puccoon (Lithospermum canescens) in Tennessee. Like most other Delphinium species, this plant is toxic, containing several poisonous alkaloids. Every part of the plant is poisonous, especially the seeds. This species can be found in many places across the eastern half of the United States and there are over 100 occurrences; however, most occurrences are small, with no more than 50 individuals. The main threat to the species is habitat loss. Agriculture and development has consumed habitat. Fire suppression is also a threat; the loss of a natural fire regime has allowed overgrowth and encroachment of competing vegetation, pushing this native plant out. Livestock causes habitat disturbance, such as soil compaction, in some areas. Road building, quarrying, and logging are factors. Pesticide use can reduce populations of the essential insect pollinators of this species. While the plant can tolerate some disturbance, as evidenced by its ability to thrive along roadsides, it cannot withstand habitat destruction. Management activities for the conservation of this species include controlled burns and other vegetation-clearing methods. Insect pollinators should be protected. The habitat should be preserved, with no logging, grazing, road construction, or other destructive forces. Transplanting propagated individuals into the habitat has been successful.

H. Bakewell, 1944 Edward Howard Bakewell (6 July 1859 – 31 March 1944) was a South Australian pastoralist, businessman and administrator. Born at North Adelaide, he was a son of Samuel Bakewell (ca.1815 – 22 September 1888), who arrived in South Australia in 1839,Samuel's brother William Bakewell also arrived in 1839, but on a different ship. and his wife Eliza Hannah Bakewell (née Pye). He was among the earliest scholars at Prince Alfred College. On completing his education he joined the staff of the National Bank as a ledger-keeper,S.A. Library Archives and after three years there he gained experience in the north of the State in flour milling and in the pastoral Industry. Pastoral interests The pastoral industry particularly, attracted his attention, and for more than 50 years he was closely associated with it. For many years he was managing director of the Willowie Land and Pastoral Association Ltd., which held large freehold and leasehold properties in the northern parts of South Australia and the Northern Territory. For many years also he was general manager of the estate of the John Howard Angas, which included the famous Hill River Estate, Point Sturt Stud Cattle Estate, Kings-ford, and other northern properties. For 10 years he was managing partner of Coronga Park Station. NSW, and Tarella Station, near White Cliffs, New South Wales. For about 12 years he was managing director of Yalkuri Station, Lake Alexandrina. Bakewell was president of the Central Council of Employers for three and a half years, and president for two years of the Pastoralists' Association of SA. During his term of office the wool committees were formed to deal with the Australian wool clips under the British purchase scheme, and Bakewell represented South Australia on the committee. During his term of office as president of the Pastoralists' Association, Bakewell was instrumental in the formation of the first Stockowners Cooperative Shearing Company in Australia, and at the time of his death was chairman of the company. The idea adopted in South Australia has since been copied by the other States. Bakewell, a suburb of the City of Palmerston in the Northern Territory was named for him, as was Bakewell Street, Union Town, in the Victoria-Daly Shire Council.N.T. Place Names Register Business interests At the time of his death he was chairman and managing director of the South Australian Portland Cement Co., a position he had held for more than 50 years. He had seen the company grow from its initiation to its present prominence, and its progress was largely due to his initiative and enterprise. He was, with David Mitchell, John Gibson and C. H. Angas a member of Sir John Monash's South Australian Reinforced Concrete Co. Ltd. in 1907Leading the Way: Sir John Monash the Engineer – Monash University For 20 years Bakewell was the SA Director of the Commercial Union Assurance Co. Ltd., and for some years was chairman of directors of the company. Municipal Tramways Trust Bakewell's name is closely associated with Adelaide's Municipal Tramways Trust. He was appointed chairman of the Trust by the Government in succession to its first chairman, A. B. Moncrieff (1845–1928) in 1922, and during his 15 years' occupancy of that office played a prominent part in the progress made by the Trust, and as a mark of appreciation named the overway bridge at Mile End after him. :Adelaide's Bakewell Bridge (on Glover Avenue/Henley Beach Road over the railway and Port Road East/Railway Terrace, Mile End) was named for him. Built to carry trams and vehicular traffic, it was opened on 22 December 1925 and demolished in 2007. The replacement underpass was opened in January 2008. Other interests Although he never entered Parliament, Bakewell always showed a keen interest in politics, and for many years was one of the leaders of the Liberal and Country League and was chairman of the finance committee of the Liberal and Country League for many years. He was a member of the Liberal Club Ltd. from its inception. Bakewell's services were engaged by the Government on numerous occasions. He was president of the Australian National League 1907–1910 Bakewell was one of the most prominent members of the Employers' Federation, of which he was chairman from 1915 to 1929. In that capacity he always strongly supported the practice of bringing employers and employees together through the medium of round table conferences, which, he always held did away with much misunderstanding and bitterness. He was a strong opponent of overlapping Federal and State legislation, and held that industrial matters should be subject to State legislation wherever possible. One of his outstanding achievements was the bringing about of closer unity among large and small employers of labour. In 1928 he was appointed a member of the Commonwealth Land Valuation Board, formed to deal with objections lodged by taxpayers against the valuation of land assessed for land tax purposes. He was also prominent in Masonic circles, and was a member of the council and executive of the Stockowners' Association. Death and tributes Bakewell died suddenly aboard the train to Morgan, where he was to attend the official opening of the Morgan – Whyalla pipeline (he was a Member of the executive committee of the River Murray League in 1904). When he attended his office in Adelaide the previous Thursday he appeared in good health, and his death came as a great shock to his associates. The general manager of the Tramways Trust (Sir William Goodman) said he had learned of the death of Mr. Bakewell with deep regret. They had been friends for many years. During the 15 years Bakewell had been chairman of the Trust they had been closely associated, and he had found him anxious at all times to do his best for the board and the public. He was a fine all-round business man of wide experience, and his death would be a distinct loss to the community. He was a good citizen and worked very hard for the welfare of his country. The obituary writer for The Advertiser observed that he was \\"gifted with remarkable business acumen, he had been aptly described as a leader of men. His leadership of the Employers' Federation and the Municipal Tramways Trust over long periods was marked by remarkable progress, and his record will be a lasting monument to service in the public interest.\\" Family Edward Howard Bakewell married Octavia Eleanor \\"Ellie\\" Wilson (18 March 1861 – 7 October 1934), daughter of Rev.

It was the second time the two fighters fought that year, as their first bout in March was mired in controversy. The fight took place at the same venue the first one had, The Mirage in Paradise, Nevada, USA. As before, it was scheduled for twelve rounds and was a championship elimination fight with the winner becoming the mandatory top challenger for the undisputed world championship that was then held by Evander Holyfield. Tyson would emerge victorious once again, this time defeating Ruddock by unanimous decision and solidifying his position as the number one contender. Background In the first fight between the two, controversy erupted in the seventh round. After Tyson hit Ruddock with a six- punch combination, referee Richard Steele stepped in and stopped the fight despite the fact the Ruddock had not been knocked down and appeared to be healthy enough to continue. This was the second time a Steele stoppage had caused controversy in twelve months; as the official in the 1990 bout between Julio Cesar Chavez and Meldrick Taylor, he called a halt to the fight with two seconds remaining in the final round after Taylor did not respond to him following a knockdown. After the decision, Ruddock's brother Delroy and his promoter Murad Muhammad got into a physical confrontation with Tyson's trainer Richie Giachetti while Steele had to be escorted to the back by Mirage security for his safety. Nine days after the fight, Tyson's promoter Don King and Muhammad struck a deal for a rematch to settle any controversy over the outcome of the initial bout.King: Ruddock-Tyson II to return boxing's integrity, Baltimore Sun article, 1990-03-27, Retrieved on 2013-05-09 However, a decision by the Nevada Athletic Commission nearly resulted in the fight getting scuttled. After an investigation into the postfight brawl, Muhammad was handed a twelve-month suspension for his actions. Ruddock decided not to participate if Muhammad was not able to and thus he announced he would not take the fight.The Unmaking of a Multimillion Rematch, From Ruddock's Side, N.Y.

Times article, 1990-05-17, Retrieved on 2013-05-09 Prior to the fight, the two men publicly expressed their dislike for one another. At a press conference before the fight, Tyson would infamously state that he would make Ruddock his \\"girlfriend\\".Has Success Spoiled Mike Tyson?

Referee Carlos Padilla counted Marin out at 1:45 of the 2nd rd. * Azumah Nelson (33–2, 25 KOs; the defending WBC champion) held Jeff Fenech (25–0, 19 KOs; WBC's #1) to a split draw in 12-rounds championship bout, retaining his WBC Super Featherweight title for the sixth time. Unpopular judges' decision was booed by the audience, as Fenech largely dominated the action. The fight In a hard fought match that went the distance, Tyson ultimately picked up the victory via unanimous decision with all three judges ruling in his favor with one score of 113–109 and two scores of 114–108. Tyson got off to a strong start in round 1. With 16 seconds left in the round, Tyson staggered Ruddock with a right hook to the side of his head, causing Ruddock to hold on to Tyson to prevent taking any more damage. After the bell rang, Tyson threw two punches at Ruddock, who in turn would respond with a powerful right hand that just missed connecting with Tyson. Referee Mills Lane would warn the two fighters between rounds that he would deduct points should punches be thrown after the bell. Tyson would continue to attack Ruddock in round 2, hitting him with another strong right hand in the round's opening seconds. Later in the round, Tyson would hit Ruddock with a 3-punch combination as Ruddock was against the ropes, though one of the punches was below the belt, causing Lane to separate the two and issue a warning to Tyson. After Lane's warning, Tyson would hit Ruddock with a strong right overhand that knocked Ruddock to the canvas. Ruddock would almost immediately get back up but was met with a furious onslaught from Tyson, who continued to hammer Ruddock with punches until fatigue set in with about 30 seconds left in the round. Ruddock would bounce back with a strong round 3, but in round 4, Tyson would counter a Ruddock uppercut and land a right hook that again sent Ruddock to canvas, though Ruddock was again able to quickly get back to his feet. Tyson would also have the first of three points deducted in round 4 after once again landing a low blow on Ruddock. Tyson would also lose points in both the 9th and 10th rounds for hitting Ruddock with another low blow and hitting him after the bell, while Ruddock would lose a point in the 8th for hitting Tyson after the bell. In round 11, the two fighters would exchange low blows, but Lane opted not to deduct points, instead warning the two to \\"knock that shit off\\". In round 12, Tyson would fight Ruddock aggressively in an attempt to gain the knockout victory, but Ruddock was able to withstand Tyson's attack and survive the fight without any further knockdowns. By the end of the fight, Ruddock's left eye had been swollen shut and his jaw had been broken, while Tyson suffered a perforated eardrum.Smash Dance, Sports Illustrated article, 1990-07-08, Retrieved on 2013-05-09 Aftermath After months of tough negotiations between Tyson's and Evander Holyfield's respective camps, which included both men's promoters attempting to get a fight with George Foreman instead, a deal was reached that would see Holyfield and Tyson face each other for the Undisputed Heavyweight Championship on November 8, 1991 at Caesars Palace.Tyson to Fight Champ Holyfield, Won't Face Foreman, Philadelphia Inquirer article, 1990-07-11, Retrieved on 2013-05-09 However, Tyson suffered an injury during training camp and was unable to fight in November. The parties waited to reschedule until after Tyson's trial was complete, but before the fight could take place, Tyson was convicted of the rape of Desiree Washington in February 1992 and sentenced to six years in prison. Meanwhile, Ruddock would bounce back from his two losses to Tyson with knockout victories over Greg Page and Phil Jackson. This would set up a match with Lennox Lewis for the right to face the winner of the Evander Holyfield–Riddick Bowe fight for the Undisputed Heavyweight Championship. Ruddock would end up being knocked out by Lewis in the 2nd round, costing him a chance at the title and effectively ending his status as one of boxing's premier heavyweights.[https://www.boxingnewsonline.net/on- this-day-lennox-lewis-obliterates-razor-ruddock-to-win-the-wbc-title-by- default/ boxingnewsonline.com, 2017-31-10, Retrieved on 2020-14-9 References Category:1991 in boxing Category:Boxing in Las Vegas Category:1991 in sports in Nevada Category:Boxing on Showtime Ruddock Category:June 1991 sports events in the United States ","title":"Mike Tyson vs. Donovan Ruddock II"},{"id":"39342221","text":"Timgharine (also written Timrharine) is a village in the commune of Ksabi, in Ouled Khoudir District, Béchar Province, Algeria.

It is the sequel to 2003's GunZ: The Duel. Gunz 2 began its first closed beta test in Korea in early 2011, however it has yet to be released. Gunz 2 is currently greenlit on Steam via its Greenlight program, and has entered into beta testing on February 17, 2014 via Steam Greenlight.http://store.steampowered.com/app/242720 The Steam version of Gunz 2 is available for international players, mainly in North America. The European version of Gunz 2 was hosted during its open beta phase by ProSiebenSat.1 Media.http://www.gunz2.co.uk/ On 15 December 2014 the licensing agreement between MAIET Entertainment and Prosieben ended where MAIET opened a Steam server for the European region. On September 4, 2015, a news post on Steam announced that the company MAIET Entertainment is no longer operational. The post also states that all rights for the game were taken over by the company MasangSoft Inc. This has caused outrage amongst many players, as they have been left in the dark without being informed of any updates while the game is kept up for MasangSoft's own personal gain. On March 31, 2017, MasangSoft announced all servers for GunZ 2 except US-West will close on May 10, 2017 at 5:00 PM PST. They cite accumulated deficit as a reason for the closures. http://steamcommunity.com/games/gunz2/announcements/detail/666937680481451576  Gameplay  GunZ 2: The Second Duel is a multiplayer third-person shooter mixed with swordplay, similar to the first game GunZ: The Duel. The game empathise fast-pace gameplay and advanced free-movement mechanics such as dashing, wall-running and tumbling. The players can split into two teams, either GSF or NAU. There are six different classes to choose from (Ivan, Elena, Rena, Max, Wayne, and Rose), all with different sets of skills and play styles. The advanced movement mechanics allows the player to maneuver in unique ways and create deadly combat techniques using rhythmic keystrokes. The game's advanced combat system is very similar but arguably not as exploitable as its prequel. GunZ 2's network communication is solved by player hosted servers, when the players joins the game one of the players will be assigned the role to act as a hosting machine. MAIET released a dedicated server solution to the US West region for testing purposes and declaring to expand later to other regions when it's stable. The dedicated server was later removed from the game. The game offers different game modes to play: * Deathmatch * Team Deathmatch * Team Elimination Players will each round spawn simultaneously and killed players will become spectator for the rest of the round. The team that successfully kills everyone in the other team will win the round. * Campaign A Story mode for Gunz2, where you can play together in co-op mode to defeat NPCs enemies and complete missions.  Storyline  Continent of Astra, 1863 AD. During the war between the Axium Empire and Republic of Trivia, Mankind makes one of the greatest discoveries of its history, Optimite. At the same time, Adam Corp, a supranational mega corporation was founded with its basis in energy industry. Adam Corp rapidly expanded with its enormous capital and became the third power of the world along with the empire and republic. Adam Corp is a group of brutal capitalists who do not hesitate to victimize anyone who stands in their way. The bigger they have become, the more devastated the public have become. To stand against the super villain, people of Astra have formed a vigilante group called Guardian Sans Frontier, the GSF. 1970 AD, Today. After the cold war, Adam Corp has completed their armament expansion and began manufacturing combat robots, which was prohibited by the international law. GSF quickly picked up the intel and dispatched their agents to an island in the republic where the core facilities of Adam Corp’s military factories are located. Hence begins the battle of GSF to cease Adam Corp’s bold ambition to take over the world. Though never explicitly mentioned, it is suggested that the universes of GunZ 1 & 2 are indeed connected. Although GunZ 1's lore isn't as expansive, GunZ 2 has the same mansion map from GunZ 1, which features the statue of Ryswick the Great. One of the songs of GunZ 1's OST is named Ryswick style, likely a reference to the statue of the same name.

Their mother Daroor Sulochana Devi was also a carnatic classical musician. As a couple the parents of SeshaChari and RagavaChari presented regular recitals in Yadagiri Gutta. SeshaChari and RaghavaChari\`s family originally belonged to Hayathnagar but later, the family moved to Yakutpura where RaghavaChari and SeshaChari were born.

LNV was first discovered in Aedes dorsalis populations in the Liaoning province of the People's Republic of China in 2006 from mosquito samples obtained in 1997. Its geographic distribution was previously thought to be limited to China, but it has since been found in mosquito populations in Australia. In addition to Aedes dorsalis, LNV has been isolated from Culex species. Virology LNV's genome is about 20,700 base pairs in length, and is segmented into 12 parts, with each segment having a major open reading frame that encodes for proteins VP1–12. VP10, believed to be a capsid protein, is responsible for determining the serotype, of which two serotypes have been identified to date. VP1 is most likely the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, VP3 is likely guanylyltransferase, a capping enzyme, VP7 shows similarities to protein kinases, and VP11 matches the dsRNA-binding proteins of other seadornaviruses. LNV is unique among seadornaviruses in that it is the only seadornavirus known to replicate in mammalian cells. The most recent common ancestor of LNV isolates from China is estimated to have been in the year 318. Genetic analysis indicates that LNV populations were relatively stable for centuries but declined significantly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before growing again starting in the late 1990s. LNV evolves at about the same rate as other dsRNA viruses but at a faster pace than other arboviruses. Part of LNV's genome is integrated into the Aedes aegypti genome, indicating that LNV likely originates from Africa, where Aedes aegypti is from, and didn't leave the continent until the growth of the shipping industry in the 18th and 19th centuries. Symptoms and diagnosis LNV is not known to cause disease in humans, but it has been investigated as a cause of encephalitis in regions of China that experience seasonal encephalitis but are not affected by Japanese encephalitis. In mice, reinfection, or being infected again shortly after recovering from an initial infection, causes lethal hemorrhaging. The exact reason for this is unknown, but it does not appear to be related to any antibody-facilitating effect. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the VP10 of both serotypes and a real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based on genome segments 10 and 12 have been developed to identify and conduct serological surveys of LNV.

The changes can be of any kind: equipment, technologies, organization, doctrine or changes in the environment itself. As in any other kind of laboratory, the analysis run in the lab is based on experiments. Since the capabilities to simulate a warfare environment, emulate systems or equipment, and model actors (including their interactions with other actors and their environment) are generally necessary to run such experiments, modelling and simulation is a major discipline required to operate a battle lab. __TOC__  Other definitions  The definition of a battle lab provided by the DNBL operating model document is \\"A combination of test capabilities brought together with operational end- users for the purpose of operator training and/or development/enhancement of operational concepts and procedures.\\"DNBL operating model document Presagis defines battle labs as \\"A fairly new concept that allow for the virtual experimentation of new technology and solutions before they are fielded in battle. The goal is to test the latest in battlefield organization, tactics, doctrine, and technological capabilities to determine their potential value early on in the acquisition process - before significant investment has been made in their preparation and deployment. By using simulations or prototypes, the battle lab can cost-effectively evaluate battlefield performance of new technology or solutions.\\" The study \\"What are Battle Labs – Do We Still Need Them?\\" provides an academic view of the US battle labs in the early 2000s.What are Battle Labs – Do We Still Need Them?  Origins  The concept of a battle lab was born in the US army in the early 1990s. It was first introduced by the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command commander, General Frederick M. Franks Jr. as being a means to \\"quickly and thoroughly analyze both warfighting ideas and the means of warfare produced by emerging technologies.\\"  Method  The analysis performed by a battle lab consists primarily in forming hypotheses, then conducting experiments based on modeling and simulation, possibly including operational end-users. Battle labs are mostly used with a concept development and experimentation approach to support experimentation campaigns. The Guide for Understanding and Implementing Defense Experimentation (GUIDEx)GUIDEx Book is a reference in the domain.  Mission  The mission of the United States Air Force Battlelab is to \\"rapidly identify and prove the worth of innovative ideas which improve the ability of the Air Force to execute its core competencies and Joint Warfighting.”USAF Battlelabs SAB-TR-00-04 August 2000 The mission of the Mission Command Battle Lab (MCBL) at United States Army Combined Arms Center is to \\"[mitigate] risk to current and future Army forces by examining and evaluating emerging concepts and technologies through experimentation, studies, prototyping, and network integration, while simultaneously informing the combat development and acquisition processes.\\" Battle labs can be set to explore a specific topic (called an \\"ad hoc battle lab,\\" generally with a limited life span and very specialized means and simulations) or can be set as a multi-purpose exploration capability (with unlimited life span, flexible and scalable means and simulations). Battle labs can be set by type of military forces (Air Forces, Naval Forces or Land Forces) or can be set across domains (Joint Forces, Combined lab). Battle labs can also be set for a military capability such as Command and Control.DoD Command and Control Research Program The list of US battle labs published by the US Air Force Air University illustrates the diversity of battle labs.  Battle labs interconnection  The interconnection of battle labs requires connecting the networks, connecting deployed systems and sometimes sharing technical means (simulation capabilities, test and evaluation services). Such interconnection requires setting a framework shared by the different stakeholders. For example, the NATO Distributed Networked Battle Labs (DNBL)DNBL overview by the NATO NCIA have been created in order to tighten cooperation on preparation and conduct of Experimentation, Test and Evaluation (ET&E;) events between the members of the framework. The DNBL Framework provides the operating model to enable the federated use of capabilities and systems for a wide range of user groups and to exchange ET&E; services available in the DNBL Service Catalogue. From the prospective of the simulation, a framework is dedicated to \\"distributed simulation\\" and simulation interoperability. The Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization develops standards and promotes modelling and simulation interoperability.

Virgo serena\\" is a motet composed by Josquin des Prez. It is regarded as Josquin's most famous motet and one of the most famous pieces of the 15th century. The piece rose to extreme popularity in the 16th century, even appearing at the head of the first volume of motets ever printed. Its revolutionary open style featuring early imitative counterpoint and two-voice parts has added to its acclaim as one of the most influential compositions of its time. Composition The opening line shows the lyrical use of imitative counterpoint. The work was composed during Josquin's service at the North Italian court at Milan. It was initially thought to have been copied into the manuscript Munich 3154 by 1476. Subsequent work by Joshua Rifkin established the date of publication to about 1485. It is Josquin's earliest dateable work. Several modern theorists have applied the concept of syntactic imitation to describe the lucid relationship between the text and Josquin's musical setting. Each phrase corresponds to a line of text, cleverly exposed through points of imitation. Structural articulations often resolve on cadences, where voices arrive on perfect intervals. The opening section summarizes the first four lines of text in a simple structure. Clear imitation of each phrase, in the style of litany, dramatically echoes from the highest to lowest voice, almost resembling Gregorian chant. While the phrases are identical in length, the counterpoint's turbidity increases, climaxing where all four voices sing together. This climax turns to an imperfect, deceptive cadence, symbolizing the permeative difficulty of Mother Mary's influence. The theme of syntactic imitation is exemplified by each strophe in the poem, comparable and balanced in length with the others. Local details in texture and counterpoint often directly relate to the syntactic affect of the text, like the sudden expanse of homophonic harmonies during \\"solemni plena gaudio\\". Following this moment comes \\"coelestia, terrestria...,\\" while the vocalists join in climbing melodic lines and dense syncopation of rhythms in an attempt to evoke Mary's filling of heaven and earth. While the regularity of imitation initially articulates the phrases, the middle verses exemplify the articulation from contrasts in texture. Duets alternate between voices and often break off into trios. The lines are punctuated by structural cadences, presenting the text in a temporary repose. Josquin locates each of these structural cadences in progressions of increasing power, placing the strongest, most perfect cadence for the very end of each line. The unity of musical sound, representing the spiritual unity of prayer, completes the act of worship which has been the rhetorical goal of the text. The final lines are sung in homophony, as if the four, once separate voices have aligned under the grace of God.

His body of work captures much of the country's turbulent history through Apartheid and into the young democracy.  Childhood and influences  Born in District Six, Cape Town, Hallett was raised in the fishing village of Hout Bay by his grandparents. He spent a lot of his time in his grandfather's workshop, where he was taught how to make his own toys, wagons and kites. He became interested in photography while rifling through his uncle's copies of National Geographic magazine and the black-and-white moving images of the cinema. He attended South Peninsula High School in Diep River where his English teacher, Richard Rive introduced him to the work of local and international artists and writers. Rive later became a journalist for Drum magazine but at the time he met George, he was an inspired dramatist, writer and activist. He encouraged his students not only to read from the syllabus but introduced them to writers such as James Matthews, Alex La Guma, Jan Rabie, Uys Krige, Breyten Breytenbach and others from the Sestigers movement. Another important influence was artist Peter Clarke, an Ocean View resident. Clarke focused his creativity in the field of printmaking and painting, on his community. He was involved in various community based projects and workshops.  Life and work  Hallett, without any experience in the field, chose the route of photography. He was self-taught and began his career as a street photographer. He furthered his skill by taking a correspondence course in photography with the City and Guilds in London at the age of 20. In his early work, he photographed District Six extensively, before its destruction under apartheid in the 1970s. James Matthews was instrumental in rallying Hallett to photograph District Six before it was razed. He also did freelance photography for Drum magazine, but there were not many job opportunities in South Africa. Having suffered stabbings on the Cape Flats and fed up with racism and violence in South Africa, he moved to London in 1970. He started working for The Times Educational Supplement in London and designed book covers for Heinemann Educational Books for more than 12 years. His first exhibition with South African artists Gerard Sekoto and Louis Maurice was held in Paris in 1971. This was followed by an exhibition of his South African work in the Westerkerk in Amsterdam that same year. In 1974 he moved to the South of France. He lived in a small farming community in the Pyrenees Mountains. The work from this period earned him an award from Hasselblad for outstanding contributions to photography (1982). Through his travels he continued to connect with exiled South Africans, many of whom were also poets, musicians, artists and writers, he soon became a part of this closely knit family. He made contact with the likes of Pallo Jordan, Alex La Guma, and Dudu Pukwana in London, and African writers such as Wole Soyinka and Ahmadou Kourouma in Berlin. Many of these images were later compiled in his book Portraits of African Writers. In 1983 he was offered an opportunity to be an Artist in Residence at the University of Illinois.James, P. 2002; The Exchange Project, Making Connections. Birmingham Black International History. Grosvenor, McLean, and Roberts (eds), Birmingham. He took this opportunity with both hands, spending the rest of the decade in the United States where he was invited to participate in exhibitions and projects with five other universities. He later moved to Amsterdam. He had not been there long when the ANC requested he return to South Africa to record the first Democratic Elections. The many images that resulted earned him a Golden Eye Award from World Press Photo in Amsterdam. He was the official photographer for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997. Many poignant works were produced in this period. One such is the image entitled Jann Turner with Eugene de Kock, TRC Headquarters 1997. Eugene De Kock was the commander at Vlakplaas, where political activist Rick Turner, father of Jann Turner, was assassinated in front of her by security policemen. The weight of this image is in the exchange between the two subjects, with Turner's dry smile and De Kock's straight gaze ahead. This project led to his work with the Nobel Peace Centre in Oslo and the resulting travelling exhibition, Strengths and Convictions: The life and times of the South African Nobel Peace laureates Albert Luthuli, Desmond Tutu, FW de Klerk and Nelson Mandela. Yet, Hallett's work is focused on capturing positive moments that communicate the triumph of the human spirit. He was vocal about this quality in his work. It sets his work apart from his peers and its development can be traced back to his early images of District Six and continued into his understated portraits of South African exiles. Hallett identified with the exiled, but not only politically. Images would include family and community activity as they interacted with each other, socialising, making music and the like. His partiality to the hopeful does not compromise the often sombre or dire themes he tackles through his image production. Hallett described himself as a humanist. He was strongly committed to passing on his skills to aspiring photographers, and has taught photography at American, British, European, and South African institutions. Hallett's photographs are represented in museums and galleries in South Africa as well as internationally. Hallett died peacefully in his sleep after a long illness on July 1, 2020.https://johannesburgreviewofbooks.com/2020/07/01/george- hallett-1942-2020-rip/ Gallery File:Dancing men at Langa Jazz Festival in 1968.jpg File:Godfrey Street District Six in1968.jpg File:Dumile Feni and Louis Moholo, exiles in London in 1971.jpg File:First Encounter, Johannesburg in 1994.jpg File:Jann Turner with Eugene de Kock, TRC Headquarters in1997.jpg  Solo exhibitions  * 1970: The Artists' Gallery  Cape Town. * 1971: Westerkerk  Amsterdam, Netherlands. * 1972: Anne Frank Huis, Amsterdam.

Recently this region became a flashpoint for violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslims as Pakistan prepares to hold a general election and provincial elections on May 11, which will mark the country’s first democratic transition of power. A suicide bomber attacked a rally for Syed Janan, a candidate of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party. Mufti Syed Janan was reportedly the main target but he left the scene with minor injuries. At least 18 people were killed and 40 people including 11 children were injured in the attack of 7 May 2013, which raised the total number of fatalities, in pre-election violence since April, to over 100. According to the police officer Haleem Khan the suicide bomber was on a motorcycle and detonated near the vehicle carrying election candidate Syed Janan. Janan later told the press, “I was on my election campaign and coming to my vehicle when the bomber blew himself up. I received some injuries but survived. Two of my guards were seriously wounded.” It was one of the attacks that targeted candidates from Islamist parties, indicating a new trend in the pre-election violence, which had only occurred with secular parties before this week. A curfew was imposed after these attacks. Investigations are going on and the site is cordoned off.

Albanian bayraks as of 1918. Kastrati covers section 30. Shkreli, drawing made by Edith Durham The Kastrati is a historical Albanian tribe (fis) and region in northwestern Albania. It is part of the Malësia region. Administratively, the region is located in the Malësi e Madhe District, part of the Kastrati municipal unit. The centre of Kastrati is the village of Bajzë. As an area and kin group it is mentioned in 1403 and then in 1416 in Venetian archives. Kastrati is a community based on kinship and territorial ties that are traced back to the common ancestor of most of its brotherhoods (vllazni), Detal Bratoshi.  Geography  Kastrati is located in northwestern Albania, Shkodër County near the Albania-Montenegro border. The region is wholly included in the Kastrat municipal unit about 26km to the east. In terms of historical divisions, it borders Hoti to the north, the town of Koplik to the south, Kelmendi and Boga to the northeast and Shkreli to the east. Kastrati borders the Skadar Lake to the west. This part of the lake that is traditionally used by Kastrati is called Viri. Kastrati is divided into two sub-regions: the mountainous Katund i Kastratit and the lowland Bajzë area. The settlement of Bajzë itself is the center of Kastrati. This division reflects the organization of Kastrati's economy, which is a combination of agricultural and livestock activities. All families of Kastrati have property in both areas. Bajzë includes: Aliaj, Jeran, Gradec, Vukpalaj, Ivanaj, Pjetroshan and Katund i Kastratit includes: Goraj, Budishë and Bratosh. In the Ottoman period, some villages like Kamicë-Flakë were put under the bajrak (military administrative unit) of Kastrati, but are not part of this region. They are related to the wider Vraka area in terms of cultural ties. p. 9. \\"Am östlichen Ufer des Shkodrasees gibt es heute auf dem Gebiet von Vraka vier Dörfer, in denen ein Teil der Bewohner eine montenegrinische Mundart spricht. Ferner zählen zu dieser Gruppe noch die Dörfer Shtoji i Ri und Shtoji i Vjetër in der Gemeinde Rrethinat und weiter nordwestlich von Koplik das Dorf Kamica (Kamenica), das zur Gemeinde Qendër in der Region Malësia e Madhe gehört. Desgleichen wohnen vereinzelt in der Stadt sowie im Kreis Shkodra weitere Sprecher der montenegrinischen Mundart. Nach ihrer Konfession unterscheidet man zwei Gruppen, d.h. orthodoxe mid muslimische Slavophone. Die erste, kleinere Gruppe wohnt in Boriçi i Vogël, Gril, Omaraj und Kamica, die zweite, größere Gruppe in Boriçi i Madh und in Shtoj.\\" Thus, today Kamica is not placed in the Kastrati municipal unit, but in Qendër. Origins Oral traditions are the first accounts about Kastrati's origins. In the beginning of the 20th century, archival records yielded more historically grounded observations. Almost all of Kastrati's brotherhoods descend from the figure of Detal Bratoshi, thus have no endogamous relations within Kastrati. The name Kastrati itself is the name of a settlement and small tribe that lived in that exact area before the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century. Kastrati is first mentioned in 1403 when its leader Alexius, head of three villages appears to be awarded gifts by the Venetian governor of Scutari. Alexius Kastrati reappears as head of Kastrati in the Venetian cadastre of Scutari in 1416-7. His immediate kin included Alexius Kastrati the Younger, Pal, Markjen and Lazër Kastrati. A Jon Stronga also appears in their main settlement. Konstantin Jireček recorded a story that linked them to Kuči through a supposed great-grandson of Kastrati named Krsto, who was allegedly the brother of Grča, son of Nenad, ancestor of Old Kuči. In historical record, Kastrati and the Old Kuči appear in different areas and timelines as Old Kuči formed part of the tribe of current Kuči, which was based on different ancestral groups in the late 15th century . Nevertheless, if not kin by blood, Montenegrin and Albanian tribes regarded closeness in original or home territory from where someone \\"came\\". Therefore, Serbian geographer Andrija Jovićević put forward the narrative that the Kuči were \\"kin\\" to Kastrati, Berisha and Kelmendi because their distant ancestor once, ostensibly, settled in the same general area as Kuči. In later times, one brotherhood of Kuči, the Drekaloviči traced their descent to Berisha. In turn, from them a part of the Kastrati trace their origin in the 16th century. Thus, these groups have the custom of avoiding intermarriage with each other. From this brotherhood descended the semi-legendary figure of Detal Bratoshi (alternatively recorded as Dedli or Del), who is the ancestor of the majority of brotherhoods of Kastrati. Families Johann Georg von Hahn registered 408 families with 3,157 people living in two groups of families: highland and lowland. Highland families were Martinaj, Gjokaj, Theresi, Bradosoi, Budischia, Kurtaj, Goraj and Pjetroviç while lowland families were Puta, Copani, Hikuzzaj, Skandsehi, Pjetrosçinaj, Moxetti, Dobrovoda and Aliaj. All of them were Catholics except the Aliaj, who were Muslims. In the late Ottoman period, the tribe of Kastrati consisted of 300 Catholic and 200 Muslim households. Religion and economy The predominant religion in Kastrati is Roman Catholicism. The Kastrati celebrate the feast of St. Mark. They have traditionally supported themselves with livestock and agriculture. History The Kastrati clan was recorded for the first time in 1416. The clan's centre was once at the ruins of a Roman castra on the Scutari-Orosh road. In Mariano Bolizza's 1614 report, Kastrati had 50 households and 130 men-in-arms led by Prenk Bitti. In 1831, during the Ottoman attack against Montenegro, the Kastrati and other clans of Northern Albania expressed their support of Montenegro and refused to participate on the Ottoman side. In 1832 they joined Montenegrin forces and defeated Ottoman forces on Hoti mountain. According to the Treaty of San Stefano the region of Kastrati (together with Hoti, Kelmendi and Grudë) was to be annexed to Montenegro, but after the Treaty of Berlin was signed in 1878 this decision was changed and Kastrati remained in the Ottoman Empire. However, as other Albanian-inhabited areas were formally annexed to Montenegro the delimitation process was not concluded. In 1883 Kastrati, Hoti, Gruda and Shkreli formed another pact to prevent the delimitation of the expanded Montenegrin borders. After the Young Turk Revolution (1908) and subsequent restoration of the Ottoman constitution, the Kastrati tribe made a besa (pledge) to support the document and to stop blood feuding with other tribes until November 6. During the Albanian revolt of 1911 on 23 June Albanian tribesmen and other revolutionaries gathered in Montenegro and drafted the Greçë Memorandum demanding Albanian sociopolitical and linguistic rights with five of the signatories being from Kastrati. In later negotiations with the Ottomans, an amnesty was granted to the tribesmen with promises by the government to build one to two primary schools in the nahiye of Kastrati and pay the wages of teachers allocated to them. Kastrati was a battleground area during the Balkan Wars. During the Siege of Scutari in 1912/1913 Catholics from Kastrati, Hoti and Grude, joined the forces of Kingdom of Montenegro and robbed and burned houses of Muslim members of their clans who retreated to the Ottoman- controlled fortress of Scutari. On May 26, 1913, a delegation from the chief families of Hoti, Gruda, Kelmendi, Shkreli and Kastrati met Admiral Cecil Burney of the international fleet and petitioned against the annexation of Hoti and Gruda by Montenegro. The delegation warned that hostilities would resume if those areas didn't remain \\"entirely Albanian\\". Eventually, due to the influence of Austria, the region of Kastrati was incorporated into the newly formed Kingdom of Albania, although it was agreed with some of the Great Powers that it should be annexed to Montenegro.

The programs aim to increase social and emotional skills, promote resilience, and preventing anxiety and depression across the lifespan. As a prevention protocol, FRIENDS has been noted as “one of the most robustly-supported programmes for internalising disorders,” with “a number of large-scale type 1 randomised control trials worldwide” demonstrating its effectiveness ( ). The FRIENDS programs are acknowledged by the World Health Organization as effective evidence based prevention programs.https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/en/prevention_of_mental_disorders_sr.pdf The FRIENDS programs incorporate physiological, cognitive and behavioural strategies to assist children, youths and adults in coping with stress and worry. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of FRIENDS in addressing mental health issues such as OCD, anxiety, depression, autism and stress in children, adolescents, adults and the elderly. Furthermore, studies have also shown that protective factors such as self-esteem, self-concept, coping skills, hope and social support are enhanced in the program. The FRIENDS protocol was designed to be delivered in both clinical and educational settings by teachers, psychologists, and allied health professionals. The FRIENDS Programs continue to be researched and developed by author, Professor Paula Barrett, in Queensland, Australia, as well as a host of researchers worldwide including Professor Paul Stallard, Professor Elisabeth Utens, and Professor Bente Storm Haugland amongst others.  History  The FRIENDS Programs were developed by Professor Paula Barrett. Based in cognitive behavioral techniques, the gold standard for treating and preventing anxiety and depression, the protocol was originally developed for the early intervention and prevention of anxiety. Unlike other anxiety protocols at the time, such as Phillip C. Kendall's Coping Cat, FRIENDS utilises a group format and can be used in a prevention, early intervention or a treatment approach. In 1999 another round of research was performed which led to the production of a third edition of FRIENDS for Children, which incorporated the research feedback to tailor the program to being more teacher-friendly. Further research and development from 2000 onward caused iterative improvements toward the FRIENDS Programs to make them what they are today. In response to the devastating Queensland Floods of 2010/2011, Professor Paula Barrett developed the Adult Resilience for Life Program. This Program was designed to help adults cope with loss and extreme stress that was prevalent after natural disasters. The Adult Resilience Program was also rolled out to victims of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in order to help that population cope with the loss of property and loved ones. The Adult Resilience for Life Program was further developed into the Adult Resilience Strong Not Tough Program in 2012. This Program is run in a two-day format and teaches coping strategies and relaxation techniques to adults and the elderly.Barrett, P. (2011). Resilience for life: Adult program, http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:266708  Format  The FRIENDS protocol has been adapted into four developmentally- sensitive programs: *Fun FRIENDS (4 – 7 years)Barrett, P.

MY FRIENDS -Youth Resilience Program: Group Leaders' Manual for Youth. Pathways Health and Research Centre. *Adult Resilience for Life (16 years and over) The programs are typically delivered over 10 session with two booster sessions, typically 60–75 minutes. Delivery is, however, flexible across different settings as long as the sequence, structure and topics are respected. Two information sessions of approximately 90–120 minutes are conducted with caregivers and educators to provide strategies for enhancing resilience at home, reinforcing program strategies, and behaviour management techniques. Specific Goals *Increasing participant's ability to recognise and regulate one's own emotions, thoughts and behaviours *Building participant's skills in taking the perspective of and empathising with others *Improving competencies of establishing and maintaining healthy and rewarding relationships *Providing strategies for making constructive and respectful choices about personal behaviour and social interactions *Enhancing participant's resilience to not only overcome adversity but also to take advantage of positive future challenges *Developing skills to prevent and treat mental health concerns Content The FRIENDS programs draw from interventions based in cognitive behavioural, acceptance and commitment, and positive psychology approaches. Skills covered in the younger programs are represented in the letters of the acronym FRIENDS, whilst the adult program utilises the acronym LIFE. All of the FRIENDS programs overlap in content; however, they differ in the method of delivering skills with each program using developmentally-appropriate activities. Specifically, whilst younger programs such as Fun FRIENDS and FRIENDS for Life encourage more play-based techniques including puppets, storybooks and coloring activities, the My FRIENDS Youth and Adult Resilience programs utilize role plays, group discussions and written activities.Barrett, P. (2005). FRIENDS for Life: Group leaders' manual for children. Barrett Research Resources Pty Ltd. Overall the content is as follows: * F= Feelings: This stage of the program focuses on building participants’ skills in recognising and responding to their own feelings as well as the feelings of others. Throughout this stage, there is an emphasis on accepting feelings and choosing positive coping behaviours. * R= Remember to Relax, Have Quiet time: The second stage of the program involves learning about physiological signs of emotions. By recognising these body clues, participants are better able to manage their feelings when they are of a smaller intensity and easier to regulate. This stage also trains participants in strategies to relax including diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, massage and relaxation imagery. Adolescent and adult programs also utilise mindfulness strategies in this stage. * I= I can try my best (Inner Helpful Thoughts): In the third stage, participants are introduced to attention training and the cognitive model. Attention and awareness have recently been identified as key factors in the maintenance of gains from evidence-based programs. Attention training encourages participants to practice awareness in the present moment and focusing on positive things in our environment. Both anxious and depressive symptomology typically involves negative evaluations about oneself, others and the world. Cognitive restructuring encourages participants to identify unhelpful thinking styles and challenge these thoughts to have more helpful thoughts, more pleasant feelings and more proactive behaviour. * E= Explore solutions and Coping Step Plans: The fourth stage of the program differs heavily between younger and older stages of the programs. Overall this stage focuses on learning coping skills and plans to overcome challenging situations including Coping Step Plans, Problem Solving Plans, Friendship Skills, Building Confidence, Conflict Resolution, Role Models, and Support Teams. Overcoming challenging situations can be a daunting task, Problem Solving Plans and Coping Step Plans help participants choose a course of action through brainstorming solutions, evaluating the potential consequences of their actions, breaking down goals into smaller steps, and reviewing the outcomes of their choices. Coping Step Plans are also utilised for exposure training, to help participants break the cycle of anxiety and avoidance to overcome fears, as well as time management, which is especially useful for adolescents. Friendship skills differ across developmental levels of the program ranging from sharing, helping and listening in younger age groups to navigating cyber friendships in older groups. Role Models and Support Teams are discussed as those who may support, guide or inspire participants during challenging situations. Conflict Resolution teaches skills in differentiating conflict styles (passive, assertive, aggressive) and how to best achieve assertive outcomes. * N = Now reward yourself: This stage involves teaching participants the importance of self-rewarding. Activities highlight the importance of rewarding ourselves for our efforts rather than the outcomes. Interpersonal rewards are encouraged such as time and activities with family and/or friends as opposed to gifts, food, electronics or monetary rewards. * D= Do it every day: Skills are most effective when practised every day. This letter of FRIENDS is to encourage participants to continue using the skills after the program is completed. *• S= Smile! Stay calm, and talk to support teams: The final stage of the program is the relapse prevention phase. Participants develop a more applied knowledge of the program by using skills in conjunction with each other. Identification of future challenges and planning strategies for overcoming these is a key learning outcome. Older programs also incorporate teaching participants about giving back to their community and the effects of healthy/unhealthy living (e.g. exercise, diet, substances, sleep) on brain development and mental health.  Use in prevention  Studies of FRIENDS effectiveness in prevention of anxiety for 9- to 10-year-old children have been mixed in results.http://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/phr/volume-3/issue-14#abstract  Translations and International Use  The FRIENDS program is currently used in the following countries: Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Portugal, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands and Singapore. Although originally written in English, the FRIENDS program has since been translated into Russian, Arabic, Finnish, Portuguese, Dutch, Japanese and Spanish.

This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction : Release of N-terminal targeting peptides from precursor proteins imported into the mitochondrion, typically with Arg in position P2 This enzyme is present the mitochondrial matrix of fungi and mammals.  Function  Mitochondria import the majority of their proteins from the cell cytosol. In order to achieve this, many mitochondrial proteins encode a short targeting signal which directs them to the mitochondrion and through its preprotein translocase machinery. Mitochondrial proteins which reach the innermost mitochondrial compartment, the Mitochondrial matrix, often undergo proteolytic cleavage of the targeting signal, performed by the Mitochondrial Processing Peptidase (MPP), this is often necessary for the maturation of the preprotein to its functional form or to reveal additional targeting sequences. In most eukaryotes, the MPP consists of two subunits, an α and β subunit which bind together to form a heterodimeric complex. In humans these are the genes PMPCA and PMPCB. The subunits of the MPP are highly conserved, and have shown to be interoperable between species, homologues to MPPs are also found in eukaryotes whose mitochondria have evolved into divergent organelles, though in the case of Trichomonas the processing peptidase complex appears to be made of two β subunits. The origins of the mitochondrial processing peptidases are thought to be prokaryotic in origin, possibly originating in the endosymbiont which developed into the mitochondrion, this hypothesis has been supported by the discovery of a bacterial signal peptidase in Rickettsia, an organism thought to be a closely related to the mitochondrial progenitor.

Commissioned in 1978, the plant was Taiwan's first and smallest nuclear power plant. Generation The power plant can generate 9 billion kWh of electricity per year. The two spent fuel pools at the plant have 3,074 and 3,076 spent nuclear fuel assemblies, respectively, with a maximum storage of 3,083 assemblies per pool. Decommissioning plan Taipower, as the operator of the power plant, was required by the Radiation Monitoring Center of the Atomic Energy Council to hand in the 2018 decommissioning plans for the plant by December 2015 for the authority to review all of the plans before the decommissioning date. Once the reactors have been shut down, the plant should be dismantled within 25 years. Taipower plans to allocate NT$18.2 billion for the disposal of nuclear waste from the decommissioned plant over the next 25 years. Currently Taipower is doing feasibility study of building a nuclear waste storage facility on an uninhabited island around Taiwan. Events The July 2013 Typhoon Soulik caused a trip to the generator and turbine of the power plant Unit-2 because one suspension ground line failed and hit the transmission line when the typhoon hit the island on 13–14 July. The typhoon also caused the seawater inlet to be blocked by large amount of debris and damaged three fine filters, traveling filter rake and the plant's switchyard. The damage caused the plant to be offline for several days. In August 2013, it was reported that there might have been radioactive water leaks for three years from the storage pools of the nuclear power plant's two reactors. Official from Taipower said that the water might come from different sources, such as condensation water or water used for cleaning up the floors. The water however has been collected in a reservoir next to the storage pools used for spent nuclear rods and has been recycled back into the storage pools, thus is claimed to pose no threat to the environment. In December 2013, the circulating pump of the second reactor tripped due to the low lube oil pressure which caused a built-in lube oil pump. The Atomic Energy Council was criticized due to their very slow respond in giving answers to the public only 10 hours after the trip. On 4 August 2016, smoke rose out from the power plant resulted from unstable voltage frequency which caused external circuit breakers to trip and produced smoke.http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2016/08/06/474618/Smoke-at.htm See also * Energy in Taiwan * List of power stations in Taiwan * Nuclear power in Taiwan * Electricity sector in Taiwan References Category:Nuclear power stations in Taiwan Category:1978 establishments in Taiwan Category:Buildings and structures in New Taipei ","title":"Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant"},{"id":"39343094","text":"The Kasabe language is an extinct language of Cameroon, formerly spoken around Mambila in the Nyalang area.

She was launched in 1778 and the Royal Navy captured her the next year, taking her into service as HMS Mutine. The Royal Navy renamed her HMS Pigmy in 1798. She was lost in 1805.  Career  On 17 August 1779 Mutin accepted the surrender of the British cutter in the Channel. Active had encountered the combined Franco-Spanish fleet in the English Channel and was unable to escape. HMS Jupiter captured Mutin, along with her sister Pilote, on 2 October after having dismasted Mutin by gunfire. At the time of her capture Mutin was under the command of Chevalier de Roquefieul. Royal Navy service Between 16 November 1779 and 13 December 1780, she was at Portsmouth, being fitted. The Royal Navy named and registered her as HMS Mutine on 22 January 1780. Lieutenant Samuel Cox commissioned her in October 1779 for the North Sea. Mutine shared with His Majesty's cutters and in the capture on 30 December 1780 of the French privateer General Ville Pateaux. From March 1782 she was under the command of Lieutenant James Hills. On 6 October she captured the French privateer lugger Compte de Valentinois and delivered it to Admiralty control at Spithead. Count de Valentinois was armed with two 3-pounder guns and eight swivel guns. She had a crew of 31 men under the command of Captain Le Dos and had sailed from Cherbourg the previous evening. She had captured nothing prior to encountering Mutine. In May 1783 Lieutenant Robert Watson replaced Hills. Watson remained in command until Mutine was paid off in 1787 and transferred to Plymouth Dockyard for repairs. There was no work on the ship until 1789, when she underwent an extensive refit at a cost of £3,884. Mutine was recommissioned in October 1789 under Lieutenant Humphrey West and detailed for Mediterranean service in 1790. From July 1795 she was assigned to the squadron led by Admiral Horatio Nelson, then in position off the coast of Genoa. French Revolutionary Wars In January 1797 Lieutenant William Shepheard replaced West. Mutine was renamed Pigmy in 1798. She shared with , and the cutter in the proceeds from the detention of two vessels under neutral colours, Federick Molk and Vrow Judith, on 18 and 21 August. On 8 January 1799, at noon, Pigmy was two miles SE of Durlston Head when she sighted a cutter and two brigs. Pigmy gave chase and at 1:40 succeeded in recapturing the two brigs, Lark and Dion. After securing these two vessels Pigmy continued the chase with the result that at 4pm she succeeded in capturing the French privateer cutter Rancune. Rancune was armed with two swivel guns and had a crew of 21 men under the command of Antoine François Victor Joseph Panpeville. She was 26 hours out of Cherbourg and the two brigs were her sole captures. Lark, Francis Artis, master, was sailing from Cardiff to London with a cargo of bar iron. Dion, Esdras Best, master, was on the same route and with the same cargo.captured the French privateer Rancune. For the remainder of the year, Pygmy operated in Quiberon Bay supporting the Royalist by bringing arms and money.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, pp.21-23. Pigmy shared with , , , and , and the hired armed cutter Telemachus in the capture of four vessels: *St Francois, taken 25 December 1799; *St Pierre de Carnac, taken 12 January 1800; *a brig of unknown name, taken 17 January 1800; and *Anna Louisa, taken 22 January 1800. In May 1800 Pigmy was part of the Royal Navy squadron assisting at the siege of Genoa. She shared with numerous other British vessels in the proceeds of the row galley cut out by their boats on 21 May, the capture on 23 May of the St Jean Baptiste, the capture of the ketch Albanaise on 4 June that the Royal Navy took into service, and the surrender of the city that same day. On 20 July 1800, Pigmy was in company , under the command of Lord Cochrane, in the Mediterranean. They captured the Imperial tartane Madonna Moseti Petro, which was sailing to Cabrera with a cargo of wood. On 28 August 1800, the brig , Lieutenant W. Ricketts, commander, and Pigmy were at Cesenatico. Their orders were to destroy the vessels in its harbour, and \\"make a proper example of the town.\\" The British were unable to approach closely enough so during the night of 30 August Ricketts sent in boats of both vessels under the overall command of Lieutenant James Lucas Yeo, first lieutenant of Corso. The attackers were able to capture the town, sink two boats, and burn 11 others. One of the sunken vessels was deeply laden with copper, money, and bale goods. Four of the vessels sank in the mouth of the harbour, and fire consumed both piers. The British sailors were able to hold off some French infantry, but when Ricketts observed French cavalry approaching he ordered the boats to withdraw. Afterwards, Ricketts sent the authorities of the town the following note: > To the Inhabitants of Cesenatico. The Treachery of your Municipality, in > causing to be arrested an Officer with Dispatches, has been long known to > the British Admiral in these Seas. That Municipality may now sadly know that > the Severity of Judgment, long delayed, is always exemplary. That the > Innocent suffer with the Guilty, though much to be regretted, is the natural > Feature of War; and the more terrible Infliction on this occasion, the more > striking the Example should prove to surrounding Municipalities. (Signed) W. > RICKETTS From September 1800 to June 1801, Pygmy, alone or with Corso, captured several small vessels, some of them armed: *French trabaccolo privateer Bataglia di Marengo, while on a cruise from Ravenna (6 September); *Imperial trabaccalo Divine Providence, sailing from Cesenatriro to France with a cargo of rope (17 September); *Neapolitan polacca brig Madona de Laura, sailing from Trepano to Ponto Gai with a cargo of salt (20 September); *Imperial trabaccolo Divine Providence, sailing from Monopoli to Milan with a cargo of oil (6 October); *Cisalpine trabaccolo sailing from Ravenna to Pesaro with a cargo of oil (16 November, with Corso); *Cisalpine trabacolo, from Ravenna bound to Pesaro, in ballast (16 November, with Corso); *Imperial ship Seinge, sailing from Barcelona to Trieste with a cargo of brandy (17 January 1801, with Corso); *Russian polacca ship Madona Turgliana, sailing from the Morea to Trieste with a cargo of leather (17 January, with Corso); *Danish ship Adonis, detained while sailing from Copenhagen to Trieste with a cargo of stockfish (13 February, with Corso); *Danish brig Madellina Christiana, detained while sailing from Venice to Zante with a cargo of planks (16 February, with Corso); *French trabaccolo Adélaïde (see below); *Imperial trabaccolo Madona del Anunciade, sailing from Trieste to Fiume with a cargo of hemp (27 February, with Corso); *French trabaccolo privateer Achille (15 March, see below, with Corso); and *French brig Prudente, of two guns and 36 men, sailing from Toulon to Alexandria, with a cargo of ammunition, artificers' tools, and \\"Comedians\\" (8 June).(Apparently Prudente had some 100 passengers aboard, including troops, and actual comedians.) The deputies of the Mercantile Insurance Company in Trieste presented Shepheard with a golden snuffbox on 5 January as an expression of their appreciation for his efforts in suppressing \\"piratical enemies\\" in the upper Adriatic. On 18 February 1801, Pigmy captured the French privateer Adélaïde. Adélaïde had been a fishing trabaccolo before her conversion to privateer. She was armed with one 6-pounder and two 12-pounder guns, and had a crew of 51 men under the command of Dominique Cannilla. She was seven days out of Ancona and had taken one small prize. On 26 February Pigmy captured the Madona Turliana. Then on the morning of 16 March Pigmy was on the north side of \\"Isle Lonzo'\\" when she sighted and gave chase to another trabaccolo. About two hours later this vessel anchored near the \\"Isle Molata\\", hoisted French colours, fired one shot, and then struck. She proved to be the privateer Achille, of four 9-pounder and two brass 6-pounder guns. She had a crew of 44 men and was one day out of Ancona. She had not taken any prizes. On 17 April Corso and Pigmy captured the St Luigi. Pigmy was among the many vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture on 9 June of the Felicité and Josephine off Alexandria. The next day, Pigmy spoke with and warned Captain Benjamin Hallowell that a French squadron under Admiral Ganteaume had put to sea. Swiftsure and the French encountered each other on 24 June, with the result that Swiftsure was forced to strike. Because Pigmy served in the navy's Egyptian campaign between 8 March and 2 September, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants. On 18 September, Pigmy captured the Ottoman polacca St Michele. Pigmy shared with , , and the privateer Furioso in the proceeds of the capture on 2 October of the Bella Aurora. Shepheard commanded Pigmy until January 1803. He then transferred to take command of . His replacement was Lieutenant Martin White, who sailed Pigmy on the Guernsey station.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.79. White resigned his command of Pigmy in consequence of ill health,Naval Chronicle, Vol. 11, p.175. but in March 1804, White transferred to . His replacement on Pygmy was Lieutenant Samuel Burgess. Lieutenant William Smith replaced Burgess in 1805. Fate On 10 August 1805 Pigmy was wrecked in Saint Aubin, Jersey, but without loss of life. She was about an hour into her departure to start a cruise when she hit a rock. She was stuck on the rock and repeated attempts to free her were unsuccessful. As the tide ebbed yards were deployed to prevent her healing over, and anchors too with the intent of kedging her off once the tide returned. At the same time boats from other vessels came and took off her stores, guns, and ammunition. Lastly, her crew cut away her masts. As the tide returned it still proved impossible to free her and she started filling with water. Boats took off her crew and by 4pm she had disappeared beneath the water. The court martial of Smith, his officers, and crew took place in Portsmouth ten days later. The court martial board reprimanded the pilot, but honourably acquitted Smith, his officers, and crew.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 14, p.173.

Facts  The Law Society applied for a notice of motion to strike Windvogel's name from the roll of attorneys, because he had misappropriated funds entrusted to him as a curator bonis and had also failed to keep proper books of his trust account transactions. Windvogel had taken too long to enter his notice of intention to defend, and applied for postponement of the applications to have his name struck off the roll of lawyers, as well as the interdict for him to stop working.  Argument  At trial, Windvogel admitted to having been negligent and careless with his trust account transactions. He put forward all manner of excuses to explain why clients' money had found its way into his personal account.  Judgment  The court found that the question of fitness is a discretionary one. It found, therefore, that Windvogel was not a fit and proper person to be allowed to continue practising as an attorney. As to the issue of costs, the applicant sought an order for costs against the respondent on the scale as between an attorney and his own client. A court will not normally direct the precise method of taxation of costs, but will generally order costs to be taxed on a party-and-party or on an attorney-and-client scale. The court considered that an attorney-client cost order may be issued after considering the circumstances surrounding the case, the conduct of the losing party and whether the court finds it just to make such an order. The court considered cases from its division in the past in which it had awarded similar costs and held that \\"the reason for such a cost order is that the Law Society is a statutory body which obtains its funding from its members and if a member strays to the extent that it becomes necessary for the Law Society to apply for his removal or for his suspension, there is no reason why any of the members of the association to which the respondent belonged should be out of pocket as a result of his conduct.\\" Accordingly, the court ordered costs on an attorney-client basis. As to the issue of taxation, the court noted that, before the amount of an attorney-and-client bill can be recovered, it must first be taxed against that latter party. When the other party to the litigation is required to pay costs, the taxation will not be as generous as where an attorney's own client is to pay that attorney's costs.

Located on Depot Street, the station was first opened in 1843 with the construction of the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad, which had originally terminated at Goshen. The station was located along the New York Division, which stretched from Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey, to the Sparrowbush station just north of Port Jervis. The building was opened in 1896 to replace one that had been in use since 1843 when the New York and Erie began service to the city. The Romanesque Revival building was designed by George E. Archer, Chief Architect of the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad, later the Erie Railroad. The station saw service for trains going from Chicago to Erie's terminal in Jersey City, and later, as part of Erie Lackawanna Railway, service to Hoboken Terminal. The long distance train along this route was the Atlantic Express and Pacific Express in 1965.'Official Guide of the Railways,' June 1961, Table 3 The station also saw regular commuter service. The building served as a railroad station until 1983, when rail service was taken over by MTA's Metro-North Railroad. Service on the route of Erie's original Main Line was discontinued in favor of the Graham Line, an Erie-built freight line now used by Norfolk Southern and the Port Jervis Line and was replaced by the Middletown Metro-North station.

There had been no precedent dealing with the appellate jurisdiction of the court. This raised an issue of fundamental importance to all affected by the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act.Act 3 of 1996. The Land Claims Court must adapt its approach to costs orders to take into account factors which are peculiar to it.

Judgment  The court had that the LCC does not regard itself as bound to follow the usual approach of the superior courts in awarding costs. It will give due weight to the constitutional obligation to promote the fundamental right of access to the courts in such a way that legitimate litigants will not be deterred from approaching the court to have disputes settled for fear of an adverse cost order.

Plot Dagwood Bumstead is an architect who has managed to convince the prominent bank president Samuel Breckenridge to let his firm have the contract to erect a new bank building in town. When Dagwood’s boss at the architect firm, George Radcliffe, hears about the contract, he is ecstatic and offers Dagwood a modest raise of $2.50. When Dagwood immediately tell his wife Blondie the good news over the telephone, she mistakes the numbers and believes he has gotten a $250 raise. She tells her friends about the fantastic news, and word gets around that Dagwood has made a fortune on his success. A class reunion is around the corner and Blondie is on the committee planning the festivities. When the rest of the committee, including bigmouth housewife Cynthia Thompson and Paul Madison, who were Dagwood’s highschool suitor, hears about Dagwood’s fortune, they suggest he pay the bill of $400 for the fancy dinner at the reunion. Blondie has no choice but to accept to defend Dagwood’s honor. Dagwood panics when he hears what Blondie has promised in his name, and starts a desperate search for money to pay for the dinner he can’t afford. He sees no other alternative than to try to gamble up the money on the horse race track. He talks to a gambling expert named Pete Brody to learn how to bet, but the bank president hears about his keen interest in gambling and cancels the building contract immediately. Dagwood’s boss Radcliffe gets furious when he hears the contract is cancelled, and fires Dagwood on the spot because of this. Blondie helps out to raise money by making women’s hats, thus contributing with $200 to the bill, but when the day of the reunion dinner arrives, Dagwood is still short the other $200. He goes to an illegal gambling parlor and starts betting. He gets advice from an old lady, but still manages to bet the $200 from Blondie on the wrong horse. Despite this, he has good fortune and the horse wins, but the place is raided by the police. Dagwood helps the old lady escape unnoticed from the place, but is arrested by the police himself. The reunion dinner starts, and Blondie is present, but Dagwood is still in custody at the police station. He calls for Radcliffe to come and bail him out, but bank president Breckenridge beats him to it, arriving shortly after Radcliffe to the station. In company with Breckenridge is the old lady from the gambling parlor, who turns out to be Mrs. Breckenridge. Grateful for Dagwood's help to avoid a public scandal and humiliation, Breckenridge renews the contract to erect a new bank building with the firm, and as a condition he demands Dagwood be rehired. Dagwood throws in another condition for his own account - that Radcliffe pay for the reunion dinner as well. Dagwood gets out of jail and arrives to the reunion dinner in time to avoid any suspicion, and is able to pay for the festivities.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69097/Blondie-s-Holiday/ Cast * Penny Singleton as Blondie Bumstead * Arthur Lake as Dagwood Bumstead * Larry Simms as Alexander Bumstead * Marjorie Ann Mutchie as Cookie Bumstead * Daisy as Himself * Jerome Cowan as George M.

A biplane, it had aerodynamically thick wings which were originally cantilever structures, though interplane struts were later added. Only one was produced. Design and development The Letov Š-13 was designed as a cantilever biplane, its Zhukovsky airfoil wings thick enough in section to allow internal bracing. In other ways it much resembled the 1923 Letov Š-7. The wings, mounted with modest stagger, were straight edged with constant chord and blunt wingtips. The slightly broader chord upper wing was braced to the fuselage with a cabane, formed on each side by a forward parallel pair of struts from the mid- fuselage, and a rear inverted-V pair from the upper fuselage. Only the lower planes carried ailerons. Both the Š-7 and the Š-13 were powered by a Škoda licence-built Hispano-Suiza 8Fb, a water-cooled V-8 engine. Letov had experienced cooling problems with it in the Š-7 and so the ring-shaped radiator proposed originally for the Š-13 was dropped and replaced from the start with the transversely mounted, circular cross-section ventral radiator successfully tested on the modified Letov Š-7a. The Hispano drove a two-blade propeller with a domed spinner. Behind the engine, the fuselage had an oval cross-section, with the single open cockpit partially under the wing trailing edge which had a shallow cutout to enhance his view. The fuselage tapered rearwards to a point behind the tail control surfaces. The cropped, straight tapered horizontal tail was mounted on the fuselage centreline; the fin and rudder, larger than on the Š-7, were also straight edged. The Š-7 had a fixed, single-axle conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on cross-braced V-struts, assisted by a tailskid. The Letov Š-13 first flew in 1924 in cantilever configuration but during the early flight trials concern about wing strength led to its conversion into a single bay biplane by the addition of a pair of interplane struts. These were initially N-shaped but later changed to Vs. The trials demonstrated generally good handling characteristics but stability problems brought an end to development.

Facts  The appellants in two cases had had their homes sold in execution for debts of R250 and R190 respectively. The appellants applied in the High Court for orders setting aside the sales and executions, and interdicting two of the respondents from taking transfer of their homes. The basis of the applications was that the sale-in-execution process was unconstitutional. The High Court dismissed their argument, finding that the applicants could either vacate the premises or remain in occupation. If they chose to stay, the new owners would have to evict them according to in terms of the Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act and UOLA.  Argument  On appeal, the applicants claimed * that their constitutional right to adequate housings 26(1). was being infringed; * that the state and private parties should not interfere with this right; and * that certain assets of a debtor should be protected against execution, because without them it would be unduly difficult for the debtor to survive, or would render him permanently homeless. They argued that words should be read into section 67 of the MCA to prohibit sales in execution against houses below a particular minimum value.  Judgment  The court held that section 26 of the Constitution, guaranteeing the right to housing, needed to be read as a whole. It considered section 26(3), which stated that eviction would not occur without an order of court considering all of the circumstances relevant to the case. Read as a whole, the provision was in place to ensure that the state was striving to provide adequate access to housing for all and refraining from permitting people to be removed unless such could be justified. Any measure that permitted a person to be deprived of existing access to adequate housing, the court found, may be a justifiable limitation of the section-26 right, in terms of the limitation clause of the Constitution.s 36. The court also considered that the advantage that attached to a creditor who sought execution may be greatly outweighed by the immense prejudice and hardship caused to the debtor. Section 66(1)(a) of the MCA was so broad, the court found, that it permitted sales in execution of immovable property without judicial intervention, even where they were unjustifiable. This meant that the scheme was overbroad and unconstitutional. To remedy this, the provision was to be read as if the words \\"a court, after consideration of all relevant circumstances, may order execution\\" appeared before the words \\"against the immovable property of the other party.\\"  References  * Jaftha v Schoeman and Others, Van Rooyen v Stoltz and Others 2005 (1) BCLR 78 (CC).

For some time, the series was preceded on HSV-7's schedule by documentary series Australia Wide and followed by Gadget Man (which consisted of demonstrations of gadgets). On Australian television of the 1950s, music programmes were typically aired in a single city, with some exceptions.

It is in the Groote Schuur Hospital on Main Road. The hospital was founded in 1938 and is famous for being the institution where the first human heart transplant took place, conducted by University of Cape Town- educated surgeon Christiaan Barnard on the patient Louis Washkansky. The museum opened on December 3, 2007 marking the 40th anniversary of the heart transplant by Christiaan Barnard. First heart transplant 40th anniversary The Heart of Cape Town Museum honors everyone who played a major role in a surgical feat that created a new medical era. It also brings attention to ethical and moral implications that came up at the time. It also highlights the ways in which Barnard's accomplishment put South Africa and the University of Cape Town on an international stage.  Museum  The museum is laid out in the Old Main Building of the Groote Schuur Hospital in the original rooms where the first heart transplant surgery occurred. It utilizes the same operating theaters originally used in December 1967 when Denise Darvall and her mother were rushed into the hospital after being struck by a vehicle. The recipient of Darval's heart was Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer, suffering from diabetes and incurable heart disease. A two-hour guided tour provides insight into the donor of the heart, the recipient, the ethical and religious issues regarding \\"moment of death\\" and more. The guided tour of the museum starts with a representation of the car accident that provided the heart for the transplant, through to the animal lab where Barnard conducted experiments with over 50 dogs to perfect the technique of heart transplantation. From there one can tour a model of Denise Darvall's bedroom and Christiaan Barnard's office before seeing a recreation of the surgery in the actual operating theaters where it occurred. Finally, visitors see a re- creation of Louis Washkansky's recovery room after which they can be assisted by tour guides to register as organ donors. The museum also features a long hallway filled with letters of acclaim and criticism for Barnard showing the ethical backlash and international attention that the surgery received.

Overview The ruins consist of walls outlining a small five-sided building and a 150-metre wall with ditches, both made with flat-surfaced ironstone slate rocks on the slope of a hill overlooking the Bayers Lake Park. The mysterious ruins pose many unanswered questions for archaeologists. The most simple and humble explanation suggests a sheep pen, but some envision a military purpose, either a training installation or a defensive work. The walls are a protected archaeological site designated under Nova Scotia's Special Places Act. The site is included within the historic limits of one of the nine original Dutch Village grants issued in 1762 – a 150-acre grant assigned to Johann Gotlieb Shermuller. Schermuller sold the property in 1770 and moved to Philadelphia, where he became a butcher. The site changed hands many times after 1770. However, given its ground conditions, it is unlikely to ever have been farmed. The only structure on the property for which there is known documentary evidence is Feature 2. A 1918 map depicts a building standing in approximately the location of the site steps. (DMD 1918).Bayers Lake Historic Site: HRM Real Property Planning Archaeological Screening Advocacy In October 1990, Jack McNab contacted local media regarding this site, as it was about to be cleared for the newly developed Bayers Lake Business Park.Chronicle-Herald Saturday, November 10, 1990 by Parker Robinson His effort helped protect the area. In 2013 the Nova Scotia Archaeology Society set up a committee called Bayers Lake Walls Historical Site Advocacy, as a result of recent vandalism to the site. Research In December 1990, Davis Archaeological Consultants opened a single test unit within the sub- chamber, due to overnight freezing of the ground the excavation was not completed. The cultural material recovered was not a reflection of the true age of the structure and is viewed as intrusive material deposited long after the building was built.Davis 1990:3, Bayer's Lake Historical site BeCv-9 Bayer;s Lake Business archaelological screening - Final report From May 27 to June 5, 1998, a total of 118 artifacts were recovered from test units excavated at the entrance to the enclosure as part of the Saint Mary's University field school project. It was concluded that all material was deposited within the last 70–90 years.Dyke 1999:6 Bayer's Lake Historical site BeCv-9 Bayer;s Lake Business archaelological screening - Final report In December 1998, a lichenologist examined the masonry of the wall and identified patterns of lichen growth that indicated that the stonework had not been disturbed since around 1798.Dyke 1999:8 Bayer's Lake Historical site BeCv-9 Bayer's Lake Business archaelological screening - Final report On May 30, 2006, W. Bruce Stewart conducted photographic documentation of the physical condition of the known archaeological features. Precise mapping of these features was conducted on August 2, 2006, with the assistance of Greg Baker, Research Instrument Technician in the Maritime Provinces Spatial Analysis Research Centre at Saint Mary's University. A differential GPS unit was used to identify x y z coordinates for key anchor points on each of the major features within the Bayers Lake Historic Site. In March 2015, John Bignell submitted a document to area councilor Reg Rankin to discuss possibilities for further exploration, interpretation and protection of the site. The Bayers Lake Walls Heritage Site Advocacy Committee was tasked with the goal of developing a short term plan and long term plan to protect and stabilize the Bayer's Lake Historical (Mystery Walls) Site. On March 10, 2015, Regional council received an information report which resulted in a proposal being submitted to HRM and pasted on July 28. The funding approved will assist in the funding of an X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) system in order to analyze soil chemistry in and around the site, which will take about two days of fieldwork. In 2017, the site was examined with an X-ray fluorescence analyzer, but did not find elevated levels of phosphorus which would have been expected in the presence of human or animal urine or feces, bone, meat, fish or plants.

Lobo, the Conference initially catered for the basic needs of the Home. The responsibility of caring for the residents was entrusted to the Sisters of the Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King (F.M.C.K).

He was born in Karlskrona, and was son of the admiral and Minister for Naval Affairs, Carl August Ehrensvärd. Ehrensvärd left the Swedish Army in 1918 and joined the Finnish Army and saw action during the Finnish Civil War. Ehrensvärd rejoined the Swedish Army the same year and served until 1940 when he became general Ernst Linder's Chief of Staff during the Winter War as part of the Swedish Volunteer Corps. Back again in the Swedish Army, Ehrensvärd held positions such as Chief of the Defence Staff and Chief of the Army. He retired in 1957. Early life and family Ehrensvärd was born on 3 August 1892 in Karlskrona, Sweden, the son of Admiral, Count Carl August Ehrensvärd (1858–1944) and Baroness Lovisa Ulrika (Ulla), née Thott. He was the brother of Vice Admiral Gösta Ehrensvärd (1885–1973) and Deputy Director of the Ministry of Defence Augustin Ehrensvärd (1887–1968). He was the uncle of chemist Gösta Ehrensvärd (1910–1980). His great-grandfather was the fortress builder Augustin Ehrensvärd, his uncle was Albert Ehrensvärd and his cousin was Archibald Douglas, Ehrensvärd's predecessor on the Chief of the Army post. Military career After the studentexamen in 1911, Ehrensvärd became an officers volunteer in the Svea Life Guards (I 1) in 1911. He was the Queen's Page of Honour in 1912 and a cadet at the Royal Military Academy the same year. Ehrensvärd became a second lieutenant in the Svea Life Guards (I 1) in 1913 and became lieutenant there in 1915. He took part in the Åland Expedition as adjutant of the commanding officer of Åland Detachment in 1918 and resigned from the Swedish Army the same year and joined the Finnish Army where he commanded the Archipelago Free Corps (Skärgårdens frikår) and took part in battles in Åboland archipelago and southwestern Finland (Korpogård 28 March, Lohm 4 April and Loimaa 22 April). Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces Helge Jung (left) and Carl August Ehrensvärd. He was promoted to major in the Finnish Army in May 1918 and was then reinstatement in the Swedish Army as lieutenant in the Svea Life Guards (I 1) in September the same year. Ehrensvärd then attended the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1920 to 1922 and was a cadet of the General Staff from 1923 to 1925. He was staff adjutant and was promoted to captain of the General Staff in 1926 and served in the Svea Life Guards (I 1) in 1927 and was a teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1928 to 1934. Ehrensvärd was captain in the Svea Life Guards (I 1) in 1931 and staff adjutant and captain of the General Staff in 1932. He was major and chief adjutant of the General Staff in 1934 and in 1935. He was head of the Central Department of the General Staff from 1935 to 1937 and the Army Operations Department in the Defence Staff from 1937 to 1938. Ehrensvärd was major and chief adjutant in the General Staff Corps from April to July 1937 and was in October of that year promoted to lieutenant colonel and chief adjutant in the General Staff Corps. He was lieutenant colonel and commanding officer of the tank battalion at Göta Life Guards (I 2) from 1938 to 1939 and the tank battalion at Skaraborg Regiment (I 9) in 1939. Ehrensvärd was lieutenant colonel and Chief of Staff of the Swedish Volunteer Corps during the Winter War in Finland in 1940. There he took part in operations in Lapland during 1940. Ehrensvärd was promoted to colonel in the Finnish Army in 1940 and colonel in the Swedish Army the same year. He was head of the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1940 to 1941 and commanding officer of South Scania Infantry Regiment (I 7) from 1941 to 1942. Ehrensvärd was section chief in the Defence Staff from 1942 to 1944 and was promoted to major general and appointed acting Chief of the Defence Staff in 1944. He was Chief of Defence Staff from 1945 to 1947 and was military commander of the I Military District from 1947 to 1948. Ehrensvärd was promoted to lieutenant general and was appointed Chief of the Army in 1948. The year before, in 1947, a proposal to appoint pro-German colonel Alf Meyerhöffer as army infantry inspector led to the so-called \\"Meyerhöffer affair\\" when the proposal met with great opposition from the Social Democratic government. A compromise made Meyerhöffer acting infantry inspector in 1947. Following threats of resignation from Ehrensvärd's cousin and Chief of the Army, Archibald Douglas, Meyerhöffer was finally appointed cavalry and infantry inspector in 1949. The far more Western-friendly Ehrensvärd had been appointed Chief of the Army in 1948 which led Meyerhöffer into conflict with his new commanding officer and he therefore lodged his resignation in 1951. Ehrensvärd was intended to have become Supreme Commander but was rejected by Allan Vougt on the grounds that Ehrensvärd was better suited for war than peace. In 1956, Ehrensvärd appointed major Sigmund Ahnfeldt as UN battalion commander in Gaza. The government opposed the nomination because of Ahnfeldt's previous involvement in the Lindholm movement. Ahnfeldt had been Sven Olov Lindholm's closest man for six years and had at the age of 27 candidated for the National League of Sweden after Meyerhöffer at the municipal elections in Östersund. Ehrensvärd threatened to resign unless he got his way, according to prime minister Tage Erlander. Ahnfeldt was persuaded, however, by defence minister Torsten Nilsson to resign from the post. Ehrensvärd was Chief of the Army until 1957 when he was promoted to full general and transferred to the reserve. Other work Ehrensvärd was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences from 1935. Ehrensvärd had the military responsibility for the Swedish stay-behind operation which was organised starting from 1946. In the early 1960s, the secret documents from Operation Stella Polaris in 1944, were brought from Hörningsholm Castle and Rottneros Manor and burnt on the instruction of the then Director-General of the National Defence Radio Establishment, Gustaf Tham, and the now pensioned general Ehrensvärd. Personal life Ehrensvärd married the first time on 21 July 1922 in Lützow, Germany with countess Gisela Dorothée Anna-Luise Marianne Lilla von Bassewitz (20 December 1895 – 1946), the daughter of count Adolf Carl Otto Alexander Bassewitz-Behr and Dorothée Louise Helene Wanda Ebba Krell. He married a second time on 8 November 1947 in Malmö, Sweden with Svea Elisabeth Lachmann, née Olsson (born 15 June 1905), the daughter of carpenter Ola Olsson and Hanna Jönsson. Ehrensvärd was the father of Louise (born 30 June 1925 in Stockholm) and Jörgen (born 6 May 1932 in Stockholm). Ehrensvärd and his wife lived at Charlottenlund Castle. Ehrensvärd died on 24 April 1974 in Ystad and was buried at Tosterup cemetery.

The city council bought the land necessary in 1863-1864. It was bought from the private land owner Johan Fredrik Hultenheim. Today a stone memorial of J.F. Hultenheim can be found in the northern part of the park. Description The park was originally formed on three bogareas surrounded by smooth rocks of granite. From the elevated areas in the eastern park there are views over the port and the surrounding waters outside Oskarshamn. The northern part of the park mainly consists of open lawns surrounded by broadleaf trees, bushes and different types of flowers. In the middle of the park there is a public tennis court. The southern part of the park is dominated by pine trees and sparse populations of birch. Throughout the park there are smaller fountains and ponds. There are also a handful of bronze statues.

He attended Duke University as an undergraduate, receiving his Bachelor of Arts in Music in 1969. After receiving a Master of Fine Arts from Princeton University in 1971, he received a Fulbright Fellowship and embarked on his doctoral dissertation, Autograph Musical Documents of Hector Berlioz, c. 1818–1840. He joined the faculty of University of California, Davis as Acting Assistant Professor of Music in 1973 and the following year received his Ph.D. from Princeton. He remained at UC Davis for the rest of his academic career, becoming Professor of Music in 1981 and serving as the Chairman of the Music Department from 1980 to 1988.

Its gorges around Pokhara are a major attraction for tourists worldwide.  Geography  It rises from the base of the Annapurna massif, and flows south and south-east past Pokhara and Damauli to join the Trishuli River near Devghat. The lakes of Pokhara were created through a geological process. As the Seti river carried the moraine from Annapurna Himalayas after the burst of glacial lakes at various pre-historical time periods, the moraine were deposited on the routes of the rivers. This caused formation of natural lakes.  Cultural and Religious Significance  Seti is one of the holiest rivers of Nepal, worshiped in Hinduism as a form of Vishnu. The river is also famous because it is close to some Holy places and is the central point of many stories of Hindu mythology, such as the Mahabharata, one of longest books of Hinduism, written by Vyasa, who was born near the confluence of the Gandaki and Madi rivers near Damauli, Tanahun, Nepal.

This appeal from a decision in the Cape Provincial Division was heard in the Appellate Division by Corbett JA, Miller JA, Nicholas JA, Galgut AJA and Howard AJA on February 27, 1984, with judgment handed down on May 21, 1984. The appellant's attorneys were Spoor & Fisher, Pretoria, and Israel & A Sackstein, Bloemfontein. The respondent's attorneys were Scher Webner & Co, Cape Town, and Lovius, Block, Meltz, Steyn & Yazbek, Bloemfontein. The court found that a qualification was necessary to the general rule regarding final interdicts in motion proceedings. Sometimes the denial by the respondent of a fact alleged by the applicant may not be such as to raise a real, genuine or bona fide dispute of fact. If the respondent in such a case has failed to apply for the deponents concerned to be called for cross-examination, and if the court is satisfied as to the inherent credibility of the applicant's averments, the court may decide the disputed fact in the applicant's favour, without hearing oral evidence. This has come to be known as the \\"Plascon-Evans rule.\\"Peté and Hulme Civil Procedure 116, 133. When factual disputes arise, therefore, relief should be granted only if the facts stated by the respondent, together with the admitted facts in the applicant's affidavits, justify the order. The court noted there may be exceptions to this general rule, as where the allegations or denials are so far-fetched that the court is justified in rejecting them on the papers. It seemed to the court that the definition of \\"trade mark\\" in section 2 of the Trade Marks ActAct 62 of 1963. was not appropriate to infringement proceedings. It seemed also that the notional-user test, deployed by the courts to determine whether or not there has been an infringement of a trade mark, posed difficulties where the actual proven user fell outside of the ambit of the plaintiff's monopoly. The court found that the intention of the legislature in section 46(b) of the Act was to safeguard the use by the trader of words which were fairly descriptive of his goods and genuinely used for the purpose of describing the character and quality of those goods. Such use must not be a device for the achievement of some ulterior object.  Judgment  The rule was formulated in Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery Ltd v Stellenvale Winery (Pty) Ltd1957 (4) SA 234 (C).235E-G. that, where there is a dispute as to the facts, a final interdict should be granted in motion proceedings only if the facts as stated by the respondents, together with the admitted facts in the applicant's affidavit, justify such an order, or where it is clear that the facts, although not formally admitted, cannot be denied and must be regarded as admitted. The court in the present matter found that this required clarification and perhaps qualification. In certain cases the denial by the respondent of a fact alleged by the applicant may not be such as to raise a real, genuine or bona fide dispute of fact. If, in such a case, the respondent has not availed himself of his right to apply for the deponents concerned to be called for cross-examination under Rule 6(5)(g) of the Uniform Rules of Court, and the court is satisfied as to the inherent credibility of the applicant's factual averment, it may proceed on the basis of the correctness thereof and include this fact among those upon which it determines whether the applicant is entitled to the final relief which he seeks. There may be exceptions to this general rule, as where the allegations or denials of the respondent are so far-fetched or clearly untenable that the court is justified in rejecting them merely on the papers. It appeared to the court that, when considering whether or not an alleged infringer of the rights of the proprietor of a registered trade mark had unauthorisedly used a mark \\"as a trade mark\\" within the meaning of section 44(1)(a) of the Trade Marks Act, in certain situations problems would arise in the application of the statutory definition of \\"trade mark\\" in section 2 of the Act. It also appeared that the application of the notional-user test to determine infringement of a trade mark posed certain difficulties. If the actual proven user by the defendant fell outside the ambit of the plaintiff's monopoly, it could not be said that a notional fair and normal user of his mark, which had not in fact occurred, would trespass upon the plaintiff's monopoly. What the legislature intended to safeguard by means of the provisions of section 46 (b) of the Act was the use by a trader, in relation to his goods, of words, which are fairly descriptive of his goods, genuinely for the purpose of describing the character or quality of the goods. The use of the words must not be a mere device to secure some ulterior object, as for example where the words are used in order to take advantage of the goodwill attaching to the registered trade mark of another. The court held in casu that the use by the respondent, a dealer in paints and allied products, of the name \\"Mikacote\\" was an infringement of appellant's (also a dealer in paints) registered trade mark consisting of the word \\"Micatex.\\" The court held, furthermore, that the word \\"Mikacote\\" was not a word in ordinary use but a fancy name which was not a fair description of the character or quality of the paint which it sold and was accordingly not protected by the provisions of s 46 (b) of the Act. The decision of the full bench of the Cape Provincial Division, in Van Riebeeck Paints (Pty) Ltd v Plascon-Evans Paints (Pty) Ltd, was thus overruled.

Nieuwoudt, nicknamed \\"Notorious\\", was one of the most feared security policemen in the Eastern Cape for his interrogation methods including wet bags, poison, torture machines and often disguised himself as a priest, dubbing him the \\"Priest from hell\\".http://www.gowanusbooks.com/lady.htm Nieuwoudt had up to five hearings at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), in connection with the murders of numerous political activists.  Role in the murder of Steve Biko  Nieuwoudt was implicated in the murder of the anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, who was a leader in the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM). Nieuwoudt admitted to hitting Biko with a rubber hose, while he was being interrogated in a police office in Port Elizabeth. Nieuwoudt was denied amnesty by the TRC in 1999 for his role in the murder of Steve Biko.  Role in the murder of Siphiwe Mthimkhulu and Topsy Mdaka  In 1982, Nieuwoudt was granted amnesty by the TRC for his role in the abduction, torture and murder of student anti- apartheid activists Siphiwe Mthimkhulu and Topsy Mdaka who were members of the Congress of South African Students (COSAS), otherwise known as the \\"Cosas Two\\". Nieuwoudt was involved in burning and disposing of the bodies into the Fish River at Post Chalmers. Nieuwoudt, while serving his prison sentence underwent a religious conversion as a result of which he asked the Mthimkhulu family for forgiveness, for his involvement in Siphiwe's murder. In 1998, a documentary was shown on television in which Niewoudt, accompanied by a camera crew, approached the Mthimkhulu's house and asked for forgiveness. Through this footage, Nieuwoudt quickly became a recognizable face to television viewers.  Granted amnesty  Nieuwoudt confessed to having been involved in the abduction, beating and murder of the anti-apartheid activists Qaqawuli Godolozi, Champion Galela and Sipho Hashe in 1985, who belonged to the Port Elizabeth Civic Organisation (PEBCO), otherwise known as the Pebco Three. In 1999, Nieuwoudt along with Herman Barend Du Plessis, Johannes Martin Van Zyl and Gerhardus Johannes Lotz were denied amnesty for their role in the murder of The Pebco Three.  Role in the murder of the Motherwell Four  In 1989, Nieuwoudt along with Marthinus Ras and Wybrand du Toit were implicated in the killing of three black police officers Mbalala \\"Glen\\" Mgoduka, Amos Temba Faku, Desmond Daliwonga Mpipa and police informer Xolile Shepard Sakati in Motherwell. Nieuwoudt, Ras and du Toit planted a bomb in a car which blew up while the four police officers were driving. Nieuwoudt stated that the four police officers were killed because they had secretly joined the ANC. Niewoudt was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for the car bomb murder of what became known as the Motherwell Four.  Death  Nieuwoudt was awaiting the outcome for his amnesty application for the murder of the Motherwell Four at the time of his death in 2005 at the age of 54 in Port Elizabeth. Nieuwoudt died of lung cancer which had further spread to other organs in his body.

Attractive toxic sugar baits are manufactured from readily available, inexpensive ingredients in tropical and sub-tropical areas. They broadly consist of an oral toxic component, a sugar component to encourage feeding on the ATSB, and a scented component attractive to mosquitos or other target vectors. Typical ATSBs consist of boric acid as the oral toxin, unrefined cane sugar as the sugar source, and fruit, flowers, seeds and other scented material taken from local plants known to be popular feeding sources for mosquitos. Mosquitoes require sugar as their main source of energy. By mimicking the scent of sugar-providing plants that are naturally attractive to mosquitoes, it is possible to attract the mosquitoes to insecticide-laden traps. The traps can be set next to areas with significant mosquito populations (e.g., reservoirs, roadside drainage ponds and culverts). This use of traps attractive to mosquitoes prevents the need for indiscriminate insecticide spraying. Attractive toxic sugar bait sprayed on vegetation has been successful in controlling Anopheles mosquitoes in outdoor environments. Additionally, indoor ATSB shows promise as a supplement to mosquito nets for controlling mosquitoes. Indoor ATSB constitute a novel application method for insecticide classes that act as stomach poisons and have not hitherto been exploited for mosquito control. Combined with long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), indoor use of ATSB has the potential to serve as a strategy for managing insecticide resistance. Mortality rates of indoor ATSB were comparable to LLINs previously tested against the same species in the same area. Boric acid is only marginally more toxic to most lifeforms than normal table salt, with exposure in humans and other mammals widely regarded as being safe. Its use as an insecticide in malarial control (instead of compounds which demonstrate high levels of mammalian toxicity or carcinogenicity) is thus seen as advantageous. ATSBs can affect insects that are not the target. In one instance, bees collected sugar from attractive non-toxic sugar baits dyed with food coloring, and the honey they produced was a different color. To avoid killing bees, it has been suggested that the ATSBs could have nets to keep the bees out, while letting harmful insects to fall for the baits.

Madge, began writing the \\"Girl’s Gossip\\" column in Truth in 1893 and continued it throughout her career. Mrs. Humphry was one of the first female journalists to write a regular column devoted to women's issues. At the beginning of her career, there were very limited spaces devoted to women in newspapers and magazines. However, by the 1890s the idea of women making a career in journalism was considerably more acceptable than it had been thirty years previously. By then, women writers had become more visible in mainstream periodicals and specialist women's magazines. As Humphry herself commented in an interview for Women’s Life: :The scope of women’s work in the journalistic world is much greater now. When I first became a journalist only a few papers published ladies’ letters, and these dealt principally with domestic servants, the management of babies, and similar subjects. Now women go in for golf, bicycling, and other games; in fact, the athletic girl is a new development, and as woman’s world is widened, so is the field for women writers.Fraser, Hilary; Green, Stephanie; Johnston.

Ten years later, she married another newspaper writer, George Adam. The pair were correspondents in Paris during the First World War, where George Adam had been posted in 1912. There she edited International Cartoons of the War in 1916 and subsequently published her diary of the period under the title Paris Sees it Through. After the war, the couple remained in the city, where Pearl Adam met the writer Jean Rhys, allowing her to live in the Adams' flat, editing Rhys's first novel, Triple Sec, and introducing her to Ford Madox Ford. George Adam resigned from the Times in January 1921 but remained there working for American newspapers, while his wife wrote articles commissioned by the Evening Standard, the Observer and the Sunday Times, among others. They wrote together A Book about Paris (1927). George Adam died in Paris in 1930, and in the wake of this Pearl Adam returned to England where she continued her work, which included writing the History of the National Council of Women of Great Britain in 1945.

Esther's diary was found in an attic in 1975 and published as A Woman Doctor's Civil War: Esther Hill Hawks' Diary. It was edited by Gerald Schwartz and covers a period before the Hawks settled in Florida. Hawks was born on November 26, 1826 in Bradford, New Hampshire to Colburn and Clarissa Brown Hawks. He passed the teacher's exam at age 15, studied medicine two years later while teaching in Georgia and received his medical degree in 1847. Hawks was a doctor and staunch abolitionist in Manchester, New Hampshire until volunteering as a physician to treat freed black soldiers during the Civil War. In December 1861, he volunteered as a physician in South Carolina to treat escaped slaves in Sea Islands, South Carolina. He established a school for the freed blacks and \\"recruited most of the 33rd Colored Troops for the Union Army then served as their physician\\" and \\"was one of the first to urge emancipation of the slaves and to use them as soldiers.\\" He was appointed Assistant Surgeon with the rank of Major in the Union Army's 33rd Colored Troops. Hawks was then appointed Surgeon of the 21st Colored Troops and practiced in Jacksonville, Florida in 1872 after his service in the U.S. Civil War. He treated former slaves and freedmen, who he had also advocated for before the war. Hawks advocated for the creation of the first Freedman's Savings Bank. In 1865, he helped found the Florida Land and Lumber Company with other officers. The business provided homes and jobs for freed slaves. He named the business's settlement for freed blacks Port Orange, and some of the families remained in the area now known as Freemanville. Most of the homesteads were located north of Spruce Creek and northwest of the inlet, near Dunlawton. Its first post office was built in 1867 in what is now the town of Ponce Inlet and was moved a few miles north in 1868. Esther taught with the Freedmen's Aid Society and may have established the first integrated school in Florida. Sandy soil proved a challenge and corruption is believed to have caused supplies to be stolen before being delivered to the settlement which soon failed. A report found the colonists who remained in poor condition and surviving by eating coutee or coontie (the starchy roots of a native plant), palmetto cabbage and fish they caught. Esther continued teaching after the colony's decline, but in January 1869 a new schoolhouse was torched and in 1870 she returned to New England to practice medicine. Eighty-three blacks remained in the eastern part of Volusia County. Hawks planted an orange grove south of Port Orange on the Indian River and established Hawks Park in 1871, it was renamed Edgewater by the Florida State Legislature in 1924. Henry Tolliver, a successful black homesteader, and Hannah Tolliver owned land in the northwest corner of Port Orange. Some of the former colonists lived on their land in a community later dubbed Freemanville. Tolliver made molasses and grew corn, cotton, peas, beans and sweet potatoes. His wife made and sold clothing. Hawks died April 2, 1910, and was buried in Hawks Park Cemetery in Volusia County. It was later renamed Edgewater New Smyrna Cemetery and is located in what is now Edgewater, Florida at plot location Old North, Section 3. A monument to the couple is also located in Pine Grove Cemetery in Manchester, New Hampshire. In 1924 Hawks Park was renamed Edgewater.

The December 4, 1928 discovery opened the Oklahoma City Oil Field to extensive exploitation, creating an oil boom that sustained the area through the Great Depression. Because much of the oil was under the existing city, the Oklahoma City field pioneered the use of directional drilling to allow lateral displacement of well bores to reach deposits under developed areas. The well is located at the present-day intersection of SE 59th Street and Bryant Boulevard. It was drilled by the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company (ITIO). Beginning on June 12, 1928, the drilling crew drilled more than . In early December they broke through the Arbuckle Limestone layer, noting that the bottom of the formation was saturated with oil and was under gas pressure. Since they were drilling with a cable tool rig, the flow of gas and oil could not be controlled, and on December 4 the gas blew the tools out of the well. The well produced 110,000 barrels of oil during its first 27 days. However, the well began to produce water by the end of 1928 and was abandoned. The discovery well was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 9, 1977. The present site preserves the concrete drilling derrick foundations and the capped well head.

The film stars Max Minghella, JJ Feild, Eloise Mumford, and Christian Clemenson. Minghella stars as a paralegal who witnesses an unknown man (JJ Feild) murder a lawyer at his nearly empty workplace.  Plot  John Ferguson, a whistleblower at Denning, a major pharmaceutical company, becomes disillusioned with the perceived lack of action taken against the company, murders several executives, and commits suicide as the police enter the building. Tom Miller, a paralegal assigned to the Denning case, subsequently loses confidence in the scheduled trial against Denning, as Ferguson was their star witness. Miller's boss criticizes his idealism as financially unsound, and when Miller writes an unsolicited memo on an unrelated case on the Gambizzi crime family, Alan Emmerich, one the partners at the law firm, fires him. Roger, Miller's friend and a fellow paralegal, initially commiserates with Miller, but returns to the office in order to work late. Emmerich sends everyone else, including Miller's girlfriend, Anna, home early due to a technical problem with the firm's Internet access. As Miller leaves the building, he sees a man in a suit set down a briefcase. A different man then picks up the suitcase and enters an elevator. Curious, Miller follows the man with the briefcase, only to see him produce a pistol from the briefcase and murder Janine, a lawyer. Panicked, Miller hides from the killer in the bathroom, where he discovers the body of a security guard. When he alerts Roger to the danger, Roger objects to Miller's plan to save Emmerich, as Roger does not believe that Emmerich would do the same for them. Regardless, Miller instructs Roger to contact the authorities as he tries to find Emmerich. Before Roger can make the call, the killer finds and strangles him. As Miller's recharging cell phone chimes, the killer realizes that there are more people left in the building than he anticipated. Miller uses his knowledge of the building's security to evade capture and eventually discovers Emmerich in an office with a woman who Emmerich identifies as Lorraine Gambizzi. When the killer breaks into the room, Gambizzi grabs a pistol, but the killer is able to shoot her first. Not noticing Miller, who hides, the killer spares Emmerich's life and orders him to stay in the office. When the killer leaves, Miller surmises that the killer is a Gambizzi hitman sent to kill Lorraine, who was going to testify against her husband. With her death, Miller hopes the killer will leave. However, the killer attempts to gain entry into the record room, a reinforced vault that Miller and Emmerich use as a safe room. Using Miller's recharged cell phone, the killer draws Anna back to the building and taunts Miller with this fact. The killer takes Anna hostage as soon as she arrives. Drawn out of the vault, Miller attempts to trade his access card for Anna's life, but the killer reneges on the deal, wounding Emmerich as he shoots at them. Now with access to the records, the killer starts a fire, only to realize that Miller tricked him into accepting a fake access card. Locked in the vault as the records burn, he chokes and falls unconscious. Miller enters the room to extinguish the fire, after which he realizes that the killer has recovered. As the killer beats Miller, Anna knocks him out with a fire extinguisher. Emmerich recovers the killer's pistol and fatally injures him. Before he dies, the killer whispers a code to Miller. Curious about the killer's last words, Miller investigates further and discovers that Denning likely targeted Roger for assassination because of his own whistleblowing about how the law firm was intending to throw the Denning case. When he confronts Emmerich, Emmerich begs him to destroy the evidence, as Emmerich believes the pharmaceutical company to be more powerful and ruthless than any crime family. When Miller refuses, Emmerich commits suicide. As Miller and Anna leave the building, the killer's earlier accomplice, now revealed to be a police officer, alerts his superiors, and a hitman outside the building radios that he has visual confirmation of Miller.

W. Myers in 1904 John W. Myers (c. 1864 - c. 1919?), who was usually credited as J. W. Myers, was a Welsh-born baritone singer, who recorded widely in the United States between the early 1890s and early 1917. His recordings, including \\"Two Little Girls in Blue\\" (1893), \\"The Sidewalks of New York\\" (1895), \\"Just Tell Them That You Saw Me\\" (1895), \\"When You Were Sweet Sixteen\\" (1901), \\"On a Sunday Afternoon\\" (1902), \\"Way Down In Old Indiana\\" (1902), and \\"In the Good Old Summer Time\\" (1902), were among the most popular of the period. Biography Little is known of his life, although he is believed to have been born in Wales and emigrated to the US at the age of 12 in the 1870s. He worked at various jobs before becoming a theatre manager in New York City. By 1892, he was identified as an already seasoned recording artist, suggesting that he may have first recorded as early as 1890.Biography by Uncle Dave Lewis at Allmusic.com. Retrieved 9 May 2013Myers, J.W., at Last.fm. Retrieved 9 May 2013 His first successful recordings were in 1892. He became regarded as \\"the foremost baritone ballad singer of his era\\", and over his career he recorded probably hundreds of songs for many phonograph cylinder recording companies, including New Jersey Phonograph, later known as United States Phonograph, Edison, Columbia, Berliner, and Victor. In 1895 he resigned from his position in the theatre in order to join a touring opera, and in 1896 set up his own short-lived cylinder company, the Globe Talking Machine Company. Many of his recordings after 1900 were for Columbia Records. He also continued to record for Victor, Edison and Leeds & Catlin. Several were of songs made popular in Broadway musicals, such as \\"In the Good Old Summer Time\\" from The Defender, while others such as \\"Come Take A Trip In My Air-Ship\\" referenced modern technology. After 1907, Myers' recording activity diminished. He invested in another recording company, the U.S. Everlasting Cylinder Company of Cleveland, Ohio, and recorded three cylinders for them, released in the first half of 1912. The listings refer to his recent concert tour, Canadian tour and eastern US vaudeville tour. He recorded at least four vertical discs for Rex Records in 1913-14. His last record for Columbia, Along the Yukon Trail, was issued in December 1914. In 1916-17 he recorded four titles for Victor H. Emerson's new Emerson records. He must have known Victor Emerson back in the early 1990s when he was head of the New Jersey Cylinder recording studio. The last known recording is 'War Song Medley'. His life after that time is unknown; researcher Jim Walsh suggested that he may have died around 1919, although it is also possible that he returned to Wales. References External links * J. W.

The DAB service of Kisstory was rolled out to more areas of the country at the start of 2015, replacing Absolute Radio 60s in some areas (including Bauer's owned digital multiplexes in northern England) and added in new space on others; this formed part of a wider reshuffle of Bauer's digital offering, which also included the withdrawal of Kerrang! Radio from areas outside London, and the launch of Magic 105.4 FM as a national station over Digital One. Following the expanded rollout, the Kisstory station was available in areas including London, Birmingham, Cambridge, Dundee and Perth, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Humberside, Central Lancashire, Leeds, Liverpool, Kent, Northern Ireland, Nottingham, South Yorkshire, Stoke-on-Trent, Sussex, Swansea, Teesside and Tyne and Wear. From 29 February 2016 the Kisstory station was made available in DAB more widely across the UK with the launch of the second national commercial DAB multiplex, Sound Digital. Some of the local-level DAB slots vacated by Kisstory were taken over by sister station KissFresh, principally in those areas where Bauer operated or co-operated the local DAB ensemble. On 11 February 2019, Kisstory migrated from SDL to the more widely available Digital One multiplex, taking up the space vacated by Absolute Radio 90s moving in the other direction a week prior.\\"Kisstory to replace Absolute 90s on Digital One\\", RadioToday.co.uk Norway In February 2016, Kisstory was launched in Norway The station (which does not have any presenters/DJs, just non-stop music) is managed by local teams and is broadcast with Kiss in DAB+ (48 kbit/s).

The Vatican Historical Museum () is one of the sections of the Vatican Museums. It was founded in 1973 at the behest of Pope Paul VI, and was initially hosted in environments under the Square Garden. In 1987 it was moved to the main floor of the Apostolic Palace of the Lateran and opened in March 1991. The Vatican Historical Museum has a unique collection of portraits of the Popes from the sixteenth century to date, the memorable items of the Papal Military Corps of the 16–17th centuries and old religious paraphernalia related to rituals of the papacy. Also on display on the lower floor are the papamobili (Popemobiles); carriages and motorcars of Popes and Cardinals, including the first cars used by Popes. Layout The Lateran Palace, which is next to the Basilica of Saint John Lateran to its left within the courtyard of the church with a common entry gate, is a large apartment complex of the Pope. Domenico Fontana was the architect of this palace which was built to his design in 1586. Right at the entrance the staircase is a massive and impressive structure with the ceiling decorated with frescoes. It had been refurbished by Pope Paul IV into ten halls; each of these halls had frescoes of the Mannerist Age. The hall known as the Conciliation, and was provided with allegories related to the papacy of Sixtus V. The other halls were named Constantine, Hall of Apostles, Emperors Room, Popes Room and so forth. The fresco decorations were on themes of the History of Rome, episodes of the Bible related to Daniel, David, Solomon, Samuel and others, and also related to the Gospel. Several colourful tapestries and Gobelins added to the aesthetic elegance of the halls. Before the History Museum decided to relocate here to a more luxurious locale, none of the rooms had been allowed to be used for any general public purpose. Since 1991, these rooms have been exclusively used as exhibition or display rooms for the exhibits moved from the Vatican Museums. Exhibits The museum has been arranged into two wings. The principal wing is the museum of all artistic and historic importance starting with the paintings of the history of the Papal States, portraits of Popes till date, memorabilia of the Papal Military Corps including the navy, documents related to ceremonial orders of Popes, the Papal household items, and various ceremonial regalia and religious vessels and insignia not in use. The second wing is an annex wing on the ground floor where the papamobili are on display; these consist of decorated carriages, saddles, sedans, wagons and the first cars used by the Popes.

Originally intended as a biplane fighter, it was later modified into a monoplane and entered as a contestant in a speed competition. Design and development The Letov Š-14 was designed alongside the Letov Š-13, sharing its Škoda licence-built 300 hp (224 kW) Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled V-8 engine but not its thick airfoil wings. Like the Š-13, it was intended as a single-seat biplane fighter aircraft. It was of mixed construction, with wooden wings and a metal-framed fuselage. The wings, mounted without stagger, were straight edged with a constant chord and blunt wingtips. It was a single bay biplane with a pair of interplane struts on each side. These were straight and near parallel, but converged a little towards the narrower chord lower wing. The upper wing was braced to the fuselage with a cabane immediately ahead of the open cockpit, situated below the wing trailing edge. The Hispano drove a two-blade propeller with a pointed spinner; it was cooled by a rectangular radiator on each side of the fuselage between the wings. The fuselage was flat sided with rounded decking, tapering aft to the mid-mounted tailplane, where the vertical tail was broad and low. The Š-14 landed on a fixed conventional tailskid undercarriage. The Š-14 first flew in 1924 but Letov quickly decided to concentrate their fighter development efforts on the Letov Š-20 which flew the following year. Instead, the Š-14 was rebuilt as a cantilever monoplane to take part in the Third Speed Contest of 1924. At that event it recorded a speed of .

Composition Rock Drill comprises a plaster figure perched on top of an actual rock drill. The combination of an industrial rock drill and the carved plaster figure makes the artwork an example of a \\"Readymade\\" created at the same time as Marcel Duchamp's Bicycle Wheel (1913). A 1974 reconstruction, by Ken Cook and Ann Christopher, is part of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery's collection. Rock Drill has been heralded as embodying the spirit of \\"radical Modernism more dramatically than any other sculpture, English or continental, then or since\\". Jacob Epstein (1880–1959) was an American-born sculptor who had moved to Europe in 1902, and taken British citizenship in 1911. Although Epstein was not officially a member of the Vorticists, not having signed the Vorticist Manifesto, the full-figure sculpture has also been hailed as the pinnacle of Vorticist art. Originally a positive statement, Rock Drill stood as a celebration of modern machinery and masculine virility. Wyndham Lewis described the sculpture as 'one of the best things he [Epstein] has done. The nerve-like figure perched on the machinery, with its straining to one purpose, is a vivid illustration of the greatest function of life.' In 1940, however, recalling the horrors of the 1914–18 war in the context of the Second World War, Epstein reinterpreted the sculpture much more negatively: Study Study for Rock Drill (c. 1913) is a × charcoal drawing by Epstein which is part of The Garman Ryan Collection at The New Art Gallery Walsall.The New Art Gallery Walsall catalogue; accession number 1973.072.GR Whilst the exact date of the sketch is unknown, because it is a preparatory study for Epstein's full sculpture Rock Drill, it has been dated to 1913.  Torso in Metal  Torso in Metal, at Tate Britain Epstein dismantled the original sculpture: he sold the drill and truncated the figure. When he exhibited the radically transformed Torso in Metal from Rock Drill in 1916, he had evidently turned his back on his ‘experimental pre-war days of 1913'. In contrast to the power and virility exuded by the full-figure, the truncated version appears defenceless and melancholic, evocative of the wounded soldiers who were returning home from the trenches in startling numbers. Torso in Metal from Rock Drill is now at Tate Britain, London.  Legacy  The 1974 reproduction, at Birmingham Epstein's dismantling of Rock Drill and truncation of the abstracted male form marks a crucial turning point in his career, signalling the end of his engagement with the machine age. Although Epstein destroyed the original sculpture, since its reconstruction in 1974, Rock Drill has been heralded as representing 'a dramatic, revolutionary moment when sculpture in Britain first became uncompromisingly modern.' Epstein had a long and successful career in Britain, working in less radical styles, and notable for portrait busts and architectural sculptures. The final Sensational Alex Harvey Band studio album, 1978's Rock Drill, was named for and influenced by the sculpture. Its cover depicts the Torso. In September 2006, Tate Modern asked a number of contemporary musicians to compose music about a piece of their choosing from the gallery's collection, under the project name Tate Tracks. The Chemical Brothers recorded \\"Rock Drill\\", inspired by Torso..., and this could be heard on headphones next to the sculpture. From October 2006, it also became available for a while, on the Tate Tracks website. Comparisons have been drawn between the sculpture and the Star Wars character General Grievous and his battle droids.

It was created in May 1991 and registered in Belgium as a non-governmental, non- profit making organisation.  History  In May 1991 the representatives of 15 European universities met in the University of Bristol (UK) to discuss the theme \\"Towards a European Universities Continuing Education Network\\". The represented universities were: Aalborg (DK), Aarhus (DK), Bordeaux (FR), Bristol (UK), Cambridge (UK), Exeter (UK), Galway (IE), Granada (ES), Hanover (DE), Leiden (NL), Liege (BE), Porto (PT), Oxford (UK), Pavia (IT) and Valladolid (ES). The participants at this initial meeting were invited to become the initial Full Members of eucen. The group decided that the main activities of eucen would be the exchange of information on strategies, regulations and techniques, establishing objectives and drawing up plans to meet them, enhancing international contacts, working towards setting standards of quality, agreeing routes to credit transfer and aiming at internationally recognised qualifications through Continuing Education. It was also agreed that an important role for eucen would be to inform policy makers and encourage them to decide on and set goals for Continuing Education development for the year 2000. New members were accepted for first time in eucen's history at the General Assembly in Barcelona in May 1993. From that date, the number of partners and countries involved progressively increased. eucen decided to have two conferences per year and started developing important European projects (for example, TheNUCE). In May 2000, the Association made a radical change in its organisation, appointing professional staff and establishing the eucen's Secretariat in Barcelona (ES). In the following years, eucen evolved from being a volunteering network into becoming a wide European multidisciplinary network trying to bring consistency to the concept of University Lifelong Learning. 2004's Professions, Competence And Informal Learning wrote that as an organization eucen was \\"especially prolific in publication terms\\" and that their conference papers were particularly useful as review on European issues of continuing education, concluding that eucen had \\"opened up the European professional development research community to news of the rapid changes in the field arising from the deep-seated political, social, economic and educational transformations of these former Communist countries in the past 15 years.\\" By 2009, eucen had representative organizations and universities from around 40 countries. Governance and organisation According to eucen's current statutes, the General Assembly comprising the full members of the association is the supreme governing body of eucen. To manage the business of the association, the general assembly elects a steering committee, which is responsible to the assembly.

Since the second edition published in 1819, it has been recorded as Tale no. 112. It is Aarne–Thompson type AT 1889K, A Rope Made of Chaff. Synopsis The tale begins with a peasant tilling his fields with a pair of oxen. Inexplicably, while in the field, the oxen's horns grew to an extraordinary size; an effect that prevented the peasant from returning home with them. Fortunately, the peasant was able to sell the oxen to a nearby butcher. The butcher, having no currency on him, bartered a measure of turnip-seed with the peasant, offering should the peasant return to him with the measure of rapeseed he would exchange a Brabant thaler for each seed. The peasant returned home with the seed, however, he lost one seed out of the bag on the way. The next day, the butcher paid him per agreement minus the one missing seed. On his way back from the butcher, the peasant passed where he dropped the seed and saw it had sprouted into a tree which reached up to the heavens. The peasant climbed the tree and, reaching the top, spied angels threshing oats. While he was viewing the angels, the tree began to shake; someone below was cutting down the tree. To save himself from being falling from the tree, the peasant wove a length of rope from the oat chaff that lay in piles. Before descending he stole a hoe and a flail which were lying in the heavenly fields. He descended the rope only to find himself at the bottom of deep pit. Using the hoe, he carved a flight of steps and walked up and out of the pit. The peasant kept the flail as proof of his adventure.

In 2012, Sarsak spent three months on hunger strike while imprisoned in Israel without trial or charges. Israel had accused him of being active in Islamic Jihad, an accusation which he denied. Sarsak was released from prison on 10 July 2012, after being held for three years without formal charges. Football career As a child, Sarsak's heroes includes Alessandro Del Piero, Frank Lampard and Zinedine Zidane. He played regularly for the Palestinian Olympic football team and twice for the Palestinian national team, competing against China and Iraq. In 2013 Sarsak said he hoped to return to the national team in the future. Detention and hunger strike Sarsak was arrested on 22 July 2009 at the Erez Crossing, while travelling between his home in Gaza and the West Bank to link up with his new club Balata Youth in Balata. He was detained for allegedly being an unlawful combatant linked to the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine (PIJ). The Shin Bet general security service alleged that he had once planted a bomb that injured an Israeli soldier. The agency said it did not have sufficient evidence for a trial and Sarsak was held for three years without formal charges. In 2013 Sarsak said that during his imprisonment he had been regularly subjected to physical and mental torture. He began his hunger strike on 19 March 2012, after his administrative detention was renewed for the sixth time. His decision to begin a hunger strike was a response to the death of Zakaria Issa, a Palestinian international football player who died shortly after being released. He received on-off intravenous drips throughout his strike, and on 14 May rejected a deal which ended a month-long hunger strike by other Palestinian prisoners. He insisted on being given prisoner-of-war status, on account of his having been detained under Israel's Unlawful Combatants Law; and refused an offer from Israeli authorities under which he would be exiled to Norway for three months. During his strike, Sarsak lost nearly half his usual weight. Palestinian officials and doctors said on 14 June that Sarsak had resumed drinking milk after meeting with Israeli officials. On 18 June, Sarsak's lawyer said he had agreed a deal to end his hunger strike in return for being released on July 10. He was freed 97 days after beginning his hunger strike. Response On 5 June 2012, campaigners in London staged a series of protests aimed to draw attention to Sarsak's cause. He became a cause célèbre for football fans including Celtic F.C.'s Green Brigade. On 8 June 2012 FIFPro, which represents professional footballers from across the globe, called for his immediate release. This was followed by similar calls from Eric Cantona, Frédéric Kanouté, UEFA President Michel Platini, FIFA President Sepp Blatter. He also received support from footballers Abou Diaby and Lilian Thuram. Outside of football, film director Ken Loach and author Noam Chomsky also requested his release. On 14 June, Amnesty International called for Sarsak to be admitted to hospital or released, saying he had been denied proper access to medical treatment, which they argued amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. The Palestinian Football Federation (PFF) asked UEFA to remove Israel as hosts of the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship in response to its detention of Sarsak, which the PFF described as being in \\"direct violation of Fifa regulations\\". Platini rejected the request and rebuked the PFF for lobbying against Israel. Blatter and International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge supported Platini's decision. Release and reaction On 10 July 2012, Israel released Sarsak from prison. On his arrival in Gaza, he was greeted with a welcoming ceremony, at which dozens of PIJ members fired rifles in the air. Senior PIJ members were present at the ceremony, and Nafez Azzam, one of the group's leaders, described Sarsak as \\"one of our noble members.\\" Women also waved black PIJ banners from nearby homes. Streets were decorated with huge photos of Sarsak, and after emerging from his car, Sarsak was hoisted up on shoulders and kissed and embraced by friends and family. Sarsak stated, \\"This is a victory for the prisoners and I thank all the Palestinian, Arab and international bodies and people who stood up for me\\". =Response= Following his release, Amnesty International expressed \\"relief\\" and called on Israel to end the use of administrative detention. FIFPro, the official representative organisation for all professional footballers, also celebrated Sarsak's release, stating \\"We, FIFPro, the representative of all professional footballers worldwide, expect that every footballer worldwide must be able to play for his country; be it Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo or Mahmoud al-Sarsak. It is written down in the FIFA regulations that all players must be allowed to play for their country.\\"FIFPro salutes Mahmoud al-Sarsak as a free man. FIFPro News. 2012-07-10. The PIJ issued a statement declaring Sarsak's release as \\"a victory of will, determination and steadfastness.\\" Life after detention Since his release Sarsak has sought to raise awareness of persecution of Palestinian football players by the Israeli government, and to oppose Israel's hosting of the Under-21 Championship.

It was the artist's first solo single release after leaving the band Ultravox and the first single release from the Metamatic album, which was released shortly after. The song typically features music made using synthesisers and electronic percussion only, and the vocal in the verses is delivered in a cold robotic style by Foxx, with an anthemic single word chorus. The lyrics feature Ballardian themes such as memory, architecture, dystopia and cars. There are no great differences in length or content between the album and single version, although an extended version did emerge years later and was used as the opening track on the Metatronic compilation album in 2010. The single reached no. 31 in the UK charts and was performed by Foxx with three keyboard players on UK music show Top of the Pops. A promotional video for the song was also made. \\"Underpass\\" is featured on all John Foxx's compilation albums Assembly (1982), Modern Art - The Best of John Foxx (2001), Glimmer - Best of John Foxx (2008) and Metatronic (2010). The latter features the extended version and a new remix by Mark Reeder. Single release track listings 7\\" single disc VS-318 # \\"Underpass\\" # \\"Film One\\" Film One The B side of the \\"Underpass\\" single is given as \\"Film 1\\" on the sleeve but as \\"Film One\\" on the label. The track did not feature on the Metamatic album but was included on later CD re-releases of the album in 1993 (track 12), 2001 (track 11) and 2010 (disc 2, track 1). It is an instrumental and was used by Alex Proyas as the soundtrack to his short film Parallel Lives featured during a live performance of John Foxx And The Maths at The Roundhouse in London in 2010. \\"Film One\\" was also used as introduction music during the live performance of \\"Metamatic\\" performed by John Foxx and Louis Gordon in 2007, as documented on the live album A New Kind Of Man (2008). 12-inch promo A 12-inch only promo disc for \\"Underpass\\" was also produced with cat no. VDJ 31. The version of \\"Underpass\\" is a standard 3:46 edit, although the B side was the Metamatic track \\"He's A Liquid\\", although a different mix from the album version. This version resurfaced much later on the 2001 compilation album Modern Art and on the 2007 \\"definitive\\" re-issue of Metamatic, listed as an \\"alternative version\\". Overpass Foxx repurposed and re-styled the song during his live shows with Louis Gordon in 1997 giving it the new title of \\"Overpass\\". The song takes the lyric of the original verses although the single word \\"underpass!\\" chorus is replaced by \\"overpass!\\". The track can be heard on the live EP Exotour (1997), also released on CD as The Omnidelic Exotour and Retro Future (2007, recorded live in Shrewsbury, 1998). In the sleevnotes to The Omnidelic Exotour CD Foxx writes for \\"Overpass\\" \\"This was the original title. How I felt when I came back from the war.\\" Foxx and Gordon later reverted to playing the \\"standard\\" version of \\"Underpass\\" live, as documented on Live From A Room (As Big As A City) (2006). Remixes Mark Reeder The track was remixed by Mark Reeder as a bonus track on the John Foxx retrospective Metatronic compilation album. Three different remixes were issued as mp3 download only # Underpass (Mark Reeder's Sinister Subway Radio Remix) (4:07) # Underpass (Mark Reeder's Sinister Subway Remix) (6:24) # Underpass (Mark Reeder's Dark, Long And Sinister Remix) (10:05) The remixes feature additional bass guitar played by Reeder himself. \\"Underpass (Mark Reeder's Sinister Subway Remix Edit)\\" (4:08) was issued on Reeder's 2011 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround remix DVD 2013 vinyl issue A special limited- edition 12-inch vinyl-only issue featuring two new remixes of \\"Underpass\\" was announced for released on Record Store Day, 20 April 2013. The release was, however, delayed and was eventually released on 27 May 2013. This special 12-inch single is limited to 500 numbered copies worldwide, and features new artwork created by Jonathan Barnbrook. # Side A Underpass (_UNSUBSCRIBE_ REMAKE MIX) (by Dave Clarke and Mr Jones) # Side AA Underpass (Oh The Gilt Mix) (by John Tatlock and John Doran) The \\"Oh The Gilt Mix\\" was played for the first time by John Doran on the BBC 6 Music programme Now Playing in September 2012. Doran described the tracks as being \\"Like J G Ballard with a disco ball\\". The remix was featured in The Quietus in April 2013 and published on The Quietus' soundcloud page. there are no plans to make the two mixes of \\"Underpass\\" featured on this release available elsewhere, except on the CD which is included as part of the VIP Packages for John Foxx And The Maths live shows in April, May and June 2013. Promo video A promotional video for \\"Underpass\\" was produced by Virgin at the time of the single release. It featured Foxx dressed in suit, tie and overcoat roaming a post-apocalyptic basement with neon light tubes, two keyboard players and two abandoned young children while a black and white film is being projected onto a suspended screen. The film of Foxx roaming the basement miming the lyrics to the song is interspersed with a mysterious telephone receiver dangling in a park and footage of underpasses, overpasses and urban highways. A revised 'black and white' version of the video was included on the DVD of the Metatronic compilation album (2010). A revised version was also made by Karborn for the same DVD to accompany \\"Mark Reeder’s Sinister Subway Mix\\". This digitally restored version also contains footage from the promo video for the successive John Foxx single \\"No-One Driving\\" (1980). A live version of \\"Underpass\\" performed by John Foxx and the Maths is included on the Analogue Circuit DVD (2013) and shows specially prepared video footage and imagery by Jonathan Barnbrook.

It is the main source of income for many in the islands and Vanuatu's biggest export. According to 2009 figures, approximately 77% of households in Vanuatu are involved in fishing activity. According to 2005 figures, Vanuatu caught 151,080 fish in that year, with frozen fish accounted for half of Vanuatu's commodity exports. Geography Vanuatu has 83 islands separated by great depths in the Pacific Ocean. Situated geologically at the edge of the Pacific Plate, the islands' land masses rise to heights of 5 m above the surface, with their bottoms at depths of 1000 m within a distance of 1 km from the coast (they are termed undersea mountains). This situation has created a very congenial setting for pelagic or open water fishing, close to the coastline of the country. Aqua fauna The coastal areas offshore of the Vanuatau islands are home to many species of fish. Some of the key species are billfish, including broad bill swordfish, short bill spearfish, sailfish, and striped, black and blue marlin, as well as yellowfin tuna, mahi-mahi, wahoo, Spanish mackerel, dogtooth tuna, coral trout, jobfish redbass, Watson's bonitofish, dolphinfish, sharks, Skipjack Tuna, and rainbow runners. The industry Ferries in Vanuatu According to 2009 figures, approximately 77% of households in Vanuatu are involved in fishing activity. According to 2005 figures, Vanuatu caught 151,080 fish in that year, with frozen fish accounted for half of the country's commodity exports. Commercial fishing in Vanuatu is done by both locally based deep-bottom fish and sport-fishing charter boats for deep-bottom hand-line fishing and trawling for pelagic species. Apart from small islands, the principal sites for subsistence and coastal commercial fishing are Port Vila, Luganville, Santo, and Malekula islands. Port Vila is the port of greatest commercial importance, with the majority of the produce of commercial produce passing through the port. In 1999, around 80% of all commercial catches (180 tonnes) were landed here; subsistence fishing, which totalled 2,700 tonnes, did not pass through any major port in particular. According to FAO reports of 1999, the landings of subsistence and Coastal commercial fishing was of the order of 2700 metric tons and 230 metric tons respectively. The catches are unloaded mainly in Port Vila. In addition, foreign based vessels have also operated with catches of 118 metric tons, reported during 2000. Estimates of consumption of fish in the Vanavatu in recent years indicate a consumption level in the range of 15.9 to 25.7 kg per person per year. Considering an increase in population between 1999 and 2025, the estimated fish requirement is of 7,500 mt for 2025. Aquaculture is also important and Vanuatu has many aqua farms. With the wild stock of Giant clams exhausted, the country has looked for investors in the farming of the species. The government is prepared to offer tax breaks for overseas investors in this industry, as well as in the culture of shrimps. Other opportunities for fish- farming that are being considered include Shrimp, as well as Milk Fish, Prawns, Oysters, and Mullet. Management and legislation The fisheries in Vanuatu are managed by the Department of Fisheries under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act No. 2 of 1989, although this act has since been revised. Detailed Legal Acts such as Fisheries Act (1982), Maritime Zones Act 1981 and related Fisheries Regulations 1983 and many other supplementary legislation for commercial fishing both by local and foreign vessels have been enacted and are in force. All marine activities in Vanuatu must comply with the law, which includes acquiring a fishing license from the department. Since 1983, Vanuatu has participated in the Artisanal Fishing and Subsistence program in cooperation with the Fisheries Department and ORSTOM. Since 1990, there has been a return towards closing certain fishing areas or voluntarily refusing to catch certain species at various times of year in order to promote conservation and increase fish stocks. As of 2007 a license costs $11,000 dollars a year. In attempting to promote sustainable development and to cooperate with other fisheries in the Pacific region, the government is reviewing an aquaculture development plan and a Tuna Management Plan or National Policy for Tuna Fisheries with assistance from the Canadian South Pacific Oceanic Development Program (CSPOD). Under the Tuna Management Plan, the Fisheries Department, the Vanuatu Maritime Authority (VMA), the Police Maritime Wing, and the State Law Office have been entrusted with the responsibility of enforcing the tuna management plan. The commercial fisheries is according to the defined management plans while in the case of subsistence and village based fisheries the management responsibility is entrusted to the local communities. Sport fishing The Department of Customs is responsible for game and sporting boats operating in Vanuatu. Sport fishing in the country has undergone much investment in recent years to promote tourism. Game and reef fishing packages include hi-tech equipment, with day trip or liveaboard options. When sport fishing for dogtooth, yellowfin tuna, or wahoo, the catch is either tagged and released or provided to local villagers. Other fishing options include prawns and eels in the rivers, spear-fishing for green jobfish, diving for crayfish; or traveling to the crater lakes for prawns and eels. Role of women Women play a proactive role in fishing operations, along with men, mostly in the shallow near-shore waters. They work in harvesting inshore fish as an essential subsistence requirement. With the use of gilnets, they catch Mangrou, which is in demand and also sea cucumbers, mudcrabs and mangrove oysters. In a few islands, they are also involved in diving to catch trochus. As a part of commercial sale of fish, its products and fish gear, which is their exclusive forte they are involved in collecting seashells, catching coconut crabs, trapping lobsters and processing bêche-de- mer. In the male dominated society their role is not given equal recognition.

Blake wrote her classic text, The Child, His Parents and the Nurse, in 1954. She co-authored two other pediatric nursing textbooks, Essentials of Pediatric Nursing and Nursing Care of Children. She was on the nursing faculty at several American universities. She was posthumously honored with induction into the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame. Biography Florence Blake was born on November 30, 1907. She was the daughter of musician Thelma Dunlap Blake and minister James Blake. She graduated from the Michael Reese Hospital School of Nursing in 1928. She completed an undergraduate degree from Columbia University in 1936. After teaching pediatric nursing in China for several years, she earned a master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1941. Beginning in the 1940s, Blake headed the graduate program in advanced pediatric nursing at the University of Chicago. Blake's 1954 book, The Child, His Parents and the Nurse, highlighted the importance of parent-child relationships and parental involvement in the medical care of children. In a review published in the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine, Morris Green wrote that the book represented the first textbook that attempted to provide comprehensive nursing knowledge on child care. Green wrote that \\"the emphasis is not limited to technical procedures and disease processes (disease-oriented care) but broadened to include a better understanding of the needs of children and parents (patient- oriented care) in health as well as disease.\\" Blake led the advanced pediatric nursing graduate program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 1963 and her retirement in 1970.

She graduated with a Master of Fine Art Degree from the Michaelis School of Fine Art, University of Cape Town in 2004.  Work  Clark has worked as an artist and curator, and have been featured in international exhibitions. Her exhibitions feature works that range from lit-up suitcases to clothing to large wall installations. Her exhibits engulf the entire gallery, using the floor, walls and ceiling as canvas for her mixed media art. Often using found objects, her materials include children's toys, old boxes, and meticulous paper cutouts. Clark describes her work altering these objects as a \\"device for coping with an overload of information or emotion\\". The variety of styles, multitude of cutouts and use of bright color give Clark's work a fanciful feel that simultaneously express profound topics. Her 2004-2005 exhibition, A Million Trillion Gazillion, used various elements to explore the \\"changing nature of knowledge systems.\\" With the help of other art students, Clark influenced traditional educational materials as illustrated books to portray the \\"in-congruence of an idealized world view with the failure and realities of our contemporary world.\\" Three of her solo exhibitions act as a trilogy, looking into the fleeting nature of knowledge systems. Another exhibition, Hypocrite's Lament (2007) focused on \\"response cycles of addition and destruction\\", (2007). Her following exhibition, the uplifting Fever Jubilee (2010) focused on growth, with works such as plants made of paper cut-outs that acts as a space for Clark and her family to relax with the audience.

Founded in 1998 during the NATO Summit, the PfPC was chartered to promote defense institution building and foster regional stability through multinational education and research, which the PfPC accomplishes via a network of educators and researchers. It is based at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies in Garmisch, Germany.Partnership for Peace Consortium (PfPC) According to the PfPC Annual Report of 2012,Annual Report of 2012 Free download in 2012 eight hundred defense academies and security studies institutes in 59 countries worked with the PfPC in 69 defense education/defense institution building and policy-relevant events. The Consortium publishes an academic quarterly journal CONNECTIONSQuarterly Journal Connections in English and Russian. The journal is run by an international Editorial Board of experts and is distributed to over 1,000 institutions in 54 countries. Background The PfPC was founded in 1998 in response to the speech by United States Secretary of Defense William Cohen, \\"Toward a Cooperative Security Network for the 21st Century\\".Toward a Cooperative Security Network for the 21st Century The speech was delivered during the 12 June 1998 meeting of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) defense ministers and similar sentiments were echoed in the concluding documents of the NATO and EAPC Summits on 24 and 25 April 1999.NATO Summit 24-25 April, 1999 The PfPC was originally co-sponsored by the United States and Germany to work in the spirit of the Partnership for Peace Program \\"to strengthen defense and military education through enhanced national and institutional cooperation.\\" Since its founding, the PfPC’s sponsorship has expanded, with contributions from numerous partner states and organizations. In the Canadian House of Commons in 2017, the PfPC's long contribution \\"in promoting stability, security, and democracy\\" was noted by the Honorable Wayne Easter, Liberal MP for Malpeque. Upon its establishment, the PfPC was chartered with the following objectives: *Strengthen defense, military, and security policy education through enhanced national and institutional cooperation *Strengthen civilian and military leadership capabilities in national security and strategic-level military planning *Enhance multinational education through collaborative approaches linking defense practitioners, scholars, researchers, and experts into activity-based networks that facilitate the sharing of knowledge *Extend the scope of educational cooperation throughout the Euro-Atlantic region to include not only governmental defense academies and security studies institutes, but also other governmental, non-governmental, and private organizations whether they are institutes, agencies or universities *Increase the scope of the multinational research on critical issues confronting partner nations Organization The PfPC is governed by a Senior Advisory Council (SAC), with high level government representatives from Austria, Canada, Germany, NATO International Staff, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, United States. SAC members can be permanent or rotational depending on the interests of the contributing state or organization. The most recent SAC additions are PolandPoland on Senior Advisory Council (SAC) and Sweden.Sweden on Senior Advisory Council (SAC) The SAC meets annually to review the PfPC's activities, providing guidance to ensure activities match the PfPC's founding principles. The PfPC organizes its activities through Working Groups and Study Groups, which address relevant topics in international security and related fields. In total there are nine groups, each with a Chair, Co-Chair, and Technical Advisors, who contribute to the groups' activities voluntarily or otherwise. The Chairs and Co-Chairs comprise the PfPC's Consortium Steering Committee (CSC). The CSC meets annually to provide updates on their activities and to determine future activities, ensuring activities are aligned with SAC directions. Activity Groups Over 90 PfPC events per year across the US, Europe and Central Asia provide the activity groups with a forum for debate and exchange of ideas on contemporary security topics. Such forums are designed to identify and facilitate options for nonviolent resolution to international differences, and to further defense education transformation goals in recipient countries. The groups benefit from a multinational, multidisciplinary network of experts across defense, academia, industry, and civil society. Working Groups =Advanced Distributed Learning= The Advanced Distributed Learning Working Group’sSynytsya, K., et al. \\"Learning on demand. ADL and the Future of e-Learning. Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative.\\" (2010): 295-303. mission is to strengthen e-learning-based defense and security policy education through international and institutional collaboration. The activities include the creation and sharing of interactive, widely needed e-learning courseware; providing access to interoperable, open-source e-learning technologies; and the exchange and dissemination of ADL-based best practices. A strategic goal is to contribute to the Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP) and integrate interested Partner nations into the ADL community of practice. The Advanced Distributed Learning Working Group coordinates and standardizes training and promotes innovation. =Education Development= The Education Development Working Group (EDWG) is designed to strengthen defense education in partner nations and consists of two core components: *Reference Curriculum *Faculty Development These two core components are facilitated by the multinational staffed Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP),.Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP)NATO Wales Summit Declaration - see Paragraph 81 on Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP) DEEP is central to EDWG activities, supporting foreign government defense learning institution efforts to: (1) enhance the quality and relevance of curriculum and to (2) promote faculty development and modern learning techniques within a framework of individually tailored multi-year action plans. As of December 2014, DEEP programs were underway in 13 nations: Afghanistan,Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP) in Afghanistan Armenia, Azerbaijan, Croatia, Georgia,Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP) in Georgia Iraq, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Moldova, Mongolia, Serbia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. =Emerging Security Challenges= The Emerging Security Challenges (ESC) Working Group aims to enhance the capacity of decision makers and policy shapers to identify and respond to emerging security challenges. Specifically, its goal is to identify and prioritize such challenges and discuss possible political frameworks and mechanisms to address them. “Emerging Security Challenges” has become a term used at NATO and in public debate to deal with potential, upcoming, non-traditional threats to our security. The working group does not have a defined set of issues for analysis - rather, it remains open to include new challenges as they arise. Along with the EDWG, the Emerging Security Challenges working group under the leadership of Sean Costigan(George C. Marshall Center for European Security Studies) and Michael Hennessy (Royal Military College of Canada) led the creation of the NATO/PFPC Cybersecurity Generic Reference Curriculum. The curriculum was endorsed by the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, and is currently available in four languages: English, French, Arabic and Russian. =Security Sector Reform= The Security Sector Reform Working Group (SSRWG) was formally established in 2001 and is financially supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport. Its stated objectives are “to enhance the exchange of ideas, insights, expertise, knowledge and best practices of security sector reform processes between consolidating and consolidated democracies in the Euro-Atlantic area”.Partnership for Peace Consortium, \\"Security Sector Reform Working Group Factsheet\\" (2014). From 2010, the group began to focus more on human security issues and has taken a particular interest in how to improve gender equality through defence transformation. This led the group to identify teaching gender to the military as an area that warranted greater attention, resulting in a series of workshops organised in collaboration with the EDWG, starting in 2012. These have been attended by representatives from NATO and Partner countries specialising in military education, gender education and integrating gender in military operations. The SSRWG’s current activities are centred on the development of a handbook to document the findings of the workshop series.DCAF, Event: Authors’ Workshop: Teaching Gender to the Military Manual, 17 Dec 2014 - 19 Dec 2014. Study Groups =Regional Security in Southeast Europe= The Regional Stability in Southeast Europe Study Group contributes to peace and security in Southeast Europe. Its working principles include the following: *Evaluate the situation and factors in the South East European region that promote regional stability through enhanced international co-operation, especially with institutions located in or close to the region of interest *Carry out strategic research on an academic level supplementary to and stimulating the practical work done in the region *Provide support for the improvement of networks in the field of security policy and help create a peaceful, strategic and stable community in the Southeast Europe region compatible to the broader Partnership for Peace network and beyond =Regional Security in the South Caucasus= The PfPC's Regional Security in the South Caucasus Study Group actively seeks to foster stability in the region through facilitating dialogue among diverse parties. The activities of the group serve to advise broader conflict resolution activities, such as the Geneva Talks and the OSCE Minsk Group. The group pursues its goals by focusing on the following areas: *Ensuring multinational participation, building on experts from all dimensions of the security-political spectrum of the three core countries Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia: This is paralleled by bringing in experts on regional stability issues from the main partner countries and institutions to the region, namely the European Union (Member States), the Russian Federation, Turkey, the United States, as well as NATO, the OSCE and the UN. *Building a constructive network of academic and policy-making influence: This includes involving civil society, think-tanks and defense institutions in the group's work. *Encouraging an alteration of the conflicting narrative in the region in order to progress conflict negotiation Products and Services Supported by the research and activities of the study/working groups, the PfPC offers the following services: *Defense education curriculum development *Education delivery methods (e.g. distributed computer-based learning) *Foreign policy recommendation papers *Information sharing, coordination of skills and assets Publications Connections: The Quarterly Journal, is a peer-reviewed open access academic journal covering security, defense, armed forces, conflict, intelligence, history, war, and related issues. It was established in 2002 by the Partnership, and is published in both hardcover and PDF. The four issues in volume 1 were published in English, French, German, and Russian. Starting with volume 2, the journal is published in English and Russian, with the exception of volumes 7-10, which were published in English only.

The company supplied early aviators, motorists and motorcyclists with protective clothing against the cold and damp British climate. In the mid-1950s, D. Lewis produced the Bronx leather jacket, one of the first products aimed directly at the post-war teenage fashion market, which was widely adopted by the Ton-up Boys and Rockers of the 1960s, becoming associated with the 59 Club and sponsoring leading motorcycle and TT racers of the day. History D. Lewis D. Lewis of Great Portland StreetOriginally a family business called D. Lewis, started in the 1892 as a gentlemen's outfitter or \\"wardobe company\\", At that time, the company produced gents suiting and raincoats in the east end of London. D. Lewis became a Limited company in 1929 under the stewardship of brothers Nathan Jones, David and Lewis Isaacs on Great Portland Street in London's West End, they also had Birmingham, Sheffield and Liverpool which traded under the name of N Jones. It was during the 1910s that the company started making and retailing specialist clothing for what was then considered the \\"gentlemen's\\" auto sports of aviation and motoring producing their wares in Watford. At the time, Great Portland Street was known as \\"Motor Row\\", the primary location for purchasing automobiles and related accessories in the early years of the 20th century.Michael Worthington-Williams, \\"Warren Street and the London motor trade\\", in Aspects of Motoring History, Edition 6, Society of Automotive Historians in Britain, October 2010.

Aviakit 1930s Aviakit label Initially used as a Telegram address (\\"Aviakit Wesdo\\") in 1929, in 1930 the company introduced Aviakit (short for \\"aviation kit\\")Biker: Truth And Myth: How The Original Cowboy Of The Road Became The Easy Rider Of The Silver Screen by Bill Osgerby, The Lyons Press, 2005 as the brand name for its aviation clothing, which it had already been selling from the first quarter of the century and acting as contractors to numerous governments around the world including the Netherlands, India, Belgium, South Africa and Greece. It went on to produce clothing for the Royal Air Force (RAF) during World War II including made to measure outfits for officers. The product line was also to include boots, goggles, and crash helmets identical to those made by Everoak. Its garments were worn by Spitfire test pilot Sir Alex Henshaw and RAF fighter pilots during World War II. The name still appears in Lewis Leathers jackets, boots, gloves and other products to this day. Post-World War II 1960s Aviakit label Following the end of hostilities, although handicapped by petrol rationing, D. Lewis started selling ex-RAF clothing to de-mobbed motorcyclists and then, in the early 1950s as rationing ended, started to develop more casual items into their ranges, expanding into shops in Sheffield, Birmingham and St Albans. By 1953, its advertising claims were that the company was already the largest motorcycle clothing and accessory company in the UK and abroad.Cycle World Magazine, Jan 1975 \\"World's largest mail order motorcycle catalogue\\", p.103. The company's products came to represent the high end of the market, out of reach of many individuals, also serving the circuit racing fraternity offering repair and replacement right hand boots which commonly wore out on England's clockwise racing circuits.Scratching – Racing Earning your degree at the University of Brands Hatch, Cycle World magazine, 24 November 2010 by Steven L. Thompson Lewis Leathers It was not until 1960 that the company registered the name by which it soon became most commonly known, 'Lewis Leathers'. This brand name was introduced on a new range of leather jackets aimed at the youth market and, in 1962, it aligned itself with the burgeoning 59 Club in London, Hackney Wick. As the Mods and Rockers clashed at English seaside resorts, Lewis Leather clothing was to be seen on both sides of the conflict. In 1982, the company was sold to the Newbold Brothers; it was then sold to Richard Lyon in November 1986. In 1991 its classic designs were to be researched and re-created by Derek Harris. After trading from the same location for 101 years, the Great Portland Street shop closed in 1993. That same year saw the launch of a small 'Retro Range' of Lewis Leathers jackets with lining, labels and hardware all as found on the jackets seen during the 60s and 70s.

In the 1970s, a small factory in Sheffield was also used. In 1982 all production was moved to Northampton, returning to London in 1993 where it remains until the present date. From the late 1950s Lewis Leathers advertised to motorcyclists and also in popular musical publications such as the NME and Melody Maker.

Lewis launched its most iconic jacket, the Bronx Jacket, an update of a 1930s flying jacket. Aimed at the teenage market, following the effect of the banning of Marlon Brando's movie The Wild One, the Bronx was to become the British equivalent of the Schott Perfecto.The Fashion Reader: Second Edition, Linda Welters, Abby Lillethun & Linda Welters, Berg, 2011, , \\"In Britain, a similar jacket was made by Lewis Leathers ... the genuine article as made by the Schott Brothers\\" p. 454 Coinciding with the huge increase in popularity of motorcycling and the Mods and Rockers era, the company continued to expand its range of black leather jackets which also started to appeal to fashion conscious rebels. The Lewis Leather jackets differed from their American counterparts such as the Perfecto motorcycle jacket in that during the mid-1950s in the United Kingdom, many young riders were influenced by the riding style of their racing heroes, which was crouched right over the tank, arms forward holding onto clip-on handle bars. In order to wear an American style jacket, various modifications needed to be made such as expansion pleats down each side of the back and the buckle had to be covered in leather, as the brass buckles found on most American styles would have scratched the tank.Derek Harris, Interview with Professor Colin Fallows, Prof of Sound & Visual Arts, Liverpool John Moores University, 2012. It became the jacket of choice for the rocker generation and is still in production more than 40 years later.Black Leather Supermodel, Dave Edmonds, Alternative London magazine, March 2005 A further development of the original Bronx jacket was the Super Bronx Twin Track version with an additional zip-track fitted allowing it to expand, enabling the rider to wear bulkier warm clothing in winter.

Born in Stirling, he moved to Bath in 1991 to work for computer magazine Amiga Power as a staff writer, where he gained attention for his video game reviews. He has lived in Somerset ever since, and made further contributions to a number of publications both within the video game industry and in the popular media. A long-term supporter of Scottish independence, Campbell launched the political blog \\"Wings Over Scotland\\" in November 2011. He is a former director of software company Herosoft, which was founded in 2010 and dissolved four years later. Early career In 1988, Campbell won the UK National Computer Games Championship's ZX Spectrum category, having been a runner-up in the Scottish heats earlier that year. The event was organised by Newsfield Publications and the National Association of Boys' Clubs, with sponsorship from video game publisher US Gold. In late 1989, US Gold and Computer and Video Games magazine sponsored a team of UK players, which included Campbell, to take part in the European Video Games Championship at the Salon de la Micro show in Paris. The UK team won, beating out the French and Spanish competitors. Using the prize fund from the first two competitions—£1,000 of computer hardware and US Gold software—Campbell was able to set up an independent videogame fanzine, Between Planets. Campbell maintained contact with US Gold's PR department, ensuring a steady stream of review material for the fanzine. Campbell's PR contact was also able to convince Ocean Software to send new games to the fanzine for review. With the cachet of legitimate journalism these contacts conferred, Campbell and Between Planets co-founder Simon Reid were able to convince other video game publishers to send them free review copies of their games. The fanzine ran to four issues; Campbell had sent issue three to Future Publishing, which hired him as a full-time staff writer for the Amiga games magazine Amiga Power. Video game journalism Campbell contributed to Amiga Power magazine from January 1991, before the magazine launched in April of that year, to May 1994, being promoted to various positions and culminating with deputising as its editor for ten issues between June 1993 and April 1994. Despite regularly professing his love for titles such as Rainbow Islands and Sensible Soccer, and compiling \\"top 100\\" lists, he is perhaps better known for his unreserved and often highly disparaging critiques. In 1993, he awarded the game International Rugby Challenge two marks out of a possible hundred, declaring that the Bosnian War was \\"Not nearly as bad.\\" Issues 27 to 36 of Amiga Power have subsequently been cited as belonging to \\"The Stuart Campbell Era\\". Campbell remained at the publication until issue 39, which is considered part of \\"The Jonathan Davies Era\\" in the chronology of AP. In 1993, the magazine had to issue an apology during the Cannon Fodder Controversy after Campbell remarked \\"Old soldiers? I wish them all dead.\\"Chris McCashin, Daily Star, 23 Nov 1993 A few months later Campbell left Amiga Power to work at Sensible Software, the producers of the game. Campbell returned to the pages of Amiga Power as a freelance contributor during its final few months in 1996, writing several more reviews and features. He also continued to contribute to the online version of Amiga Power, known as AP2, which was set up by former writer Jonathan Nash after the magazine's closure in 1996. He wrote for Teletext's videogame section Digitiser from 1996 to 2001, as well as its short-lived online successor Digiworld with Kieron Gillen, Nash and Paul Rose, and was Features Editor of the videogames trade magazine CTW (Computer Trade Weekly) until its closure in 2002. He wrote regular gaming columns for men's magazines including Esquire, The Face and Front throughout the 1990s. He was also a resident gaming expert, alongside former Amiga Power colleague Dave Green, on the BBC technology television programme Don't Read The Manual (presented by Lindsey Fallow and Rajesh Mirchandani), appearing on most episodes of the show in 2001 and 2002. Campbell's writing has influenced current video games writers, including journalist and Marvel Comics writer Kieron Gillen. John Walker also cites Campbell as an influence, calling him a \\"constant conscience and inspiration\\". Gillen said Campbell was \\"the world's sharpest critic of arcade games\\", the long-running newsletter Need To Know said he was \\"Britain's Best Games Journalist\\", and Wired described Campbell as \\"the UK's foremost authority on computer and video games\\". Keith Stuart, gaming editor of The Guardian, said in 2016 that \\"I would not be doing this job if it weren't for [Amiga Power] - I wanted to write like Stuart.\\" Games industry Campbell left Amiga Power to work at Sensible Software and during 1994 and 1995 he oversaw the development of the Amiga and PC games Cannon Fodder 2—for which he designed all but around 10 of its 72 levels—and Sensible World of Soccer. Campbell built upon his contributions with references to popular culture, particularly the Scottish indie rock band The Jesus and Mary Chain. He later remarked that he was especially pleased when players had: \\"worked out solutions that I hadn't even thought of. I love games where you can outsmart the designer and get away with it.\\" Previously and subsequently, Campbell designed original games for various other formats including the ZX Spectrum and PC, one of which is a freeware pinball game themed around the Sex Pistols film/album The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. In 2007, Campbell was interviewed by UK-based PC gaming blog Rock, Paper, Shotgun. He discussed his transition from journalist to game designer, and the difference he saw between the two professions: > \\"The pace took some getting used to – compared to working on a magazine, > development goes at a crawl... Otherwise, it's pretty similar. In both cases > you're a group of young men doing a fun creative job in a fairly small and > close-knit team, and then going to the pub quite a lot. You do get a much > broader perspective from working on mags, though, because you see so many > games – as a developer you're naturally quite narrowly focused. You have to > make a conscious effort to stay aware of the outside world, which is > probably why [Cannon Fodder 2] is so full of cross-cultural references from > music, movies, comics and the like.\\" Campbell was director of developer Herosoft, which in November 2010 launched \\"Free-App Hero\\", an aggregator application created to help consumers find the best free games available for iOS. Despite a positive critical reception - the app was described by Pocket Gamer as a \\"very useful tool\\", by The Guardian as \\"a bargain-hunter's dream\\" and by Cult Of Mac as \\"a fantastic app tracker\\" which the site placed \\"at the top of our must-have apps list\\" \\\\- the project was not a commercial success and has now been removed from the App Store. Campaigning Campbell was a founding member of the campaigning group FairPlay, which led a week-long boycott of videogame purchasing in late 2002, in protest at what it regarded as the artificially high prices of games. In 2003, FairPlay switched its attention to the slot machine industry, attracting coverage in the broadsheet and tabloid press. As a spokesman for FairPlay, Campbell explained how the majority of fruit machines would cheat the player by offering \\"gambles\\" which had no chance of success, ensuring the player lost whichever option they chose. The campaign succeeded in having a warning from the Gaming Board of Great Britain (now the Gambling Commission) added to the front of all subsequent machines which exhibited this behaviour, although it was unsuccessful in having the practice outlawed entirely. Wings Over Scotland Campbell launched Wings Over Scotland in November 2011 with the stated aim of providing a \\"fair and honest perspective on Scottish politics\\" with a pro-independence slant, after he \\"got fed up of just shouting at the TV when Newsnight Scotland was on\\". The blog is known for its challenge to traditional media and successful use of crowd funding, along with its controversial reporting style described as \\"somewhere between Gonzo and WWE\\" by then-STV columnist Stephen Daisley. Kevin McKenna of The Observer praised Campbell as someone who \\"doesn’t retreat and gets into fights with everyone\\", adding \\"Newspapers used to be like that too. I like his style\\", whereas Daily Record editor Murray Foote called the site \\"A world of conspiracy theories, hatred and paranoia\\", representing \\"a brand of nationalism that seeks to peddle falsehoods and unfounded allegations against anyone who isn’t a believer. It is nasty, sewage politics that debases public life.\\" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale told The Scotsman newspaper that \\"My dad will see something on Wings Over Scotland and post it. For him, it is as relevant a source as the Financial Times\\". As of April 2016, the site attracted over 250,000 readers a month. It has raised in excess of £700,000 since 2013 in a series of crowdfunding initiatives to fund its work. Comments made by Campbell on his personal blog Wings Over Sealand in 2012 relating to the Hillsborough disaster caused controversy by suggesting that \\"[Liverpool] fans were to blame because they, alone, were the ones who pushed and thereby caused the crush\\". Later Campbell said: \\"I stand absolutely by the stuff that I've written about Hillsborough\\". During the latter stages of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Campbell described Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone as a liar and \\"fat troughing scum\\", causing Johnstone to complain: \\"If describing an MSP as a 'fat, troughing scum' is your idea of a well-made argument or a clever way to debunk myths, then the standard of our national debate really has fallen into disrepair\\". Campbell stated that the comments were reported out of context and were an isolated instance, and that he would apologise when Johnstone apologised for his personal attack on pro-independence donors Chris and Colin Weir which had provoked Campbell's remarks. Johnstone subsequently died of cancer in December 2016. With just over a month to go until the vote, a 72-page book The Wee Blue Book, written by Campbell, was published. Within a month, the digital edition had been downloaded 550,000 times, in addition to 300,000 printed copies being distributed across Scotland. In August 2015, a Kidderminster woman was fined more than £320 after pleading guilty to shoplifting a pack of chocolate bars valued at 75p; in her plea of mitigation, she claimed that after her benefits were sanctioned, hunger had led her to steal. Campbell saw the story online and set out to raise £500 on her behalf. Within the first day £12,000 had been donated. In total, the appeal raised over £16,000 and attracted significant media coverage. The woman subsequently asked that the £500 be donated to two women's charities. The remainder was then donated to a number of Scottish anti-poverty charities. In October 2015, Campbell was fined £750 by the Electoral Commission for \\"failing to submit the necessary invoices and receipts after registering as an official yes campaigner during the independence referendum\\". In March 2017, the then-leader of Scottish Labour, Kezia Dugdale, used her Daily Record column to allege that Campbell had posted \\"homophobic tweets\\" involving the heterosexual Tory MSP Oliver Mundell and his homosexual father David Mundell. Campbell's tweet read “Oliver Mundell is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner\\". Campbell sued her for defamation, seeking damages of £25,000. In 2019, Campbell lost the case, with the Sheriff concluding that, while Campbell's comment was not homophobic and he was not a homophobe, Dugdale's remarks constituted fair comment and \\"were not motivated by malice, but by a genuine perception that the tweet represented an insult to homosexual people, and was homophobic\\". Campbell unsuccessfully appealed in 2020. In August 2017, Campbell was arrested, questioned and bailed on suspicion of harassment and malicious communications against an unnamed person. The Metropolitan Police announced at the beginning of November 2017 that after investigation Campbell had been cleared and released without charge. Campbell described the events as \\"an insane, ridiculous farce\\". In July 2018, the Wings Over Scotland YouTube channel was shut down (along with that of another user, Peter Curran) after copyright complaints from the BBC about short clips from its news and current affairs programmes. A few days later, following an intervention to the BBC's Director General from former First Minister Alex Salmond, the channel was reinstated and the BBC announced a decision to review its copyright policies. In December 2019, Stuart Campbell's Wings Over Scotland twitter account was permanently suspended for violations of the platform's rules against hateful conduct. In May 2020, twitter permanently suspended two more of Campbell's twitter accounts, including his personal one, for violations of the platform's rules against hateful conduct, platform manipulation and spam. In response, Campbell accused Twitter of censorship and alleged the social media platform was “an unaccountable and unelected foreign corporation serving the interests of a massive right-wing pharmacological lobby.” References External links * Wings Over Scotland political blog * Wings Over Sealand modern culture blog Category:British video game designers Category:Scottish journalists Category:Scottish bloggers Category:Scottish nationalists Category:Living people Category:1967 births ","title":"Stuart Campbell (game journalist)"},{"id":"39345200","text":"Grant le Roux (born 13 January 1986) is a South African rugby union player, who most recently played with the .

Now a significant tourist attraction, the building is located in a little street off the Plaza San Jacinto, a block east of the Plaza Bolívar. It is one of only a few houses from the colonial era which survive in central Caracas. One of the adjacent buildings serves as a Bolivarian museum (museo bolivariano).Red Museos Bolivarianos (Casa Natal-Museo Bolivariano) The birthplace and museum together present memorabilia connected with Bolivar and the Venezuelan War of Independence, along with weapons and furniture of that period. History Portrait of Simón Bolívar in the house The house on San Jacinto Street was completed in the 1640s. Bolivar was born to Doña María de la Concepción Palacios y Blanco and Coronel Don Juan Vicente Bolívar y Ponte in the bedroom here on 24 July 1783, and was the fourth child of the aristocratic couple of the Creole family who had migrated from Spain 200 years earlier. In 1806, the house was sold to a relation of Bolívar called Madriz. The house remained in his family until 1876 when it was bought by President Antonio Guzmán Blanco.Lynch, John Simon Bolivar: A Life Guzmán Blanco was an admirer of Bolívar, and erected his equestrian statue in the Plaza Bolivar. Reconstruction of the house was ordered on October 28, 1916, with the purpose of preserving Venezuela's cultural heritage, and to honor its national hero, but it was not until 1920 when the house actually underwent reconstruction with added refinements. It was inaugurated on 5 January 1921 on the anniversary of the Battle of Carabobo. The building became a listed National Monument on 25 July 2002.\\"La Casa Natal del Libertador Simon Bolivar\\", Venezuela. Retrieved 9 May 2013. Architecture The single-storey building occupies a relatively narrow plot, 23 meters wide and 60 meters deep. It has wide corridors and courtyards and patios. Courtyard at the main entrance The reconstruction is Spanish Colonial in character, but the aim of the restorers was to enhance the building, rather than adopt criteria of strict authenticity. New materials were introduced; for example the facade facing the street has been refaced in stone, which is atypical of colonial-era houses in Venezuela. Other walls are whitewashed: the structure underneath is now made of brick, although it was probably made of adobe originally. At the time of Bolívar's birth, the home was opulently furnished with mahogany chests and tables, upholstered chairs, decorated mirrors; damask curtains, gold cornices, and bright chandeliers. Period furniture and artifacts belonging to Bolívar can now be seen in the building. The house has a sequence of courtyards surrounded by corridors and rooms. In the main courtyard is the baptismal font used for Bolívar's baptism, originally located in Caracas Cathedral. The second courtyard serves as ventilation to the kitchen and other rooms, and includes a replica of a water fountain from the time of Bolívar. At the end of the house is a small pen-laundry and stable. Bedroom Among those which stand out are the main room, the bedroom (site where Simón Bolívar was born) and the cabinet, which occupy the front body of the building. They are decorated with murals executed by the painter Tito Salas. These very large paintings by Salas depict Bolívar's heroic battles and scenes during his life. In one painting at the house, Salas depicts Bolívar on a white mountain with a white bearded man with angel wings. There are also paintings of his life scenes by Martín Tovar y Tovar and Arturo Michelena, including his christening, wedding and death. There is also a tree in the backyard of the house, which is famous as it is said to be the location where Simon was taught by Rodríguez. Bolivar's childhood mementos such as his library and personal records are also exhibited. Other homes of Bolívar Venezuela Despite the Venezuelan authorities' assertion that Bolívar was born in Caracas, there have been claims that the much poorer town of San Mateo, Aragua, was in fact his true birthplace. The claims are based on the fact that Bolívar's mother had certainly been living at the San Mateo ranch shortly before his birth and that as a child, Bolívar spent much of his time there.\\"San Mateo Municipio Bolívar, Edo. Aragua, Venezuela\\". Retrieved 10 May 2013. There is also another family home of Bolivar which has historical importance. It was the venue where the independence movement was launched on 19 April 1810 after the freedom fighters had conspired to act during their first meeting at this home in 1818. Eventually, as result of this movement Venezuela got its independence from Spain, on 5 July 1815.

He was the leading authority on early recording artists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and their techniques, especially through his columns written between the 1920s and 1980s, most notably for Hobbies magazine. Biography He was born in Richmond, Virginia, and was named after Ulysses S. Grant. After living for periods in Durham, North Carolina, and in South Boston, Virginia, he went to school and grew up in the small town of Marion. As a boy, he was generally known as \\"E\\"; he acquired the nickname \\"Jim\\", which he used for the rest of his life, after he started work. He recorded on a phonograph cylinder as a boy soprano, and as a teenager started to collect and research the recordings of his childhood and earlier years. He first submitted articles for publication in local newspapers and specialist magazines in the late 1920s. In 1929 he began work in the music department of a furniture store in Marion, before taking a job as a post office clerk in the town in 1932. Tim Gracyk, The Life and Writing Career of Ulysses \\"Jim\\" Walsh. Retrieved 9 May 2013 Between 1934 and 1943 he worked as a newspaper reporter in Johnson City, Tennessee, and in 1939 also began hosting a program on radio station WJHL, which showcased old recordings from his collection, and allowed him to discuss the lives and accomplishments of the musicians. He started writing a column, \\"Favorite Pioneer Recording Artists,\\" for Hobbies magazine in 1942. The articles concentrated on popular - rather than classical - recordings made before 1909, though their scope later widened to cover recordings made before the introduction of electronic recording in the mid 1920s. He continued writing articles for Hobbies until 1985. In later years, as the recognised authority on early popular recordings, he also wrote columns on the subject for Variety, The New Yorker, and many other magazines. Library of Congress: Jim Walsh Collection. Retrieved 9 May 2013 In 1943 he joined the staff of the Roanoke World News, and began working on the local radio stations WDBJ and later WSLS, where he continued to broadcast until 1960. He also continued to collect records and recording equipment, and met or corresponded with many of those involved in the early recording industry. He listed his favorite recording artists as Billy Murray, Henry Burr, Ada Jones, Len Spencer, Arthur Collins, Byron G. Harlan, Harry Macdonough, Albert Campbell, Frank C. Stanley, Steve Porter, Billy Golden, S. H. Dudley, Dan W. Quinn, William F. Hooley, and Cal Stewart. He started, but never completed, a comprehensive history of early recordings and techniques. However, his voluminous articles continue to be regarded as the most important source of information on recordings of the period. In 1965 he began transferring much of his collection to the Library of Congress. In all, he contributed some 40,000 discs - including an almost complete run of over 5,000 Edison \\"Diamond Disc\\" records - together with 500 cylinders, 23 early phonographs, extensive correspondence, research notes, clippings, photographs, radio broadcast scripts and miscellaneous ephemera. Walsh died in 1990, after many years of declining health. He was unmarried, and devoted to his cats. In 1991 he was posthumously awarded the first Lifetime Achievement Award of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC).

Delsa.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088767/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast Based on the true story that took place in Harlem during 1971, the telefilm, Badge of the Assassin, is based on the 1979 book of the same name – a true- crime account from the former district attorney and New York Times bestselling author Robert K. Tanenbaum and Philip Rosenberg. Woods played Tanenbaum in the film, whilst Tanenbaum was a co-executive producer. Writer Lawrence Roman transferred the book into a script for a television film. The film is an account of the detective work and prosecution that resulted in the convictions in 1975 of the Black Liberation Army members who, four years earlier, had shot to death two New York City police officers, Waverly Jones and Joseph Piagentini, in an unprovoked attack. Plot Three black revolutionaries gun down two New York City police officers. The policemen were gunned down in cold blood by the self-styled terrorists, who first elude to the law and then, for want of crucial evidence, conviction for their crime. Assistant District Attorney, Robert Tanenbaum, the man responsible for bringing the three cop killers to justice leads a tireless nationwide investigation that moves to San Francisco, New Orleans and Mississippi and finally back to a climax in a New York courtroom, during the desperate search for the killers. Tanenbaum is aided by his partner, a resourceful and equally determined detective, Cliff Fenton.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088767/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl Cast * James Woods as Robert K.

In the Blockbuster Video Guide to Movies and Videos, 1996, published by Dell Pub. on 1 August 1995, the film was given a four out of five star rating. On November 1, 1985, the New York Times writer Lawrence Van Gelder reviewed the film under the article headline \\"Police Murders Dramatized in Badge of the Assassin\\", where he stated \\"On screen, Mr. Tanenbaum, who pursued the case through two trials -the first ending in a hung jury, the second in murder convictions - is portrayed with a nice mixture of intensity, warmth, subdued humor and occasional self-doubt by James Woods. He is well supported by Yaphet Kotto and Alex Rocco as the New York detectives assigned to the case, and the cast also includes Rae Dawn Chong and Pam Grier as women associated with the killers. Badge of the Assassin wastes no time on subplots, nor does it exaggerate its intrinsic drama; neither does it seek to appraise or analyze from the vantage point of the 1980's the racial rage that was a characteristic of the time that produced the murders. Perhaps the fact that the case is revisited nearly 15 years later as typical television entertainment for a Saturday night is comment enough.\\" In The Pittsburgh Press of November 1, 1985, writer Barbara Holsopple stated \\"Badge of the Assassin is well-written, performed and produced, but it lacks the tension, suspense and horror of its era. Performers can't reproduce that, Yaphet Kotto said, if nobody remembers.\\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ThwhAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=JmMEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6811,154380&dq;=badge+of+the+assassin&hl;=en As quoted on the film's original publicity poster and VHS release, Leonard of Entertainment Tonight said \\"Bristling police drama about real life... played with nervous intensity by James Woods.\\" The Stop Button webzine reviewed the film in 2007, and stated \\"Mel Damski, if Badge of the Assassin is any indication, might be the finest TV movie director ever (who never went on to good theatrical films anyway). He understands composition, camera movement, editing–how to let actors do what actors do–beautifully. Badge of the Assassin looks like a TV movie and that description is, thanks in large part to Damski, not at all a pejorative. Admittedly, he has a lot of help. The film's perfectly as cast, top to bottom. Alex Rocco, Larry Riley, Richard Bradford, all three are particularly good, but there are no bad performances. David Harris is real good too. But the film really belongs to Yaphet Kotto. Even though James Woods gets a lot to do, he never gets as much to do as Kotto... and he doesn't get to do it as long. Regardless of what a terrible film McQ is... screenwriter Lawrence Roman is of a definite pedigree and his influence is probably significant. The script is another area Badge really makes a model TV movie. The character content, which is considerable–scenes with Rocco, Woods and Kotto all have a lot of weight–occurs over a really long time. Adding to the film is the location shooting. It helps immensely, forcing the viewer to engage with the reality of what's on the screen in front of him or her. In the end, Badge of the Assassin sort of runs out of time. It doesn't run out of story so much as it runs out of scenes it can enact well. It's a good looking film, though, with some great acting.\\" Home media The film was released in America and the UK, and has never received a DVD release. In the UK it was released onto VHS with an exclusive artwork. In America, the film has received a number of VHS releases.

The project's start date was 15 August 2008 and cost approximately US$120,000 at its conclusion. The physical structure is sized at 200 sq. meters and includes a Youth Centre, Stadium/Sports Facility, Health Clinic, and a Community Centre. The site's capacity is capped at 200. The centre's beneficiaries include at-risk children from ages ten to eighteen years of age, and will be accessed by approximately 50,000 people of the greater Mathare community and surrounding areas.Open Architecture Network The Mathare Football for Hope Centre was made possible by “20 Centres for 2010,” the Official Campaign of the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa. The entire campaign aims to address local social challenges in disadvantaged areas and improve education and health services for young people through the creation of these centers. Each center throughout Africa has its own local Centre Host Organization. Mathare's Football for Hope host organization is MYSA, Mathare Youth Sports Association.  Host Organization  MYSA, the centre's host organization, is located in Mathare, a collection of slums in Nairobi, Kenya. The organization is run by young people, aiding in their development in its fullest potential, and was founded with the intent to enhance their social proficiencies through the teaching of football. The mission of MYSA is, “Linking Sports, Community Leadership and Sustainable Development in Africa by: Creating opportunities for physical, personal and community development; Empowering young people and building their self-esteem; Empowering young people to become responsible citizens and environmental preservation experts.”MYSA Kenya The association has been in existence since 1987, celebrating its twentieth anniversary in 2006. The organization has expanded to a staff of sixty members, and over 7,000 volunteers. In addition, the association is making notable strides in helping their local youth become responsible citizens. MYSA has been awarded the UN Environment Programme 500 Award, Common Ground Award 2010, Winners Beyond Sport Award – Leadership in sport Award Category 2011, and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize twice.  Design  As noted in MYSA's mission statement, one of the association's goals is to develop their youth into environmental preservation experts (cite mission). The Mathare Football for Hope Centre chose to work with Studio 610 to design the space. They stated that their goal was, “to provide a space that is functional, sustainable, cost effective, and that will become a beacon where the community can come together.” Turf was chosen as a low maintenance, cost saving, recyclable option. The main building within the structure is formed by local stone masonry. The stone in the design was kept its natural colour in order to symbolize the nature of Kenya. In turn, the interior walls are painted bright colours in order to symbolize the heart and vibrancy of the Kenyan culture. The intent of the colourful interior was for the colour to radiate through the large glass like a multicoloured lantern. In addition, the flat roof allows for the installation of solar panels and easy rainwater collection. The architects of record for this project were Andrew Gremley and Pharos Architects. Studio 610 incorporated recycled shipping containers into the design of towers. In order to incorporate the association's sustainability goals, Studio 610 included the following sustainability initiatives in their design of the centre: the buildings consists of stones hand cut from the local quarries of Nairobi; it is powered by low cost devices such as low energy light bulbs; has block pavers that allow for proper drainage of rainwater into the ground; consists of a rain water collection design in which the water is directed to a harvesting tank and/or the irrigation system; high degree natural ventilation system so as to avoid the use of air conditioning; a natural cooling system with a shading structure at the northern end of the building that will create air circulation for cooling the seating/step and plaza area; large glazed openings to allow for the maximum use of daylight to ensure low use of artificial light; the shipping containers used to transport the turf have been recycled and reused as the tower element, and have been modified and incorporated alongside the field as an open shaded structure for gathering and storage; low construct waste in which the contractor was committed to separating on site waste and recycling; the building is positioned strategically to ensure optimal daylight at all times as well as shading to prevent overheating; and the fields have been dressed with artificial turf in order to lower maintenance costs, save water, and is completely recyclable. The environmental consultant for this project was Dr. Alfred Omenya  Development  As of July 2012, approximately 150 kids are accessing the centre each week; 200 girls have been recruited for the centre's football league; six youth have been trained as HIV testing and counselling counsellors; 579 Males and 478 Females have been counselled and tested on HIV/AIDS; 120 boys and 108 girls have been recruited to the library program; and 59 youth have been trained on entrepreneurship and basic computer training.

The movement was established to further conversation and development of relationships between existing social development and football organizations, various football club teams and individual players, as well as other commercial partners. By using the sport of football as its main vehicle, Football for Hope works to ultimately further develop and achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals.  Background  The Football for Hope Movement aims to establish sustainable programmes that work towards greater social development through community interest, passion, and understanding of the sport of football. Through the use of football, the movement aims to contribute towards further sharing of knowledge and understanding of public health, peace building, discrimination and integration, youth education, and the environment. Each programme will contribute specifically and individually towards these various components. In addition to the various programme created through the Football for Hope Movement, the largest contribution made by the movement is the creation and building of Football for Hope Centres across the continent of Africa. This is made possible with the partnership between the Football for Hope movement, , FIFA, as well as various other members. Each Football for Hope Centre or Hope Centre will incorporate a shared community space and football field. Each common space will target its community programming towards children and young people of the surrounding areas. By incorporating the use of football, each centre aims to promote greater interest and involvement of children and young people. In addition, the movement aims to encourage the youth to be involved in the design and building of the centres, creating a great sense of ownership within the communities and each centre. The centres will be focused around three main components: education, public health, and football. Football- centred events are used as a greater incentive towards encouraging children and young people to be actively involved. Through these events, each centre aims to establish stronger and more influential learning environments. Each centre hopes to be supplied with computers and materials necessary to creating such an environment. In addition, as poor public health is a main concern for much of Africa, the centres aim to address these concerns through a wide range of health services, including public health education courses. The last component of each centre is focused around football in order to attract all age groups through offering a space where individuals can share and engage in various programs, activities, and games. By addressing local social challenges experienced by many young people in developing and disadvantaged communities, The Football for Hope Movement hopes to work towards greater and positive social change. In working with younger generations, the Football for Hope Movement aims to make an impact early in the lives of many, creating greater change for future generations.  20 Centres for 2010 Campaign  To promote the establishment of the Football for Hope Movement, FIFA launched the 20 Centres for 2010 campaign to create further awareness. This became the official campaign of the 2010 FIFA World Cup games.[ 20 Centres for 2010]  Development  Since its inception in 2005, the Football for Hope Movement has spread all across the continent of Africa, having already opened several centres.

Czech Baroque architecture refers to the architectural period of the 17th and 18th century in Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia, which comprised the Crown of Bohemia and today constitute the Czech Republic. The Baroque style also changed the character of the Czech countryside (churches and chapels in Czech countryside are mostly Baroque). Czech Baroque architecture is considered to be a unique part of the European cultural heritage thanks to its extensiveness and extraordinariness. In the first third of the 18th century the Czech lands (especially Bohemia) were one of the leading artistic centers of the Baroque style. In Bohemia there was completed in a very original way the development of the Radical Baroque style created in Italy by Francesco Borromini and Guarino Guarini. The leading architects of the Czech High Baroque style (also called Radical Baroque of Bohemia) were Christoph Dientzenhofer, Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer and Jan Blažej Santini-Aichel. The spread of the Baroque style in the Crown of Bohemia was coupled with the victory of the Catholic Church during the Thirty Years' War when the Catholic Church became the only legal church in the Kingdom of Bohemia (from 1627) and Margraviate of Moravia (from 1628). The heyday of Baroque style in the Czech lands can be seen in the early 18th century. Many of the Baroque architects who worked, lived and often also died in the Czech lands came from different countries or were of foreign origin, mainly Italian, some came also from Bavaria, Austria or France. From Late Renaissance and Mannerism to Early Baroque The Matthias Gate at the Prague Castle, probably the first Baroque structure in Bohemia. The Baroque style penetrated Bohemia in the first half of the 17th century. Prague was one of the main centers of Mannerist art (a late Renaissance style, foreseeing early Baroque) under Rudolph II (1576–1611). At the end of his reign and during the reign of his brother Mathias (1611–1619) there were built some late Renaissance or Mannerist buildings with Early Baroque elements in Prague. But it is hard to distinguish between the Mannerist style and the Early Baroque style because there is no clear break, therefore some scholars consider these buildings to be Early Baroque while others consider them to be Mannerist. Among these transitional buildings is the Italian chapel consecrated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, adjoining the former Jesuit college called Clementinum built in 1590-1600 for Italians residing in Prague, designed by the Italian O. Mascarino. Although it is a Late Renaissance or Mannerist chapel, it is very important for Czech Baroque architecture because of its elliptical ground plan which is much more typical for Baroque architecture than for the rational Renaissance style. The Matthias Gate of the Prague Castle, built before 1614 probably by Giovanni Maria Filippi is traditionally designated the first Baroque structure in Prague. Early Baroque Wallenstein Palace, the first Baroque palace in Central Europe. The clear Baroque style came to the Crown of Bohemia during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) when it finally replaced the Renaissance style. The Baroque style, coming from Catholic Italy, was strongly supported by the rich Catholic aristocracy and the Catholic church, which became the only legal church after 1627. The architects of early Baroque in the Czech lands were foreigners, mostly Italians. The first Baroque palace in Prague and probably also the first in Central Europe was built in 1621–1630 for a Czech nobleman, general of the imperial army in the Thirty Years' War, Albrecht von Wallenstein. Wallenstein Palace (Czech: Valdštejnský palác) was designed and built by Italian architects Giovanni Pieroni and Andrea Spezza and was inspired by the newest Italian architecture of its time but the influence of Mannerism can also be seen. Facade of the Church of Our Lady Victorious completed in 1644 The Church of Our Lady Victorious in the Lesser Town of Prague is considered to be the first Baroque church in Prague. It was built probably by Giovanni Maria Filippi in 1611–13 for Lutherans in the late Renaissance style. In the 1620s the church became Catholic and was rebuilt in the early Baroque style. The new Baroque facade was completed in 1644. Very important architect of the early Baroque style in Prague was Carlo Lurago, who came from Italy and worked for the Jesuits. He started to rebuild the Clementinum and the older Renaissance Church of the Holy Savior in the Old Town, and for the Jesuits he built St. Ignatius Church on Charles Square in the New Town and the Church in Březnice. He built the Humprecht Chateau in 1666-1668 with an interesting elliptical ground floor. Another Italian architect who settled in the Czech lands was Francesco Carrati, who designed the Černín Palace in Prague. In the early Baroque style was renovated the residence of the archbishops of Olomouc in Kroměříž by Italian-Swiss architect Filiberto Lucchese and then by Italian Giovanni Pietro Tencalla. The Kroměříž Archbishop's Palace was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. Jean Baptiste Mathey was an important French architect who worked in the Crown of Bohemia. His works include the Church of St. Francis Seraph in the Old Town of Prague and Troja Palace, built near Prague for count of Sternberg. He also rebuilt the Archbishop's Palace in Prague. His works prefigure the High Baroque style in the Czech lands. File:Kostel Svatého Salvátora na Křižovnickém náměstí.jpgThe front facade of the Church of the Holy Savior by Carlo Lurago, 1650s–1660s.

File:Sv.Marketa-Jaromerice.jpgChurch of St. Margaret in Jaroměřice nad Rokytnou, late 17th century. High Baroque St. Nicholas Church in Prague, built in the first half of the 18th century in the radical Baroque style The High Baroque period in the Czech lands begins around the year 1690 and lasts to the mid-18th century. The architects of this time were mostly born in Bohemia or Moravia but often were of foreign origin. The most significant architects of this period were Christoph Dientzenhofer, who came to Bohemia from Bavaria and lived in Prague, and his son Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer. They are known for their style called \\"radical Baroque\\", which was inspired by examples from northern Italy, particularly by the works of Guarino Guarini, and which seeks to express movement. It is characterized by the curvature of walls and intersection of oval spaces. Together, father and son Dientzenhofer built in 1702–1715 and 1737–1751 the St. Nicholas Church in the Lesser Town of Prague, due to its architecture one of the most important Baroque churches in Europe. Other important high Baroque architects in the Crown of Bohemia were Giovanni Battista Alliprandi, born in Italy, worked mainly for aristocracy, František Maxmilián Kaňka and Jan Santini Aichel. Significant are mainly Santinis pilgrimage churches Basilica Virgin Mary in Křtiny an St. John of Nepomuk in Žďár and the convent church in Rajhrad. One of the most precious high Baroque secular buildings in Prague is the Clam- Gallas Palace built in 1714-1718 by famous Austrian architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach who also designed Baroque rebuilding of Vranov nad Dyjí Chateau in Moravia or a fountain in Brno. In Prague there are also fine high Baroque terraced palace gardens below the Prague Castle in the Malá Strana of Prague: Ledebur Garden, Small and Great Palffy Gardens, Kolowrat and Small Fürstenberg Gardens. Another important terraced garden in the Malá Strana district is the Vrtba Garden. In 1714–1754 the Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc was built by Wenzel Render and other citizens of Olomouc. It too is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Baroque Gothic The Baroque Gothic style is a unique strand of Czech High Baroque art which connects the Bohemian Radical Baroque style with Gothic elements. The creator and main representative of this style was the Bohemian architect Jan Santini Aichel. The Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk built in 1720s in this style by Jan Santini Aichel can be found on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Late Baroque and Rococo The main facade of the Prague Castle by Nicolò Pacassi and the Archbishop's Palace on the left The late Baroque style was usual in the Crown of Bohemia during the reign of queen Maria Theresa (1740–1780). In that time the Rococo style occurred, which is very similar to Baroque but differs from it by its ornamental decoration. During her rule the Neoclassical style came to the Czech lands and after her death replaced the Baroque style. The examples of the late Baroque architecture (with Rococo elements) in Prague are the Archbishop's Palace or the Goltz-Kinsky Palace on the Old Town Square. In the style of Baroque Classicism the New Royal Palace of the Prague Castle was rebuilt by the Viennese architect Nicolo Pacassi in the second half of the 18th century.

The centre opened on 5 December 2009 in the Harare neighbourhood. It cost approximately US$256,000 and spans about 220 square meters. Khayelitsha is a township in the Western Cape of South Africa in Cape Town. Football for Hope was made possible by Architecture for Humanity, FIFA’s 20 Centres for 2010 project, and to create the centre in Khayelitsha, while Grassroot Soccer is the Centre Host organisation. Grassroot Soccer’s mission is: “Grassroot Soccer uses the power of soccer to educate, inspire, and mobilise communities to stop the spread of HIV.” Football for Hope's mission is to use football as a vehicle for the encouragement of health, peace, rights of the children and a way to discourage discrimination. There are different programs that are orchestrated at each centre that promote these objectives. These programs encourage play in an architecturally sound and safe environment. The location of the Centre plays an important role in its growing popularity and prevalence in Khayelitsha. It is located in an area where pedestrian traffic is heavy and common. This encourages frequent visitors to the Football for Hope Centre. It is placed in a convenient location in the Harare neighbourhood. Because Khayelitsha is the second largest township in South Africa, the location of this Centre is strategic in that it can provide its resources to the vast youth and general population living in Khayelitsha.  Programs  Through Grassroot Soccer, an NGO and Khayelitsha Football for Hope Centre's host organisation, individuals are trained in behavioural development through the use of football and use what they've learned to benefit children in different communities. Grassroot soccer provides programs used at Khayelitsha Football for Hope Centre. They are used to promote healthy living and HIV free lives. A programme put on by Grassroot Soccer is the “Skillz Programme.” This programme is two hours, three times a week. In these two hours, soccer drills and games are run and “combined with specially-designed exercises to help young people understand and deal with HIV and AIDS.” There are peer counsellors who take part in educating the youth of Khayelitsha in various ways. The games and drills they partake in are representative of positive behaviours and experiences. The youth take these experiences and understand the importance of living a healthy and fun life. 6,000 completed the Skillz Curriculum in the first year of Khayelitsha Football for Hope Centre's existence. The Utshintsho programme was started at Khayelitsha Football for Hope Centre and is meant for children to be educated about drugs and alcohol abuse. Utshintsho means “transformation” or “change” in Xhosa. The community aspect of Khayelitsha has become more apparent and tight knit since the construction of Khayelitsha Football for Hope Centre. It provides a healthy and safe environment for the community members (aimed at children from the ages of 12-18) to come together, learn and play. Through the involvement in football and the various programs at the Centre, children are encouraged to refrain from dangerous behaviours and learn to explore and play as the alternative. They also have HIV testing and counselling at the Centre. They are set up rather frequently and encourage children to get tested as often as possible because the prevalence of HIV in the Khayelitsha community is incredibly high.  Structure and Design  Urban Design Guidelines was a relevant source for arG Design, the firm that designed Khayelitsha Football for Hope Centre due to the location of the edifice. The prevalence of crime in Khayelitsha is high, therefore situating the building where all sides were visible and accessible was important to the design firm. Because the building is located on a very common road, there is interaction between the Khayelitsha community and the Football for Hope Centre. There is a courtyard in the Centre, which is surrounded by a room with many purposes, namely recreationally and other services for the community. There is also a small kitchen, bathroom and changing rooms and an office. The mission of the arG design team was to incorporate outdoor spaces that are conducive to a welcoming and comfortable environment. Khayelitsha Football for Hope Centre has many features that are sustainable and environmentally friendly, an element that was also important to the arG's design idea. This is incorporated into the design of the building and the turf. The features are as follows: The bricks used to construct the building are local, made in Cape Town, and use over 95% of recycled materials; the insulation of the building is important to endure the rain; the roof is made of iron from Cape Town and keeps the warmth of the edifice intact in the winter and provides a cooling effect in the hot summer months; the devices used (lights, toilets, showers) are all low cost and energy efficient; to support the essential diet and nutritional benefits for the children, a food garden was built on the edge of the site; fruit trees were planted to not only provide shade in the hot months for pedestrians but also provide citrus fruits to the community; rainwater is used for toilet water and is used in their irrigation plan; the Centre is partially run on solar power; air conditioning is not used but rather the construction and design of the building provides natural cooling effects; and the building uses recycling.  Outcomes  Since the construction of Khayelitsha Football for Hope Centre, there have been many positive outcomes and benefits to the Khayelitsha community. The children and adults of the community are tested frequently for HIV and AIDS, a service that was rare and largely unavailable to the neighbourhood prior to the construction and operation of Football for Hope in Khayelitsha.Open Architecture Network In addition, 6,000 children and adolescents in the community graduated from the Skillz program, meaning that they are able to mentor and teach kids constructive information about how to stay safe and avoid dangerous situations. They also are able to incorporate play and fun into these mentoring sessions through football and exercise. The community of Khayelitsha has also benefitted solely because there is a common space for everyone to come, share ideas, and play together. It has helped unite the large community of 1.2 million people.

Church of Saint Michael the Archangel is a church situated in Prague, Czech Republic. It was built in Romanesque and Gothic style and later rebuilt in Baroque style. The priest and church reformer Jan Hus celebrated masses in the church. The church and adjacent monastery were disestablished during the reforms of the Emperor Joseph II in the 18th century. Later, the buildings served as a warehouse. In the crypt, there are buried rectors of the Prague's University. History The Church of St. Michael () in Opatovice – V Jirachářích, originally a Romanesque structure, is older than the New Town (Nové Město) itself, which started to evolve in the place of the fields and meadows, settlements and villages in 1348. It was founded at the same time as the settlement of Opatovice and a rectory stood at the site during the reign of John of Bohemia. It belonged to the Hussites during the Hussite Wars (1419), became the property of the Lutherans a hundred years later (1524), and then the Catholics after the Battle of White Mountain (1621). It was then bought by the German Lutheran Church in 1790 after being abandoned. The German choir had a picture of Martin Luther created for the side window of the church in 1915. After the Second World War, the confiscated church was passed to the Prague choir of the Slovak Evangelical Church. The Gothic structure of the church dates back to the last 25 years of the 14th century. It was expanded and added to on a number of occasions, with its final re-Gothicisation dating back to 1914–1915 under the leadership of builder Štěpán Koloschek. An oblong nave was created with a flat ceiling and a prismatic tower to the west. The irregular presbytery is distinctive for its ornate vaulting. The asymmetric three-naved structure is externally unified by an orbiting, Baroque, main cornice. The Baroque extension of a staircase to the gallery sits next to the southern Gothic nave. The structure comes to a peak with its slender prismatic tower, which has Gothic core. The portal from the north is fitted with a fanlight, whose tracery was made up of a number of stylized nuns. The late- Rococo main altar (around 1770) remains the Gothic fittings. This was originally dedicated to St. Michael.

Course of storm The typhoon hit Hong Kong with \\"unprecedented violence\\" and left no less than 2,000 people injured. However, around 5,000 people lost their lives in Macau, making the typhoon the worst storm on record to hit Macau, with Typhoon Hato in 2017 being the second worst.\\"TERRIFIC TYPHOON IN HONGKONG\\", The Straits Times, 10 October 1874, Page 1 The Colony experienced a period of low pressure, typical of the eye of a typhoon. From 8 pm, winds raged and howled with ear-deafening sounds, alongside the painful cries of many people who had become homeless. The typhoon increased in strength steadily up to 2:15 am in the morning. Modern analysis in 2017 indicated that this great typhoon passed approximately 50 to 60km to the south of Hong Kong at its closest approach, similar to Hato in 2017. Some adventurers went out to the Praya at 11 pm and found themselves knee deep in the water and risked being washed away by the waves hitting the shore. They were forced to retreat by 1 am as the winds were reaching a new high. The East Point on Causeway Bay recorded a water level 4 feet above its average. Many stores and shops, even far away from the Praya waterfront were flooded and water damaged. The typhoon began weakening after 3 am, yet its two-hour impact had injured and killed many in the Colony. Telegraphic communication was interrupted and communication with Hong Kong island was cut for a time. The town had sustained great loss, its roads were deserted and strewn with debris, house roofs were ruined, windows shattered and walls fallen and cables and gas pipes were blown away and trees uprooted. Aftermath Most of the 37 ships in port were damaged and hundreds of fishing junks and sampans were either wrecked or broken up despite having sought shelter in the bay. At this time Hong Kong did not have its own weather observatory and many people were expecting the storm from a different direction, while others were caught off guard and either shipwrecked or lost their homes. A few false typhoon alerts had been announced earlier in the year. The next morning, the Praya scene from west to east was heart-rending: one could easily find boats capsized and corpses floating and drifting on the water with some bodies washed ashore by the high tides. The sizeable Stonecutters' Island Gaol was left in ruins and both the Police Courts and Victoria Gaol were unroofed. The damage overall was considered \\"incalculable\\". Ernst Eitel recounted how many of the European and Chinese houses were ruined and became roofless; big trees were unrooted and corpses were found in the ruins and started surfacing at the waterfront from the wrecked ships. A visitor arriving on a steamer from Peking during the typhoon reported that the waterfront was nearly swept away, hardly a tree was left standing in the Botanical Gardens and many buildings were found roofless and in ruins. People were hastily burying the dead for the heat was intense and there was great concern over the outbreak of contagious disease.Mrs Hugh Fraser, (1911) A Diplomat's Wife in Many Lands. Hutchison & Co.: London. Vol 2, Chapter XXIII, Two weddings and a voyage to the East : in the wake of a typhoon, p397-400. Controversy Captain Superintendent of Police Walter Meredith Deane attracted severe criticism for ordering his men confined to barracks rather than to risk rescue of the crews on the wrecked vessels Leonor and Albay. Refusing calls for a public inquiry, Governor Sir Arthur Kennedy passed all papers on the matter to Secretary of State Lord Carnarvon who affirmed Kennedy's decision.

Biography He was born in Aachen as the son of a Lutheran minister, but moved to the Netherlands, where he became a Lutheran minister in Leiden in 1614.Conradus Viëtor in the NNBW He served there from 1614 to 1617 in the Leiden Lutheran church, where he started their baptismal register.Bijdragen tot de geschiedenis der Evang.-Luthersche Kerk in de Nederlanden, Volume 5, 1841 He succeeded Henricus Justini, who had served only one year after the death of Bernhardus Aernoldi (or Muyners or Muykens). Arnoldi/Muykens/Muyners had been a Lutheran minister in Brussels and had fled to Aachen during the Protestant Reformation, where he may have influenced the young Vietor. After setting up the infant baptism registration in Leiden, Vietor moved to Haarlem in 1617 where he served in their new Lutheran church. He began a long-drawn-out argument with the Mennonites there about the pros and cons of infant baptism, which started when a woman from his congregation married a Mennonite and left his church to join her husband's Doopsgezinde \\"Block\\". He went there to persuade her to come back and spoke \\"from ten in the morning until late in the evening\\", attracting quite a crowd of curious Mennonites in the process. Finally someone from Amsterdam was brought in to shut him up, promising him another chance to air his views, but this never happened and the rumor spread that he had \\"lost his argument\\". Piqued, he wrote a booklet in response, further explaining his \\"six reasons to baptise\\" and including the five other reasons that he had prepared for his second chance to air his views, which had never been granted.Summarisch ende waerachtich verhael van 't beginsel eener t'samen-sprekinghe van den Doop der Christenkinderen, door occasie ghehouden tusschen sommighe van de secte der wederdoopers, genoemt nieuwe Vlaminghen ofte van den Block binnen Haerlem, ende Conradum Vietorem, Prediger van de Christelycke Ghemeente, toeghedaen de Confessie van Augsburch aldaer,by Vietor, Amstelredam (publisher Pieter Jansz Slijp), 1628 Four years later, Pieter Jansz Mooyer, a Mennonite leader in Amsterdam (and probably the same person who stopped his passionate speech in Haarlem) wrote an answer to this booklet.Wederleg van Conradi Vietoris Bewijs- redenen voor der Martinisten kinderdoop, dienende tot antwoord op syn (soo hy 't noemt) Summarisch ende waerachtich verhael etc., by Moyer, Haarlem 8 folio, 1632.

Two wire terminals at the upper end of the apparatus are available for attaching the wire ends of telephone lines. Use The field telephone 50 is used by all communication troops of the Swiss Army for both point-to-point connections and landlines. For the first variant, two field telephones are connected with telephone wire. In the second version the phone is connected to lines specially reserved for the army. Such a linked phone is accessible from any telephone. When connected to army common Switchboard 85 all phone numbers can be called. If only a normal telephone connection is available, the phone can be coupled with the supplementary Army dealing phone 53 (ATF53). The ATF 53 is technically identical to the FTF50. However, it is not weather resistant and more suitable for bunker cabling due to its metal housing. Reasons for using The advantages of the field telephone 50 is its compact and lightweight design, its ability to withstand heavy loads through bumps, blows or weather.

History The race has assumed the history of the Port Adelaide Cup after the closure of Cheltenham Park Racecourse in 2009. The race was the principal long distance race of the Port Adelaide Racing Club. It was held initially in the Christmas holiday period. However, after the demise of the club in 1975 and later the closure of the track where the race was predominantly held the race had lost its prestige when it was downgraded to a Listed race in 2003. The current SAJC has had less stability with the scheduling of the race having it run in February several times in the last 10 years. There existed a race in the South Australian racing calendar that was actually named the Queen's Cup that had its own identity but was sporadically run.

But by next year the race was missing from the carnival and was not seen again until 1936 when Donaster won the race over the same distance. After the World War II the race was renewed in 1948 when Valcurl was victorious. However, the next time the race was run in 1954 the race was known as the Queen's Cup and the winner's trophy was presented by Queen Elizabeth II who was present in Adelaide. The name of the race has since been called the Queen's Cup. The race has maintained its Group 3 status even though it has been run sporadically. In 1990, 2003, and 2008 the race was held at Cheltenham Park. The 1996 December race was run over a distance of 2000 metres and in 2008 the distance was 2414 metres.

Begun as a castle, it was protected by a moat. It was the residence of the Princes and Dukes of Anhalt from 1244 to 1847, and now belongs to a foundation for the preservation of sites in Saxony-Anhalt. The composer Johann Sebastian Bach was employed there by Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. The palace is one of the locations for Köthen's biannual Bach festival. Since the 19th century, the palace has housed an important bird collection which was sold to Frederick Ferdinand, Duke of Anhalt-Köthen by the ornithologist Johann Friedrich Naumann.  History  Köthen castle was built from 1156 to 1160 on an earlier island castle controlled by the Ascania Counts of Ballenstedt. The town of Köthen was an important trade hub in the realm of the House of Ascania during the reign of Albert the Bear. The castle burned in 1547, leaving only its northern portion. it was renovated into a Baroque palace over the late 16th and then 17th centuries. More renovations, in the interiors, were made in the Neoclassical style from 1821 to 1833. The building in the town center was the residence of the Princes and Dukes of Anhalt from 1244 to 1847. After 1603, it was the seat of the Anhalt-Köthen line. In 1806, the principality was elevated to duchy. With the death of Duke Henry in 1847, the Anhalt-Köthen line of the House of Ascania became extinct. Engraving of the property c. 1650 In the 17th century, the palace was the seat of the Fruitbearing Society, an early society for the promotion of the German language.  Bach at Köthen  Spiegelsaal, now Bachsaal Johann Sebastian Bach worked in Köthen from 1717 to 1723 as Hofkapellmeister of Prince Leopold. Bach's first wife Maria Barbara died in Köthen in 1720. His second wife Ana Magdalena was employed at the court as a singer at the time of their marriage in 1721. Bach worked on important instrumental works during these years, including the Brandenburg Concertos and the first book of The Well-Tempered Clavier. The court was Reformed, therefore sacred music was not required, but Bach composed a series of secular cantatas such as Der Himmel dacht auf Anhalts Ruhm und Glück, BWV 66a, for the prince's birthday, and Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV 134a for New Year's Day. After the Bach family moved to Leipzig in 1723, Bach continued to write occasional pieces for the court for a few years until the prince died. Grounds The grounds of Schloss Köthen is divided into three portions – the Schlosspark and the other and inner areas. The inner area stands on top of the original castle and is separated from the rest of the castle grounds by a moat crossed by three bridges. Located next to the entrance to the castle grounds is the Prinzessinhaus (Princess's House), built in 1779. It served as the Hofmarschalls residence until 1847. As of 2018, the building is used as office space for Köthen Culture and Marketing GmbH, Köthener Bach GmbH, and the . The building also houses a bus driver's lounge. Outer buildings The outer area of the palace is made up by the Marstall (Royal stable), Reithalle (Riding hall), and the Remisenhaus (coach house). The stables were rebuilt along the from 1757 to 1767 according to Rococo designs by Emanuel Lebrecht Rothe. The building is two stories tall and has on its exteriors mansard roofs and risaliten emblazoned with an escutcheons for the stable gates. Horses were kept privately here until 1945. Since 2010, part of the Bach museum has taken up the ground floor. The Reithalle was built by . It was destroyed by fire in 1940 and rebuilt as a concert hall and inaugurated on 29 March 2008. The coach house was built in 1833 by according to plans by Bandhauer. Along with the Reithalle, the Remisenhaus is an event venue. A plaque located outside the building is dedicated to Bandhauer. Inner buildings The Johann-Georg and Ludwig buildings seen from the south. The Johann-Georg-Bau (John-George building), across the moat to the east from the outer buildings, was a gatehouse in the original castle. It was remodeled in 1597 at the behest of Prince John George I, and again in 1670 for Prince Emmanuel Lebrecht, but still retains its Renaissance-era round arch. The building was destroyed in 1944 during World War II. The Ludwigsbau (Ludwig building) was built in the style of Upper Silesian castles and has Italiante influence in its plan. Museums The Reithalle contains most of the Bach museum, though part of the museum is also extant on the ground floor of the Marstall. The upper floor of the Ferdinandbau houses the Naumann-Museum, an ornithological museum dedicated to Johann Friedrich Naumann founded in 1835. The museum contains about 1300 items, spread out over 113 showcases. They include taxidermied bird specimens, personal effects of Naumann's, engravings of birds, and his hunting and fishing equipment. In 2015, the Federal Government recognized the Naumann- Museum as a \\"nationally valuable cultural heritage\\" (National wertvolles Kulturerbe).

While returning home one night, he encounters a young woman, Leela (Madhubala), who, for unexplained reasons, is roaming the streets. A storm breaks out and Shyam lets Leela spend the night at his place. Shyam and Leela fall in love. A little later, Leela gets acquainted with a rani (queen) (Durga Khote). After Leela leaves Shyam's place, she takes refuge with the rani at the rani's haveli. The widowed rani's only son, the musically talented Kumar (Premnath), falls in love with Leela. For the sake of her son's happiness, the rani would like Leela to become her bahu. However, Leela tells them that she is in love with Shyam and both Kumar and his mother, the rani, end up accepting that. Through the rani, Leela even manages to get a painting of Shyam's entered in a competition through which Shyam attains fame. Leela and Shyam decide to travel to Shyam's village to have their wedding. But just as Leela is about to join Shyam, she is kidnapped in front of the rani's haveli by a former suitor from whom she had been running away, and who wants to force Leela to marry him and keeps her prisoner. It turns out later that while trying to prevent the kidnapping, Kumar was seriously hurt, even though nothing of the sort is actually shown on the screen.

At that meeting, the villains are overpowered by Shyam, Kumar and others. During the struggle, Kumar is shot and wounded. The police arrive to take the overpowered villains into custody.

Existed from 1963 until its closure in 2019, it was the first vocational school that served in the former City of Scarborough in which the school tailored for students with life skills or pursue career in the industry. The school's motto was Flourish Through Industry. The school merged with David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute in 2019, after which it was demolished with the former race track was replaced by the new school building. Bendale was located on the eastern corner of Midland Avenue north of Lawrence Avenue East. History Origins The history of Bendale Vocational School begins on November 7, 1961 when the Scarborough Board of Education approved a building application for the new $2,392,880.00 vocational school in Scarborough. http://www.metropolicyarchive.ca/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/HSS-1146450-1961D_MSBT-Minutes-1961.pdf At a February 13, 1962 school board meeting, the Scarborough Board of Education purchased a 13.319 acre site for a junior vocational school fronting Midland Avenue north of Lawrence Avenue East at a cost of $229,000.http://www.metropolicyarchive.ca/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/HSS-1146450-1962D_MSBT-Minutes-1962.pdf The school began construction that same year and opened on September 3, 1963 as its first occupational school. The building was designed by the architects Craig, Madill, Abram and Ingleson. At the cost of $2,392,880.00, it was built to accommodate 14 shops for boys, 9 shops for girls, 14 classrooms, 1 music room, cafetorium, a double gymnasium and library.http://www.metropolicyarchive.ca/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/HSS-1146450-1961D_MSBT-Minutes-1961.pdf Before the school existed, most of the technical courses were done at local collegiate institutes in Scarborough or Danforth Technical School and Jarvis Junior Vocational School in East Toronto. From its inception, the school's programs were expanded from two years to four designed for students transferring from Grade 8 as first year pupils and failing students from regular collegiates. However, in 1965, the Scarborough Board of Education opened Tabor Park Vocational School and Bendale would later forged the model for special school delivery over the next 40 years with the openings of Sir Robert L. Borden Secondary School (1965) and Timothy Eaton Secondary School (1971). It then became Bendale Secondary School in 1971-72 school year. The school's inaugural principal was Edward Monkman and its vice-principal was Jean McConnell. It had 21 teachers in its first year. In 1987, Bendale S.S. celebrated its 25th anniversary and the school was renamed to Bendale Business and Technical Institute. Merger, closure and redevelopment The Toronto District School Board passed staff's recommendation in February 2009 to consolidate Bendale with David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute on nearby Lawrence into one school that would be housed in a renovated Bendale. The recommendations were based on a report done by the accommodation review committee considering what should be done with Bendale, Thomson and Donwood Park Public School. The committee recommended a kindergarten to Grade 12 campus on the 38-acre property (that also includes Highbrook Learning Centre) with the surplus land to be sold to pay for the new school. Based on costs consideration, staff recommended the board renovate Donwood and change it from a kindergarten to Grade 6 to a K-8 school, while a deep retrofit be undertaken at Bendale.http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/35249-public-board-to-merge- bendale-and-thomson-high-schools/ Toronto Lands Corporation, the realtor arm of the TDSB, declared 7.6 acres of Bendale BTI surplus in June 2012.?Disposition of Midland-Lawrence Redevelopment - TCDSB With the school planned to be demolished upon completion of the new building in late 2019, the proposed 140 townhouse subdivision are to be built on the Bendale site along with the extension of Brockley Road to Midland Avenue.http://www.thomsonforever.ca/2012/11/25/thomsons-fate-is-sealed/ The proposal was condemned by the local community, particularly over the loss of green space and over residents' impressions that they were told the Thomson site would be used for a school and that they were initially promised an urban farm. Per regulation 444/98, other public agencies should be given the right to make an offer before the property is placed on the open market. Midland Park Community Association, a residents' group in Scarborough, and the Greater Bendale Advocacy Team (GBAT), formed by Mark Weiser, protested the TDSB's plans for townhouses on the Thomson site, resulting in a decision by Scarborough Community Council to place a hold on any further sale or development on either school site pending community consultation. The TDSB appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board. At a protest rally organised by GBAT in February 2015, more than 160 signs were distributed. In May 2015 the local councillor, Michael Thompson, announced that an agreement had been reached with the school district to reserve almost 3 acres of the site for community uses, including a daycare centre that is to be part of the new school; many felt this was insufficient. The city eventually approved the purchase of 2 acres of the site under this plan. In April 2017, the new Thomson school building was built on its old playing field that took 31 months to complete. The combined school, under its project name, Lawrence Midland Secondary School, was designed in conjunction with the architectural firms of ZAS Architects and Taylor+Smith. Bendale B.T.I. held its farewell reunion on June 1, 2019 and the final day of regular classes took place on June 13, 2019. The last graduates emerged on June 27, 2019. Colin Dye was the school's final principal. With the opening of the new Thomson building in December 2019, demolition of Bendale began shortly after and was completed at the end of January 2020. The school’s former playing field was retained by the TDSB. Administration at the time of closure * Principal: Colin Dye (transferred to Drewry Secondary School) * Vice-Principal: Annamaria Mazzaferro (transferred to North Toronto Collegiate Institute) * Vice- Principal: Zoran Pejovic (transferred to Woburn Collegiate Institute) Academics and programs Bendale B.T.I. offered various vocational and technical courses throughout its 57-year existence ranging from automotives, culinary, hairstyling, electricity, plumbing, welding, construction, and green industries. It also offered academic courses such as English, science, mathematics, geography, and history in applied or open levels.http://www3.tdsb.on.ca/SharedApp/SchoolPageLayout/4112_4pageLayout.pdf It was a semestered secondary school covering grades 9 to 12 and formerly grade 13 (renamed to Ontario Academic Credit) until 2003. The school also offered arts and cooperative education programs. In partnership with FoodShare, Bendale had the largest urban organic farm garden in Canada. Following the merger of the school with David and Mary Thomson, most of its technical courses were integrated into the new school such as construction woodworking, communications, culinary arts, greenhouse/landscaping, hairstyling and industrial design. The automotive, electrical and manufacturing courses were discontinued upon the closure of the school though these similar programs are offered at nearby schools such as Winston Churchill, Cedarbrae, Woburn or the larger Danforth. Recognition In February 2010, Bendale principal Cindy Zwicker-Reston became one of Canada's Outstanding Principals Award handed out by The Learning Partnership.https://www.toronto.com/community-story/48202-bendale-bti- principal-wins-national-award/ Notable staff *Sheldon Benoit - CFL player, Bendale teacher See also *List of high schools in Ontario References External links *Bendale Business and Technical Institute *TDSB Profile Category:High schools in Toronto Category:Schools in the TDSB Category:Educational institutions established in 1963 Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2019 Category:1963 establishments in Ontario Category:2019 disestablishments in Ontario Category:Defunct schools in Canada Category:Toronto Lands Corporation Category:Education in Scarborough, Toronto ","title":"Bendale Business and Technical Institute"},{"id":"39346393","text":"William Wilson was an English professional footballer who played as a right back.

Nash conducted the first anthropological study of a factory in a Third World country, and his expertise in modernization of developing nations led to his fieldwork in Guatemala, Mexico, Burma, Iran, and Malaysia.  Early life and education  Nash was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1924. He received his bachelor's degree from Temple University in 1949 and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1955. In 1951, he married June C. Bousley, a fellow graduate student in anthropology at the University of Chicago. After completing her master's degree in 1953, she joined him in Guatemala for fieldwork. In 1960 and 1961, Manning and June Nash conducted fieldwork in Burma, collaborating on research relating to marriage, family, and population growth.  Research and work  Nash's anthropological studies predicted the impact corporations and governments would have on people in villages around the world, which would later be referred to as third world countries. From 1958-1963, Nash was editor of the journal on developing nations, Economic Development and Cultural Change. He served on the faculty of the University of California, Los Angeles and at the University of Washington. In the 1950s, he was one of the first anthropologists to join the faculty of a business school when he was hired to teach for the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. Nash returned to Chicago in 1957 as an assistant professor. He became a full-time faculty member in the department of anthropology 1968, and he served as chairman of the department from 1988—1991. ;Nash's core elements of ethnicity: # kinship - \\"presumed biological and descent unity of a group\\" # Commensality - \\"the propriety of eating together\\" # common cult - \\"a value system beyond time and empirical circumstance\\"Petersen, William, Michael Novak, and Philip Gleason. \\"Manning Nash: Core Elements of Ethnicity.\\" Concepts of Ethnicity.

Facts  Provisional sentence had been claimed on two surety bonds. The feature of the litigation which brought it before the court was that neither bond contained an acknowledgment by the defendant that she was indebted to the plaintiff in a specific amount; nor did either bond contain an unequivocal promise by her to pay the plaintiff a definite sum.  Issue  The question confronting the court was whether such a bond could support a claim for provisional sentence.  Law  The leading case in this area of the law was Union Share Agency Investment Ltd v Spain. \\"It is the essence of the doctrine of provisional sentence,\\" the court held in that case, \\"that the acknowledgement of debt or the undertaking to pay should be clear and certain on the face of the document itself, and that no extrinsic evidence should be required to establish the indebtedness.\\" In the case of Bee-Jay Ltd v Knights-Trench, the court found that it was \\"fundamental that a document, to support a claim for provisional sentence, must be clear and certain as to the indebtedness [.... T]he indebtedness cannot be clear and certain if the amount thereof is uncertain.\\" According to the court in Lagerwey v Rich and Others, > One starts with the proposition that provisional sentence, being an > extraordinary remedy whereunder the plaintiff enjoys special and important > advantages, is granted only in a case which falls strictly within a > particular class. It is granted only when the plaintiff has a claim for the > payment of money supported by strong prima facie proof in the form of a > liquid document which the defendant has signed, or to which he is deemed to > have given his assent. A document is liquid, in the context of an action for > provisional sentence, only if it reflects unequivocally a present > indebtedness by the defendant in a specific sum of money.  Judgment  After considering these authorities, the court held that provisional sentence could not be granted on a surety bond which, while limiting the surety's liability to a prescribed maximum, covered a principal indebtedness in an indefinite amount, without even acknowledging that any at all existed. No subsequent certificate, as provided for in the bond, indicating the amount of the indebtedness, could cure the intrinsic illiquidity of such a document. Didcott J thus took a stand against the expansion of the provisional-sentence procedure, focusing on its disadvantages and oppressive byproducts. The procedure is recognised, however, as a commercial necessity, since most of the time defendants do not actually have a defence.

Facts  The plaintiff claimed provisional sentence against the defendant on a covering mortgage bond. In terms of the bond, the defendant held himself \\"bound unto (plaintiff) in the sum of R160 000 as a continuing security up to but not exceeding the principal sum in respect of [...] monies lent and advanced and/or to be lent and advanced.\\" At the time of the execution of the bond, no money had been lent to the defendant. Clause 18 of the bond provided that, should the defendant \\"fail to make payment of any monies payable\\" to the plaintiff, then \\"all capital and interest\\" would immediately be due and payable. In terms of clause 21 of the bond, \\"a certificate signed by the [...] authorised officer [...] of the [plaintiff] specifying the amount owing by the [defendant] to the [plaintiff] and further stating that such amount is due, owing and payable [...] shall be sufficient proof of the amount of such indebtedness and of the fact that the sum is due, owing and payable for the purpose of obtaining provisional sentence.\\" The plaintiff filed a certificate in terms of clause 21, but the plaintiff's affidavits revealed that the amount certified as owing was excessive and incorrectly calculated. Some eight months after a loan, secured by the bond, had been made to defendant, the plaintiff and the defendant agreed that the defendant's loan account with plaintiff should be converted into an overdraft facility. In terms of a letter signed by defendant, which governed the terms of repayment of the overdraft, the terms of payment under the bond were varied.  Argument  The defendant contended: * that the covering bond was not a liquid document; * that no reliance could be placed on the certificate in terms of clause 21 of the bond; and, on the merits, * that it had not been shown that payment of the defendant's indebtedness was actually due.  Judgment  The court held that the covering mortgage bond was not a liquid document, as the acknowledgment of indebtedness therein was conditional upon future advances of sums of money. The contention that the certificate could not be relied upon because it reflected an excessive amount as owing was relevant to a defense on the merits, but not relevant to the issue of liquidity. The bond sued on, while not a liquid document, had been rendered liquid by reason of the certificate, and was adequate to support an action for provisional sentence. In spite of the above, the court found that plaintiff had failed to discharge the onus resting upon it to prove that the amount claimed was due and payable. Provisional sentence was therefore refused.  Conclusion  Despite the above, the court found that plaintiff had failed to discharge the onus resting on it of proving that the amount claimed was due and payable. Provisional sentence was thus refused. An appeal took the form of Barclays Western Bank v Pretorius.  References  * Western Bank Ltd v Pretorius 1976 (2) SA 481 (T).

Xeno nucleic acids (XNA) are synthetic nucleic acid analogues that have a different sugar backbone than the natural nucleic acids DNA and RNA. As of 2011, at least six types of synthetic sugars have been shown to form nucleic acid backbones that can store and retrieve genetic information. Research is now being done to create synthetic polymerases to transform XNA. The study of its production and application has created a field known as xenobiology. Although the genetic information is still stored in the four canonical base pairs (unlike other nucleic acid analogues), natural DNA polymerases cannot read and duplicate this information. Thus the genetic information stored in XNA is \\"invisible\\" and therefore useless to natural DNA-based organisms. Background The structure of DNA was discovered in 1953. Around the early 2000s, researchers created a number of exotic DNA-like structures, XNA. XNA is a synthetic polymer that can carry the same information as DNA, but with different molecular constituents. The \\"X\\" in XNA stands for \\"xeno,\\" meaning stranger or alien, indicating the difference in the molecular structure as compared to DNA or RNA. Not much was done with XNA until the development of special polymerase enzyme, capable of copying XNA from a DNA template as well as copying XNA back into DNA. Pinheiro et al. (2012), for example, has demonstrated such an XNA-capable polymerase that works on sequences of ~100bp in length. More recently, synthetic biologists Philipp Holliger and Alexander Taylor, both from the University of Cambridge, managed to create XNAzymes, the XNA equivalent of a ribozyme, enzymes made of DNA or ribonucleic acid. This demonstrates that XNAs not only store hereditary information, but can also serve as enzymes, raising the possibility that life elsewhere could have begun with something other than RNA or DNA.  Structure  This image displays the differences in the sugar backbones used in XNAs compared to common and biologically used DNA and RNA. Strands of DNA and RNA are formed by stringing together long chains of molecules called nucleotides. A nucleotide is made up of three chemical components: a phosphate, a five-carbon sugar group (this can be either a deoxyribose sugar—which gives us the \\"D\\" in DNA—or a ribose sugar—the \\"R\\" in RNA), and one of five standard bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine or uracil). The molecules that piece together to form the six xeno nucleic acids are almost identical to those of DNA and RNA, with one exception: in XNA nucleotides, the deoxyribose and ribose sugar groups of DNA and RNA have been replaced with other chemical structures. These substitutions make XNAs functionally and structurally analogous to DNA and RNA despite being unnatural and artificial. XNA exhibits a variety of structural chemical changes relative to its natural counterparts. Types of synthetic XNA created so far include: * 1,5-anhydrohexitol nucleic acid (HNA) * Cyclohexene nucleic acid (CeNA) * Threose nucleic acid (TNA) * Glycol nucleic acid (GNA) * Locked nucleic acid (LNA) * Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) * FANA (Fluoro Arabino nucleic acid) HNA could be used to potentially act as a drug that can recognize and bind to specified sequences. Scientists have been able to isolate HNAs for the possible binding of sequences that target HIV. With cyclohexene nucleic acid, research has shown that CeNAs with stereochemistry similar to the D form can create stable duplexes with itself and RNA. It was shown that CeNAs are not as stable when they form duplexes with DNA. Implications The study of XNA is not intended to give scientists a better understanding of biological evolution as it has occurred historically, but rather to explore ways in which we can control and even reprogram the genetic makeup of biological organisms moving forward. XNA has shown significant potential in solving the current issue of genetic pollution in genetically modified organisms. While DNA is incredibly efficient in its ability to store genetic information and lend complex biological diversity, its four-letter genetic alphabet is relatively limited. Using a genetic code of six XNAs rather than the four naturally occurring DNA nucleotide bases yields endless opportunities for genetic modification and expansion of chemical functionality. The development of various hypotheses and theories about XNAs have altered a key factor in our current understanding of nucleic acids: that heredity and evolution are not limited to DNA and RNA as once thought, but are simply processes that have developed from polymers capable of storing information. Investigations into XNAs will allow for researchers to assess whether DNA and RNA are the most efficient and desirable building blocks of life, or if these two molecules were chosen randomly after evolving from a larger class of chemical ancestors.  Applications  One theory of XNA utilization is its incorporation into medicine as a disease- fighting agent. Some enzymes and antibodies that are currently administered for various disease treatments are broken down too quickly in the stomach or bloodstream. Because XNA is foreign and because it is believed that humans have not yet evolved the enzymes to break them down, XNAs may be able to serve as a more durable counterpart to the DNA and RNA-based treatment methodologies that are currently in use. Experiments with XNA have already allowed for the replacement and enlargement of this genetic alphabet, and XNAs have shown complementarity with DNA and RNA nucleotides, suggesting potential for its transcription and recombination. One experiment conducted at the University of Florida led to the production of an XNA aptamer by the AEGIS-SELEX (artificially expanded genetic information system - systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) method, followed by successful binding to a line of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, experiments in the model bacterium E. coli have demonstrated the ability for XNA to serve as a biological template for DNA in vivo. In moving forward with genetic research on XNAs, various questions must come into consideration regarding biosafety, biosecurity, ethics, and governance/regulation. One of the key questions here is whether XNA in an in vivo setting would intermix with DNA and RNA in its natural environment, thereby rendering scientists unable to control or predict its implications in genetic mutation. XNA also has potential applications to be used as catalysts, much like RNA has the ability to be used as an enzyme. Researchers have shown XNA is able to cleave and ligate DNA, RNA and other XNA sequences, with the most activity being XNA catalyzed reactions on XNA molecules. This research may be used in determining whether DNA and RNA's role in life emerged through natural selection processes or if it was simply a coincidental occurrence.

He converted to the Roman Catholicism taking a name Jean-Louis in the monastic life of the Carthusians.  Life  Louis von Nicolay was a grandson of Baron Ludwig Heinrich von Nicolay, the first owner of the famous Monrepos estate. He was born on January 7, 1820 in Copenhagen, and was the son of Baron Paul von Nicolay, Russian extreme envoy to the court of Denmark, and his mother was Alexandrina Simplicius de Broglie (the granddaughter of Victor François de Broglie). His brother, Alexander, was also a well-known figure in the Caucasus and left a memoir. Nicolay in 1833 entered in the Sea Cadet Corps (Russia) and at the end of the course which was in December 1837 he was a warrant officer in the Baltic Fleet, and as one of the most academically talented students and the body was left for improvement in the military marine sciences in the officer class at the Naval College, later transformed into the Nicholas Naval Academy. In 1841, with the rank of lieutenant, Nicolay was transferred to the Black Sea Fleet, which found a patron in the person of Admiral Mikhail Lazarev. In 1842, Nicolay was in international voyages in the Mediterranean Sea in the crew of the corvette \\"Andromache\\", and in 1844, leaving the naval service, joined the military land designation in Dragoon Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich regiment with the rank of lieutenant, but soon entered in the General Staff Academy (Imperial Russia), where he graduated from the course in 1846. Since 1847 began active service on Baron Nicolay in the Caucasus, which lasted for twenty years, with a short break. This break occurred in 1849 as a result of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, when Nicolay was appointed to consist in the main headquarters of Field Marshal Ivan Paskevich, and then to the rank of adjutant was from 1849 to 1850 in Vologda Governorate, where he was charged with monitoring the recruitments. In 1849, for bravery in battle with the Hungarians, Nicolay received a Gold Sword for Bravery. Returning to the Caucasus, Nicolay was appointed first in the winter expedition against the Highlanders, then transferred to the Kabardian Regiment, which has since been inextricably linked its activities. Nicolay was appointed commander of the 3rd Battalion and was given to him the command of the regiment's and remained in that position until December 1857. During the seven-year period (1850–1857) Nicolai, most of the time was in the marches. Particularly difficult was his position during the Crimean War, when because of the diversion of troops in Asia Minor was to be expected from Shamil particularly decisive action. On 26 December 1853 Nicolay was awarded the Order of St. George 4th degree. In recompense of these great feats of courage and bravery, rendered in 1853 in the cases against the Highlanders, and especially for the difference extended to the 17th of February in the assault and capture of the enemy's position on heavily fortified river Mechik on 3 October 1854 Baron Nicolay, with 6 companies of managed to break under the His-sous many thousands of Imam Shamil, who tried to invade the Kumyk plane on 6 December of the same year made a major general in the suite with the appointment of His Majesty. From 1857 to 1860 Nicolai was the commander in chief of the Caucasian Army and took part in the famous campaign of 1859, which ended in the Shamil's capture. On January 28, 1860 Nicolay was promoted to lieutenant general with the appointment of the head of the Caucasian Grenadier Division, and in 1862 he was appointed adjutant-general, and was awarded a gold sword decorated with diamonds with the inscription \\"For Bravery\\". In the rank of chief of the Caucasian Grenadier Division of Baron Nicolay remained until 1867, when he left on vacation abroad. The following year he retired.  Religion  Nicolay was extremely religious, and this feeling is particularly developed in it for the full-time of the dangers of service in the Caucasus. The result of this religious sentiment was the transition of Baron Nicolay in 1868 from Protestantism to Catholicism, and then, in retirement, to the tonsure. In 1868 Baron Nicolay became a monk of the Order of Carthusians by the name of Jean- Louis, shorn in the monastery of the Grande Chartreuse, near Grenoble in France, where he died on January 21 ( February 2 new style) 1891.  Diary  Baron Nicolay's diary from the period of the Hungarian campaign (1849) was printed in his lifetime in the Russkaya Starina in 1877 (Vol. XX, Vol. 9, 10 and 11).

Casse (born February 14, 1961) is a Thoroughbred racehorse trainer whose most notable horses include 2015 American champion turf mare Tepin and Canadian Horses of the Year Sealy Hill (2007), Uncaptured (2012), Lexie Lou (2014), Catch A Glimpse (2015) and Wonder Gadot. He has won eleven Sovereign Awards for outstanding trainer in Canada and has been the leading trainer at Woodbine Racetrack 14 times. In 2019, he won his first American Classic with War of Will in the Preakness Stakes. Background Casse was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on February 14, 1961, to Norman Casse. He grew up in Ocala, Florida where his father ran Cardinal Hill Farm and was one of the founders of the Ocala Breeders' Sales Company. His brothers are John and Justin Casse, who are also involved in the racing industry. At age eight, Casse accompanied his father to the spring meet of the original Woodbine Racetrack. In 1973, father and son traveled to Churchill Downs and saw Secretariat win the 1973 Kentucky Derby. Casse's third wife, Tina, is the Direct of Operations for Casse Racing, a company they founded in 2002. Although they spend much of the year at Woodbine Racetrack in Canada, their home base is Moonshadow Farm in Florida. Racing career Casse started to run his father's training operation in 1976 at the age of 15 and received his training license in Massachusetts when he was 17. He received a Kentucky trainer's license at age 18 and won his first race at Keeneland with Joe’s Coming on April 14, 1979. His first stakes winner was Amalie, who won the 1979 Indian Maid at Sportsman’s Park. He won the trainer's title at the Churchill Downs Spring meet of 1988, and also won four training titles at Turfway Park. He was Calumet Farm's private trainer for two years. In the 1990s, Casse became the private trainer of Harry Mangurian and ran Mockingbird Farm, which at the time had 900 horses in the Ocala area. Manguarian dispersed most of his stock in 1999 and 2000, and the farm was bought by Eugene Melnyk, who renamed it Winding Oaks and become one of Casse's majort clients. Casse officially moved his center of operations to Woodbine Racetrack in 1998 though he had already been racing there for several years. Since moving to Canada, Casse has won a record nine Sovereign Awards as Canada's top trainer. In 1999, Casse trained his first Sovereign Award winning horse, Exciting Story, who was champion two year-old colt. Two years later, Exciting Story would also earn Casse his first Grade I stakes win, the Metropolitan Handicap, at odds of 56-1. The next year, Casse captured his first Woodbine training title with 69 wins. Among his stakes winners was Added Edge, who was named Canada’s champion two-year-old. Casse had developed a reputation for training good two-year-olds and selling them once they won, which kept him from winning most major races. This started to change around 2005 as Casse's client list started to grow. Casse earned his first Sovereign Award for outstanding trainer in 2005, and had his first Kentucky Derby starter, Seaside Retreat. The next year, his horses won eleven stakes races, a personal best, including the Woodbine Oaks, a prestigious race for Canadian-bred three-year-old fillies. In 2007, Casse won his second Woodbine training title and second straight Sovereign Award. He trained his first Canadian Horse of the Year, Sealy Hill, who won the Canadian Triple Tiara and several other stakes races. In 2008, Sealy Hill would finish second in the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf and was eventually inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. Casse earned his 1,000th win on August 9, 2008 at Woodbine with Laragh. In 2011, Casse won his fifth straight training title at Woodbine Toronto with a record 119 victories, which was nearly double the number of wins compiled by the runner-up. Among them were 13 stakes victories including the Grey Stakes, in which Casse saddled the top three finishers. He also earned his first Grade I win since 2001 when Pool Play won the Stephen Foster Stakes at odds of 36-1. In 2012, Casse ranked 7th in North America by trainer earnings. Uncaptured became his second Canadian Horse of the Year when, at the age of two, he won the Clarendon, Vandal, and Swynford stakes at Woodbine and the Iroquois and Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes at Churchill Downs. On July 6, 2014, Casse scored his first victory in the Queen's Plate, Canada's premier race, with filly Lexie Lou. She was later named Canadian Horse of the Year while Casse won his seventh Sovereign Award. Casse would finish the year ranked #6 in North America by earnings. Casse (back right) and son Norman (right) with Tepin at the 2016 Breeders' Cup In 2015, Casse scored his first two Breeders' Cup wins, with Catch a Glimpse in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf, and with Tepin in the Breeders' Cup Mile. Tepin would be awarded the 2015 Eclipse Award for champion turf mare, while Catch A Glimpse was named the Canadian Horse of the Year. Unfortunately, a promising colt, Danzig Moon, who had finished fifth in the Kentucky Derby and was the favourite for the Queen's Plate, suffered a catastrophic breakdown during the Plate Trial. \\"If you knew why it happened, you could try to do it better or do it differently. So now we’ve got this fear and worry that it could happen again. It’s going to take a long time to be able to watch races because they (horses) are part of your family.\\" That year, Casse was the #4 ranked trainer in North America by earnings. In 2016, Casse won several major stakes races with Tepin, including the prestigious Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in England. Other major graded stakes winners included World Approval, Lexie Lou, Kaigun, Catch A Glimpse, Noble Bird and Pretty City Dancer. On May 14, he won his 2,000th race at Gulfstream Park, even though he himself was located at Woodbine at the time. \\"It's a great testimony to our team, which I'm very proud of,\\" said Casse. At the 2016 Breeders' Cup, Classic Empire established himself as a leading contender for the 2017 Kentucky Derby by winning the Juvenile. In 2016, Casse was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

Early years John Lancelot Todd was born on 10 September 1876 in Victoria, British Columbia. He was of Anglo-Irish origins. His father was Jacob Hunter Todd, a prosperous businessman, and his mother was Rosanna Wigley, a teacher. He attended Upper Canada College, where one of his teachers was the author Stephen Leacock. In 1894 he was admitted to McGill University. He gained a B.A. in 1898 and a medical degree in 1900. He then spent some time in laboratory work, examining bacteriological and pathological specimens at the Royal Victoria Hospital. African expeditions In 1901 Todd was admitted to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). In 1902 he went on an LSTM expedition to The Gambia and Senegal, with Joseph Everett Dutton. The expedition was supported by Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, which facilitated the stay in Dakar, in the French colony. The two men left Liverpool on 21 August 1902, and established themselves at Cape St. Mary, near Bathurst, where they treated patients and conducted research, working long hours. Once they dissected a horse that had been killed by trypanosomiasis. They studied diseases related to trypanosoma, and investigated sanitation in the main population centers. John Lancelot Todd with a monkey used in experiments in the Congo expedition 1903–05 In 1903 Todd and Dutton accepted an invitation by King Leopold II of Belgium to research the connection between trypanosoma and sleeping sickness in the Congo Free State. The twelfth expedition of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine left for the Congo Free State on 13 September 1903. Dutton and Todd were accompanied Cuthbert Christy. Christy went back to England in June 1904, while Todd and Dutton went upstream to Stanley Falls, which they reached late in 1904. There they demonstrated what caused tick fever, and how it was transferred between humans and monkeys. Both Todd and Dutton caught the disease, but were well enough to continue traveling, and reached Kasongo on 9 February 1905. Dutton's health then declined quickly. He recorded his symptoms until too weak, after which Todd continued the record. Dutton died at Kasongo on 27 February 1905. Todd completed the program of study in respect for Dutton's memory. He left the Congo to return to England via Tanganyika in April 1905. The LSTM appointed Todd an assistant lecturer on his return, and in 1906 appointed him director of tropical diseases at the Runcorn Research Centre. Todd and two other scientists from the LSTM, Rupert Boyce and Ronald Ross, were invited to meet King Leopold II in August 1906. Todd said of this visit, \\"After we'd finished telling the old man how to make the Congo healthy and promised to administer a lovely coat of whitewash to his character in the eyes of the English, he created Boyce, Ross and myself officers of his Order of Leopold II...\\" In 1907 Todd accepted the position of Associate Professor of Parasitology at McGill. He established a laboratory in Sainte-Anne-de- Bellevue, Quebec, at Macdonald College. Todd left on another LSTM expedition to conduct further studies of trypanosomes in the Gambia in January 1911. He was accompanied by Simeon Burt Wolbach of Harvard University. Later career Todd married Marjory Clouston (1882–1945) on 20 December 1911. She was the daughter of Edward Clouston, General Manager of the Bank of Montreal. They settled on a farm in Senneville, Quebec, and were to have three daughters. During World War I Todd served in the Canadian Army Medical Corps. From 1916 to 1919 he was Canadian Pension Commissioner, and had lasting influence on the way in which Canadian pensions are administered. After the war he led an expedition for the American Red Cross to find a way to contain a violent outbreak of typhus in eastern Europe. Todd resigned from McGill in 1925, partly due to poor health and partly to administrative disputes. He worked for Canada's National Research Council, setting up the Institute of Parasitology at Macdonald College in 1932. From 1934 to 1939 Todd and his family lived in England. With the outbreak of World War II they returned to farming in Senneville. Marjory Todd died in February 1945. John Lancelot Todd died on 27 August 1949 in a car accident in Sainte Anne de Bellevue, a few miles from home.

Hunsingo was one of three Ommelanden. It is bordered to the north by the Wadden Sea, to the east Fivelingo, in the west to the Westerkwartier and Friesland and in the south, Gorecht. The region corresponds to the current municipalities De Marne, Eemsmond, the majority of the municipalities of Bedum and Winsum and the former municipality of Middelstum. The name means area (go or gau) of the Hunze River. The Hunze no longer exists after the construction of the Reitdiep canal. Originally the Hunze followed a different course with its mouth at Pieterburen on the Wadden Sea, and divided Hunsingo into two parts.Cultural Entities (The Netherlands): Hunsingo, Lancewadplan, 2008 Hunsingo was the first member of the Ommelander Union. The main town was Winsum where the Ommelanden for a short time held their own meetings. The area is largely similar to the Hoogeland region although that is more a geographical indication, while Hunsingo was an administrative unit. The three Wadden islands of Rottumerplaat, Rottumeroog and Zuiderduintjes belong to this area. History Windmill \\"Hunsingo\\" in Onderdendam, now a bed and breakfastHistory windmill 'Molen Hunsingo', accessed May 9, 2013 Like Fivelingo, Hunsingo was originally a Frisian region. Ludger was assigned in 787 the mission areas including the regions of Hugmerthi (Humsterland), Hunusga and Fivilga. The monastery of Fulda received in the ninth century a donation in Middelstum \\"in pago Hunergewe in regione fresonum\\". In 1057 the region of \\"Hunsingo\\" is mentioned as part of a county donated by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, under the regency of his mother, to the Archbishop of Hamburg, Adalbert. Before that, the Saxon noble house of Brunonen had the fief of the county. In the eleventh century, coins were minted in Winsum, which suggests that Winsum was the capital of the region. In later times Onderdendam became the central place of the region. The population always spoke an East Frisian, but, by uniting the city of Groningen with the surrounding district, East Frisian has merged with Low Saxon (Platduuts) of the city, although the language of the surrounding countryside still retains a strong East Frisian substrate. In the 13th century laws were recorded in Latin or in the Hunsingoer dialect of East Frisian.The Frisian Language and Literature: A Historical Study, Thomas Hewett Waterman, Finch & Apgar, 1879, pp. 33-36http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/bork001nede01_01/bork001nede01_01_0004.php In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Hunsingo was the first member of the Ommelander Union. The most important place in Hunsingo, Winsum, was for a brief period where the Ommelander jonkers held their meetings. Winsum was originally therefore a settlement with an urban character. The proximity of the city of Groningen, however, did not allow it the opportunity to become a real city. The region was originally divided into two or three subdistricts, which coincided with the oldest seenddistricts (sees or mother parishes). Of these the parishes of Usquert and Leens were the oldest: *Marne (capital Leens) *Westerambt (western district, chief town Baflo, with the subdivisions Halfambt (north of the Winsumerdiep, capital Baflo) and a southern half, which divided into Upgo or Ubbega (between Winsumerdiep and Reitdiep, capital Winsum) and Middag (south of the Reitdiep, capital Garnwerd) *Oosterambt (eastern district, capital Usquert) De Marne was originally part of the region Humsterland (Westerkwartier); however, the emergence of the Reitdiep and the exploitation of the underlying peat led to it becoming a separate seenddistrict. The district, Middag, is also recognized in Westerkwartier since the sixteenth century. The peat area of Innersdijk (around Bedum) was separated from the Oosterambt around the fourteenth century, while De Marne in the fifteenth century temporarily disintegrated into an eastern and a western part. The various districts were characterized by considerable autonomy, the joint representatives gathered in Onderdendam, that was exactly on the border of the main subdivisions.H. van Lengen, 'Tota Frisia: Sieben Seelande und mehr', in: dez. (red.), Die friesische Freiheit des Mittelalters: Leben und Legende, Aurich 2003, pp. 61-68 In 1659 a new classification was ordered by the States General: *Marnsteradeel *Halfambsteradeel, consisting of the subdivisions Halfambt and Ubbega *Oostambtsteradeel, consisting of the subdivisions Oosterambt and Innersdijk Between 1830 and 1880, 5,900 people emigrated from Hunsingo, almost all going to the United States. This was two- thirds of all emigrations from the entire province of Groningen. Most of the emigrants from Hunsingo ended up in western Michigan, followed by Chicago and a smaller group going to Lafayette, Indiana.Faith and Family, Dutch Immigration and Settlement in the United States, 1820-1920, Robert P. Swieringa, Holmes and Meier Pub., 2000, Hunsingo was also the name of the water authority in the area, charged with the management of water levels, canals, dykes and storm barriers. The Hunsingo water board existed from 1856 to 1994 when it was merged into the Noorderzijlvest water board. Character Hotel called \\"Wapen van Hunsingo\\" (coat of arms of Hunsingo) in Pieterburen In Hunsingo, many borg (fortified great houses) were found. This does not imply that there was more nobility in Hunsingo than in the remainder of Groningen. Many of the borgs were destroyed, both by officials and by the dissatisfied people. A famous borg in Hunsingo is the Menkemaborg at Uithuizen. Another is Verhildersum at Leens. Hunsingo is characterized by meadows, mounds and dikes. Hunsingo has expanded by reclaiming land that initially is filled in by the natural settlement of sedimentary clay by the sea near the dikes (endiking). This area above the old dikes is also known as the Groningen Hogeland (high land). When the new deposits had reached sufficient size, that area was then secured by the construction of a new dyke. Today Hunsingo is one of the main economic arteries of Groningen. This is due to the Eemshaven on the eastern point and the Lauwersmeer National Park and shrimping village of Zoutkamp on the western point. The shrimp company Heiploeg is located in Zoutland. This is the largest shrimp supplier in Europe.

It depicts the wars between the Irish Uí Bhriain and the English de Clares for control of the Thomond region of Ireland, drawing from contemporary sources for details. Though it has been praised for its accuracy and historical value, it is not a strictly scholarly work: it incorporates verse as well as prose, and includes fantastical elements such as the banshee in the historical events it describes.Westropp, Thomas. \\"Normans\\"  Content   Historical material  Cathreim is written mostly in prose, describing the wars between the Irish and the English in Thomond , now mainly County Clare. The time period spanned by this work stretches from 1194 to 1318. Specific, highly significant events in the work are portrayed in verse. It is split into two volumes: the first volume primarily covers the war between Toirdhealbhach Mór Ó Briain and Thomas de Clare from 1275 to 1285, and the second details the war between Murchad Ó Briain and Richard de Clare, from 1310 to Richard's defeat in the Battle of Dysert O'Dea in 1318. Accompanying these volumes are prefaces that describe the history prior to the main events. The preface to the first volume discusses the start of the English invasion of Ireland, and the subsequent struggle of the various dynasties to remain independent. The preface to the second volume tells of the establishment of an Irish domain in the English region and its subsequent fragmentation in the years between 1287 and 1310.Westropp, Thomas. \\"Historic Character\\"  Mythological material  The work is also known for its vivid description of the mythological banshees incorporated into the historical narrative. There are a few specific banshees that are described in the text; all three are portrayed as women, one beautiful—representing the \\"Sovereignty of Erin\\", and whose place in folklore faded over time—and one or two that are ugly, representing its despair. The ugly hags, surrounded by mutilated bodies and described in grotesque detail, foretell doom of armies, Irish and Norman alike, to their commanders, who do not heed the warning and press on to their eventual destruction. These tales in Cathreim are the last known stories involving banshees from the Clare area until the Memoires of Lady Fanshawe, published about 300 years later in 1665; despite this, local legends surrounding banshee involvement in the battles of Thomond survived orally to modern times. This depiction of the banshee washing the bodies and armor of the doomed in blood has drawn parallels to the Gaelic tradition of the Washer in the Ford.Westropp, Thomas: \\"Folklore\\"Schoepperle, Gertrude  Scholarly study  An imperfect copy of Cathreim dating from 1509 has been preserved in the library of the Royal Irish Academy. A newer copy was produced by Aindrias Mac Cruitín in 1721 at the request of Teige Mac Conmara; this copy was held in the library at Trinity College in Dublin. In 1929, a translation of the work into English by Standish Hayes O'Grady was published posthumously by the Irish Texts Society; O'Grady had died in 1915.

A parasol-wing Dewoitine-style fighter, it was not successful, and only one was built. Design and development The Letov Š-22's designer Alois Šmolik briefly interrupted his series of biplane fighters with this Dewoitine-influenced parasol-wing monoplane. It was powered by a Škoda L W-12 water-cooled engine, with three banks of four cylinders, driving a two-blade propeller. This engine was a Škoda version of the Hispano-Suiza 12Gb, with a new lower crankcase. The Š-22 was an all-metal design. The wing was straight-edged with constant chord and blunt wing tips. It was braced to the lower fuselage with faired N-struts on each side. The engine was tightly cowled, the fairing following each cylinder bank individually. The pilot sat in an open cockpit just behind the wing trailing edge, and behind him the round fuselage tapered only gently. The braced tailplane, carrying split elevators, was mounted at the top of the fuselage and a straight-edged fin carried a round-topped rudder which extended to the keel. The Š-22 had a fixed, conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on V-struts. It was to be armed with a pair of synchronised Vickers machine guns firing through the propeller arc. The Š-22 first flew in March 1926, but by the end of April Letov had decided it was not viable, and development ceased.

The cemetery is listed by CONDEPHAAT () for its historical, cultural and social importance for the state of São Paulo. History Background When the German professor of law Julius Frank died in 1841, his students decided to bury him within the faculty. The plan was agreed upon and supported by councillor Brotero. However, since Julius Frank was a Protestant, the Roman Catholic bishop at first protested this decision, because the envisioned burial place was located at the \\"sacred ground\\" of the former Convent of the Franciscan Friars. Councillor Brotero eventually managed to get the bishop's consent. The incident triggered both Catholic and Protestant foreigners living in São Paulo, to build the Cemitério dos Estrangeiros (\\"Cemetery of the Foreigners\\") in the Paulistano neighbourhood of Luz in 1844. The cemetery was closed after only a few burials, because the land near São Caetano Road had to make way for a wider Tiradentes Avenue. Protestant Cemetery In answer to the closure of the Foreigner's Cemetery, Lutherans, Anglicans and some Presbyterians founded the Associação Cemitério dos Protestantes (\\"Association of the Cemetery of the Protestants\\") to create a new burial site. In accordance with 's plans, an administration building and chapel were built. The first burial took place in 1858.

It is named after its founder who established the company in 1984.\\"An Interview with James Currey\\", The Africa Oxford Initiative, University of Oxford, 22 March 2018. It publishes on a full spectrum of topics—including anthropology, archaeology, history, politics, economics, development studies, gender studies, literature, theatre, film studies, and the humanities and social sciences generally—and its authors include leading names such as Bethwell Ogot and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o.  History  Named after its founder, the company was established in 1984 when James Currey, originally from South Africa, left his position at Heinemann Educational Books to set up an Africa-focused publisher.Nourdin Bejjit, \\"James Currey interview: AWS, Chinua Achebe, & all those Books\\", African Writing Online, No. 4, August 2005. At Heinemann, working with Chinua Achebe, Currey had spent more than a decade pioneering Heinemann's African Writers Series (AWS), the set of volumes that was a crucial factor in expanding the reach of African literature after World War II, particularly in English..: \\"Heinemann Press […] entered Africa's literary sphere in 1958, when it published Chinua Achebe's classic and best-selling Things Fall Apart, the book that gave birth to modern African literature. This publication not only set the foundation for the African literary canon but also provided the impetus for the foundation of the African Writers Series, which started in 1962, with Achebe as its editorial advisor.\\".Saeed Husaini, \\"James Currey: The Godfather Of The African Novel\\", Daily Nation (Kenya), 22 August 2015. Currey cut his publishing teeth at the Cape Town outpost of Oxford University Press, as well as by spending time moonlighting for The New African, a liberal publication he followed into exile in London when it was stamped on by the Apartheid authorities in 1964.: \\"The New African was published in Cape Town from 1961 to 1964 and, in exile in London, from 1965 to 1967. I suggested the name in reflection of the left-wing London journal The New Statesman, which influenced our group of young members of the South African Liberal Party. Our editorial policy was that we were interested in work on Africa in general and in South Africa in particular. Exciting things were happening to the north which were an antidote to the frustrations of South Africa.\\". In 1986, speaking at a Royal African Society symposium on the state of publishing in Africa, Currey described what he called \\"an academic book famine\\", down in part to the profit-driven reaction of the head offices of the big publishing houses, such as Heinemann and Longman, to negative economic developments on the continent during previous years. Currey spoke with pride of how small publishers like the James Currey imprint were the ones who picked up the slack as best they were able..

For over thirty years he contributed one or more papers to the Companion to the Almanac. Another periodical to which Dodd contributed was Household Words, run by Charles Dickens.

It exists in multiple recensions, the earliest of which — \\"Recension A\\" — consists of just over 100 canons drawn from a variety of sources, most predominantly the ninth-century Frankish collection of penitential and canon law known as the Collectio canonum quadripartita. The author of Recension A is currently unknown. Other recensions also exist, slightly later in date than the first. These later recensions are extensions and augmentations of Recension A, and are known collectively as \\"Recension B\\". These later recensions all bear the unmistakable mark of having been created by Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester and archbishop of York, possibly sometime around the year 1008, though some of them may have been compiled as late as 1023, the year of Wulfstan's death. The collection treats a range of ecclesiastical and lay subjects, such as clerical discipline, church administration, lay and clerical penance, public and private penance, as well as a variety of spiritual, doctrinal and catechistic matters. Several \\"canons\\" in the collection verge on the character of sermons or expository texts rather than church canons in the traditional sense; but nearly every element in the collection is prescriptive in nature, and concerns the proper ordering of society in a Christian polity.

This new form of movement has brought local African dance onto a global stage.  Background  The word \\"tofo\\" means body shaking in the local Mozambique language of Maputo, the area the members of this group are from. The group creates this expression of movement through their combination of dance and music. Both the Kwaito music and Pantsula dance originated in South Africa as ways of expression during the time of Apartheid.  Kwaito  The music genre that the Tofo Tofo dance troupe dances to is called Kwaito music, a form of South African house music. This genre started developing in the 1990s. The term Kwaito is derived from the Afrikaans word kwaii, which means strict or angry, although in more common and contemporary use the word is a loose translation of the English term cool.Kwaito, 26 February 2013. wikipedia. Web. Retrieved 1 May 2013. The language used in Kwaito music is that of South African township slang, called Isicamtho. The origination and development of Kwaito has had a significant impact on South African culture to the extent that it is seen as a lifestyle as much as a music genre. The blend of black urban style and modern influences contribute to its constant evolution – much like South Africa itself.Kwaito: Ghetto Rough – A Tale of Rags to Riches, 2013. South African Tourism. Web. Retrieved 2 May 2013. One of the first Kwaito singles to become a big hit in South Africa was \\"Kaffir\\" by artist Arthur Mafokate. This single illustrated the freedom of expression resulting from political liberation in South Africa. The first Kwaito group was Boom Shaka. Kwaito music has a distinct sound. It is an urban sound that is richly textured and expressive. Its dance beat has roots in South African music styles such as mbaqanga and dancehall, as well as house and disco. Typically at a slower tempo range than other styles of the house music that it stems from Kwaito music often contains catchy melodic and percussive loop samples, deep bass lines, and vocals. One distinctive feature of this genre is the manner in which the lyrics are sung, rapped and shouted. Well-known American producer Diplo has described Kwaito as a “slowed-down garage music” most popular among the black youth of South Africa. Kwaito is not performed by a live band. The music tracks are manufactured digitally in a studio, and then played as a backing track on stage.Kwaito: The Voice of Youth, South Africa. Rhythms of the Continent. BBC World Service. Retrieved on 4 May 2013. In Kwaito music, township culture is being celebrated by its youth. In South Africa, close to half of the population is under the age of twenty-one years, Kwaito music has helped shape a spirit of optimism and self- confidence by being the new sound of the township. Kwaito music is about the township, knowing about the township, understanding the township, walking the walk, talking the talk and more importantly, being proud of these things.Kwaito, South Africa History Online. Web. Retrieved on 4 May 2013. Kwaito has been known as the expression of new freedom, and many anti- apartheid chants have been used as lyrics for Kwaito songs. In this sense, Kwaito has led post-Apartheid township culture into the mainstream culture. The lyrics of this genre convey the street language of the townships.  Pantsula  The type of dance that the Tofo Tofo dance troupe use in their movements is called the Pantsula dance. Pantsula became a popular form of dance in the 1980s when it was used as a means of expression during violent Apartheid times in South African townships, starting mainly in the streets of Soweto.Pantsula Dancers, Webster, Alexia. Africa Media Online. 2010. Web. Retrieved 5 May 2013. The dance originated when townships first became exposed to transistor radios and people became aware and intrigued by international pop music trends.Welcome to Pantsula Dance, Pantsula Dance. 2011. Web. Retrieved 8 May 2013. In the 1960s and 1970s, the culture of Pantsula was commonly associated with troublemakers and gangsters- troubled youths who defined themselves with aggressive ways of walking, talking and dancing.Pantsula:South Africa Colors. Web. Retrieved on 7 May 2013. Pantsula dance has slowly migrated out of the townships and has emerged in the commercial area. It remains popular today in townships, cities and built up areas. Pantsula is an energetic and spontaneous expression of the lives of people in the townships. It is described as a flat-footed African tap-and- glide style of dance. The term Pantsula means to waddle like a duck or alternatively to walk with protruded buttocks, which is a characteristic of the dance.Dance Umbrella Kicks Up Its Heels, Joburg. Official Website of the City of Johannesburg. Web. Retrieved on 7 May 2013. In many ways, Pantsula is akin to modern day hip-hop. It is similar to Western-style break dancing for the people in South Africa. They would dance using props, such as brooms, cans or sticks, musical instruments such as large bass drums and dance theatrically as if they were performing on Broadway. The competitive spirits of Pantsula footwork, rhythm and beat were revealed in the streets- characterised by competitions of who could perform the most creative dance of Pantsula. The evolution of Pantsula is shown through the transition from a township thug dance to the fame of the Tofo Tofo dance troupe. Pantsula provides a freedom of expression, free from prejudice. In community life, Pantsula is important because it can keep kids focused and away from bad influences. One example of Pantsula dance having a positive community impact is the dance group, Real Action. This crew has starred in TV commercials, music videos and road shows and also provided mentorship and role models for aspiring young dancers.  Members of the group  The group is led by Mario Abel Buce, known as Kwela, and Xavier Manuel Campione, known as Xavitto, both of whom are widely recognised in Mozambique for their distinctive dance moves.Tofo Tofo Official, About: Biography. 29 September 2013.

Videos of their performances have been put up on YouTube by their audiences to present their talents to a larger, international audience.  Rise to fame  World super-star Beyoncé Knowles came across a YouTube video of this group performing. After five months of searching for these men with help from the US Embassy in Maputo, the Tofo Tofo Dance Group was found and flown out to Los Angeles, California to introduce and instruct Beyoncé and her dancers their native dance moves as well as be a part of Beyoncé’s hit music video, Run the World (Girls).
