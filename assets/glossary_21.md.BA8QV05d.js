Whilst a prisoner of war (POW) in Borneo during World War II he organised a \\"secret university\\" to provide educational opportunities for his fellow prisoners. He founded the first Bell Language School in Cambridge, England in 1955 and later established the Bell Educational Trust, a charity involved in language education. Early life Bell was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College and then at Peterhouse, Cambridge, from where he graduated in 1938 with a first in French and Spanish. He joined the British Army in 1940, was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1941, and was posted to the 48th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment which left England on 3 December 1941, destined for North Africa. It never arrived. On 7 December the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and the British force, of which the Regiment was a part, was diverted to the Far East (see Pacific War). It arrived in Batavia, Java on 4 February 1942. Singapore fell to the Japanese 11 days later, and the Japanese landed on Java at about the same time. When the Dutch forces capitulated to them on 8 March the few British troops on the island, whose role was mainly airfield defence, became POWs. Bell was interned in five different camps before arriving at Batu Lintang camp at Kuching in Sarawak on the island of Borneo in September 1943.The other camps were, in order of his incarceration: Koan School, Batavia; Glodok Gaol, Batavia; Changi Barracks, Singapore; Jesselton Gaol, North Borneo and Sandakan camp, North Borneo (Bell 11‚Äì25) At first the British officers and other ranks were all in the same sub- camp, but after a while the officers were separated out. As he was a 2nd Lieutenant, Bell was housed in the officers' compound. Bell was known by the nicknames \\"Tink\\" and \\"Tinker\\" (a reference to the character Tinkerbell in Peter Pan). =The \\"Kuching University\\"= Bell was largely responsible for conceiving and organising what became known by the prisoners as the \\"Kuching University\\" in the British officers' camp. Under Japanese regulations, prisoners were forbidden to teach, to learn, to compile or possess notes on any subject whatever, or to meet in groups for discussion. The penalty for disobedience was imprisonment or death. Despite this, the university, led by Bell, established classes in seven modern languages (Dutch, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Urdu), as well as subjects as diverse as history, public speaking, navigation, pig-farming, civics, chess and poultry keeping. Bell and his fellow educators compiled text books, led classes and awarded diplomas. Classes were often held in the evenings when dusk or darkness gave some protection against surprise by their captors. Paper for writing exercises and for compiling textbooks was always at a premium: books were fashioned out of paper from soap wrappers, newspaper, the backs of letters and envelopes, and cigarette paper. These were bound into books and often covered with sarong material. This experience was formative in strengthening Bell's interest in language and adult education. In 1946, Bell wrote an account of his time in the camp which was published some 44 years later. It included a passage, written in Cambridge University Library reading room in 1946, which could be said to sum up Bell's vision: Post-war career After the war, as Assistant Secretary of the University of Cambridge Board of Extra-Mural Studies, Bell was actively engaged in the organisation of extension classes and lectures, courses for German ex-POWs, and University vacation courses for students from overseas. In 1948, he became Secretary of the University's committee for re-establishing links with German universities. In 1955, Bell founded in Cambridge the first Bell School of Languages for the teaching of English to foreign students. Further Bell Schools were opened in Norwich (1967 and 1975), Bath (1968) and Saffron Walden (1977). In 1968, he acquired Concord College, where overseas students were prepared for university. In 1972, he converted both these enterprises into Educational Trusts. As of 2012, The Bell Educational Trust (an educational charity) now comprises a business called Bell Educational Services Ltd. and a charitable wing operating under the name the Bell Foundation. Bell was Chairman of the Educational Interchange Council from 1951 to 1979 and was awarded the OBE in 1975. In 1986, he was elected Honorary President of ARELS-FELCO (the association of recognised English Language teaching establishments in Britain). He was Chairman of the Bell Educational Trust from 1988. Bell had a twin brother, Douglas. Frank Bell was married to Elisabeth (daughter of Sir Henry Willink) and they had a son, Nick and a daughter, Tass. He lived in Cambridge for most of his life. With his wife, Elisabeth, he re-visited Kuching in 1984, and was delighted to find the Batu Lintang Teachers' College flourishing on the site of the former POW camp in which he had established the \\"Kuching University\\". After his death in 1989, Elisabeth brought Bell's 1946 account and diary entries from his time at Batu Lintang to publication.

Former Mayor of the Colombian city of C√∫cuta, Norte de Santander and actually is a convicted Murderer. Early life Su√°rez-Corzo was born in Encino, Santander Department to a humble family. He started working at a very young age. At age 11 he left Encino to Bogot√° where he worked on many jobs, including automotive maintenance. In the mid 1970s he then moved to C√∫cuta where he worked in construction, security guard, cab driver and neighborhood community leader. He later became chauffeur of a congressman named Mario Said Lamk Valencia member of the National Salvation Movement led by conservative leader √Ålvaro G√≥mez Hurtado. During this time (1982) he became good friends with √Ångel Uriel Garc√≠a, then Municipal Secretary of Finance and Jorge Garc√≠a Herreros one of the most influential conservative politicians in the region. For the 2001 elections Su√°rez had increased his political influence and power and supported Manuel Guillermo Mora for mayor of C√∫cuta, office for which Mora was ultimately elected. In 2003 Su√°rez then run for Mayor of C√∫cuta and was popularly elected with 127,800 votes. Legal problems =Paramilitarism= On June 29, 2004, Su√°rez was captured in C√∫cuta for having ties with the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) paramilitary group. On January 6, 2005 was set in a trial and accused of meeting with paramilitaries to support them, among them one known by alias of \\"El Gato\\". On March 4, 2005 an attorney appealed the decision and the investigation ended. On April 4, 2007, the demobilized paramilitary John Mario Salazar aka. \\"El Pecoso\\" accused Su√°rez of the being the mastermind behind the assassination of Jos√© Agust√≠n Uribe, who worked for the Government of Norte de Santander as a Judicial Advisor. In May, 2007 Salvatore Mancuso the detained paramilitary leader of the demobilized AUC paramilitary group that he had agreed to support Su√°rez' election for Mayor of C√∫cuta. Su√°rez denied all these allegations saying that these were all lies from a delinquent and that he had never met Mancuso in his life. Another captured paramilitary leader named Jorge Iv√°n Laverde aka \\"El Iguano\\", member of the AUC Frontier Front testified that Suarez-Corzo had asked the AUC paramilitary group to kill as a favor the former adviser to the city of Cucuta, Alfredo Enrique Fl√≥rez. Su√°rez testified for both cases alleging the same defense arguments, declaring himself innocent and unrelated to paramilitary groups. Suerez Corzo accused the emerging paramilitary group √Åguilas Negras of being behind the accusations against him as retaliation for combating them. =C√∫cuta Deportivo= Su√°rez as Mayor of C√∫cuta was supposedly managing the football (soccer) team C√∫cuta Deportivo indirectly overriding the president of this club Angel Uriel Garcia. According to El Tiempo newspaper Su√°rez was supposed to sell part of the team's stocks to the people of C√∫cuta, 8.5% of the total 70%, instead he sold that 70% to his friends. He also authorized C√∫cuta to be exempt of taxes until the year 2010, when the Colombian law only allows 1 year to do so.

It shares its history, and its main building, with the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan's main public museum for art. In 2010 an agreement was signed to move the accademia to a former military barracks, the Caserma Magenta in via Mascheroni, but the move had not happened by early 2017. History The academy was founded in 1776 by Maria Theresa of Austria. In typical Enlightenment fashion, it shared premises with other cultural and scientific institutions ‚Äì the astronomical observatory, the Orto Botanico di Brera, the Scuole Palatine for philosophy and law, the Gymnasium, laboratories for physics and chemistry, the Biblioteca di Brera, the agricultural society and, from 1806, the Pinacoteca di Brera or art gallery. These were housed in the Palazzo Brera, which was built in about 1615 to designs by Francesco Maria Richini, and until the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773 had been a Jesuit college. The courtyard, with a bronze copy of Antonio Canova‚Äôs statue of Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker The academy Like other state-run art academies in Italy, the Accademia di Brera falls under the Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca, the Italian ministry of education and research. In accordance with presidential decree 212 dated 8 July 2005, it awards first- and second-level degrees, specialised degrees, master's degrees and doctorates. The accademia has three departments: the department of visual arts, with courses in decorative art, graphic art, painting and sculpture; the department of design and applied art, which has courses in art restoration, design for business, new technologies of art and scenic design; and the department of communication and education in art, with courses in conservation of cultural heritage and in art education. It has about 3,800 students, including about 1,000 foreign students (mostly postgraduates). It participates in the ERASMUS programme, and exchanges students and teachers with institutions in other countries in Europe and elsewhere. The picture gallery The picture gallery of the accademia, now the Pinacoteca di Brera, was started in 1806, in Napoleonic times. Large numbers of paintings were brought to Milan after the suppression of the convents by Napoleon. The fa√ßade of the church of Santa Maria in Brera of the former monastery was torn down and the nave of the church divided horizontally; the upper floor became the Napoleonic rooms of the art gallery of the Accademia, which opened in 1809 as the Reale Galleria, and the lower floor housed the sculptures of the museum of antiquities. A Sala dei Moderni, which held contemporary works, was started in 1806 by Giuseppe Bossi. The Pinacoteca became independent of the accademia in 1882, though both remain in Palazzo Brera. Academics and alumni Alumni of the academy include the playwright Dario Fo, recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature; and the Futurist painter Carlo Carr√†, who also taught at the academy from 1939 to 1952. Others who have taught at the Brera include the Venetian painter Francesco Hayez, professor of painting from 1822 to 1880; and the architect and writer Camillo Boito, who was professor of architecture from 1860 to 1909, and for part of that time also president of the academy.

CHK2 is involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Mutations to the CHEK2 gene have been linked to a wide range of cancers.  Gene location  The CHEK2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 at position 12.1. Its location on chromosome 22 stretches from base pair 28,687,742 to base pair 28,741,904.  Protein structure  The CHK2 protein encoded by the CHEK2 gene is a serine threonine kinase. The protein consists of 543 amino acids and the following domains: * N-terminal SQ/TQ cluster doman (SCD) * Central forkhead- associated (FHA) domain * C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain (KD) The SCD domain contains multiple SQ/TQ motifs that serve as sites for phosphorylation in response to DNA damage. The most notable and frequently phosphorylated site being Thr68. CHK2 appears as a monomer in its inactive state. However, in the event of DNA damage SCD phosphorylation causes CHK2 dimerization. The phosphorylated Thr68 (located on the SCD) interacts with the FHA domain to form the dimer. After the protein dimerizes the KD is activated via autophosphorylation. Once the KD is activated the CHK2 dimer dissociates.  Function and mechanism  The CHEK2 gene encodes for checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), a protein that acts a tumor suppressor. CHK2 regulates cell division, and has the ability to prevent cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled manner. When DNA undergoes a double-strand break, CHK2 is activated. Specifically, DNA damage-activated phosphatidylinositol kinase family protein (PIKK) ATM phosphorylates site Thr68 and activates CHK2. Once activated, CHK2 phosphorylates downstream targets including CDC25 phosphatases, responsible for dephosphorylating and activating the cyclin- dependent kinases (CDKs). Thus, CHK2‚Äôs inhibition of the CDC25 phosphatases prevents entry of the cell into mitosis. Furthermore, the CHK2 protein interacts with several other proteins including p53 (p53). Stabilization of p53 by CHK2 leads to cell cycle arrest in phase G1. Furthermore, CHK2 is known to phosphorylate the cell-cycle transcription factor E2F1 and the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) involved in apoptosis (programmed cell death).  Association with cancer  The CHK2 protein plays a critical role in the DNA damage checkpoint. Thus, mutations to the CHEK2 gene have been labeled as causes to a wide range of cancers. In 1999, genetic variations of CHEK2 were found to correspond to inherited cancer susceptibility. Bell et al. (1999) discovered three CHEK2 germline mutations among four Li‚ÄìFraumeni syndrome (LFS) and 18 Li‚ÄìFraumeni-like (LFL) families. Since the time of this discovery, two of the three variants (a deletion in the kinase domain in exon 10 and a missense mutation in the FHA domain in exon 3) have been linked to inherited susceptibility to breast as well as other cancers. Beyond initial speculations, screening of LFS and LFL patients has revealed no or very rare individual missense variants in the CHEK2 gene. Additionally, the deletion in the kinase domain on exon 10 has been found rare among LFS/LFL patients. The evidence from these studies has suggests that CHEK2 is not a predisposition gene to Li‚ÄìFraumeni syndrome. = Breast cancer = Inherited mutations in the CHEK2 gene have been linked to certain cases of breast cancer. Most notably, the deletion of a single DNA nucleotide at position 1100 in exon 10 (1100delC) produces a nonfunctional version of the CHK2 protein, truncated at the kinase domain. The loss of normal CHK2 protein function leads to unregulated cell division, accumulated damage to DNA and in many cases, tumor development. The CHEK2*1100del mutation is most commonly seen in individuals of Eastern and Northern European descent. Within these populations the CHEK2*1100delC mutation is seen in 1 out of 100 to 1 out of 200 individuals. However, in North America the frequency drops to 1 out of 333 to 1 out of 500. The mutation is almost absent in Spain and India. Studies show that a CHEK2 1100delC corresponds to a two-fold increased risk of breast cancer and a 10-fold increased risk of breast cancer in males. A CHEK2 mutation known as the I157T variant to the FHA domain in exon 3 has also been linked to breast cancer but at a lower risk than the CHEK2*1100delC mutation. The estimated fraction of breast cancer attributed to this variant is reported to be around 1.2% in the US. Two more CHEK2 gene mutations, CHEK2*S428F, an amino-acid substitution to the kinase domain in exon 11 and CHEK2*P85L, an amino-acid substitution in the N-terminal region (exon 1) have been found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Suggestion of a Hispanic founder mutation has also been described. = Other cancers = Mutations to CHEK2 have been found in hereditary and nonhereditary cases of cancer. Studies link the mutation to cases of prostate, lung, colon, kidney, and thyroid cancers. Links have also been drawn to certain brain tumors and osteosarcoma. Unlike BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, CHEK2 mutations do not appear to cause an elevated risk for ovarian cancer.  Meiosis  CHEK2 regulates cell cycle progression and spindle assembly during mouse oocyte maturation and early embryo development. Although CHEK2 is a down stream effector of the ATM kinase that responds primarily to double-strand breaks it can also be activated by ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related) kinase that responds primarily to single-strand breaks. In mice, CHEK2 is essential for DNA damage surveillance in female meiosis. The response of oocytes to DNA double-strand break damage involves a pathway hierarchy in which ATR kinase signals to CHEK2 which then activates p53 and p63 proteins.

This moth is endemic to the North Island of New Zealand. It is New Zealand's largest moth, with a wingspan of up to 150 mm. It spends the first five to six years of its life as a grub in a tree trunk (common host plants are the puriri tree (Vitex lucens) and putaputawƒìtƒÅ (Carpodetus serratus), but puriri larva also inhabit non- native species such as Eucalyptus), with the last 48 hours of its life as a moth. Footage has been taken of a puriri moth chrysalis hatching over a period of one hour and forty minutes.  Taxonomy  Aenetus virescens female LCR Aenetus virescens male LCR Male puriri moth, wings at rest This species was first described in 1843 by Edward Doubleday in the book Travels in New Zealand by Ernst Dieffenbach. Doubleday named the species Hepialis uirescens. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species under that name in his book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. The moth is also commonly called the ghost moth or pepetuna.  Description  The puriri moth is easily identifiable by its large size and vivid forewing colouration. Adults exhibit sexual dimorphism. With a wingspan that averages 100mm (for males) and 150mm (for females), it is New Zealand's largest native winged insect. The forewings generally exhibit a range of bright greens, with patterning of brownish black in females and a white pattern in males. The hind wings are a pinkish colour. There is colour variation within the species, with some individuals exhibiting blue-green, bright yellow, brick-red or even albino wing colouration.LandCare New Zealand The moths are nocturnal forest-dwellers. In the past males frequently swarmed lights in areas inhabited by people, however with forest clearing, this has become less common. Puriri moths are predated upon by birds, including kaka and moreporks (who tend to feed on the adult moths when they congregate around lights), native bats, cats and brushtail possums. The larva also are traditionally eaten by MƒÅori, who flushed the caterpillars (known as ngutara) out of their tunnels with water.  Life cycle  The caterpillar stage may last up to six years. The adult moths emerge mostly from September through to November. Adults live only a few days at most, generally being most active at dusk and night time when they mate and lay eggs. The adults do not have any mouthparts and cannot feed, so are sustained only by larval food reserves. Puriri moth carved on pare on display at the New Zealand Arthropod Collection at Landcare Research, Auckland. The female moths oviposit around 2000 eggs during their adult lifetime. The eggs are randomly laid on the forest floor. The eggs are initially yellow-white, and darken to black, before hatching (normally after about 2 weeks). Initially the larva live under decaying wood close to the ground where they feed on bracket fungi. After about a year of living on the forest floor, the larva move into their host tree, and construct a burrow in the growing trunks and limbs of their host plants. This tunnel is often described as seven-shaped. Approximately 13mm in diameter it penetrates into the tree approximately 40-50mm and then runs perpendicularly down the tree for around 150mm at its largest. The tunnel is gradually expanded as the larva grows and moults. The tunnel is protected and camouflaged by a covering web constructed of silk and wood chips. \\"An elementary manual of New Zealand entomology; being an introduction to the study of our native insects\\", George Vernon Hudson (1892). The larva emerges at night to feed on callus tissue around the entrance to the burrow, where it is hidden under a camouflaged web of silk (often matching the bark in colour and texture). The larva reaches a length of approximately 100mm before it pupates. The pupal stage lasts 4 to 5 months before the pupa wriggles up the shaft of the tunnel and, protruding through the covering web, emerges by splitting through the skin of the pupa. Footage has been taken of a puriri moth chrysalis hatching over a period of one hour and forty minutes. The moth spends the last 48 hours of its life as a moth. = Host plants = The moth is named after the puriri tree (Vitex lucens), a common host plant, however it also lives in a range of native and non-native forest trees. The putaputawƒìtƒÅ (Carpodetus serratus) is another common host plant, which is named after the wƒìtƒÅ that often shelter in the old holes vacated by puriri moth larva. The larva also inhabit native beech, titoki, kanuka and maire and smaller trees such as manuka, wineberry and houhere. Introduced plants such as eucalyptus, English oak, silver birch, lemon, apple and willow are also used as hosts. Host plants include: * Smoky bracket * Alectryon excelsus, tƒ´toki * Aristotelia serrata, wineberry * Buddleja davidii, Buddleia * Carpodetus serratus, marbleleaf References External links * Puriri moths discussed on RNZ Critter of the Week 23 Dec 2016 * Timelapse video of a puriri moth hatching from its chrysalis. * 3D model of a puriri grub (pepetuna).

History The fort was originally designed by Captain William Crossman, with later modifications by Captain (later Maj General) Edmund Frederick Du Cane,Freddy Woodward, (1996) The Historic Defences of Plymouth, Cornwall County Council, p176 Construction commenced in 1859 and was completed in 1865. When originally designed it had provision for 35 large guns. By 1893 the guns consisted of five RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns and nineteen RML 64-pounders, together with a number of 32 Pounder Smooth Bore Breech Loading (SBBL) guns.The National Archives WO196/31, Ports and harbours Western District: Revision of Coast defence armaments prior to June 1894 Rifle butts below the fort It was also designed with barrack accommodation for 2,000 men in two-tiered casemates at the rear of the Fort. In the event, far smaller garrisons have been based there, with only six gunners in 1882. Early in the 1900s it became an infantry battalion headquarters with 14 officers and 423 other ranks, and from 1903 was used for rifle training. Tregantle is infamous within the armed forces because many of the rifle ranges located there slope steeply down towards the sea. These ranges are still in use, primarily by personnel located at HMS Raleigh. Tregantle was vacated after World War I until 1938, when it was used as the Territorial Army Passive Air Defence School. During World War II it was used first as the Army Gas School and from 1942 as US Army accommodation. Since 1945 the fort, and the cliffs, beach and sea to the south-west, have been in use by the British Armed Forces. It is currently part of the Defence Estate and used for Royal Marine training. It is also used by specialist Royal Naval EW teams (FEWSG) for the monitoring of ship's communications in the area. FEWSG operate specialist coded transmission scenarios from Tregantle Fort and surrounding areas for Naval warships to decode at sea as part of an ongoing training schedule. In January 2020 a Royal Marine died in a training exercise off the beach. Tregantle Down high-angle battery A few hundred yards southeast of Tregantle Fort, along the north side of the road, there was constructed in the 1890s a battery of four 9-inch muzzle-loading guns on \\"high-angle\\" mountings. These were intended to fire shells along a high curving trajectory to more easily penetrate the decks of ships at sea to the south. Although the guns and mountings are long gone and the site is filled in, the area is clearly recognisable in aerial photographs.

It originated as a converted Roman Catholic Church in 1876. The church was replaced in 1887 by a purpose-built theatre, which burnt down in 1910. The theatre was rebuilt the following year, and was refurbished in 1994. It continues in use as a theatre, as of 2013 it is managed by HQ Theatres. The theatre is constructed in brick, and adjacent to it is a block containing the entrance and offices. Its interior contains decorated plasterwork. History The theatre stands on the site of a former Roman Catholic Church that had been built to serve Irish immigrants working on the local railway. In 1876 the congregation moved into a larger church in the town. The site was acquired by Thomas Cliffe, a local farmer, and he gave permission for Henry Taylor, a local printer, to convert the church into a theatre. Taylor wanted to have a \\"proper\\" theatre on the site and later built the New Lyceum Theatre, which opened on 21 November 1887. It cost ¬£5,000 () and seated 1,250 people. It was re-fitted in 1908 and changed its name to the Opera House. On 11 March 1910 the theatre was destroyed in a fire, and it was decided to rebuild it on the same site. The new theatre was designed by Albert Winstanley, it seated 850, and opened on 6 October 1911. In the early 1930s it was acquired by Terence Byron, who also owned theatres elsewhere in the country. It was bought in 1955 by Crewe Borough Council who formed a management trust in 1964. It operated, with a varying degree of success, as a repertory theatre. During this time actors and actresses who later achieved fame gained experience in the theatre; these included Glenda Jackson, Richard Beckinsale, Judy Loe, and Lynda Bellingham. In 1982 the management of the theatre moved back from the trust to the Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council. The council redecorated the theatre in 1992, and installed new seating, and in 1994 ¬£1.5 million was spent in rebuilding the facilities in the front of the house and remodelling the gallery. Architecture The theatre is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 6 July 1976. It is constructed in Accrington-type brick with a slate roof. It is three storeys high and has a gabled fa√ßade, divided into five unequal bays. To its left is a two-storey, four-bay building incorporating the entrance and containing offices. Inside the theatre is an auditorium with a dress circle, gallery and boxes. The front of these is decorated with plasterwork, including cartouches and reclining figures. There is more plasterwork decoration on the proscenium arch and the ceiling rose. Present day The theatre arranges a regular programme of plays and shows. There is a restaurant on the premises, and the theatre also arranges exhibitions.

It is a large shrub growing to tall. It has clusters of waxy flowers that are either white or lavender in colour. Each flower consists of five pointed petals and a small \\"crown\\" rising from the center which holds the stamens. The aestivation found in calotropis is valvate i.e. sepals or petals in a whorl just touch one another at the margin, without overlapping. The plant has oval, light green leaves and milky stem. The latex of Calotropis gigantea contains cardiac glycosides, fatty acids, and calcium oxalate. The roots also contain Calotropone Pollination This plant plays host to a variety of insects and butterflies. It is the host plant for Hawaii's non-migratory monarch butterflies. Calotropis is an example of entomophily pollination (pollination by insects) and pollination is achieved with the help of bees. In Calotropis, gynostegium is present (formed by the fusion of stigma and androecium). The pollen are in a structure named pollinia which is attached to a glandular, adhesive disc at the stigmatic angle (translator mechanism). These sticky discs get attached to the legs of visiting bees that pull out pollinia when a bee moves away. When such a bee visits another flower, this flower might be pollinated by the pollinium. Calotropis gigantea (Ankhade) plant with full bloom at Haridwar Uses The flowers are long lasting, and in Thailand they are used in floral arrangements. The extract of flowers and leaves has shown hypoglycemic effect in preclinical studies. They were favored by the Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani, who considered them a symbol of royalty and wore them strung into leis. In Cambodia, they are used in funerals to decorate the urn or sarcophagus and the interior of the house holding the funeral. The fruit is a follicle and when dry, seed dispersal is by wind. In Indonesia its flowers are called widuri. According to the Shiva Purana, the madar flower/crown flower is very much liked by Lord Shiva; therefore the crown flower and its garland are offered to Lord Shiva for peace, prosperity and stability in society.http://www.freepressjournal.in/weekend/mahashivaratri-favorite-plants- of-lord-shiva/798182 The Crown flower is also one of the major parts of the nine astrological trees (Navagrah tree). Calotropis yields a durable fiber (commercially known as bowstring of India) useful for ropes, carpets, fishing nets, and sewing thread. Floss, obtained from seeds, is used as stuffing. Crown flower cotton can also be used to make a pillow. A fermented mixture of Calotropis and salt is used to remove the hair from goat skins for production of nari leather and from sheep skins to make leather which is much used for inexpensive book binding.Singh et al. 1996 Fungicidal which is far effective than oinmentand insecticidal properties of Calotropis have been reported.Ganapathy and Narayanasamy 1993 In India, the plant is common in the compounds of temples and is known as madar in .

Extracts of plant parts such as root, stem, and leaf affect germination and seedling vigor of many agricultural crops.Oudhia and Tripathi 1997, 1999Oudhia et al. 1997, 1998a, b However, extracts of Calotropis failed to produce any detrimental effects on weeds such as Chenopodium album, Melilotus alba, Melilotus indica, Sphaeranthus indicus, and Phalaris minor.Oudhia and Tripathi 1997 =Use as an arrow poison= Many plant and animal extracts have been used as arrow poisons all over the world. In many cases, the poison was applied to the arrow or spear to aid the hunting of prey. Alkaloids are among the most powerful plant poisons, and extracts of Strychnos species are commonly used. Other arrow poisons are commonly cardiac glycosides, which can be found in digitalis, but most of these arrow poisons are derived from plants in the family Apocynaceae. This family includes Calotropis gigantea and the more potent Calotropis procera. The latex of these plants has been used in Africa as an arrow poison. Apocynaceae species often contain a mixture of cardiac glycosides, including calactin, uscharin, calotoxin, and calotropin. These poisons work by inhibiting the sodium-potassium pump, and this effect is especially potent in the cardiac tissues. The cardiac effects can be applied for heart medication, and digitalis has been used as such. However, excessive doses can cause arrhythmia, which can lead to death. =Medical uses= Given the potent bioactivity of calotropin, calotropis gigantea has been used as a folk medicine in India for many years, and has been reported to have a variety of uses. In Ayurveda, Indian practitioners have used the root and leaf of C. procera in asthma and also used in bacterial infection, swelling with redness, boils also and shortness of breath and the bark in liver and spleen diseases. The plant is reported as effective in treating skin, digestive, respiratory, circulatory and neurological disorders and was used to treat fevers, elephantiasis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The milky juice of Calotropis procera was used against arthritis, cancer, and as an antidote for snake bite.Upadhyay RK. Ethnomedicinal, pharmaceutical and pesticidal uses of Calotropis procera (Aiton) (Family: Asclepiadaceae). Int J Green Pharm 2014;8:135-46. However, these reports are of folk uses and more research is needed to confirm the clinical usefulness of the leaves, latex, and bark. Recent studies have displayed use of calotropin as a contraceptive and as a promising cancer medication. In one study of the cancer-fighting properties of Calotropis gigantea, DCM extracts were demonstrated to be strongly cytotoxic against non-small cell lung carcinoma (A549), colon carcinoma (HCT 116), and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2). These extracts show promise as cancer medications and warrant further clinical research. Poisoning Calotropis is a poisonous plant. The active principles are uscharin, calotoxin, calactin, and calotropin. The leaves and stem when incised yield thick milky juice. It is used as an arrow poison, cattle poison (see also Sutari), rarely for suicide and homicide and mostly an accidental poison. The milky latex sap of Calotropis gigantea is a known cause of toxic keratoconjunctivitis and reversible vision loss. Crownflower keratitis is a rare condition and is usually the result of accidental ocular exposure to the sap. During the process of making a Hawaiian lei flower necklace, touching the sap and then touching the ocular surface may result in crownflower keratitis. Damage (poisoning) of the cornea endothelium results in corneal stromal edema and decreased visual acuity. Although there is some permanent damage to the corneal endothelium with decreased endothelial cell count and irregular shape, the remaining corneal endothelial cells usually recover with complete resolution of the corneal edema and a return to normal visual acuity. The condition is usually self-limited and resolves faster with topical steroids. The clinical course of this condition suggests that Calotropis is paradoxically relatively nontoxic to corneal epithelium and highly toxic to corneal endothelium. The painless clinical course may be related to anesthetic properties of Calotropis latex and relatively minor epithelial injury.Wong, W. H.: Crownflower keratoconjunctivitis, Hawaii Med J. 1949;8:339-341.Crawford, H. E. : Crownflower Keratoconjunctivitis, Hawaii Med J. 1958;17:244-245Hani S. Al-Mezaine, Ali A.

Wagoner, Calotropis procera (ushaar) keratitis, American Journal of Ophthalmology, Volume 139, Issue 1, January 2005, Pages 199-202 =Signs and symptoms= Applied to the skin, it causes redness and vesication. When taken orally, the juice produces an acrid, bitter taste and burning pain in throat and stomach, salivation, stomatitis, vomiting, diarrhea, dilated pupils, tetanic convulsions, collapse and death. The fatal period is 6 to 12 hours. Treatment includes stomach wash, demulcents, and symptomatic treatment. Mosquito controlling property Giant calotrope flower in Sindh C. gigantea is reported to exhibit mosquito controlling properties against Culex gelidus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes which serve as vectors for Japanese encephalitis. The aqueous extract of the C. gigantea leaves demonstrated significant larvicidal, repellent and ovicidal activity.Kumar G, Karthik L, Rao KVB, Karti AV, Rahuman AA, Larvicidal, Repellent and Ovicidal activity of Calotropis gigentia against Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex gelidus.

An important phosphorylated form is Œ≥H2AX (140S), which forms when double-strand breaks appear. In humans and other eukaryotes, the DNA is wrapped around histone octamers, consisting of core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, to form chromatin. H2AX contributes to nucleosome-formation, chromatin-remodeling and DNA repair, and is also used in vitro as an assay for double-strand breaks in dsDNA. Formation of Œ≥H2AX H2AX becomes phosphorylated on serine 139, then called Œ≥H2AX, as a reaction on DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). The kinases of the PI3-family (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated, ATR and DNA-PKcs) are responsible for this phosphorylation, especially ATM. The modification can happen accidentally during replication fork collapse or in the response to ionizing radiation but also during controlled physiological processes such as V(D)J recombination. Œ≥H2AX is a sensitive target for looking at DSBs in cells. The presence of Œ≥H2AX by itself, however, is not the evidence of the DSBs. The role of the phosphorylated form of the histone in DNA repair is under discussion but it is known that because of the modification the DNA becomes less condensed, potentially allowing space for the recruitment of proteins necessary during repair of DSBs. Mutagenesis experiments have shown that the modification is necessary for the proper formation of ionizing radiation induced foci in response to double strand breaks, but is not required for the recruitment of proteins to the site of DSBs.  Function  =DNA damage response= The histone variant H2AX constitutes about 2-25% of the H2A histones in mammalian chromatin. When a double-strand break occurs in DNA, a sequence of events occurs in which H2AX is altered. Very early after a double- strand break, a specific protein that interacts with and affects the architecture of chromatin is phosphorylated and then released from the chromatin. This protein, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-beta (CBX1), is bound to histone H3 methylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me). Half-maximum release of HP1-beta from damaged DNA occurs within one second. A dynamic alteration in chromatin structure is triggered by HP1-beta release. This alteration in chromatin structure promotes H2AX phosphorylation by ATM, ATR and DNA-PK, allowing formation of Œ≥H2AX (H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139). Œ≥H2AX can be detected as soon as 20 seconds after irradiation of cells (with DNA double- strand break formation), and half maximum accumulation of Œ≥H2AX occurs in one minute. Chromatin with phosphorylated Œ≥H2AX extends to about a million base pairs on each side of a DNA double-strand break. MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1) then binds to Œ≥H2AX and the Œ≥H2AX/MDC1 complex then orchestrates further interactions in double-strand break repair. The ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 bind to the Œ≥H2AX/MDC1 complex, ubiquitylating other chromatin components. This allows the recruitment of BRCA1 and 53BP1 to the long, modified Œ≥H2AX/MDC1 chromatin. Other proteins that stably assemble on the extensive Œ≥H2AX-modified chromatin are the MRN complex (a protein complex consisting of Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1), RAD51 and the ATM kinase. Further DNA repair components, such as RAD52 and RAD54, rapidly and reversibly interact with the core components stably associated with Œ≥H2AX-modified chromatin. The constitutive level of Œ≥H2AX expression in live cells, untreated by exogenous agents, likely represents DNA damage by endogenous oxidants generated during cellular respiration. =In chromatin remodeling= The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin presents a barrier to all DNA-based processes that require recruitment of enzymes to their sites of action. To allow DNA repair, the chromatin must be remodeled. Œ≥H2AX, the phosphorylated form of H2AX, is involved in the steps leading to chromatin decondensation after DNA double-strand breaks. Œ≥H2AX does not, itself, cause chromatin decondensation, but within 30 seconds of ionizing radiation, RNF8 protein can be detected in association with Œ≥H2AX. RNF8 mediates extensive chromatin decondensation, through its subsequent interaction with CHD4, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex NuRD. Œ≥H2AX as an assay for double-strand breaks An assay for Œ≥H2AX generally reflects the presence of double-strand breaks in DNA, though the assay may indicate other minor phenomena as well. On the one hand, overwhelming evidence supports a strong, quantitative correlation between Œ≥H2AX foci formation and DNA double-strand break induction following ionizing radiation exposure, based on absolute yields and distributions induced per unit dose. On the other hand, not only the formation of distinct Œ≥H2AX foci but also the induction of pan-nuclear Œ≥H2AX signals have been reported as a cellular reaction to various stressors other than ionizing radiation. The Œ≥H2AX signal is always stronger at DNA double-strand breaks than in undamaged chromatin. Œ≥H2AX in undamaged chromatin is thought to possibly be generated via direct phosphorylation of H2AX by activated kinases, most likely diffusing from DNA damage sites.  Interactions  H2AX has been shown to interact with: * BARD1, * BRCA1 * Bloom syndrome protein, * MDC1, * Nibrin, and * TP53BP1.

It is by far the largest subcontractor for Bane NOR and is owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. History The company started out as a division of Norges Statsbaner (NSB), with the construction and maintenance functions dating back to the formation of NSB in 1883. The division was separated from the planning department in 1992 and became part of Jernbaneverket when NSB was split up in 1996 with the name Jernbaneverket BaneService. On 1 January 2005 the company became a separate limited company after the liberal-conservative government wanted to create a market for public tender bids for the maintenance of the railway infrastructure. To do this BaneService had to be separated from Jernbaneverket, much like the separation of Statens Vegvesen and Mesta. The red-green government to follow in 2005 has announced that they will revert the decision to privatise the maintenance of the railway, but BaneService has remained a separate company.

It was disbanded in 1969. World War I It was initially a unit of the Royal Flying Corps and was formed out of the Central Flying School, based at Upavon, Wiltshire. Eight days after, the new unit moved to RFC Lilbourne, near Rugby. The squadron, only for a matter of days led by Lieutenant C A Mercer, came under the command of Major H F A Gordon and started a phase of training at Lilbourne. From September 1917, this became more specifically targeted towards operating in combat when a Programme of Development was received, instructing the unit to prepare for an overseas deployment on 22 December. This training phase saw a number of accidents and incidents, not uncommon in military aviation at that time. On one day, 29 October 1917, the squadron had four aircraft damaged in accidents: two in a mid-air collision, when one aircraft had its propeller damaged, the other lost part of its lower left wing and aileron; one aircraft was damaged when it had to be crash-landed after its pilot became lost; a fourth aircraft was damaged when the pilot crashed at the aerodrome. All incidents are shown in the squadron records as applying to 'A' Flight. The squadron's first fatality occurred when 2nd Lieutenant Rawbone crashed at the aerodrome on 7 December 1917 and died from his injuries on 18 December. =Combat operations= By stages, the unit deployed to France through January 1918; by the 20th, the full squadron complement was based at Liettres and available for operations. Due to bad weather, the first patrols were not sent up until 30 January. Two flights each comprising six machines undertook practice patrols, one along the balloon lines from Boesinghe to Flerbaix and then Bethune to Arras. The first offensive patrols over enemy lines took place on 18 February 1918. On the 20th, all 18 Camels, divided into three 'Flights' patrolled a line between Roeselare and Menin and the first combat report was completed by Captain Gus Orlebar, submitting that an Albatros D.V may have been damaged. It was the start of a combat record that would show ten aces serving in the squadron, including Owen Baldwin, Gavin L. Graham, William Stephenson, William Henry Hubbard, Emile John Lussier, Robert Chandler, Norman Cooper, Maurice Le Blanc- Smith, Thomas Sharpe, and future Air Vice-Marshal Geoffrey Pidcock. In March 1918 the squadron was moved to the south of the British Front where it became engaged in the German offensive between Cambrai and St. Quentin where low level strafing was carried out. In August the squadron was attached to the Tank Corps for special duties in connection with anti-tank gun strafing and took part in a succession of battles on the Third and Fourth Army Fronts. During this phase the squadron expended 25,000 rounds of ammunition and 160 25 lb. Cooper bombs in one day's flying. At the cessation of hostilities the Camels of No. 73 were disposed of and the personnel posted to Yatesbury, where the squadron was disbanded. During wartime operations the pilots of the squadron had destroyed or sent down out of control 132 enemy aircraft. =Aircraft used= As at 1 October 1917, the squadron had the following aircraft: 'A' Flight: * 2 Sopwith Camels * 1 Sopwith Pup * 2 Nieuports 'B' Flight: * 2 Avros * 1 Nieuport 'C' Flight: * 1 Avro From November 1917, the squadron began to re-equip entirely with Sopwith Camels powered by 130 hp Clerget engines. By the time it deployed to France in January 1918, the squadron had 18 Camels, which it retained throughout the rest of the Great War. World War II A Hawker Hurricane Mark I flown by Flight Lieutenant J E \\"Ian\\" Scoular, commander of 'B' Flight, No. 73 Squadron RAF, being refuelled and re-armed between sorties at Reims-Champagne, 1939 or 1940 The squadron reformed on 15 March 1937 equipped with Hawker Furys, they then relocated to RAF Digby where they were re-equipped with Gloster Gladiators, and then Hawker Hurricanes. In September 1939, 73 Squadron, along with No. 1 Squadron were then posted to North-East France on the outbreak of war as part of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force. Early in the campaign the squadron controlled the Cherbourg Peninsula, before a move to Rouvres in October. One of the outstanding pilots on the squadron at this time was F/O. E. J. 'Cobber' Kain, who destroyed a Do 17 at 27,000 feet. 'Cobber' was killed in a flying accident on 7 June 1940. Another 'ace' in the squadron at this time was F/O Newell 'Fanny' Orton. Spitfire Mark IXs of No. 73 Squadron RAF, undergo servicing and refuelling at Prkos, Yugoslavia 1945 After the German attack on 10 May 1940, No. 73 provided cover over Allied airfields and bases, falling back as its airfields were overrun by enemy columns. On 17 June 1940 the squadron had withdrawn from France. The squadron suffered tragedy during the withdrawal when was sunk off the coast of St. Nazaire with the loss of around 40 ground crew. During the Battle of Britain No.73 Squadron, operating from Debden on 5 September until late October, when the unit withdrew in preparation for a move to the Middle East. The squadron Hurricanes were shipped to Takoradi on the Gold Coast on board , and were then flown in stages across Africa to Egypt. The squadron took part in the series of campaigns in the Western Desert and Tunisia, helping cover the supply routes to Tobruk and taking part in ground- attack operations. In December 1942 the squadron recorded their 300th victory when F/S Beard shot down a Ju 88 over the sea of Benghazi. In June 1943 the squadron converted to the Spitfire, and were posted to Italy in October. In April 1944 the squadron began to operate over the Balkans, in the fighter- bomber role. In December 1944 part of the squadron was moved to Greece to take part in the fighting against the Communist resistance attempting to seize power. In January 1945 the squadron returned to Italy, and in April moved to Yugoslavia, where it remained until the end of the war moving to Malta in July 1945. Initially at Hal Far, the squadron soon moved to Takali. 1950s The squadron, now flying de Havilland Vampire FB.9„ÄÅVenom FB.1s, was moved to Habbaniya in Iraq in May 1953. In 1955 it was in Cyprus, and deployed to Aden from 1956‚Äì57 for the Suez Crisis. The squadron arrived in Akrotiri in March 1957 to form part of the Middle East Air Force Strike Wing, equipped with Canberra B2s. The squadron was disbanded on 10 January 1969.

Definition  Let A be a Banach algebra and G the group of invertible elements in A. The set G is open and a topological group. Consider the identity component :G0, or in other words the connected component containing the identity 1 of A; G0 is a normal subgroup of G. The quotient group :ŒõA = G/G0 is the abstract index group of A. Because G0, being the component of an open set, is both open and closed in G, the index group is a discrete group.  Examples  Let L(H) be the Banach algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space. The set of invertible elements in L(H) is path connected. Therefore, ŒõL(H) is the trivial group. Let T denote the unit circle in the complex plane. The algebra C(T) of continuous functions from T to the complex numbers is a Banach algebra, with the topology of uniform convergence. A function in C(T) is invertible (meaning that it has a pointwise multiplicative inverse, not that it is an invertible function) if it does not map any element of T to zero. The group G0 consists of elements homotopic, in G, to the identity in G, the constant function 1. One can choose the functions fn(z) = zn as representatives in G of distinct homotopy classes of maps T‚ÜíT. Thus the index group ŒõC(T) is the set of homotopy classes, indexed by the winding number of its members. Thus ŒõC(T) is isomorphic to the fundamental group of T. It is a countable discrete group. The Calkin algebra K is the quotient C*-algebra of L(H) with respect to the compact operators. Suppose œÄ is the quotient map. By Atkinson's theorem, an invertible elements in K is of the form œÄ(T) where T is a Fredholm operators. The index group ŒõK is again a countable discrete group. In fact, ŒõK is isomorphic to the additive group of integers Z, via the Fredholm index. In other words, for Fredholm operators, the two notions of index coincide.  References  * Zhu, Kehe (1993).

It was founded in 1961 as the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and is one of 84 institutions of the Max Planck Society. Originally named the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology, it was renamed to its current name in 2010 as it widened its research thrusts to the study of epigenetics. The researchers of the institute study the development of the immune system and analyse the genes and molecules which are important for its function. They also seek to establish which factors control the maturation of immune cells and how chemical changes of the DNA influence the immune defense. The 1984 Nobel Prize-winning biologist Georges J. F. K√∂hler was director of the institute from 1984 until his death in 1995. History Beginning in the early 1960s, the institute was founded within the former research facilities of German pharmaceutical company Wander AG located in Freiburg. By the 1970s, MPIIE was engaged in studies focusing on interactions between infectious agents, particularly endotoxin, and the human immune system. Research scope was then expanded into cellular and molecular mechanisms of B and T cells in the next decade. By the 1990s, the institute saw beginning research on genetic imprinting and epigenetics. Molecular mechanisms of lymphoid cell differentiation and the regulation of genes via extracellular signals were later added as research areas in later years. In 2007, the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology included epigenetics as a new research department and thus the institute was formally renamed to the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics by 2010. Organization The Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics is organised into four departments. In addition to the four departments, the institute includes an adjunct University Department on Molecular Immunology headed by Michael Reth, and the Spemann Laboratory, which has the aim of promoting the early independence of junior scientists. =Cellular and Molecular Immunology= Headed by Rudolf Grosschedl, the Department of Cellular and Molecular Immunology focuses on cellular differentiation and commitment in response to extracellular signals and intrinsic regulatory networks. The department consists of three independent research groups. =Chromatin Regulation= The Department of Chromatin Regulation, under Asifa Akhtar, aims to study chromatin and epigenetic mechanisms within gene regulation. the department further looks into whether chromosome organization and nuclear architecture plays a role in transcription activity and how this influences X chromosomal regulation. These are done through a holistic application of dosage compensations through biochemical, genetic, genomic and bioinformatic methodologies =Developmental Immunobiology= Under the leadership of Thomas Boehm, the Department of Developmental Immunology strives to understand the biology and evolution of lymphoid organs and the adaptive immune system, intestinal immune system, and adaptive and innate immunity. The department consists of two independent research groups. =Epigenetics= Headed by Thomas Jenuwein, the Department focuses on basic epigenetic mechanisms in normal development and complex diseases such as diabetes and obesity. The department consists of three independent research groups. = Immunometabolism = The new Director Erica Pearce could be won over for the institute, in replacement for Rolf Kemler. She is now heading the department of Immunometabolism. The Department focuses on understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control immune responses, with a particular emphasis on how metabolism governs this process. Management The Management Board of the MPI comprises elected scientific members of the Max Planck Society. These serve a dual function as co-directors of the institute and as department heads. The managing directorship rotates every three years among these co- directors. Currently, the Management Board (Kollegium) comprises the following members: Managing Director: * Thomas Boehm Scientific Members: * Asifa Akhtar * Rudolf Grosschedl * Thomas Jenuwein * Erika Pearce Adjunct Scientific Member: * Michael Reth Directorship The following were the directors of the institute: *1961‚Äì1982 Otto Westphal *1964‚Äì1981 Herbert Fischer *1965‚Äì1988 Otto L√ºderitz *1981‚Äì2004 Klaus Eichmann *1984‚Äì1995 Georges J.

The school was established in 1966, and the campus was merged into Keysborough Secondary College on 6 October 2008.  History  During 1965 the Education Department decided to establish a new secondary school in the Springvale and Noble Park area. A site was reserved and the official name was Heatherhill High School. Mr. N. R. Oxenbould was appointed as the first principal, and the first school assembly had 105 students, three members of staff and one office assistant which was held in the grounds of the Heatherhill State School on 2 February. The school celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2006 with a barbecue luncheon for past and present members of the school community. Patrick Boyd became the campus principal upon the school's merger with Keysborough.  Curriculum  Years 7, 8, 9 Students in years 7, 8 and 9 are required to undertake studies in English, mathematics, science, humanities and physical education. These studies are further accompanied by a range of electives offered to the students. Pupils in year 9 undertake a unique program throughout the year that is aimed at both social and academic performance. This includes a community service program and various leadership programs throughout the year. Years 10, 11, 12 Students in year 10 are required to undertake core studies in English, mathematics, science and physical education as well as an additional VCE units 1/2 subject. Students in years 11 and 12 are required to take several Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) or Vocational Education and Training (VET) subjects as part of their senior schooling, as well as a compulsory VCE English units 1/2 or ESL units 1/2. The school also offers the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL) programme. Academic Competitions Students are encouraged to participate in competitions such as the Westpac Mathematics Competition and the International Competitions and Assessments for Schools Science Competition.  Houses  The four houses with their associated colours are: *Olympic (Yellow) *Athol (Blue) *Janine (Green) *Noble (Red)  Facilities  The school is divided into F, E, D, C and B blocks. In 2003, a sports gym was built to provide more accommodation for the school's sporting needs. In 2007, a new learning centre will be fully operational and this building will serve as the primary year 9 learning facility. Furthermore, the school's new learning centre will serve as the primary music room to accommodate an overwhelming increase in young talented musicians.  Sister School  Heatherhill Secondary College maintains close ties with Haimen Experimental School in the Jiangsu of China as part of the ongoing sister school relationship. Each year, a group of students from Haimen Experimental School are hosted during their stay in Australia by several year 7 and 8 students.  Future Projects  Heatherhill Secondary College has proposed to merge with Chandler Secondary College, Springvale Secondary College and Coomoora Secondary College into two separate years 7‚Äì12 super schools. One campus is proposed for the Chandler site and the other for the Heatherhill site, and each campus is expected to hold 1200 students. Work is expected to begin in late 2008 and students will move into the two new campuses in 2010. The new name of the school is Keysborough College.

P. Gill, was an English-born Australian art curator, teacher and painter. Gill was born at Brighton, Sussex, England, the son of Alfred Gill and his wife Frances Elizabeth, n√©e Pelling. Gill studied at the Brighton School of Art, Hove and Sussex Grammar Schools and at South Kensington where he won a scholarship. In 1882 Gill was appointed master of the School of Design at Adelaide and held this position until 1909, when it was taken over by the Education Department and became the Adelaide School of Art, with Gill as Principal and Examiner. The Adelaide Art Circle was founded early in 1890, with Gill as president and G. A. Reynolds as hon. secretary. Membership was open to professional artists and limited to 12 members, including watercolorist W. P. H. Haines (died August 1891), A(lfred) Scott Broad, Edward Davies, M. F. Cavanagh, H. E. Powell, W. K. Gold, E. J. Woods and ? Maxwell. W. J. Wadham and his brother Alf Sinclair were elected to the circle in 1892. The society appears to have folded shortly after. He published The Straight and Crooked Paths of Studentship in 1894. He was appointed honorary curator of the Art Gallery of South Australia, and in 1899 visited Europe where, with the assistance of a committee, he spent ¬£10,000 on works of art. He was also responsible for purchasing works of young Australian artists such as Tom Roberts, Hans Heysen and Frederick McCubbin.http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1066&c;=7521 It was generally agreed that very good judgment had been shown in making these purchases. Gill was a longtime member of the South Australian Society of Arts and its president from 1909 to 1911. He resigned from the School of Art on 1 July 1915 on account of ill health, and while on a voyage to England, for reasons of health, died in the Mediterranean between Marseilles and Gibraltar on 25 May 1916, and was buried at sea. Gill had a good reputation as a teacher and lecturer. Gill was an Associate of the Royal College of Art, London, and a Freemason. An oil and three of his water-colours are in the Art Gallery of South Australia. He was survived by his wife and two sons. Family Harry Pelling Gill married Annie Waring Wright, a granddaughter of T.

After World War II, the production of iron ore in Kiruna and Malmberget increased dramatically and the train length was increased, with the consequence that each train needed more propulsion. NSB chose to order eight new El 12 locomotives at the same time it combined the ten El 3 locomotives to make three triple-engine sets with one reserve. When the El 15 locomotives were delivered in 1967, the El 3 and El 4 units were taken out of service. None of the locomotives have been preserved. One engine, 4.2046, is buried under gravel and soil below the railway near Katterat, where it ended up at a derailment in 1959.

The major newspapers published by the group are Dainik Bhaskar (Hindi daily), Divya Bhaskar (Gujarati daily), Dainik Divya Marathi (Marathi daily), Saurashtra Samachar, DB Post (English daily) and DB Star. The Group also publishes 3 magazines; Aha! Zindagi (a monthly family magazine in hind), Bal Bhaskar (Hindi magazine for kids) and Young Bhaskar (English magazine for kids) are also published by the group. Listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, the group is majority-owned by the Bhopal-based Agarwal family.  History  Dainik Bhaskar was first published in Bhopal and Gwalior. The newspaper was launched in the year 1956, tailored to the market for a Hindi-language daily. Initially named Subah Savere in Bhopal and Good Morning India in Gwalior in 1957, the paper was later renamed Bhaskar Samachar. In 1958, the paper was renamed once more, taking on its current moniker, Dainik Bhaskar. In English, the word Bhaskar means \\"The Rising Sun.\\" A graphic of a rising sun accompanied the paper's new name. Today, Dainik Bhaskar is the most-circulated daily newspaper in India.  Newspaper presence  The Dainik Bhaskar Group's publications serve a variety of Indian states: * Dainik Bhaskar, the Group's flagship Hindi daily, serves 11 states, offering 45 editions. * Divya Bhaskar, a Gujarati daily, serves 2 states with 8 editions. * Dainik Divya Marathi, a Marathi daily, serves the state of Maharashtra, offering 6 editions. * DB Star serves 3 states with 5 editions. * Saurashtra Samachar serves 1 state with 1 editions. * DB Post serves 1 state with 1 editions. Among all of its publications, the Dainik Bhaskar Group serves more than 50% of India's geographical area. The Group has a total circulation of more than 6 million copies with 53 print locations. Dainik Bhaskar was declared the world's fourth largest circulated daily in 2016-2017.  Business expansion  In 1983, D B Corp Ltd. attempted to expand by launching Dainik Bhaskar, Indore edition. This was the company's first move outside its hometown of Bhopal. Within four years, Dainik Bhaskar had become Indore's most popular newspaper, replacing the previous favorite, Nai Duniya. Aiming to further increase its presence in the state of Madhya Pradesh, the Group launched newspaper editions based in Raipur, Bilaspur, Ujjain, Sagar, and Ratlam. By 1995, Dainik Bhaskar was the most popular newspaper in Madhya Pradesh, and was declared the Fastest-Growing Daily in India by the Readership Survey. In 1996, Dainik Bhaskar's next goal was to enter Jaipur as the second- most circulated newspaper on the first day it was launched, with a target circulation of 50,000. To achieve this lofty goal, the Group set up an in- house team of 700 employees to survey of 200,000 potential newspaper-buying households in Jaipur. Based on survey feedback, they returned to each of the surveyed households to show them a prototype of the new Dainik Bhaskar newspaper, and to give them the option to purchase an advance subscription. These customers were offered a subscription price of Rs.1.50 (discounted from the newsstand price of Rs. 2), in addition to a refund in case of dissatisfaction. When Dainik Bhaskar first launched in Jaipur on 19 December 1996, it entered the market as the most-circulated newspaper, with 172,347 copies sold. Rajasthan Patrika, which had been the most popular newspaper to that point, had a circulation of around 100,000 at that time.[2] Using the launch strategy that made it successful in Jaipur, Dainik Bhaskar later captured all the major cities of Rajasthan, including Jodhpur, Bikaner, Kota, Udaipur, and Ajmer Sikar. By 1999, it became the most popular urban newspaper in Rajasthan. Next the Group targeted Chandigarh. It launched a customer survey in January 2000, covering 220,000 households. At that time, the English-language newspapers in Chandigarh sold six times as many copies as the Hindi newspapers, with The Tribune in the lead with a circulation of approximately 50,000 copies. Dainik Bhaskar's survey revealed that people in Chandigarh preferred English newspapers because they were of better quality. As a result, the Group concentrated on a well-designed newspaper that incorporated the local Chandigarh dialect in the design, mixing Hindi and English. When the new paper debuted in Chandigarh in May 2000, it entered the market with 69,000 copies. In June 2000, Dainik Bhaskar entered Haryana, again as the most-circulated newspaper on launch day, with 271,000 copies. For its fourth launch outside Madhya Pradesh, DB Corp Ltd. identified Ahmedabad, Gujarat as the city with the highest potential. It surveyed 12,00,000 households, with a team of 1050 surveyors, 64 supervisors, 16 zonal managers, and 4 divisional managers. Nearly 40‚Äì50% of the surveyors were later absorbed in Dainik Bhaskar or Divya Bhaskar. The team was trained to reach out to 8 lakh (800,000) households in Ahmedabad, and 4 lakh (400,000) households in adjoining districts, within 40 days. The newspaper was launched in Ahmedabad on 23 June 2003, under the brand name Divya Bhaskar, as most-circulated newspaper with 452,000 copies sold. Within 15 months, the Group entered two more cities of Gujarat: Surat and Vadodara. To counter this threat, the area's leading Gujarati newspapers implemented color pages, price reductions, and several high-value customer offers. Nevertheless, by 2009, Divya Bhaskar became the largest-circulated Gujarati daily in the area. In 2006, Dainik Bhaskar launched its operations in Punjab with its Amritsar and Jalandhar editions. Later, it further increased its presence in Punjab with the launch of editions in Ludhiana and Bhatinda. In 2010, Dainik Bhaskar entered the Jharkhand market with the launch of its Ranchi, Jamshedpur, and Dhanbad editions. Its objective was to cover and capture the entire state of Jharkhand.

History  Commune House of the Royal Acequia de Moncada. Old City Hall, which houses the library and the archaeological museum. The territory of the municipality of Montcada was the subject of an intense human occupation from the early days of Romanization. There are few data we have from earlier times. In the area known as the Xop and in some fields for extraction of clay for pottery, appeared a few fragments of ceramic belonging to handmade vessels and two arrowheads. Also before the Roman times is the Iberian settlement of Tos Pelat, which remaining parts of its walled town and were seen sections of the walls of the rooms, and were for a long time been collected fragments of Iberian vessels with geometric decoration painted and even whole pieces. We know the existence of two large rustic Roman villas, one in the departure of Pou or Pousaig and the other in the departure of Bordellet. By the characteristics of the collected materials, both towns should to blossom during the 2nd and early 3rd centuries AD. The origin of the population is attributed to the Iberian or Roman period, due to the archaeological materials found in its term. King James I in 1239 granted to the inhabitants of the conquered lands of Valencia, of all water and major medium and minor irrigation ditch, but literal, and expressly reserved the channel that was called Real, that it was going to Puzol, better known as \\"Royal Ditch of Moncada\\" that irrigate the most of the left bank of the River Turia, from Paterna to Pu√ßol. It extended the boundaries of irrigation on the twenty towns and thirteen districts that conform the irrigable area of the Royal Ditch of Moncada, specifically the populations of Quart de Poblet, Paterna, Burjassot, Godella, Rocafort, Moncada, Alfara of the Patriarch, Vinalesa, Bonrepos and Mirambell, Alm√†ssera, Foios, Meliana, Albalat dels Sorells, Museros, Albuixech, Massalfassar, Massamagrell, La Pobla de Farnals, Rafelbunyol, El Puig and Pu√ßol, and the hamlets of Benim√†met, Beniferri, Masarrojos, Benifaraig, Carpesa, Borbot√≥, Cases de B√†rcena, Mahuella, Tauladella, Rafalell and Vistabella. The first written documentation come from, however, of the time of the Catalan conquest. Some years later, Montcada returned to crown and was changed to the Order of the Temple by the Farmhouse of Russafa in 1246 (to have greater strategic value by keeping the southern flank of the capital of the Kingdom). In 1248 the commander of the Templars granted Municipal corporation Population Charter and about in the same time was created the bailiff of Moncada, one of the richest of the Order of the Temple, and after the Order of Montesa, which was passed after being suppressed in the early 14th century. During the War of Succession in 1706, Moncada was occupied by the Bourbon army. This occupation lasted short time as Basset, Austracist general, forced it to raise its reals. After the Spanish Civil War, the city suffered a widespread destruction during the conflict and Salvador Rodrigo Rosalen is left in front of City Hall. = Montcada Islamic Necropolis = In 1996 to realize the excavations for the foundations of a house in Barreres street were found seven human burials pointing to an Islamic origin; Islamic culture were dated between the 11th and 13th centuries. Located archaeologically the location of the Islamic necropolis, the subsequent discovery in 2006 of some silos and the remains of two houses in The Ravalet, dating from the Almohad period (12th century), allowed the archaeological finding Islamic origin or previous of the city.Ajuntament de Moncada: urban archaeological interventions Between November 2006 and January 2007 in San Roque Street, following the demolition of a house, they found 25 to 30 bodies of young people in good condition and a few babies in almost good condition, dating from around the 12th century. Some showing large head injuries, which were shattered by impacts. It is presumed that the bodies found professed the Muslim religion by the way in which lay buried. In early 2006, were found traces of the Moorish occupation, in what some experts have dubbed \\"the hamlet of Moncada\\" next to the Palace of the Counts of R√≥tova, current city council of the Municipality of Moncada. This finding corresponds to a first level. In the second level were found houses dating from the 16th century.  Demography  Moncada has a population of 21,847 inhabitants in 2010.  Economy  Moncada's economy, as well as the other towns in the Valencia region of l'Horta, is mostly agricultural, due to the favourable location and the fertility of the soil in the area. Despite the dominance of the primary sector, Moncada has experienced over the last years a significant growth in the tertiary sector, caused primarily by strong demand in the hospitality sector arising from the close presence of the Cardenal Herrera CEU University, whose influx of students has served as a stimulus for the modest local hotel industry.  Transportation  The easiest way to reach Moncada is from the city of Valencia through the CV-308. Moncada has three stations of Metro Valencia (Moncada-Alfara, Seminar-CEU and Masias). It also has a bus to Valencia and intercity bus service connecting the town of Moncada with its various neighborhoods.  Notable buildings  Gate Church of San Jaime. * Church of San James. Temple consecrated in 1696. It is rectangular and its interior has undergone numerous reforms, according to prevailing styles and tastes in each historical period. * Hermitage de Santa Barbara. Built in the early 18th century, which is dedicated to its patron Saint Barbara, is based on another earlier chapel to smaller proportions dedicated to San Ponce. * Old Market.

Until 1997, the City council was located in what was the town hall, rebuilt in 1911. Then moved to the restored Palace of the Counts of R√≥tova. The palace, located in the old core of Moncada, in The Ravalet area, was purchased by the City council of Moncada for public use. The building dates from the late 18th century, baroque architecture in the initial phase, with subsequent interventions witch ended deriving in neoclassical style. This palace was in ruins after having had different uses at different times, from serving as a summer residence of the Counts of R√≥tova, to be used as a private psychiatric hospital in the postwar years. In times of Carlist wars, the building played an important role, given the location at the entrance of the town. Towards the 70 housed a community of monks Comboni, then was completely abandoned. It was Council's decision to acquire the property, as a formula to halt its deterioration. * Metropolitan Seminary of Valencia. Located between the city and Carraixet Ravine.

History The school was founded by Reverend Walter Earle, former Second Master at Uppingham School, as a small prep school for boys in Yarlet Hall, a Victorian private house situated in the countryside on the outskirts of Stafford. Hence, Yarlet had close ties with Uppingham early in its history and indeed, many of the boys continued their schooling at Uppingham. Earle founded Bilton Grange in Warwickshire and later moved there in 1887, taking some of the boys with him, but the original school in Yarlet continued to function under a new headmaster. Ties were also established with Rugby School, which remain to this day. It became a charitable trust in 1970. The pre-prep department was opened in 1993. Girls were admitted in 1994 and the school is now fully coeducational. Curriculum Subjects taught in Year 3 and above include English, Mathematics, Science, ICT, French, History, Geography, Religious Studies, Latin and Music. Pupils are prepared for the Common Entrance Exam which is taken at the end of Year 8.Main School Sport Yarlet has beautiful grounds and a wide range of facilities such as an astro turf pitch, three tennis courts, two football/rugby/rounders pitches and three tennis courts, two of which can be used for netball. This gives a large availability of sport at Yarlet. Boys play Football in the Autumn Term, Rugby in the Spring Term and Cricket in the Summer Term. Girls play Hockey in the Autumn Term, Netball in the Spring Term and Rounders in the Summer term. Athletics, Swimming and Tennis are also available for pupils. Boarding There is no full-time boarding. A flexi-boarding option is also available which allows children to board on Thursday and Friday nights. It is closer to a sleep over than full-time boarding and fun activities are arranged for boarding evenings. Since 2009 Yarlet has run a \\"combined scholarship\\" programme with several reputable independent senior schools to allow deserving children from financially disadvantaged backgrounds to board at Yarlet and then transfer to the senior schools as full boarders after completing their studies at Yarlet. Headmasters There have only been eight headmasters (including the incumbent) in the school's history. : *Walter Earle (1873-1887) *Clement W L Bode (1887-1902) *Andrew F Fernie (1903-1929) *Guy C N Mackarness (1929-1937) *Keith E Tarling (1937-1970) *David N Carr (1970-1989)In Memory of David Carr *Richard S Plant (1989-2009)Farewell to Richard Plant *Ian M Raybould (2009‚Äìpresent) Former Pupils *John Buxton, academic *Norman Douglas, author *Giles Foden, author *Nick Hancock, comedian and host *Andy Richards, musician, composer and organist *John Uttley, son of Alison Uttley See also *Yarlet Hall School (1986) on Domesday Reloaded *The Historian of Yarlet References External links *School Website *Profile on the ISC website *Profile on the Good Schools Guide Category:Preparatory schools in Staffordshire Category:Boarding schools in Staffordshire Category:Educational institutions established in 1873 ","title":"Yarlet School"},{"id":"10475083","text":"Montaverner is a municipality in the comarca of Vall d'Albaida in the Valencian Community, Spain.

Life and work Raskin was born in New York to Harry A. Raskin, a high school music teacher, and Lillian Raskin, a grade school teacher. Her father aroused her childhood interest in music, leading her to study violin and piano, before she turned her focus to singing. In 1945, she graduated from Roosevelt High School, Yonkers and attended Smith College, where she majored in music. It was during her college years that she began taking singing lessons, which she continued after graduation in order to develop further the warmth and artistry of her voice. In 1948, she married Dr. Raymond A. Raskin, with whom she had two children, Jonathan and Lisa. Winning the Marian Anderson award in 1952 and 1953, and the Musicians Club of New York's Young Artist Award in 1956, Raskin started to perform in concerts throughout the United States. She secured national recognition in 1957 for her part as Sister Constance in the televised American premiere of Poulenc's Dialogues des Carm√©lites. Her prominence continued to rise in July the same year when she starred in a concert version of Puccini's La boh√®me, with the Symphony of the Air in Central Park. Finally, in 1959, she joined the New York City Opera (NYCO), debuting as Despina in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte. Her next spectacular performance was the title role of Douglas Moore's The Ballad of Baby Doe for the New York City Opera in 1960. She also sang Baby Doe in Central City Colorado where the opera had premiered. Two years later, she made her crowning debut in 1962 at the Metropolitan Opera, as Susanna in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. It is with Mozart that she became most closely associated. Reviewing the debut Raymond Ericsson wrote ‚Äú Pretty as a picture, never forcing her musical phrases or overplaying the comedy, enunciating the Italian like a veteran, Miss Raskin was as appealing a Susanna as the Met could wish for.‚Äù During her career at the Met she also performed as Zerlina in Don Giovanni, and she had the distinction of performing at the new Met as Pamina in the memorable Marc Chagall- designed performance of The Magic Flute. In reviewing the recordings of the CDs produced for the Metropolitan Opera‚Äôs 50th year celebration of the new opera house, Dewey Faulkner wrote that hearing the broadcast of Judith Raskin‚Äôs Pamina ‚Äú makes one love her all over again.‚Äù Yale Review January 2018, vol. 106, no. 1. Ms. Raskin appeared on the NBC television opera as the bride in Menotti‚Äôs Labyrinth (wikipedia), an opera that was never intended to be performed on stage. Although Harold Schonberg of the Times was critical of the opera he praised the singers including John Reardon and Judith Raskin. Other roles performed at the Met included Micaela in Carmen, Nanetta in Falstaff, Marzeline in Fidelio and Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier. Ms. Raskin performed Pamina in The Magic Flute for two summer seasons at the Glyndebourne Festival. She also sang at the Chicago Lyric Opera, San Francisco Opera company. In 1969, Raskin performed in Boston for the Peabody Mason Concert series.Christian Science Monitor, 24-Oct-1969, Louis Snyder, \\"Raskin recital in Cambridge\\", Boston During the rest of her career, she would specialize in lyrical roles written not only by Mozart but also by Richard Strauss. Judith Raskin was chosen by George Szell to be the ‚Äúfirst desk soprano‚Äù of the Cleveland Orchestra; with the maestro she recorded Mahler‚Äôs Fourth Symphony, a highly rated recording that was reissued in the Great Performances series. With Szell she also recorded Mozart‚Äôs Exsultate Jubilate. She was chosen by Igor Stravinsky to be the Anne Trulove on a studio recording of his opera, The Rake‚Äôs Progress, that was conducted by Stravinsky himself. Ms. Raskin‚Äôs discography is extensive. She has recorded for Columbia, London Decca, RCA Victor and CRI recording studios. She also served on many music advisory boards, as well as in the Young Concert Artists, the National Opera Institute and the National Endowment for the Arts. One of her main concerns was the need to establish more opera companies in American cities to provide practical experience to \\"well trained American singers with no place to go\\", since \\"the only way to become professional is to perform.\\" Ms. Raskin moved gracefully from the large opera stage to the intimate settings of recitals. She was well known for her concerts in, and recordings of, Lieder. Beginning her recital work in 1964 after receiving the Ford Foundation grant, she continued to concertize in many venues. She performed the works of contemporary composers, Miriam Gideon and Ezra Laderman at Carnegie Hall in 1977; Harold Schonberg of the Times wrote that she ‚Äúdid honor to the music.‚Äù She sang at the Cleveland Chamber Music Society; Robert Finn in The Plain Dealer wrote in 1967 \\"...when it comes to the total package of voice, musicianship, personality projection and so on, I cannot think of any recitalist who is her superior.\\" While her operatic singing received excellent reviews she commented to Edward Rothstein of the New York Times, ‚ÄúIn my heart of hearts I have always been a recitalist. The recital is personal. I always liked the idea that I could say something directly. One person is all I need. An audience is multiples of one person. (NYT May 15, 1981) As a music educator, Raskin taught at the Manhattan School of Music, and at the 92nd Street Y, where she took the role of Pearl, the rabbi's wife, in Lazar Weiner's opera The Golem in 1979. Following a 2-year battle with ovarian cancer, Raskin died in New York in 1984. Harold Schonberg in his NY Times obituary of Ms. Raskin wrote ‚Äúas a leading singer with the New York City Opera, and then at the Metropolitan Opera from 1962 to 1972, Miss Raskin was hailed as one of the finest artists of her time. She had a voice that critics constantly referred to as 'ravishing.‚Äô Combined with the beauty of her sound was a high order of musicianship. In addition, Miss Raskin was a beautiful woman and an excellent actress. As a complete artist, she captivated audiences whenever she appeared.‚Äù ‚ÄúMany believed her to be the most attractive Adele in Strauss' Fledermaus within memory.‚Äù (New York Times, Dec. 22, 1984)After her death the family began an annual concert at The Stephen Wise Free Synagogue at which a winner of the National Council awards would perform; the annual Judith Raskin Memorial Concert ran for 25 years. There are currently awards established in her name for young singers at the National Council of the Metropolitan Opera, the Manhattan School of Music and Smith College.

The PCGamerBike Mini is a compact exercise bike, and the PCGamerBike Recumbent is a full-sized recumbent exercise bike. Use The PCGamerBike is configurable and as a result can interact with a broad range of PC games. They are typically used to control character(s) in a game, or a character's vehicle, such as a car, bike or boat, by pedaling forward or backward, to move the character in those directions. Side to side controls require the use of a keyboard or mouse, which can be used in accompaniment with the bike. When used with driving and racing games, character speed is proportional to pedal speed. The PCGamerBike Mini can be used with any game that supports a keyboard, as it is connected via a USB port as a game controller. The resistance of the pedals on the PCGamerBike Recumbent can be adjusted to the player's preference and will also vary depending on certain in-game situations, for example, in a situation when the character is going up or down hill.

The main economical activities of the city are tourism, fishing, shrimp farming, agriculture (tree plantation for paper/wood), underground sand extraction, and one large chemical industry (magnesium extraction from sea water). Tourism is fueled by very clean beaches and the sea estuary that is good for fishing and water sports. The city population increases to 50,000 or more at summer time (mostly from Christmas to the end of January). The biggest city party (Festa da Tainha) happens by the winter, when the cold water brings huge schools of Tainha fish (a fish with meat rich in fat, suitable to grilling, vaguely similar to salmon but showing a white meat). Most of the Barra do Sul natives have Portuguese/Indian heritage, and inherit from them the intimacy with the sea, the sea food cuisine and traditions like Farra do Boi‚Äîreleasing a bull in the village and teasing it so it runs after people. Even though this tradition is also found in French and Spanish cities, Farra do Boi is forbidden by law in Brazil due to animal rights regulations, which resulted with the help of President Get√∫lio Vargas through Brazil's 1934 constitution, passed on 16 July. Based on the recognition of animals in the Constitution, a Brazilian Supreme Court ruling resulted in the ban of animal-related activities that involve claimed \\"animal suffering such as cock fighting, and a tradition practiced in southern Brazil, known as ‚ÄúFarra do Boi‚Äù (the Oxen Festival)\\". Overview of Brazil's Legal Structure for Animal Issues - Lane Azevedo Clayton - Animal Legal & Historical Center = Publish Date: 2011 stating that \\"animals also have the right to legal protection against mistreatment and suffering\\". Brazilian animal law - Alex P - JoinUniverse Beginning in the 1960s, a small but steady immigration flux of people from nearby towns increased the ethnic diversity, and nowadays almost all ethnic communities found in Santa Catarina (in particular Germans) have a share in Barra do Sul. Following the immigration, Catholic church as well as major flavors of Protestantism have physical presence in Barra do Sul. Also, migration from Rio Grande do Sul state brought a CTG (Gaucho traditions center) to Barra do Sul.  History  The proximity with S√£o Francisco do Sul town (itself the third oldest village in Brazil) made Barra do Sul a natural route for transportation, as well as an alternative S√£o Francisco's port entrance coming from the south (hence the name, Barra do Sul means \\"South Shore\\"). The first three non-Indian inhabitants in the 18th century were from a small military patrol that helped travellers to cross the \\"river\\" (the sea estuary) and protected them from Indian attacks (save for the Carij√≥s, all other tribes in the area tended to react violently to white man presence). In a very slow pace, Portuguese immigrants or people with Portuguese descent began to colonize Barra do Sul, living from cassava planting, fishing and/or providing services for travellers en route to the bigger cities. In the beginning of the 20th century, extrativism of certain leaves from \\"mangues\\" (seawater swamps) for the leather industry was also important. Immigrants mixed with the pacific Carij√≥ tribe and determined he ethnical mix found today. For centuries, Barra do Sul had no terrestrial roads to other cities, relying on navigation and walking by the seashore. The main two roads were built well into the 20th century: * The first one (Salinas) was open incidentally by a palm extractivism business - as the palms were cut, a small wooden railroad was built to collect the palms at site, leaving the road outlined when the palm reserves exhausted. That road was very primitive, allowing only animal traction vehicles. In the 1960s military engineering troops improved the road to the point it could (barely) be used by regular cars. Nowadays it is a gravel but perfectly usable road. There are plans to cover it with tarmac in the next 5‚Äì10 years. * The second one (Conquista) became main access to the city, and was open around the 1950s by a private landowner that planned to sell his land in small chunks, and having a road would be a selling point. This road was covered with tarmac by the 1990s. It was also corrected to be more straight, so 8 km of the old gravel, sinuous road still exists and gives access to many rural properties.  The blockage of the sea channel  The Baia da Babitonga sea estuary is delimited by the mainland at West and the S√£o Francisco island at East. S√£o Francisco port is in the estuary where the water is calm, and it could be reached both from South and North island extremes. In 1935, the estuary was landfilled 15 km upstream of the South sea entrance, in order to build a railroad over the estuary (it can be seen at ). This procedure made the estuary to be separated in two parts: North (where the port is) and South (where Barra do Sul is). Both have an exit to the sea but the crossflow of water was blocked. This crossflow was important because the North estuary has a mean sea level half meter above South estuary (the difference can easily be seen if the observer is over the landfill), so the landfill blocked the North- South flow that kept the estuary deep and clean. That caused several obvious and non-obvious ecological and economical impacts. First, the South sea exit no longer could be used for navigation, since the landfill blocked the route to S√£o Francisco port. Several fishing, extractivism and boat maneuerving workers lost their jobs. Over time, the reduced seatide and crossflow made the South estuary to become shallower, reducing fishing output and stagnating the water. The only small positive effect was to increase the dry area at Barra do Sul city; several blocks of city center are built on land that used to be submerged or swamped. The exit to the sea became to get clogged by sand, and the South estuary was in danger of becoming a closed saltwater lake. In 1982, an emergencial action was taken in order to reopen the estuary for good: the exit was lined with big stones, as well as made straight, deeper and narrower. Since then, the strong seatide currents have been able to keep the estuary open to the sea, improving a lot the whole channel's situation. It is now (2007) much more clean than it used to be, even though the shallowness problem persists, limiting the navigation. There are proposals to re-open the landfill (either entirely or just a small gap to allow the current to flow), but it will be an expensive measure and there are concerns about the sea reclaiming back the city areas that were not dry before the landfill.

Pre- independence (1857‚Äì1947) The University of Calcutta was founded in 1857. Dr. Fredrick John, the education secretary to the then British Government in India, first tendered a proposal to the British Government in London for the establishment of a university in Calcutta, along the lines of London University, but at that time the plan failed to obtain the necessary approval. However, a proposal to establish two universities, one in Calcutta and the other in Bombay was later accepted in 1854 and the necessary authority was given through Wood's despatch. The Calcutta University Act came into force on 24 January 1857 and a 41-member Senate was formed as the policy making body of the university. When the university was first established it had a catchment area covering the area from Lahore to Rangoon (now in Myanmar)‚Äîthe largest of any Indian university. On 30 January 1858, the Syndicate of the Calcutta University started functioning. The first meeting of the Senate was held in the Council room of the Calcutta Medical College. A temporary office of the university was started in a few rented rooms in Camac Street. For several years afterwards the meetings of the Senate and Syndicate were held in a room of the Writers' building. 244 candidates appeared for the first Entrance Examination of the university, held in March 1857 in the Town Hall of Calcutta. The Calcutta University by Francis Frith. c. 1850s to 1870s. College Street.alt= The first Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor of the Calcutta University were Governor General Lord Canning and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Sir William Colvile, respectively. In 1858, Joddu Nath Bose and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee became the first graduates of the university. From 1860 to 1890, Government Science College, Jabalpur, the first science college of India, was affiliated to the University of Calcutta. In 1862, a decision was taken by the Senate to construct for the university a building of its own. Accordingly, the historical Senate Hall was constructed at a cost of Rs. 2,52,221/- and inaugurated on 12 March 1873 by holding the convocation of the university. The university library was also started soon after. = 1900-1947 = In 1914, the University College of Science or Rajabazar Science College was established. A centralized Post-Graduate system of teaching and research was started in 1917. The Asutoish building was opened in 1926. The Asutosh Museum of Indian Art started in 1937. in 1937 when Dr. Syamaprasad Mookerjee was the Vice-Chancellor, he requested Rabindranath Tagore to compose a song to be adopted as the university song of the University of Calcutta. Tagore composed two songs instead of one. Later the second song, Subho Karmapathe Dharo Nirvayo Gaan was chosen to be the university song. The Institute of Nuclear Physics, the first of its kind in Asia, was founded under the leadership of Meghnad Saha in 1945.  Post-independence (1947‚Äìpresent)  In the year 2001 the University of Calcutta was awarded with the 'Five Star' status in the first cycle of the University's accreditation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). In 2009 and 2017, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) awarded its highest grade of 'A' to the University of Calcutta in 2nd & 3rd cycle of the University's accreditation. In 2019, the university's central library and 40 departmental libraries were opened to the general public.  Seals  The second seal of the university. The first seal was adopted when the university was founded on 24 January 1857, when India was under company rule. The second seal of the university was adopted after the formation of the British Raj. It features within it a coat of arms, with a lion and the St Edward's Crown at the crest, symbolizing the formation of the British Raj when India was brought under direct rule by the British Crown. It features a lion and unicorn as supporters, and the motto Dieu et mon droit at the bottom. The third seal was used for a brief period of time in 1930. It features three elephants carrying a book. The fourth, fifth, and sixth seals are very similar, and they all feature lotuses. The seventh seal is currently used today.

Originally incorporated in 1996 as Lightning Print Inc., the company is headquartered in La Vergne, Tennessee. Its UK operations are based in Milton Keynes. They also have operations in Maurepas, France and Melbourne, Australia. IngramSpark is a service operated by Lightning Source to cater for the needs of independent publishers and authors. Since it launched in 2013, IngramSpark has registered more than 7 million books, with 4,000 new books added each day. Espresso Book Machine The Espresso Book Machine 2.0 is a compact ( wide by deep by high) book-printing kiosk that can be installed in a bookshop or public place to print, bind and cut books on demand while the customer waits. The EBM 2.0 can download encrypted book files from Lightning Source (LS). Publishers must specifically give permission in order for their titles to be included in the scheme. The EBM project can theoretically allow faster access to LS print-on-demand books in regions where there is no existing LS plant, and where shipping times would otherwise create significant supply delays. It also allows large bookshops to offer their customers almost immediate access to a wider range of titles than could be held onsite. However, to date, uptake of the Espresso Book Machine system has been low. E-book services Lightning Source has an e-book supply system that can serve up protected PDF copies of books from their library through a vendor's site, if a publisher chooses to participate. Although the scheme originally allowed electronic LS editions to be sold on Amazon alongside \\"conventional\\" print-on-demand editions, Amazon withdrew from the scheme. Lightning Source still offer their e-book on demand service to publishers who have a suitable vendor website, and supply eBooks to their retail partners Powells.com, Ebookmall.com, Diesel-ebooks.com, Fictionwise.com, Booksonboard.com and eBooksAboutEverything.com, but have no online retail outlet themselves to sell eBooks. In March 2010 Ingram Digital (a wholesaler part of the same group) warned its customers it might not be able to sell them e-books, as most large publishers were moving from the wholesale model (publishers offer wholesale discounts, and the final price is determined by retailers) to the agency model (publishers set the retail price and offer agents a commission, so retailers earn more by buying direct from the publisher rather than via a wholesaler). This was triggered by the eBook pricing dispute between Amazon and Macmillan, and the imminent launch of the iPad.Mike Shatzkin, \\"Apple‚Äôs disruption of the ebook market has nothing to do with the tablet\\", The Idea Logical Company (19 January 2010).

An alternative concept to the usage of chemically synthesized siRNA for RNA Interference (RNAi) is the enzymatic digestion of long double stranded RNAs in vitro. In this case a cDNA template is amplified by PCR and tagged with two bacteriophage-promoter sequences. RNA polymerase is then used to generate long double stranded RNA that is homologous to the target-gene cDNA. This RNA is subsequently digested with RNase III from Escherichia coli to generate short overlapping fragments of siRNAs with a length between 18-25 base pairs. This complex mixture of short double stranded RNAs is similar to the mixture generated by Dicer cleavage in vivo and is therefore called endoribonuclease- prepared siRNA or short esiRNA. esiRNA are a heterogeneous mixture of siRNAs that all target the same mRNA sequence. These multiple silencing triggers lead to highly specific and effective gene silencing. References *Lawo et al. HAUS, the 8-Subunit Human Augmin Complex, Regulates Centrosome and Spindle Integrity.

At the time of his death, he was known as the world's oldest retired wrestler at the age of 99. Early life Fornini was born in Castrocielo, Italy in 1914. At the age of five, he and his family moved to the United States, where they lived in Hoboken, New Jersey. As a child, Fornini was reportedly friends with Frank Sinatra. He first began to wrestle at Demarest High School (now Hoboken High School), but left during the Great Depression to get a job cutting metal at the Cleveland Container. Professional wrestling career Fornini's brother Lou was a professional wrestler in New York, and so Fornini approached New York promoter Jack Pfefer. Pfefer christened him \\"Angelo Savoldi\\", and, billed as the brother of Joe Savoldi, he began wrestling in 1937. By 1938, Savoldi was regularly wrestling throughout the Northeastern United States. During World War II, Fornini joined the United States Navy. He later worked in Puerto Rico, becoming the first American to main event in that region. It was in the 1950s that Savoldi became a star in the Oklahoma region, as a junior heavyweight (a term for lightweight). Wrestling as a heel (villainous character), he held the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship three times between 1958 and 1964. In Oklahoma, Savoldi feuded with Danny Hodge. On May 27, 1960, Savoldi and Hodge were facing off in a match, when Savoldi was stabbed with a pen knife by an angry fan that turned out to be Hodge's father. Savoldi finished his in-ring career with the World Wide Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment) putting over the promotion's faces. He was also a trainer of younger wrestlers, with Jack Brisco and Hercules Ayala Cortez among them. In the 1970s Savoldi was a minority business partner in the WWWF. In 1984 Angelo, with his sons Mario, Tom and Joseph Savoldi, established International Championship Wrestling (ICW) in the Northeastern region. Joseph was a featured wrestler for the promotion. Angelo received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cauliflower Alley Club in 2003, and was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2004. Personal life Fornini and his wife were married for 74 years, and had four sons. They lived in Parsippany, New Jersey, where Fornini owned a record shop with his son Mario.

T. Bidlake Memorial Plaque: Recipients Booty recalled: :It was one of those lovely sunny summer mornings you crave for when you are time-trialling. It was calm, as I remember, and eventually it became very hot. And I was really having to hang on in the last half hour. I remember it was a real struggle. I knew I was on to a good ride if I could hang on. The thing I remember about that particular event was at the finish, and I was absolutely shattered at the finish. And I sat down. And, of course, when I finished I realised just how hot it was. I was desperate for some drink and somebody came with all they'd got, which was a bottle of milk. And it was sour. And he said it was sour. It was all he'd got. It was really sour. But I drank it all. That was the thing I remember mainly about that event.Cycling Weekly Also in 1956 he signed the Golden Book of Cycling. Ray Booty at the Awards Ceremony for the 2007 Team Time Trial Championship The straight-out record In September Booty attempted the record under Road Records Association(RRA) rules. These allowed him to take advantage of tailwinds and gradient drop (time trials in the UK must be on out-and-back courses). He recorded 3h 28m 40s. For the event he used a Sturmey-Archer hub gear. The record stood for 34 years. It was beaten by Ian Cammish. More time trial success Booty won the season-long British Best All-rounder competition three times from 1955 to 1957. The BBAR is based on averaged speeds over 50 and and for 12 hours. He was champion from 1955 to 1959 and 12-hour champion from 1954 to 1958. He first broke the record in 1955, lowering it to 4:04:30. He broke it three times. He twice broke the 12-hour record: in 1956 and the following year. Road racing Booty won the gold medal in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games road race in Cardiff. He won a bronze medal in the national championship road race in the same year. He also won the Manx International road race in 1954. Personality The cycling wholesaler and patron Ron Kitching said of Booty: :He was an iron man. But somewhere along the line I think he lacked something, the dedication to make bike-racing a full-time career. Maybe he didn't want to, but he certainly had most of the qualities. He had the strength, he could climb and of course he could time-trial. What he really needed was to be part of a good continental racing team. Then I think he would have gone to the very top. But whether or not his personality would have got in the way, that's another thing. You need a bit of modesty and humility to achieve that. I think the fact that Ray dropped right out of the sport proves that his interest didn't go deep enough. Why he went off and hid away, I don't know.Breckon, Michael (1993), A Wheel in Two Worlds: the Ron Kitching Story, privately published, UK References External links *Article on Booty's bicycle at classiclighteweights.co.uk *Pictures of the restored bicycle used in the 100-miles TT record Category:English male cyclists Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for England Category:Cyclists at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Category:Road racing cyclists Category:1932 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Nottingham Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in cycling ","title":"Ray Booty"},{"id":"10475618","text":"The Rafah Border Crossing ( Ma\`bar Rafa·∏•, Ma'avar Rafi'a·∏•) or Rafah Crossing Point is the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.

Document by PLO's NSU from the Palestine Papers. Here available The Palestinians agreed that all imports of goods are diverted to the Kerem Shalom border crossing, because Israel threatened to exclude Gaza from the customs union out of concern about the implementation of the Paris Protocol. On the other hand, the Palestinians agreed because they wanted to limit Israeli interference at Rafah and maximize their sovereignty. Diversion via Kerem was meant as a temporary measure but in fact, imports through Rafah were never realized, forcing the Palestinians to develop a smuggling tunnels economy. Israel had consistently tried to turn the Kerem Shalom border crossing (which borders Egypt) into a commercial crossing between Gaza and Israel, or as an alternative passenger crossing to Rafah. The Palestinians were concerned that Israel would take control over the Gaza-Egypt border or even replace Rafah and objected. On 26 November 2005, the crossing was opened for the first time under the European Union's supervision, while the Israeli army kept a video watch from a nearby base and retained control over the movement of all goods and trade in and out of Gaza.  Statistics  After the Israeli disengagement in 2005, the monthly average number of entries and exits through Rafah Crossing reached about 40,000. After the capture of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in June 2006, the crossing was closed 76% of the time and after Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip it was closed permanently except for infrequent limited openings by Egypt. From June 2010 to January 2011, the monthly average number of exits and entries through Rafah reached 19,000.

Stage career She was the daughter of a prominent London journalist. Rooke left boarding school in 1896 and went directly on the stage. Unlike many novices, she achieved quick success as an actress. In 1897 she performed the role of Ophelia in Hamlet. Edward Gordon Craig appeared in the title role. Rooke played the part of the Christian maiden, Mercia, in The Sign of the Cross. The play was adapted from the historical drama written by Wilson Barrett. The production was staged at the Fourteenth Street Theatre in New York City, in October 1898. The entire company was composed of actors from London's Lyric Theatre. Rooke was in an original production of Quality Street prior to creating the character of the charwoman in The Silver Box. The latter was the first John Galsworthy play to be produced. It was staged in 1906. Rooke is remembered for depicting characters who were \\"quiet but valiant, misunderstood but uncomplaining.\\" She acted the part of Kate Hardcastle in the Ben Greet production of She Stoops To Conquer. Rooke's performance was well-received as was the character played by Julia Reynolds. They performed together on the Oberlin, Ohio stage, in March 1908. The Greet Company presented A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare to audiences in La Crosse, Wisconsin, in 1909. Rooke trained under and toured with Greet. She also appeared in support of E.H. Sothern. Her acting range was broad. She demonstrated this in 1913 while touring Canada with the company of Annie Horniman. On this trip Rooke played parts including the title roles in The Second Mrs. Tanqueray, Major Barbara, and Alice Sit-by- the-Fire. In the latter stages of her stage career she impressed critics most vividly with her rendition of the mother in Oliver Cromwell. The theatrical production was adapted from the writing of John Drinkwater. Rooke played an old woman who relished the cause of freedom, yet who loved poetry even more. Films Rooke was in films beginning with her role opposite Nigel Playfair in Lady Windermere's Fan (1916). In the drama, The Street of Adventure (1921), she was cast with Lionelle Howard and Margot Drake. Rooke appeared as Catherine de' Medici in The Loves of Mary, Queen of Scots (1923). The 16th century historical drama featured Fay Compton and Jack Cardiff. She also featured in the 1927 film version of the popular stage play Hindle Wakes, directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Estelle Brody and John Stuart. Her final films were released in 1932, both of them British titles produced by G.B. Samuelson. Rooke depicted Lady Grathers in Threads and Mrs. Maynard in Collision. Death Rooke died in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, England, in 1958. She retired from the theatre more than twenty years prior to her death. She was married to Milton Rosmer.

It stars James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. The film was made in 1995, shortly after the fall of apartheid and the free election of Nelson Mandela as President of South Africa. Plot Set in South Africa in October 1946, before the implementation of apartheid, this is the story of church minister Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) who is requested from his village to Johannesburg. There he discovers that his son Absalom has been arrested for the murder of a white man. The white man's father, James Jarvis (Richard Harris), supports apartheid. When the two meet, they come to unexpected understandings about their sons and their own humanity. Selected cast *James Earl Jones as Rev.

Music The score was composed by veteran English composer John Barry, who dedicated it to Nelson Mandela. It has been described by film score reviewer Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks.com as \\"one of Barry's last truly enjoyable efforts.\\" Barry, who had previously composed music for such African themed films as Zulu (1964), Born Free (1966), and Out of Africa (1985), used predominantly western musical styles to complete the score. The music is notable for referencing themes from Barry's previous work on Zulu, augmenting the original warlike compositions into a somber piano theme for travel scenes. The film also features the song \\"Exile\\" by Enya. The music was performed by the English Chamber Orchestra and recorded in Studio One at the EMI Abbey Road Studios, London. Filming The film was shot on location in KwaZulu Natal, Cape Province, and at Gauteng, South Africa. Reception Cry, the Beloved Country received a mostly positive response from critics and holds an 85% \\"Fresh\\" rating from the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Online critic James Berardinelli gave the film four out of four stars, and described the performances of Harris and Jones as \\"superb,\\" concluding \\"Rarely does a motion picture touch the heart so deeply, with no hint of artifice or manipulation.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times also wrote favorably of the film, commenting \\"In a moment as transcendent as it is risky, the screen erupts with a volcanic emotion that cuts through the prevailing high-minded contemplation. Why risky? Because movies have become so invested in the unleashing of violent emotion and the escalation of hostility, that expressions of restraint, reconciliation and forgiveness can easily be read as corny cop-outs. Cry, the Beloved Country is not corny, and it doesn't cop out.\\" Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times had a less positive view of the film, giving it only two and half out of four stars, and commenting, \\"The film has genuine qualities. Its photography and tone evoke a South Africa that is indeed beloved by its inhabitants ('If the climate and the landscape were not so beautiful, we would have had a revolution 50 years ago,' Paton is said to have observed). The performances by Jones and Harris have a quiet dignity, suitable to the characters if not reflecting a larger reality. But the film contains little that would have concerned the South African censors under apartheid. [...] Cry, the Beloved Country reflects a sentimentality that motivates many people, but it fails as a portrait of what it used to be like in South Africa, what happened and what it's like now.\\" Awards and nominations *NAACP Image Awards **Outstanding Motion Picture (Nominated) **Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture: James Earl Jones (Nominated) **Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture: Charles S.

Career Born in Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire, McDonald began his career with his hometown club Barrow before joining Workington. A move to Liverpool followed but he did not break into the first team, and was loaned to Colchester United before joining Mansfield Town in July 1975, with whom he won the Third Division title in 1976‚Äì77. He moved to York City where he became a regular in midfield before joining Aldershot in November 1981, in exchange for Malcolm Crosby. At Aldershot he gained renown as a skilful midfielder and captained the side to promotion to the Third Division under Len Walker in 1987. After leaving League football in 1989 to join Farnborough Town, he returned to Aldershot as caretaker manager following the resignation of Brian Talbot in November 1991. However, the Hampshire club was now deep in debt and struggling back in the Fourth Division, having narrowly avoided going out of business the previous year. Staff wages regularly went unpaid, and many players moved elsewhere just to seek a guaranteed wage. McDonald often had to resort to recruiting amateur footballers just to be able to field a full side. McDonald stayed with Aldershot until the club finally went out of business and left the Football League on 25 March 1992. His assistant Steve Wignall was appointed manager of the new Aldershot Town club which was formed several weeks later, and that summer McDonald made his own football comeback as a reserve team coach at Millwall. Later in 1992, McDonald had his own testimonial with the new Aldershot side at the Recreation Ground against Southampton. He later worked part-time in schools support in the Barrow-in- Furness area.

Smithfield Market The area was originally the site of the Birmingham Manor House in which the De Birmingham family had lived for centuries. The house had fallen into decay, a situation it had been in many times since the 16th century. The manor house was purchased by the Birmingham Street Commissioners from Sir Thomas Gooch. The house was demolished and the moat filled in in 1816. Twelve feet of silt was removed from the moat. The establishment of a market in the area was made possible by the lack of density of the buildings and was described in 1848 as \\"a spacious area.\\" It was built on the site of the ancient manor house moat. The Smithfield Market was opened on Whitsun Fair Thursday, 29 May 1817 by the Birmingham Street Commissioners. The total cost of the development was ¬£3,223 with the cost of construction being ¬£2,449. A result of the opening of the market was the removal of farm animals from the streets and the increase in amount of space for retail trading. Due to the proximity to the markets, Smithfield also developed into a trading centre, establishing its own cattle and horse market which occasionally sold hay and straw on Michaelmas Day in 1817. An Act of Parliament passed in the same year forced the sheep and pig market, which had been held on New Street. The market was further extended in 1883 when a wholesale vegetable market opened on part of the Smithfield site. The pig market in Smithfield was moved to a new site on Montague Street in 1897 and the cattle market followed in 1898. The vegetable market took over the market by 1900, however, a weekly and bi-weekly second-hand market, known as the Rag Fair, was also held there from before 1912 until 1957. Smithfield market declined due to the increasing popularity in the dead meat market. The market closed in the 1960s after being purchased by Birmingham City Council for the construction for the Inner Ring Road and the construction of new wholesale markets. The whole site was cleared in 1975. During the clearance work, several large sandstone blocks were removed which could have possibly formed the inner wall of the moat. In addition, other stonework was discovered but for reasons of time and money, no detailed excavations took place leading to the production of a floorplan. All recovered rocks were moved to Weoley Castle though nothing has been done to them since. Smithfield Market had also been a popular public meeting area with a notable event being the assembly of 5,000 black children for the Birmingham Street Robins' winter treat. They proceeded to march to the Drill Hall in Thorpe Street, where they drank tea, eat cakes and received Christmas gifts of fruit, clothing, books and toys, provided by numerous charitable organisations and individuals. Transport Smithfield was also a tram terminus for the city. As congestion developed in Smithfield, it was decided that it should be moved to Station Street and in June 1885, work to do this commenced. The area at present Smithfield House viewed from Moat Lane car park, the former site of the market and manor. Today, the area has completely disappeared. Smithfield Markets expanded to become the Bull Ring Indoor Market was rebuilt and opened before the redevelopment of the Bullring Shopping Centre. Outdoor markets are held outside the entrance. The Bull Ring Rag Market was demolished as part of the development and a multi- storey car park was constructed. The markets adopted the name of the Bull Ring and lost the Smithfield name. The original site of the Smithfield market is now Moat Lane car park. Smithfield Street, which connected Bradford Street (then Moat Row) to Digbeth High Street was renamed Mill Lane. There are very few reminders of the existence of Smithfield. Smithfield House, an office building with ground floor retail, once occupied by Reddingtons Rare Records, bounded by Upper Mill Lane, Moat Lane and Digbeth High Street is directly opposite the site of the old market. Inside the new multi-storey car park on Pershore Street is a walkway called Smithfield Passage. The name of Moat Lane is a reference to the moat that once encircled the manor house on the site. And the site, will also be the host to the 2022 Commonwealth Games 3X3 Basketball, Wheelchair Basketball and Beach Volleyball competitions, held within 2 bespoke games time arenas on the land.

It is located northeast of the comarca of L'Horta de Valencia, northwest of the inland suburbs of Valencia, and on the left bank of the river Turia. Its population in 2014 was 67,156 inhabitants, being the eleventh city by population in the Valencian Community.  Geography  The town is characterized by a dry Mediterranean climate, with an average annual rainfall around and temperatures ranging from minimum in January to maximum in August, reaching every summer peaks above .  History  The first signs of human settlement in Paterna back to the Neolithic and Bronze Age, and relics have been found in settlements of The Vallesa and Despe√±aperros, in an area of small hills near the river Turia, which allowed the water supply. The Iberians also left their imprint in The Vallesa and Despe√±aperros, where there have been found remains of a defensive wall and the walls of small huts. Documentation relating to the arrival of the Romans is limited to literary references of events near Valentia, Edeta and Saguntum. It is believed that it was at this time the original place name of Paterna was first used which is supposed to make reference to the Latin word \\"Paternus\\" or belonging to the father, alluding to the social and legal status of the property. In the municipal district, there have been found remains of an aqueduct system that extends to Massamagrell and might link through to Sagunto, a large Roman site. In February 2009, the excavation of a plot which was planned for housing led to the discovery of the ruins of a Roman villa, dated between the 1st and 3rd centuries. This offers a new twist to the known history of the city and becomes the first traces of a Roman habitation between Valencia and Ll√≠ria. In the Moslem period, Paterna developed a manufacturing and pottery industry and also began development of agriculture, including new irrigated lands and the introduction of crops such as rice and oranges. On April 10, 1237, at 3.13 PM, there is a peaceful entry of King James I of Aragon into the Paterna area that precipitated the Second Slaughter of the Gingers in Paterna. According to the Book of Distribution, the farm of Paterna was given to Artal de Luna, one of those appointed by James I to write the Jurisdictions. The Luna family become feudal lords from the 13th to 15th century, when the ceramic from Paterna reached full production. In the 16th century, there was a crisis in ceramic production and the local economy in general. In 1436 Alfonso the Magnanimous gave possession of Paterna to the infant Henry, son of Ferdinand I of Antequera and Duke of Segovia. The Expulsion of the Moriscos forced the Muslim population into exile and consequently Paterna suffered depopulation and subsequent economic stagnation. In the Old Regime, the political crisis further exacerbated the deteriorating political, social and economic context of which Paterna was a part. By Royal Decree, in 1769 the cultivation of rice was banned to help prevent malarial fevers. In the 19th century agriculture reappeared, and displayed the first cave (?). That same century a water pipeline was built (1866), and a new building for City Hall was constructed in 1881. In 1888 a narrow gauge railway was built (inaugurated April 22, 1888), forming part of the Valencia - Liria line, which greatly improved communication. Population growth starts slowly with a flow of immigration and the enlargement of Paterna with the construction of The Camp neighborhood with houses and chalets for bourgeoisie from Valencia, and a military barracks for protection of the city In the 20th century the creation of the industrial area, Pol√≠gono Fuente del Jarro, generated a strong demand for labor that subsequently attracted a flow of immigration that changed the economy and the urban aspect of Paterna.  Demography  Paterna had about 3,505 inhabitants in 1900. The creation of the Pol√≠gono Fuente del Jarro industrial area favored immigration between 1950 and 1970 in which Paterna experienced significant social and urban change, coming up triple the population. The current population growth is due to the creation of new residential areas and the expansion of industrial areas in the municipality. In 2014, the number of inhabitants was 67,156 according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE). = Neighborhoods and districts = The nuclei of the municipality are: Urban Center (Center, Alborg√≠, Campament, Santa Rita), La Canyada (El Pantio, Monteca√±ada, La Vallesa), Mas del Rosary (La Coma), Terramelar, Lloma Llarga (Valterna) and Bobalar (Casas Verde, Creu de Gr√†cia and Santa Gemma). In addition, Paterna has four industrial parks: Fuente del Jarro, Tactica, L'Andana and Parque Tecnol√≥gico. = Demographic Statistics 2004 = * Average annual population growth rate 2000-2004: 1.9% * Population Change 2000-2004: 7.7%  Economy  The services sector represents 56% of global economic activity in the municipality.

Known ceramics are plates, bowls, pharmacy jars painted in blue and gold and decorated in green and manganese. The pictures are varied: human figures, animals, plants or heraldic. The socarrat (15th century) is the most distinctive piece of Paterna's pottery. They are pieces of clay with a rectangular shape that were used for decoration of palaces and mansions, including eaves and ceilings. A large sample is exposed at the Museum of Ceramics in Paterna, which manages the loan of pieces to other museums and exhibitions. Currently there are ceramic pieces from Paterna in the National Archaeological Museum (Madrid) and in other museums of Valencia, Barcelona, Paris, London or New York.

Picassent is a town of close to twenty thousand people. Originally the town's main economic activity was agriculture, however during the last twenty years Picassent developed two industrial areas adjacent to the city centre. The excellent communications and its distance to the main City of Valencia have converted Picassent in an ideal location (and cheaper) for the city workers that commute every day. In the surrounding countryside, one of the largest of the cantons (comarca), the locals grow orange trees. The municipality is composed by several neighbourhoods, some more formal than others. Traditionally these neighbourhoods were attached to the three Churches sited next to three main town squares: \\"San Cristobal\\" next to the townhall square, \\"Milagrosa\\" next to the Market square and \\"l¬¥hermita de la Vallivana\\" next to \\"l¬¥hermita\\" square. The town celebrates two main festivals a year, one on 10 July in honour of \\"San Cristobal\\" and another on 8 September in honour to \\"Virgen de la Vallivana\\". During the July festival there is a week of \\"bous al carrer\\", a version of the well known \\"San Fermin\\" in Pamplona.

Antiques have been found from the Bronze Age. It got the entitlement of 'village' in 1324, and on 22 October 1364 it came under the control of Pere Boil Colom. Its population in 1510 was less than 400 people, around 100 families, which got halved with the expulsion of the Muslims and the general crisis in 1646 with the loss of some settlements like Ninyerola and Espioca. It didn't recover until the year 1713 when it reached 100 families again and has continued growing until now. The older area is known as the \\"Carrerons\\" (meaning long streets in the local language). The village kept its original walls until 1820. Some remaining historic building are * The Sant Cristofol church which was built over an older building between the years 1712 and 1755. * The Espioca tower, which was built by Muslims in the 11th century and was used as a defensive point for Valencia.

It lies in the Sz√©kely Land, an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania, and is composed of two villages, Porumbenii Mari (the commune center; Nagygalambfalva) and Porumbenii Mici (Kisgalambfalva). Porumbenii Mari is generally referred to as Galambfalva in Hungarian and was originally called Golumba Mare in Romanian. Demographics Formerly part of Mugeni commune, the two villages broke off in 2004. At the 2011 census, 99.33% of inhabitants were Sz√©kely Hungarians and 0.51% Roma. History The commune has attracted interest from archaeologists, who have uncovered numerous material proofs of human settlement in the area beginning in prehistory. Dacian pottery and ceramic fragments from the Bronze Age, the Age of Migrations, and the Middle Ages have been discovered in sites along the √Åj and Nagy brooks. The archaeological record proves a settlement existed during the period of the √Årp√°ds, but the current settlement was documented only in 1332. The villages belonged first to the Sz√©kely seat of Udvarhelysz√©k, then, from 1876 until 1918, to Udvarhely County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After World War I, by the terms of the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of Romania. As a result of the Second Vienna Award, it belonged to Hungary again between 1940 and 1944. After World War II, it came under Romanian administration and became part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, it formed part of the Hungarian Autonomous Province, then, of the Mure»ô-Hungarian Autonomous Province until it was abolished in 1968. Since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County. Its economy is based on agriculture and animal husbandry, with small sectors in milling flour, baking bread, and other commercial activities. The medieval church, today used by the village's Hungarian Reformed community, first appeared in the papal annals of 1332-1337. An originally Gothic structure with elements from subsequent periods, the church's medieval features were largely destroyed during the reconstruction of the building in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

History  As 'Madaras' on Josephinische Landaufnahme, 1769-73 As 'Madaras' on Josephinische Landaufnahme, 1769-73 The village was first mentioned in 1567 as Madaras, meaning \\"birdy\\". Its name may have referred to the abundancy of birds in the area. Transylvanian Toponym Book Its Romanian name derives from the Hungarian form. According to tradition, the village was in the beginning located in the H√°morkert (Iron Hammer Garden) part also known as Fejedelem Kertje (Dukes‚Äôs Garden). Its residents used to be engaged in the mining of iron ore and mercury which was a royal monopoly. By the 18th century, the iron ore mine became exhausted, so the villagers started to deal with pottery and the village soon was famous for its potters which lasted until the end of the 19th century. More recently, thermal water sources has been discovered in the area and there are still unexploited iron ore and andezit occurrences, too. The village historically belonged to the Sz√©kely seat of Cs√≠ksz√©k until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when it fell within Cs√≠k County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of Romania and fell within Ciuc County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the village was held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the commune became officially part of Romania in 1947.

It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List because fewer than 1,000 individuals were estimated to be alive as of 2017. It is the only member of the genus Houbaropsis. Description Adult male taking flight in Kaziranga National Park, Assam (India) Adult male in flight in Manas National Park, Assam, India Adult Bengal floricans range from in length and stand around tall. The male has black plumage from the head and neck to underparts. Its head carries a long lanky crest, and the neck has elongated display plumes. The upperside is buff with fine black vermiculations and black arrowhead markings, and there is a conspicuous large white patch from the wing coverts to the remiges. In flight, the male's wings appear entirely white except for the dark primary remiges. The feet and legs are yellow, the bill and irides are dark.Grimmett, R; Inskipp, C. and T. (1998): Birds of the Indian Subcontinent. Christopher Helm, London. Females are larger than the males and have a buff-brown colour similar to the males' back, with a dark brown crown and narrow dark streaks down the side of the neck. Their wing coverts are lighter than the remiges and covered in fine dark barring. Immature birds look like females. Adult females weigh around against a weight of in males.A Natural History They are normally silent but when disturbed utters a metallic chik-chik-chik call. Displaying males croak and produce a strange deep humming. The only bird even remotely similar to adult males of the Bengal florican is the lesser florican (Sypheotides indica). This is a smaller, slimmer-necked bustard overall, and its males have cheek-tufts of plumes with pennant-like tips rather than the crest, and a white band between neck and back. The females are similar, and young Bengal floricans can be easily mistaken for female lesser floricans. The latter has almost white wing coverts however, resembling the males' wing patch.BirdLife International (2009) Species factsheet: Houbaropsis bengalensis. Distribution and habitat Bengal florican at Orang National Park, Assam, India It has two disjunct populations, one in the Indian subcontinent, another in Southeast Asia. The former occurs from Uttar Pradesh (India) through the Terai of Nepal to Assam (where it is called ulu mora) and Arunachal Pradesh in India, and historically to Bangladesh. The South East Asian population occurs in Cambodia and perhaps adjacent southern Vietnam. This species is mostly resident on its breeding grounds; around Tonl√© Sap in Cambodia however, the birds use grasslands near the lake to breed, and move away from the water in the wet season when the breeding grounds are flooded. Similarly, the Terai population seems to move to warmer lowland locations in winter. Migrations are not long- distance, however, and probably are restricted to a few dozen kilometers. Bengal floricans live in open tall grassland habitats with scattered bushes. The most important grass species are satintails (Imperata, in particular Cogongrass I. cylindrica), sugarcane (Saccharum, in particular S. munja and Kans Grass S. spontaneum), as well as Desmostachya bipinnata. The birds are usually encountered in the early mornings and evenings and are most easily spotted in the breeding season from March to August, which is when most censuses of the population are conducted. Particular between March and May, when they give their stunning courtship display, males are far more conspicuous than the cryptically-coloured females, which moreover prefer high grassland rich in sugarcane. =Status and conservation= Female at Manas National Park Restricted to tiny fragments of grassland scattered across South and Southeast Asia, the Bengal florican is the world's rarest bustard. It is known to have become increasingly threatened by land conversion for intensive agriculture, particularly for dry season rice production. Poaching continues to be a problem in Southeast Asia, while the South Asian population is down to less than 350 adult birds, about 85% of which are found in India. Though more threatened, birds in Southeast Asia may number as many as in South Asia but more probably closer to or even less than 1,000 adults.BirdLife International (2008, 2009) Species factsheet: Houbaropsis bengalensis The population has decreased dramatically in past decades. It may be that in India the decline is coming to a halt and that stocks in Dibru-Saikhowa and Kaziranga National Parks and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve are safe at very low levels. Still, its global status is precarious and it was consequently uplisted from Endangered to Critically Endangered in the 2007 IUCN Red List.BirdLife International (2007, 2008, 2009) Species factsheets: Houbaropsis bengalensis. In Cambodia, it is mostly found in Kampong Thom Province; lesser numbers are found in Siem Reap Province and remnants might persist in Banteay Meanchey, Battambang and Pursat Provinces. Its rate of decline there has accelerated in the early 21st century, and the bird's numbers in Southeast Asia might fall to effective extinction in the early 2010s. The government of Cambodia has taken a significant step towards protecting important habitat for the Bengal florican. Along with 350 square kilometres being designated as \\"Integrated Farming and Biodiversity Areas\\", where land-use practices are adapted to also benefit the Bengal florican, a public education program to inform schoolchildren about the bird has also been undertaken. At present, the species may persist in the Ang Trapaing Thmor Crane Sanctuary and perhaps Vietnam's Tr√†m Chim National Park, but the South Asian population is not known with certainty from any protected areas. In Nepal, it is essentially restricted to protected areas, namely Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, Bardia and Chitwan National Parks. Since 1982, the Sukla Phanta and Bardia populations appear to have been stable, but the Chitwan population has declined. In 2001, 20‚Äì28 birds were estimated in Sukla Phanta, 6‚Äì10 birds in Bardia, and 6‚Äì22 birds in Chitwan. It used to be fairly common in the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve but has not been recorded there since 1990, and has not been sighted around the Koshi Barrage since the 1980s.Baral, N., Timilsina, N., Tamang, B.

BirdingASIA 10 (2008): 43‚Äì47. In spring 2011, 17 birds were recorded from nine different sites along a north- south stretch of the Koshi River. Seven were males and 10 were females. Only five individuals were recorded outside the reserve, two pairs north of Koshi Tappu, and one female seen twice near the Koshi Barrage area.Baral, H. S., Ram, A. K., Chaudhary, B., Basnet, S., Chaudhary, H., Giri, T. R. and D. Chaudhary (2012). Conservation status of Bengal Florican Houbaropsis bengalensis bengalensis (Gmelin, 1789) (Gruiformes: Otididae) in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve and adjoining areas, eastern Nepal . Journal of Threatened Taxa 4(3): 2464‚Äì2469. The courtship display of males has been discussed by many naturalists travelling British India, and in the modern era attracts tourists who provide revenue to locals. Studies indicate that the Bengal florican is not a particularly shy or hemerophobic species, its apparent intolerance of human settlements being chiefly due to its intolerance of land clearance for agriculture. Pastures and the traditional use of common land for villagers' tall-grass harvest (for construction and handicraft) actually seem to be tolerated quite well by the birds. If firewood and timber is collected from grassland rather than from forests, human land use will even benefit the species. In particular, sal (Shorea robusta) and saj (Terminalia elliptica) have been identified as trees that encroach upon the florican's habitat in Nepal, and its decline in Bardia National Park is probably chiefly due to insufficient use of trees that overgrow grassland. A sustainable land- management technique that will bolster Bengal florican stocks consists of harvesting grass and particularly wood from changing tracts of land, leaving some areas unharvested each year and setting aside a few additional ones as reserve land, where grasses can grow tall for years until they are harvested. Controlled burning may be necessary when woodland encroachment is strong; it should take place before March so that the year's offspring are not harmed. A landscape ecology approach, integrating social, biological and physical environmental elements at scales compatible with management objectives, will be needed to effectively conserve Bengal floricans and their grassland habitats.

It was part of An T√≥stal, a national festival begun by Se√°n Lemass in 1952, as an attempt to set lift the country from a period of economic depression and high emigration. This initiative was supported by senior Army officers and B√≥rd F√°ilte, the Irish Tourist Board; which played a leading role in its implementation.Ruth Fleischmann, Ed.: Cork International Choral Festival 1954-2004: A Celebration, 2004, p 10. The first T√≥stal began in Cork in 1953 with a pageant in which a large section of the business community took part; there were sporting events, Gaelic League activities, and an arts programme which included a performance of Handel's Messiah performed by the English Hall√© Orchestra under Sir John Barbirolli, with Our Lady‚Äôs Choral Society of Dublin ‚Äì in all 300 performers. The following year the Choral Festival was established in its own right, and two years later the Cork Film Festival. The Choral Festival set out to * encourage music-making at local level, to provide a forum for rural and small town choirs * bring outstanding foreign choirs to Ireland and thus set standards against which the national choirs could measure themselves * safeguard standards by having panels of Irish and foreign adjudicators * provide entertainment for a large audience by combining competitive with non- competitive performances interspersed with Irish and foreign folk dancing * establish contact between the two parts of Ireland: a choir from Belfast attended the first Festival and that bridge-building continued to be successful Festival policy despite the Troubles * establish links with foreign choirs and dance teams and encourage Irish choirs to visit their counterparts abroad * create incentives for the production of new choral music by Irish composers and to encourage Irish choirs to perform this music: since the beginning competitors have been required to sing one work by a living composer from their own country. From 1958-1961 there were two competitions for Irish composers: one for a new work, and one for a folk song arrangement; in 1962 the Seminar on Contemporary Choral Music was set up which commissioned up to four Irish and foreign composers every year to produce new works for performance at the university Seminar and at the Festival. (To date 118 new works have been commissioned from 98 different composers). 1972 brought a further initiative with the Se√°n √ì Riada Trophy competition for young Irish composers commissioned by Irish choirs. * encourage choral music in schools ‚Äì a schools competition was introduced in 1966 * bring the Festival to the city through outreach or fringe activities which have been organised since 1959. Visiting choirs sing for church services and give church recitals; choirs and dance teams perform in various venues outside the City Hall; foreign choirs give joint recitals with Irish partner choirs in their home towns in County Cork.Ruth Fleischmann, Ed.: Cork International Choral Festival 1954-2004: A Celebration, 2004, pp 10-11. Each year amateur international choirs are selected to compete for the Fleischmann International Trophy. The selected choirs also perform non-competitively in a range of Festival activities over the weekend, including Fringe concerts, church and informal performances.

No source gives the precise date, although 21 July is possible from the sequence of events. The battle was a part of the wider Italian War of 1542‚Äì1546, and took place during the French invasion of the Isle of Wight. Several landings were made, including at Bonchurch. Most accounts suggest that England won the battle, and the French advance across the island was halted. The battle was between French regular soldiers, and local English militiamen. Although the French force that landed was considerably larger than the English force, it is thought that the number of French soldiers involved in this battle to be about 500, with the number of militiamen uncertain, with one source stating 300 and another 2,800. The English forces are believed to have been commanded by Captain Robert Fyssher, and the French by Le Seigneur de Tais. The battle was one of several fought between English and French on the Isle of Wight. The majority of sources state that the English won this battle, although one suggests that the French were victorious. The battle was fought as part of the French attempt to cause enough damage to force English ships to leave their defensive positions and attack in less favourable conditions. Something they failed to achieve and had to withdraw from the island Other French landings were made at Sandown, Bembridge, and St Helens. Background The Italian War of 1542-1546 arose from a dispute between Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Francis I of France, which had not been settled by the Italian War of 1535-1538. This led to war between France, backed by the Ottoman Empire and J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg, and the Holy Roman Empire, backed by the Kingdom of England, Spain, Saxony, and Brandenburg. After two years of fighting Charles V, and Henry VIII invaded France. In September 1544, English forces captured Boulogne. France failed to re-capture the city by force. Peace talks between England and France were unsuccessful, partly because Henry VIII refused to return Boulogne.Robert Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 501; Scarisbrick, Henry VIII, 397‚Äì398. As a result, Francis I decided to invade England, hoping that Henry VIII would return Boulogne in return for his leaving England. Thirty thousand French troops and a fleet of some 400 vessels were assembled,Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 502; Phillips, \\"Testing the 'Mystery'\\", 50‚Äì51. and sailed from Le Havre on 16 July. On 18 July, French and English ships engaged off the English coast, marking the beginning of the Battle of the Solent. The outnumbered English ships withdrew, hoping to lure the French into the shallows of Spithead, but the French wanted to fight in the more open waters of eastern Spithead where the English could be encircled. To entice the English to abandon their defensive position and engage the larger French fleet, they decided to invade the Isle of Wight and burn buildings and crops. France also hoped that the residents of the island might support them and rebel against England, so that it could be used as a base. French troops landed on 21 July. During the Hundred Years War, society had become militarised: male adults were obliged to fight if needed, and they received regular military training. The Captain of the Isle, Sir Richard Worsley of Appuldurcombe House, was considered a \\"capable and energetic commander\\". He was assisted by Sir Edward Bellingham, an officer in the regular army, and a headquarters staff. Compared to the heavily armoured French troops, bristling with the latest firearms and steel blades, the militia relied on long pikes topped with a bill hook, and daggers, knives, and clubs for close fighting. The Welsh longbow provided their firepower. However they had advantages in speed and agility. The French plan at Bonchurch may have been to burn Wroxall and Appuldurcombe, capture and consolidate a position on the heights of St. Boniface Down, and then link up with another French landing near Sandown. The area around Bonchurch was important because nearby Dunnose Point offered safe anchorage, and had a fresh water source. Prelude 2000 French troops landed at three locations on the coast, including about 500 at Bonchurch. The landing was unopposed and the French began to advance inland, up the steep and thickly wooded slopes. The Isle of Wight militia learned of the French invasion quickly; 300 of them, under the command of Captain Robert Fyssher, were already waiting at St. Boniface Down for the French to advance from Monks Bay. Battle There is no comprehensive account of the battle. However, it could have taken place at dawn and lasted until midday. Some accounts suggest that local women participated by shooting arrows at the French. =Outcome= One amateur source claims that the French won the battle at Bonchurch. The English forces took up a defensive position flanked by cliffs and screened by woods. The first French attack was apparently repelled but the French commander Le Seigneur de Tais rallied his troops. A second attack was launched, with the French forces in the 'array' fighting formation. The account concludes by claiming that, after heavy casualties on both sides, the English line broke and the militia routed, and that Captain Robert Fyssher shouted an offer of ¬£100 for anyone who could bring him a horse to escape, because of his being too fat to run. Sir John Oglander is claimed to have said: \\"but none could be had even for a kingdom\\". The captain was never heard from again, and the account suggests he was either killed, or captured and buried at sea. All other relevant sources state it was a comprehensive English victory Aftermath Casualties on both sides were heavy. Another skirmish took place several days later, when the English engaged Frenchmen, disembarked from ships retreating from Portsmouth to look for fresh water. A senior French commander, Chevalier D'Aux, was killed. The assumed English victory at Bonchurch only had a marginal impact on the course of the war, because it only involved a fraction of the forces engaged throughout. Had the French captured the island, it is unlikely this would have drastically affected the war, because more significant territory was being contested. However, the island could have been used to support French operations against England; Claude d'Annebault, commander of the French armada, recorded: \\"having it [the Isle of Wight] under our control, we could then dominate Portsmouth... and so put the enemy to extraordinary expense in maintaining a standing army and navy to contain us\\". Although some sources do claim that the victory at Bonchurch was responsible for the French withdrawal, the source that claims a French victory says that fighting at Bembridge was ultimately responsible for forcing the French to leave.

By rail you can get there Renfe Media Distancia line 47, also known as the Valencia-X√†tiva-Alcoy line. =Neighbouring localities= The municipality of Puebla del Duc is bordered by the following towns: B√®lgida, Beniatjar, Benig√†nim, Castell√≥ de Rugat, Quatretonda, Llutxent, Otos and Sempere, all of them in the province of Valencia. History It is known that in this place existed farmhouses founded and inhabited by the Muslims and that after the conquest of King Jaime I of Aragon in the middle of the thirteenth century, this king granted a new foundation, delivering it to mister Belvis, feudal lord who at that time managed these lands, the so-called Carta Puebla, for the foundation of a new urban nucleus recognized by the Kingdom of Valencia. Later, this lordship gave this possession to the Dukes of Gand√≠a, more specifically to the dukes of the House of Borja, hence its current name. Economy Until a few years ago the vine was the main and almost the only economic support of this population. But with the time and the demands of the market today much of the soil is dedicated to summer fruit trees, such as plum, peach and apricot trees. There are several poultry and pig farms, while some 200 sheep are grazing in the wild. The industrial sector has seen broad growth in recent years, but it is still less important than agri-food activities. Monuments *Manor houses. There are still a large number of manor houses in the town, which, although Spartan in their finishes, do not lose their Mediterranean charm. *Parish church. Dedicated to Nuestra se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n, with rectangular plan and hexagonal base tower. *Calvary Garden. Interesting to see at it. *The Poasa.

Founded in 1603, based on the hermitage of San Sebastian and San Fabi√°n, located on the outskirts of the town. After the ecclesiastical disentailment and the exclaustration decreed by Mendiz√°bal in 1835, the building was ceded to the town hall, who demolished it. The original church of the convent is dedicated to San Cosme and San Dami√°n and there are hardly any arches of the gates, which have been integrated into a small park-garden.

The letter was reprinted in various journals, including the Gentleman's Magazine and The Gazetteer, and has since been used by beer historians for the basis of information about porter. The letter Sir, I believe I may say I am the oldest acting outdoor Clerk at present in the brewery. I served in the trade when Tom Tryon (a student in physick) whom I new very well, occasioned no small bustle among us by advising the not boiling of our worts for fear that our ales should taste raw. This, as near as I can recollect, was about the time of the Revolution as proves in how much need the trade stood of further improvement. (here come arguments for a rise in price of beer) ...In the beginning of King William's reign, whose memory be ever blessed, the duty on strong beer and ale was 2/6 per barrel and small beer was made from the same grains and sold for 6/- per barrel. Both the ale and beer was fetched from the brew-house by the customers themselves or at their charge, and paid for with ready money; so we entertained but few servants, fewer horses; we had no stocks of ales and beers in store, of casks but a trifling quantity and money in the Compting House before either duty or malt was become due. The Victuallers then sold this ale for twopence the quart. But soon after our wars with France occasioned Further duties on this commodity‚ÄîI set them down from memory alone‚Äîninepence per barrel more in 1693 was laid on strong ale, an additional threepence per barrel in 1694. The whole duty amounted to four shillings per barrel on ale and one shilling per barrel on small beer at this period. Ale rose in price to 18/- and 19/- per barrel and the victualler sold it for twopence halfpenny per quart. Now we come to the Queen's time, when France disturbing us again, the Malt Tax, the Duty on Hops and that on coals took place, besides one shilling per barrel more on strong beer and ale and fourpence per barrel more on small beer, owing to old Lewis's ambition. Our duties on strong beer and ale amounted to 5/- per barrel and on small beer 1/4 per barrel. May he receive his reward, say I, for about the year 1710 his machinations embarrassed us much. However, at last, it was realised that the duty on malt surpassed by much the duty on hops, from whence the Brewers endeavoured at a liquor wherein more of these last should be used. Thus the drinking of beer came to be encouraged in preference to ale. This beer, when new, was sold for 2/- per barrel, but the people not easily weaned from their wonted sweet heavy drink, in general used ale mixed with beer, which they purchased from the Ale draper at twopence halfpenny, and twopence three farthings per quart. About this time the Gentry residing in London more than they had in former times, for them was introduced the pale ales and pale small beers they were habituated to in the country and many of the Brewers took (to) making drinks of this sort. Affluence and cleanliness promoted the delivery of them in the brewer's own casks and at his charge. Pale malt being dearer than brown malt, the brewer being loaded with more and greater taxes, the price of such small beer was fixed at 8/- and 10/- per barrel and that of the ale at 10/- per barrel; the latter was retailed by the victuallers at twopence per pint or fourpence per quart under the name of twopenny. This incroachment on the consumption of the drinks which London had always been habituated to, excited the brown beer brewers to produce if possible a better sort of commodity in their own way, than heretofore had been made. To their honour I say it, my old Masters were foremost in this attempt and thus much let me add, I approved of the undertaking. They began to hop their mild beer more and the Publican started three, four, sometimes six butts at once, but so little idea had the brewer or his customers incurring the charge of great stocks of beer, that some moneyed people made a trade of purchasing their hopped beers at the first hand, keeping them sometime and when stale to dispose of the same to Publicans for 5/- per barrel and 6/- per barrel. Our tastes but slowly alter or reform. Some drank mild beer and stale mixed, others ale, mild beer and stale blended together at threepence per quart, but many used all stale at fourpence per pot. On this footing stood the trade until about the year 1722 when the Brewers conceived there was a method to be found preferable to any of these extremes; that beer well brewed, kept its proper time, became racy and mellow, that is, neither new nor stale, such would recommend itself to the public. This they ventured to sell at 5/- per barrel that the victualler might retail at threepence per quart. At first it was slow in making its way, but in the end the experiment succeeded beyond all expectation. The labouring people, porters etc. experienced its wholesomeness and utility, they assumed to themselves the use thereof, from whence it was called Porter or Entire Butt. As yet, however, it was far from being in the perfection which since we have had it. I well remember for many years it was not expected, nor was it thought possible to be made fine and bright, and four or five months was deemed to be sufficient age for it to be drunk at. The improvement of transparency has since been added to it by means of more and better workmanship, better malt, better hops and the use of isinglass; but this more perfection has brought with it numberless charges, greater stocks, long credit, more casks, more cellarage, more servants etc. and if at this time Porter is not fine, it has brought also this casualty of being returned on the Brewers' hands as being unfit for use. (Here follow further arguments for a rise in price of beer) ...For a last objection, the Gazeteer has said, by a rise of 3/- per barrel a certain great brewhouse will be benefitted by 11,000 per annum. Perhaps is the Brewhouse I have the honour to belong to, and perhaps it may be so much advantaged. Sir, I desire to be allowed to know somewhat of this matter, if such be the profits they make, it will be the first profits they have seen these five years. Their capital stock is not less than 120,000 and this sum in the public funds would make 6,000 per annum; remains 5,000 out of which at least one half must be taken for so much as under the circumstances of a rise on beer, it will be made of better quality; the result then is that 2 per cent would be paid by the victualler for carrying on the most laborious manufacture in England. There is then a necessity for a rise on this commodity and if it did not take place when the late additional duty on malt was imposed and when liberty was granted to the Distiller to go on in his profession, the reason was this: The London brewers willing to try what could be done in support of this charge by weakening their commodity, acted in consequence thereof and how did the event prove? Why, their beers were small and bad to such a degree that it became a fashion with the people to drink one half twopenny and one half porter at threepence halfpenny the pot.

The station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting and broadcasts on 1420 kHz at 5,000 watts daytime and 1,000 watts nighttime, both directional, from a five-tower array located just north of Peekskill in the Town of Cortlandt, New York. (The day and night patterns use two different arrays of three towers, with only one tower shared by both arrays.) Its studios are in Beacon. History WLNA signed on-the-air on December 22, 1948, with 500 watts of power daytime only from a single tower located on Radio Terrace in the Town of Cortlandt.Construction permit, FCC file number BP-6229, WLNA 1420 kc Peekskill, NY dated July 1948 It was a Full service/Middle of the road AM station with heavy emphasis on local news and community events. A typical broadcast day had local news at the top and bottom of the hour, farm reports, local weather, and recorded or live music in between. During the Peekskill Riots on September 4, 1949, WLNA was requested by State Police and City of Peekskill officials to stay on the air past its 6 p.m. sign off time to broadcast emergency information to local residents and persons traveling into the area who may have not been aware of the situation. The Riots took place near Van Cortlandtville, about 2 miles west of the station.FCC violation notice and reply letter from Irving Cotrell, October 18, 1949 In 1951 the station increased power to 1,000 watts. In 1958 WLNA-FM 100.7 MHz signed on as a simulcast of the AM station. After sign-off time, WLNA-FM continued on-the-air until about midnight, allowing additional advertising revenue during shortened winter broadcast days. On October 24, 1971, WLNA-FM changed its call letters to WHUD. In 1972 the simulcast ended as FM signal split off and launched a beautiful music format from Bonneville. Throughout the 1970s WLNA continued the Full Service format. In 1980, WLNA applied to the Federal Communications Commission for a signal upgrade to 5,000 watts daytime and 1,000 watts night time power. This would entail moving the transmitter site about 1/2 mile south and putting up a five tower directional antenna array. The station owners, Highland Broadcasting, battled the Town of Cortlandt zoning board all the way to the New York State Supreme Court over a zoning variance for use of the new transmitter site.Supreme Court of the State of New York index #15043/80 Date September 5, 1980 The Supreme court sided with the radio station, and construction was finished in late 1981. After the power upgrade, the station's signal never lived up to expectations, and with the decline of AM radio, more resources were put into its sister FM station WHUD. Highland Broadcasting sold both WLNA and WHUD to Radio Terrace, Inc in 1982. Radio Terrace also owned WROW and WROW-FM in Albany, New York. Radio Terrace, Inc sold WROW-AM-FM to Albany Broadcasting, predecessor of Pamal Broadcasting in December 1993. In 1997, WLNA and WHUD were sold Pamal Broadcasting.

Because of its steeply sloping site, the church has a double level crypt to the rear. The interior, which has a coffered barrel vaulted ceiling, is lit by lunette windows high above the walls. The statue of Our Lady's Altar is by Peter Bonanni of Rome, which won a gold medal at the Dublin Exhibition in 1853. The holy water stoups on either side of the main doors are giant clam shells that were donated in 1917 by a Pacific Ocean sea captain as a gift to his brother, the parish priest at the time. Until December 2007 the church hosted a regular Tridentine (Latin) Mass. The church has experienced a resurgence of attendance due to the influx of Polish immigrants who regularly celebrate mass in the church in their native language.

Family history Isaac Boulton was born at Stockport. He was the son of John Boulton of Glossop who was related to Matthew Boulton of Boulton and Watt fame. Isaac had 3 sons named Thomas, Wiliam and James Watt Boulton. He had one daughter named Helena. Career In 1841 I. W. Boulton began an apprenticeship with the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway under Richard Peacock. Later, he joined his father's canal boat business and remained there until 1845.http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Isaac_Watt_Boulton After this he set up an engineering business but little is known about it except that he built at least one steam carriage (probably similar to those built by Richard Trevithick and Goldsworthy Gurney) and at least one steamboat.http://www.steamindex.com/people/boulton.htm In 1854 he joined the locomotive department of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway at Gorton. He left in 1856 and set up another engineering business at Portland Street, Ashton-under-Lyne, where he built and repaired steam engines of various kinds. In 1858‚Äì1859 he bought three second-hand railway locomotives (2-2-0 tender engines built by Bury) and started to hire them out for temporary jobs. The locomotive-hire side of the business grew and so a connection to the nearest railway line was needed. This led, in 1864, to the construction of Boulton's Siding, alongside the Oldham branch of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway.

Activities Berkeley campus of the University of California where much of the VDC's actions took place or were organised The VDC was formed by Jerry Rubin and Stephen Smale between May 21 and May 22, 1965 during a 35‚Äëhour‚Äëlong anti-Vietnam war protest that took place inside and around the University of California, Berkeley, and attracted over 35,000 people including Paul Montauk and Stew Albert. The VDC laid out three main objectives: to achieve national and international solidarity and coordination on action, to take part in militant action, including civil disobedience and to work extensively in the community to develop the movement outside of the university campus.Online Archive of California Vietnam Day Committee retrieved on April 5, 2007 Attending the event were several notable anti-war activists, including Dr. Benjamin Spock, however the State Department declined to send a representative, despite the burning of an effigy of president Lyndon Johnson. On May 5, 1965, the VDC were involved in a march of several hundred students from Berkeley on to the Berkeley Draft Board, where staff were given a black coffin as a gift, and a number of students set alight their draft cards. Later that year, the VDC planned a nationwide protest known as the International Days of Protest Against American Military Intervention, which was scheduled to take place between October 15 and October 16. In arranging and coordinating the protest movement, the VDC headquarters in Berkeley communicated with numerous anti-war groups in New York City, Boston, New Haven, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Ann Arbor, Chicago, Madison, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Portland and Atlanta. The planned movement attracted attention from some newspapers like the National Guardian: Similar groups began to form outside of California, notably in Mexico City and Tokyo. In California, what was now known as the International Days of Protest was to culminate with a peace march towards the Oakland Army Terminal, where men and materials were sent to Vietnam. On October 15, 1965, the protests took place across the country, with the VDC itself organising a sit-in at the San Francisco State College, which saw a performance by Country Joe and the Fish. The VDC organised another peace march which took place on November 21, 1965, and saw over 10,000 people marching through Oakland.Oakland Museum Picture this article, retrieved on April 5, 2007 The march was the first of its kind in California, and was one of many orchestrated by the VDC from 1965 through until 1972, illustrated partly by the number of pro-war protesters who lined the route holding signs that stated \\"Stamp out VDC\\".Ilka Hartmann photograph retrieved on April 5, 2007 By this time, the activities of the VDC had attracted the interest of the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities.

It operated from 1864 to 1898. Overview In the 1860s, established railway companies were replacing their small 2-2-0 and 0-4-0 steam locomotives with larger, more modern machines. Mr I. W. Boulton took advantage of this by buying up some of the old locomotives, modifying them in his workshop, and hiring them out to contractors for use on civil engineering projects, including the building of new railways. The usual modifications were to fit smaller driving wheels (to increase tractive effort) and to convert tender locomotives to tank locomotives. By the 1880s, the hire business was declining so Mr Boulton started building new locomotives. He used his own patent design of boiler which had a single large flue with cross water-tubes. This was, essentially, a horizontal predecessor of the vertical water-tube boilers later used in Sentinel Steam Waggons. Although Boulton's boilers steamed well, they were difficult to repair so they never became popular. The business declined during the 1890s and closed in 1898. Mr Boulton died in 1899.

Location  The village is located 22 km north of Miercurea-Ciuc along the Olt River.  History  Its name was first mentioned in 1333 when, a sacerdos de Sancto Toma, a priest from St Thomas was mentioned. In 1441, it is recorded by its Hungarian names as Zenth Thamas, in 1549 as Szent Tam√°s. Until 1919, its Romanian name was S√¢ntƒÉmas.

It belonged to Cs√≠ksz√©k district until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when fell within the Cs√≠k County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of Romania and fell within Ciuc County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the village was held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the commune became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mure»ô-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County. Demographics The commune has an absolute Hungarian (Sz√©kely) majority.

A similar unit was being raised by the Portuguese in Rhodesia's neighboring Mozambique when the war ended in 1974.CANN, Jonh P., \\"Counterinsurgency in Africa: The Portuguese Way of War, 1961‚Äì1974\\", Hailer Publishing, 2005 Like the Dragoons of Angola, Grey's Scouts were used for tracking, reconnaissance, pursuit, and, most prominently, patrol in the Rhodesian Bush War.Stringer, p.98 With measured variations in horse speed for training purposes, they would cover an area of over on the average day. Their routes often took them through active minefields, which they were to inspect.Beckett, p.175 In addition to this, the small stature and manoeuvrability of the crossbreeds they rode on was of repeated benefit to the Rhodesian forces in the construction of border defences; the Scouts could transport materials and supplies over terrain impassable to vehicles. The horses themselves were mostly given in charity by sympathisers of the Rhodesian effort from South Africa and elsewhere.  Constitution and training  Initially, the unit consisted of around 200 men, but this would eventually grow to over 1,000. It conscripted soldiers from other infantry regiments of the Rhodesian Army, who were then instructed in equestrianism. Craftsmen such as farriers, horsebreeders, smithers and manufacturers were employed internally. Grey's Scouts were trained as mounted infantry rather than cavalry, and were prepared for engagements on foot rather than on horseback. A tactic of rushing and fronting with their horses was implemented to significant success by Grey's Scouts and they were noted for their skill in launching shock attacks. The number of casualties Grey's Scouts suffered during the Rhodesian Bush War is known, and is recorded to be nine.Stringer, p.99  Notes   References    External links  * Official Website Category:Regiments of Rhodesia Category:Special forces of Rhodesia Category:Military units and formations of Rhodesia in the Bush War Category:Military units and formations established in 1975 ","title":"Grey's Scouts"},{"id":"10476429","text":"The Villager is a newspaper published in The Woodlands, Texas, covering the master-planned community and the rest of southern Montgomery County, north of Houston.

Based on the novel of the same name by Alan Paton, it stars Canada Lee, Sidney Poitier, and Charles Carson. This film was Canada Lee's last film. Although not a solely black cast the film is a rarity for its date in that all the main characters are black, and the white roles are as supporting actors. However, the contemporary film posters chose to illustrate only the white supporting actors. Plot From the back country of South Africa, black minister Stephen Kumalo (Canada Lee) journeys to Johannesburg to help his sister, who has been reported to be ill, and to search for his son, who left home and has not kept in contact. He is also asked to visit the daughter of someone who has not heard from her for some time. With the help of fellow minister, Reverend Msimangu (Sidney Poitier), he discovers that his sister, who has a young son, who left home to find her husband who left in search of work, failed to find him and has been in prison and is a prostitute. He finds out that his son has got a young girl pregnant and is a thief and murderer. Both live in a poverty stricken urban community. The ministers confront the harsh reality of apartheid and its inimical effects on both white and black inhabitants. Cast Cast and characters are in order as listed by the British Film Institute. * Canada Lee as Stephen Kumalo * Sidney Poitier as Reverend Msimangu * Charles Carson as James Jarvis * Joyce Carey as Mrs. Jarvis * Geoffrey Keen as Father Vincent * Michael Goodliffe as Martens * Edric Connor as John Kumalo * Lionel Ngakane as Absolom * Vivien Clinton as Mary * Albertina Temba as Mrs. Kumalo *Charles McRae as Kumalo's friend * Ribbon Dhlamini as Gertrude Kumalo Production Zoltan Korda's acclaimed smash film was shot entirely in South Africa. Since the country was ruled by strict apartheid (enforced racial separation) laws, stars Sidney Poitier and Canada Lee and producer/director Korda cooked up a scheme where they told the South African immigration authorities that Poitier and Lee were not actors but were Korda's indentured servants; otherwise, the two black actors and the white director could have been arrested, and jailed without trial. It marked the first time a major film was shot in the racially divided country, leading to serious exposure of the terrible conditions there. After the making of this film, Canada Lee planned to make a full report about life in South Africa: he was then called to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee to explain his actions, but died of heart failure before he could testify. Critical response The film was well received by critics, and currently holds an 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Those praising the film included Bosley Crowther in The New York Times who stated \\"It is difficult to do proper justice to the fine qualities of this film or to the courage and skill of Mr. Korda in transmitting such a difficult and sobering theme.\\" Awards ;Won * 2nd Berlin International Film Festival - Bronze Berlin Bear ;Nominated * 1952 Cannes Film Festival - Palme d'Or References External links * * Category:Apartheid films Category:1951 films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British films Category:1951 drama films Category:English- language films Category:Films based on South African novels Category:Films set in South Africa Category:Films directed by Zolt√°n Korda Category:British drama films Category:Films shot in South Africa ","title":"Cry, the Beloved Country (1951 film)"},{"id":"10476475","title":"David Ferraris"},{"id":"10476501","text":"Sister Aimee is a 2019 American biographical film written and directed by Samantha Buck and Marie Schlingmann and starring Anna Margaret Hollyman as Aimee Semple McPherson.

Gartner defines application delivery networking as the combination of WAN optimization controllers (WOCs) and application delivery controllers (ADCs).Gartner Says Worldwide Application Acceleration Market Will Reach $3.7 Billion in 2008, STAMFORD, Conn., August 21, 2006 At the data center end of an ADN is the application delivery controller, an advanced traffic management device that is often also referred to as a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch, the purpose of which is to distribute traffic among a number of servers or geographically dislocated sites based on application specific criteria. In the branch office portion of an ADN is the WAN optimization controller, which works to reduce the number of bits that flow over the network using caching and compression, and shapes TCP traffic using prioritization and other optimization techniques.What makes a WAN optimization controller? Network World, Jan 8, 2008 Some WOC components are installed on PCs or mobile clients, and there is typically a portion of the WOC installed in the data center. Application delivery networks are also offered by some CDN vendors. The ADC, one component of an ADN, evolved from layer 4-7 switches in the late 1990s when it became apparent that traditional load balancing techniques were not robust enough to handle the increasingly complex mix of application traffic being delivered over a wider variety of network connectivity options.  Application delivery techniques  The Internet was designed according to the end-to-end principle.Saltzer, J. H., Reed, D. P., Clark, D. D.: ‚ÄúEnd-to-End Arguments in System Design,‚Äù ACM Transactions on Communications, 2(4), 1984 This principle keeps the core network relatively simple and moves the intelligence as much as possible to the network end-points: the hosts and clients. An Application Delivery Network (ADN) enhances the delivery of applications across the Internet by employing a number of optimization techniques. Many of these techniques are based on established best-practices employed to efficiently route traffic at the network layer including redundancy and load balancing Halabi, Bassam: \\"Internet Routing Architectures\\", New Riders Publishing, 1997 In theory, an Application Delivery Network (ADN) is closely related to a content delivery network. The difference between the two delivery networks lies in the intelligence of the ADN to understand and optimize applications, usually referred to as application fluency.http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/07/18/29FEintelnet_1.html?NETWORK%20STANDARDS Erlanger, Leon: \\"Building the Intelligent Network,\\" InfoWorld, July 2005 Application Fluent Network (AFN) is based on the concept of Application Fluency to refer to WAN optimization techniques applied at Layer Four to Layer Seven of the OSI model for networks. Application Fluency implies that the network is fluent or intelligent in understanding and being able to optimize delivery of each application. Application Fluent Network is an addition of SDN capabilities. The acronym 'AFN' is used by Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise to refer to an Application Fluent Network. Application delivery uses one or more layer 4‚Äì7 switches, also known as a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch to intelligently distribute traffic to a pool, also known as a cluster or farm, of servers. The application delivery controller (ADC) is assigned a single virtual IP address (VIP) that represents the pool of servers. Traffic arriving at the ADC is then directed to one of the servers in the pool (cluster, farm) based on a number of factors including application specific data values, application transport protocol, availability of servers, current performance metrics, and client-specific parameters. An ADN provides the advantages of load distribution, increase in capacity of servers, improved scalability, security, and increased reliability through application specific health checks. Increasingly the ADN comprises a redundant pair of ADC on which is integrated a number of different feature sets designed to provide security, availability, reliability, and acceleration functions. In some cases these devices are still separate entities, deployed together as a network of devices through which application traffic is delivered, each providing specific functionality that enhances the delivery of the application. ADN optimization techniques =TCP multiplexing= TCP Multiplexing is loosely based on established connection pooling techniques utilized by application server platforms to optimize the execution of database queries from within applications. An ADC establishes a number of connections to the servers in its pool and keeps the connections open. When a request is received by the ADC from the client, the request is evaluated and then directed to a server over an existing connection. This has the effect of reducing the overhead imposed by establishing and tearing down the TCP connection with the server, improving the responsiveness of the application. Some ADN implementations take this technique one step further and also multiplex HTTP and application requests. This has the benefit of executing requests in parallel, which enhances the performance of the application. =TCP optimization= There are a number of Request for Comments (RFCs) which describe mechanisms for improving the performance of TCP. Many ADN implement these RFCs in order to provide enhanced delivery of applications through more efficient use of TCP. The RFCs most commonly implemented are: * Delayed Acknowledgements RFC 896: Congestion Control in IP/TCP Internetworks * Nagle Algorithm RFC 1122: Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers * Selective AcknowledgementsRFC 2018: TCP Selective Acknowledgment OptionsRFC 2883: An Extension to the Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) Option for TCP * Explicit Congestion Notification ECNRFC 3168: The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification to TCPRFC 2481: A Proposal to add Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP * Limited and Fast RetransmitsRFC 3042: Enhancing TCP's Loss Recovery Using Limited TransmitRFC 2582: The NewReno Modification to TCP's Fast Recovery Algorithm * Adaptive Initial Congestion WindowsRFC 3390: Increasing TCP's Initial Window =Data compression and caching= ADNs also provide optimization of application data through caching and compression techniques. There are two types of compression used by ADNs today: industry standard HTTP compression and proprietary data reduction algorithms. It is important to note that the cost in CPU cycles to compress data when traversing a LAN can result in a negative performance impact and therefore best practices are to only utilize compression when delivering applications via a WAN or particularly congested high-speed data link. HTTP compression is asymmetric and transparent to the client. Support for HTTP compression is built into web servers and web browsers. All commercial ADN products currently support HTTP compression. A second compression technique is achieved through data reduction algorithms. Because these algorithms are proprietary and modify the application traffic, they are symmetric and require a device to reassemble the application traffic before the client can receive it. A separate class of devices known as WAN Optimization Controllers (WOC) provide this functionality, but the technology has been slowly added to the ADN portfolio over the past few years as this class of device continues to become more application aware, providing additional features for specific applications such as CIFS and SMB. ADN reliability and availability techniques =Advanced health checking= Advanced health checking is the ability of an ADN to determine not only the state of the server on which an application is hosted, but the status of the application it is delivering. Advanced health checking techniques allow the ADC to intelligently determine whether or not the content being returned by the server is correct and should be delivered to the client. This feature enables other reliability features in the ADN, such as resending a request to a different server if the content returned by the original server is found to be erroneous. =Load balancing algorithms= The load balancing algorithms found in today's ADN are far more advanced than the simplistic round-robin and least connections algorithms used in the early 1990s. These algorithms were originally loosely based on operating systems' scheduling algorithms, but have since evolved to factor in conditions peculiar to networking and application environments. It is more accurate to describe today's \\"load balancing\\" algorithms as application routing algorithms, as most ADN employ application awareness to determine whether an application is available to respond to a request. This includes the ability of the ADN to determine not only whether the application is available, but whether or not the application can respond to the request within specified parameters, often referred to as a service level agreement. Typical industry standard load balancing algorithms available today include: * Round Robin * Least Connections * Fastest Response Time * Weighted Round Robin * Weighted Least Connections * Custom values assigned to individual servers in a pool based on SNMP or other communication mechanism =Fault tolerance= The ADN provides fault tolerance at the server level, within pools or farms. This is accomplished by designating specific servers as a 'backup' that is activated automatically by the ADN in the event that the primary server(s) in the pool fail.MacVittie, Lori: \\"Content Switches\\", Network Computing, July, 2001 The ADN also ensures application availability and reliability through its ability to seamlessly \\"failover\\" to a secondary device in the event of a hardware or software failure. This ensures that traffic continues to flow in the event of a failure in one device, thereby providing fault tolerance for the applications. Fault tolerance is implemented in ADNs through either a network or serial based connection. Network based failover The Virtual IP Address (VIP) is shared between two devices. A heartbeat daemon on the secondary device verifies that the primary device is active. In the event that the heartbeat is lost, the secondary device assumes the shared VIP and begins servicing requests. This process is not immediate, and though most ADN replicate sessions from the primary to the secondary, there is no way to guarantee that sessions initiated during the time it takes for the secondary to assume the VIP and begin managing traffic will be maintained. Serial based failover In a serial connection based failover configuration two ADN devices communicate via a standard RS232 connection instead of the network, and all sharing of session information and status is exchanged over this connection. Failover is nearly instantaneous, though it suffers from the same constraints regarding sessions initiated while the primary device is failing as network based failover. ADN security =Transport layer security= Although often erroneously assigned to the application layer, SSL is the most common method of securing application traffic through an ADN today. SSL uses PKI to establish a secure connection between the client and the ADN, making it difficult for attackers to decrypt the data in transit or hijack the session. =Application layer security= Resource cloaking The use of a virtual IP address (VIP) and position of the ADN in the network provides the means through which certain resources can be cloaked, or hidden, from the client. Because the ADN is designed to understand applications and application protocols, such as HTTP, it can manipulate certain aspects of the protocol to cloak the servers in the pool and prevent potentially useful information regarding the software and hardware infrastructure from being exposed. A typical use of this functionality is to hide the operating system and server software used to host the application. This is usually accomplished by rewriting the Server field in an HTTP response.Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content, Response Context A second typical use of this functionality is the exploitation of the ADN's ability to rewrite the URI portion of an HTTP request. The client is presented with a URI and VIP that are known only to the ADN, and upon receiving the request the ADN may either (a) rewrite the URI and send a 302 redirect Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content, Redirection 3xx or (b) transparently translates the URI and responds to the client as if the URI were the right one in the first place. Application firewall In recent years commercial ADNs have begun to include application firewall functionality to further secure applications during the delivery process. This is a hotly debated subject with many security professionals arguing that the functionality included in an application firewall are unnecessary and should be handled by the application while others consider employing as much security as possible, regardless of position in the delivery network, to be the best practice. Many commercial ADN companies have acquired and integrated these functions and present such features as part of a defense in depth strategy often cited by security professionals. =Network layer security= The ADN is most often deployed in the DMZ at the edge of the network. This results in exposure to potential network layer attacks including Denial of Service (DoS) from ICMP and SYN floods. As a result, the ADN must necessarily protect not only itself but the applications it is delivering from succumbing to such attacks. The ADN generally employs a number of protections against typical network layer attacks though it does not implement the full security offered by an IPS. Some of the Network Layer Security technologies that may be employed by ADN devices include: Delayed binding Delayed binding, also called TCP splicing, is the postponement of the connection between the client and the server in order to obtain sufficient information to make a routing decision. Some application switches and routers delay binding the client session to the server until the proper handshakes are complete so as to prevent Denial of Service attacks. IP filtering ADNs often have the ability to filter traffic based on Access Control Lists (ACLs), Bogus IP ranges (Bogon filtering) and deep packet inspection pattern matching. In some cases, thresholds or rate limiting of IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses may be employed. Traffic management ADNs are increasingly adding advanced traffic management functionality. The deep packet inspection capabilities of some of these products can identify traffic by application type and can be used to analyze, block, shape and prioritize traffic.

It is sited in the Taurus Mountains, on the right bank of the Ceyhan River. The site is contained within Karatepe-Aslanta≈ü National Park. History The place was an ancient city of Cilicia, which controlled a passage from eastern Anatolia to the north Syrian plain. It became an important Neo-Hittite center after the collapse of the Hittite Empire in the late 12th century BC.

Morpurgo Davies, On the Problems of Karatepe: The Hieroglyphic Text, Anatolian Studies, vol. 28, pp. 103‚Äì119, 1978 As we learn from the inscription, its author is Azatiwada (or Azatiwata), the ruler of the town. He was also its founder; the inscription commemorates the town's foundation. He acknowledged himself as a subordinate of Awariku, the king of Adanawa (Adana), which was the ancient kingdom of Quwe. Azatiwataya seems to have been one of the frontier towns of Adanawa.Yakubovich, 50Trevor Bryce, The World of The Neo-Hittite Kingdoms: A Political and Military History. Oxford University Press, 2012 Another inscription of the same type, the Cinekoy inscription, was discovered more recently. It also mentions king Awariku, who may have been the same ruler, or part of the same dynasty. Troy theory According to a 2010 ZDF documentary featuring the writer and translator Raoul Schrott, the fortress and surrounding landscape at Karatepe significantly match Homer's descriptions of Troy in the Iliad. According to this theory, Homer may have used his knowledge of the legend of Troy and combined it into historical fiction, using his own experiences and access to writings as a scribe in the service of the Assyrians in Karatepe.http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/#/beitrag/video/951028/Der-Fall-Troia/ Archaeology After the site was discovered in 1946, Karatepe was excavated from 1947 to 1957 by a team led by Helmuth Theodor Bossert (1889‚Äì1961), revealing the ruins of the walled city of king Azatiwata≈°.

In Communist Bulgaria it was called People's Uprising of 9 September (–î–µ–≤–µ—Ç–æ—Å–µ–ø—Ç–µ–º–≤—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ –≤—ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ) ‚Äì on the grounds of the broad unrest, and Socialist Revolution (–°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è) ‚Äì as it was a turning point politically and the beginning of radical reforms towards socialism. In brief Bulgaria was in a precarious situation, still in the sphere of Nazi Germany's influence (as a former member of the Axis powers, with German troops in the country despite the declared Bulgarian neutrality 15 days earlier), but under threat of war with the leading military power of that time, the Soviet Union (the USSR had declared war on the Kingdom of Bulgaria 4 days earlier and units of its Third Ukrainian Front of the Red Army had entered Bulgaria 3 days after), and with demonstrations, strikes, revolts in many cities and villages (6 ‚Äì 7 September) and local government power taken by Bulgarian Fatherland Front (FF) forces (without Red Army help) in Varna, Burgas, etc. The coup d'√©tat was organized by the Fatherland Front political coalition (led by the Bulgarian Communists) and performed by pro-FF units of the Bulgarian Army and the Bulgarian partisan forces of the People's Liberation Revolt Army (–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–æ—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–Ω–∞ –≤—ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞ –∞—Ä–º–∏—è). As a direct result the legal government of Prime Minister Konstantin Muraviev was overthrown and replaced with a government of the FF led by Kimon Georgiev. Bulgaria joined immediately the anti-Nazi coalition of the Allies of World War II and took part in World War II. The Kingdom of Bulgaria became a republic after the Bulgarian republic referendum in 1946. Large-scale political, economic and social changes were introduced to the country. The coup resulted in coming of Bulgaria into the Soviet sphere of influence and further to Bulgaria's 45-year-long People's Republic. Background On 26 August 1944, the government of Ivan Bagryanov had orally declared Bulgaria's neutrality in the war under the threat of the Red Army's offensive in neighbouring Romania. At the same time, in Egypt the government had entered separate peace talks with the United Kingdom and the United States, hoping to secure the dispatch of British and American troops in Bulgaria. On the same day, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Workers' Party (BWP) proclaimed the assumption of power by means of a popular uprising to be its official task. A government of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BANU) \\"Vrabcha 1\\", until then in opposition, was formed on 2 September 1944, headed by Konstantin Muraviev. It continued the peace talks, declared its support for democratic reforms and ordered the withdrawal of German Army troops from Bulgaria. At the same time, the guerrilla actions of the partisans did not cease, the alliance with Nazi Germany was not disbanded and no attempts were made to normalize the relations with Moscow, forcing the Soviet Union to treat the new government with suspicion. On 5 September 1944, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria. The Central Committee of the BWP and the general staff of the People's Liberation Revolt Army commenced, on 5 September, planning of a coup d'√©tat. The plan was further detailed on 8 September. According to the plan, the coordinated actions of the partisans, the BWP combat groups and the pro-Fatherland Front army detachments would assume power and effective control of government during the night of 9 September. The stated goal of the coup d'√©tat was the \\"overthrowing of the fascist authorities and the establishment of popular-democratic power of the Fatherland Front\\". Unrest began all around Bulgaria on 6 September and 7 September, with the strikes of the Pernik miners and the Sofia tram employees, as well as the general strikes in Plovdiv and Gabrovo. The prisons in Pleven, Varna and Sliven had their political prisoners released; 170 localities were entered by partisan detachments between 6 September and 8 September. In many cities and villages, the strikes and meetings grew into armed clashes with the police, with victims on both sides. On 8 September,History of Bulgaria, Petar Delev et al., 2001, p.364 the Red Army entered Bulgaria meeting with no opposition on the order of the new Bulgarian government. Coup d'√©tat On the eve of 9 September, army units together with Fatherland Front detachments captured key locations in Sofia, such as the Ministry of War, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the post, the telegraph, the radio, the railway station, etc. Early in the morning, the new Prime Minister Kimon Georgiev informed the people on the radio of the shuffle: On 9 September, on the order of the People's Liberation Revolt Army (bg) commander-in-chief Dobri Terpeshev (bg), all partisan units descended from the mountains and assumed power in the villages and cities. In most places, this was not met with much resistance, but in other cases army and police detachments loyal to the old government put up violent resistance to the Fatherland Front forces. In Sofia, Plovdiv, the region of Pernik, Shumen and Haskovo the old regime's supporters were defeated by military means, with the army coming under the effective control of the Fatherland Front. The establishment of the new leadership happened at the latest in Haskovo, where partisans and other antifascists seized the artillery barracks on 12 September, but suffered many casualties, as the negotiations with the commanding officers failed to reach a compromise. As of 9 September, the Red Army had not reached Sofia but remained in northeastern Bulgaria. As the Bulgarian communists were capable of assuming power without any aid, the Red Army commanders decided not to hurry with a seizure of the capital. New government The Fatherland Front government included representatives of the BWP, BANU \\"Pladne\\", the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party (Wide Socialists) and Zveno. The former Prime Minister Konstantin Muraviev was arrested, as were Tsar Simeon II's regents, members of the former government, and some army detachment heads. On 10 September, the police was abolished and replaced with a popular militia consisting mainly of recent partisans; 8,130 political prisoners were released from the prisons, and the concentration camps of the former regime (e.g. Gonda voda, Krasto pole, Lebane) were closed down. The fascist organizations were banned, as were their publications. The former regents, Prince Kyril, Bogdan Filov, and Nikola Mihailov Mihov, were executed in February. On 15 September 1946, a referendum was held and monarchy was abolished. Aftermath After 9 September 1944, the Bulgarian Army joined the Third Ukrainian Front and contributed to the defeat of Nazism in Europe, helping drive out the Germans from much of Yugoslavia and Hungary, reaching as far as Klagenfurt in Austria by April 1945. Although Bulgaria was not recognized as a true member of the Allies, it still managed to retain Southern Dobruja which it had acquired in 1940 per the Treaty of Craiova. The government of Kimon Georgiev established in December 1944 the People's Court according to the international obligation of Bulgaria to condemn the persons (ministers, etc.) guilty for World War II. It became one of the main propellers of the wave of terror in the country. Between 20,000 and 40,000 people were killed or missing in just the first four months after the communist regime overtook Bulgaria. Bulgarian communists (their Workers' Party renamed to Communist Party) consolidated their leading role in the Fatherland Front coalition, reduced its members from 5 to 2 political parties (together with the Agrarian Union) and led the country consecutively and gradually on the pathway to socialism (after the Soviet model), enforced through totalitarianism. The former opposition parties were made illegal and personal and political enemies of the communists were either killed or put in labour camps. The Tarnovo Constitution was overthrown and replaced by the new pro- communist republican Dimitrov Constitution after the successful republic referendum in 1946.

Grenfell undertook a medical expedition in 1892 on the hospital ship the Albert. He saw medical and living conditions that appalled him, including settlements that had been wiped out by diphtheria. In response, he developed a network of regional hospitals and nursing stations. The first hospitals were built at Battle Harbour in 1893 and Indian Harbour in 1894. By the 1960s, the network had extended into the interior of Labrador. The IGA was incorporated in the Dominion of Newfoundland on January 10, 1914, under the Companies Act of 1899. Between 1949 and 1979, thousands of Indigenous children were taken from their communities to attend five residential schools that were run by the International Grenfell Association or Moravians.

The organization was led by Fred Phelps (who has since died) and located in Topeka, Kansas. Westboro Baptist Church members believe that the United States government is immoral due to its tolerance of homosexuality; in addition, they protest at funerals of U.S. military killed in action with signs that display text such as \\"God Hates Fags\\" and \\"Thank God for Dead Soldiers\\" (which is shown in the film). With a BBC film crew, Theroux travelled to Kansas to spend time with members of the church and interview its leadership. Theroux interviews church leadership including Fred Phelps and Shirley Phelps-Roper. The documentary first aired on BBC Two in the United Kingdom in April 2007. The documentary was a ratings success in its initial airing, beating simultaneous programming for BBC One for the 9pm hour. It was broadcast again on BBC Two later that month, and Seven Network purchased the programme for airing in Australia in August 2007 and again in April 2008. It aired in May 2008 on TV3 and Seven Network, and multiple times in June 2008 on the television channel Dave. It aired again on BBC Two in December 2008 and in February 2010 in Ireland on 3e. A DVD-box-set including the documentary and other Theroux programmes was released in January 2009; The Independent placed the DVD release as number eight among its list of \\"The 50 Best DVD boxsets\\". The Most Hated Family in America received a positive reception, with four-star ratings from the The Daily Record. It was recommended in reviews as a critic's choice by The Independent, The Times, Financial Times, The Age, and the Herald Sun. A review in the Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's interview techniques, \\"His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members.\\" The documentary was highlighted in The Sydney Morning Herald among \\"The week's best\\", and characterised as, \\"Disturbing, perplexing and very entertaining.\\" A follow-up documentary by Theroux, America's Most Hated Family in Crisis, was first broadcast on BBC Two on 3 April 2011. In 2019, Theroux made another follow-up, Surviving America's Most Hated Family, essentially creating a trilogy of documentaries based on the church. Background Westboro Baptist Church members with protest signs (2000) The documentary focuses on the Westboro Baptist Church, headed by Fred Phelps and based in Topeka, Kansas. Born in 1929 in Meridian, Mississippi, Phelps conducts himself under the belief that he is a prophet chosen by God \\"to preach his message of hate\\". Phelps was ordained a Southern Baptist in 1947. The Westboro Baptist Church was started by Phelps in 1955. Members of the church meet in Phelps' residence; the majority of the group's adherents are his family. Phelps received an associate's degree from John Muir Junior College in 1951, a bachelor's degree in 1962 and a degree in law in 1964 from Washburn University. He formed a \\"crusade for righteousness\\", attempting to abolish Jim Crow laws in Topeka. In 1991 when a local park started to serve as a meeting place for homosexual men, Phelps began to protest against homosexuality. Phelps subsequently enlarged the scope of his activities and formed protests in areas where civil rights were being debated for LGBT people. Phelps received criticism in 1998 when he repeatedly exclaimed \\"Matt is in hell\\" during the funeral of Matthew Shepard, a man murdered for being homosexual. Westboro Baptist Church bases its work around the belief that \\"God Hates Fags\\", and expresses the opinion, based on its Biblical interpretation, that nearly every tragedy in the world is God's punishment for homosexuality - specifically society's increasing tolerance and acceptance of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people. It maintains that God hates homosexuals above all other kinds of \\"sinners\\" and that homosexuality should be a capital crime. The church runs the website GodHatesFags.com, and GodHatesAmerica.com, and websites expressing condemnation of LGBT people, Roman Catholics, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, Sweden, Ireland, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United States. The organisation is monitored by the Anti-Defamation League and is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The group has achieved notoriety because of its picketing of funeral processions of U.S. soldiers killed in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. Controversial acts of Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church resulted in litigation and the formation of groups which counter-protest against its efforts. President George W. Bush signed the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act into law on Memorial Day in May 2006. Groups of American Legion members formed motorcycle honor guards, such as the Patriot Guard Riders, with the intention of safeguarding funerals of U.S. military from the church protesters. Another group, called \\"Free Republic,\\" held signs praising the military.Fox News: Protesters gather at Arlington Cemetery. Content The Most Hated Family in America includes footage of members of the Westboro Baptist Church picketing at funerals of United States soldiers. The organisation members hold signs blaming deaths of U.S. soldiers on the country's tolerance towards homosexuality and LGBT people. Westboro Baptist Church members believe that these deaths are caused by God as retribution for the immorality of the U.S., stating the soldiers were \\"struck down by God for fighting for a depraved nation\\". They attend the funeral of a soldier Kevin Zeigler who died at the age of 31 while attempting to disable a bomb in Iraq. Referring to improvised explosive devices, Westboro Baptist Church hold signs reading, \\"Thank God for IEDs\\". Protest signs carried by members of the organisation at the funeral, including six-year-old children, state: \\"Thank God For Dead Soldiers\\", \\"Don't Worship The Dead\\" and \\"Fag Marines\\". Another placard criticises Diana, Princess of Wales, for her friendship with the LGBT community, stating, \\"Royal Whore In Hell\\". Diana is criticised by the organisation as a \\"fag enabler\\". Additional signs read \\"God hates fags\\", \\"Thank God for Dead Soldiers\\", \\"God is America's Terrorist\\", and \\"Fag Troops\\". The Westboro Baptist Church members reveled in the September 11 attacks and stated they were punishment for the country's \\"fornication and lust\\". The group also protests outside the local synagogue and holds signs which state that, \\"Jews worship the rectum\\". Theroux interviews members of the Phelps family including Fred Phelps (called \\"Gramps\\" by members of the organisation) and Shirley Phelps-Roper. Theroux asks Fred Phelps, \\"Isn't it an act of presumption, when you don't have all the information about all the other churches, to assume you have privileged access to Grace?\\"; Phelps responds, \\"Oh, I know all there is to know about 'em.\\" When Theroux asks him how he knows this, Phelps answers, \\"I'm not going to keep on talking to you. I know what you are [‚Å† ‚Å†‚Ä¶‚Å† ‚Å†] You're an evil ‚Ä¶ I don't even wanna go there [‚Å† ‚Å†‚Ä¶‚Å† ‚Å†] Good luck to ya!\\" Filmmaker Louis Theroux (2009) Theroux traveled from the United Kingdom to Kansas, United States to meet members of the Westboro Baptist Church. Theroux and a BBC film crew spent three weeks in Topeka, Kansas, gathering information on the 71 members of the organisation. In an article for The Guardian, Theroux noted, \\"It was fascinating to see the power of a family to create its own bizarre ideology and pass it down through the generations.\\" In a statement in The Age, Theroux posited, \\"Maybe, through my enthusiasm, people reveal more of themselves than they may have intended. The show is laughing at me, adrift in their world, as much as at them.\\" The Western Mail quoted Theroux on how he selects subject matter which interests him, \\"The subjects I'm interested in are quite extreme. They're so far beyond the pale of normal human interaction that you're never going to get a reality show on that territory.\\" In an interview with BBC News, Theroux stated that the Phelpses are the most extreme people he has ever met. Theroux gave his opinion on the teachings of Fred Phelps. Theroux stated, \\"I think that the pastor is not a very nice person. I think he's an angry person who's twisted the Bible and picked and chosen verses that support his anger, that sort of justify his anger, and he's instilled that in his children and they've passed it on to their children. Although the second and third generation are by and large quite nice people from what I saw, they still live under the influence of their Gramps.\\" Apart from their protests, Theroux found them to be quite kind, and commented, \\"It shows you what strange avenues the religious impulse can take you down. I think another part of the answer is that parts of the Christian Bible are pretty weird. There's a lot of weird stuff in there and when you take that and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he has sort of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and he was kind of a charismatic guy, and still is up to a point. He was [‚Å† ‚Å†‚Ä¶‚Å† ‚Å†] very verbal, very persuasive, [‚Å† ‚Å†and‚Å† ‚Å†] an extremely compelling speaker. All these things added together combined to make a powerful influence.\\" Reception =Response from organization= The Westboro Baptist Church appreciated the attention its organisation received from the documentary, and added a citation to the film on its website. Shirley Phelps-Roper stated she had one regret about the documentary: \\"If he had just called it, 'The Most Hated Family in the World. The Washington Post reported, \\"In the last hours of the last days, she explained, Jesus said his chosen will be 'hated by all men. On 8 April 2007, Fred Phelps Sr preached a sermon addressing Louis Theroux directly and personally, accusing Theroux of taking \\"cheap unfair advantage\\" of the young women in the church, and trying to embarrass them about their chastity. Phelps also stated that Theroux \\"contrives and manipulates those he interviews\\", accusing him of feigning naivety on camera.http://www.godhatesfags.com/audio/index.html =Release and ratings= The Most Hated Family in America aired on BBC Two on 1 April 2007. The Guardian characterised its performance as \\"a ratings hit\\". The film received 19 percent of viewership between the 9pm to 10pm hour, and beat programming for BBC One for the same time period. The documentary received 4.3 million viewers while the programme which aired at the same time on BBC One only drew 1.8 million viewers. The Most Hated Family in America was again aired on BBC Two on 4 April 2007. In August 2007, Seven Network of Australia purchased a package of programmes from the BBC including The Most Hated Family in America and two other specials by Theroux: Under the Knife and Gambling in Las Vegas. In April 2008, Seven Network purchased The Most Hated Family in America and the same two other programmes from the BBC, with an additional two documentaries by Theroux added: Behind Bars and African Hunting Holiday. In May 2008, the documentary aired on TV3. The documentary aired in Australia on Seven Network in May 2008. It aired again in the UK on 21 and 26 June 2008 on the television channel Dave. The documentary aired again on BBC Two on 18 December 2008. In January 2009, The Most Hated Family in America was released as part of a DVD boxed set in PAL region 2 format, along with African Hunting Holiday, Under The Knife, Behind Bars, and Gambling In Las Vegas. Titled, Louis Theroux: The Strange and The Dangerous, the DVD set received a four-out- of-four-star recommendation from The Daily Record. In February 2009, The Independent placed the DVD release as number eight among its list of \\"The 50 Best DVD boxsets\\", and characterised The Most Hated Family in America as the \\"strangest episode of the set, and by far the most disturbing\\". The documentary aired in Ireland on 10 February 2010 on 3e. =Critical reception= Writing for The Times, journalist David Chater highlighted The Most Hated Family in America among selections for \\"Chater's Choice\\". Chater commented, \\"Louis Theroux undertakes his ugliest assignment to date.\\" Chater concluded, \\"Theroux deploys all his logic and charm to find the humanity beneath the rhetoric, but ultimately fails. It is difficult to reason with people who think that holding up a placard proclaiming 'Jews worship the rectum' is 'a courteous and loving' thing to do.\\" The film was highlighted in the Liverpool Echo as \\"Sunday's: Pick of the day\\". Peter Grant of the Liverpool Echo commented, \\"Louis Theroux took a trip to Kansas for his documentary, The Most Hated Family in America. His profile of Westboro Baptist Church, the home of America's most fanatical Christian fundamentalists, was astonishing.\\" Karl French of Financial Times selected the film as his \\"Critic's Choice\\". French wrote positively of the documentary, \\"After painting himself into an oddball- documentary corner a few years back, Theroux wisely took a long break, and he's come back refreshed, as confirmed by this film. In the way it reveals the comic horror inherent in all forms of zealotry, it is every bit as compelling as Theroux's recent Vegas documentary.\\" Writing for The Scotsman, Andrea Mullaney articulated, \\"Theroux really had found the ultimate in weirdness for his latest documentary ‚Äì they're so beyond the point of reason, into a self-perpetuating psychosis, that no matter how he tried, he couldn't challenge their beamingly-delivered pronouncements, or trip them up. But he did manage to show them as human beings (more than the courtesy they extend to us sinners).\\" Hilary Fannin of The Irish Times commented that the airing of the documentary, \\"saw Louis Theroux, in The Most Hated Family in America, shatter another redneck American target, the Westboro Baptist Church\\". In a review of the documentary for The Sunday Times, Roland White discussed Theroux's stylistic technique, \\"Theroux's usual technique - the friendly ingenue - made absolutely no impact on these people. It was like watching a youngster from a village cricket team trying to bowl out Geoff Boycott, and I began to wonder what Theroux was hoping to achieve. It is impossible to out-argue the religious bigot. They have impeccable logic on their side: the word of God is the righteous truth; only they understand the true word of the Lord; therefore, they are right and everybody else is wrong.\\" Liverpool Daily Post recommended the film in its column, \\"Sunday: What to Watch\\". Writing for the Birmingham Mail, Graham Young observed, \\"The Most Hated Family in America is the best documentary from Louis since long before his Michael Jackson fiasco.\\" John Dugdale of The Sunday Times highlighted the film as his \\"Pick of the day\\". Dugdale wrote favorably of the film, \\"There are echoes of Theroux's film about a woman raising her daughters as neo-Nazis as he watches Phelps' daughter, Shirley, handing out placards to kids as young as seven. While tangling with her and her dad is pointless, the family's younger women are less inflexible, and his encounters with them are more rewarding.\\" A review in the Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's interview techniques, \\"His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members.\\" Writing in The Independent, Cathy Pryor declared, \\"Louis Theroux is out-oddballed this week by the subject of his latest documentary ... Astonishingly, Theroux makes you feel some sympathy for them and the price they pay for being the way they are.\\" Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent posited that viewers were \\"...[left] wondering, after an hour, whether the Phelps hadn't got a bit more out of it than Louis. They aren't representative of anything but themselves, after all, and they rejoice in the world's detestation. So they had nothing to lose by being held up to ridicule, and gained exactly what they want ‚Äì a bigger audience for their insane rantings.\\" Writing for The Daily Record, Paul English wrote favorably, \\"The journalist in me marvels at yet more great work from Theroux. But the human in me mourns that we gave this appalling family exactly what they want. The shiny badge of notoriety...\\" A review in the Irish Independent was critical of giving any coverage to the group, \\"Theroux tried to get the teenage daughters to deviate from the standard family line but they weren't budging an inch. The end result was that a group of loathsome people who spend every second of their lives trying to attract free publicity for themselves got a whole hour of it courtesy of the BBC. Ah, the joys of public service television.\\" Writing for The Observer, Kathryn Flett was critical of the choice of title for the documentary, commenting, \\"The Most Hated Family in America? Says who? Louis Theroux? BBC2? Ooh, I don't like a sweeping statement of a documentary title. Not that the family who comprise the majority of the 71 congregants of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, aren't appalling, but the title definitely infers that they are the family most hated by most Americans, when I doubt most Americans have the faintest idea who they are.\\" Mike Bradley of The Observer commented about the film, \\"A shock doc, but an easy target for Theroux.\\" In a review for the Melbourne, Australia newspaper, The Age, Larry Schwartz selected the documentary as \\"Critic's Choice\\". Schwartz was critical of Theroux's lack of detachment from his subject matter, \\"He repeatedly distances himself from the church, expressing his disapproval of their views. But so concerned is he, he seems almost evangelical in his determination to show them the error of their ways.\\" The documentary was highlighted in The Sydney Morning Herald among \\"The week's best\\", and critic Greg Hassall characterised it as, \\"Disturbing, perplexing and very entertaining.\\" The Australia newspaper MX highlighted the documentary favorably, in its column, \\"Best in show\\". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun selected The Most Hated Family in America as his \\"Top Choice\\" recommendation. Adams wrote, \\"A truly disturbing, disgusting and sad documentary. The repellent Shirley Phelps is the outspoken nutbag who got publicity by calling Heath Ledger a 'fag enabler' after his death. This jaw-dropping doco infiltrates Phelps' only-in-America church where her 11 spooky kids regularly picket funerals of US soldiers killed in Iraq ‚Äì they believe God killed them to show his hatred of how 'depraved' America now is.\\" Follow-ups Theroux returned to Westboro Baptist Church for a follow-up documentary four years after making The Most Hated Family in America, to investigate the departure of several members of the Phelps family since his last visit. The film, America's Most Hated Family in Crisis, was first broadcast on BBC Two on 3 April 2011. Theroux's return was prompted by an email he received from a young member of the church he had interviewed previously, who had since left and been disfellowed. The US Supreme Court case of Snyder v. Phelps, heard following the suing of Westboro Baptist Church for distress caused by the picketing of the funeral of a US Marine killed in Iraq, formed the background to the new film. Theroux was interested in the ambivalent attitude of church members towards his first film, and stated that \\"the new documentary feels quite different than the original - though still funny, a little darker and stranger\\". He returned in 2019 to create Surviving America's Most Hated Family.

First raised in 1759, it saw service over two centuries, including the First World War, before being amalgamated with the 19th Royal Hussars into the 15th/19th The King's Royal Hussars in 1922. History George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield, founder of the regiment Louis Nolan, an officer of the 15th Hussars who gained notoriety as the bearer of the ill-fated order precipitating the Charge of the Light Brigade =Early wars= The regiment was raised in the London area by George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield as Elliots Light Horse as the first of the new regiments of light dragoons in 1759. It was renamed the 15th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons in 1760. The regiment landed in Bremen in June 1760 for service in the Seven Years' War.Cannon, p. 18 The regiment were largely responsible for the victory, suffering 125 of the 186 allied casualties at the Battle of Emsdorf in July 1760. Lieutenant Colonel William Erskine, commanding the regiment, presented King George III with 16 colours captured by his regiment after the battle.Savory, p. 227 During the battle the French commander, Major-General Christian-Sigismund von Glaubitz, was taken prisoner.Cannon, p. 21 The regiment charged the French rear guard twice at the Battle of Wilhelmsthal in June 1762Cannon, p. 29 and then returned home in July 1763.Cannon, p. 32 In 1766 it was renamed for King George III as the 1st (or The King's Royal) Regiment of Light Dragoons, the number being an attempt to create a new numbering system for the light dragoon regiments. However, the old system was quickly re-established, with the regiment returning as the 15th (The King's) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons in 1769. The regiment landed at Ostend in May 1793 for service in the Flanders Campaign and fought at the Battle of Famars in May 1793.Cannon, p. 38 It formed part of the besieging force at the Siege of Valenciennes in June 1793 and formed part of the covering force at the Siege of Dunkirk in August 1793Cannon, p. 40 and at the Siege of Landrecies in April 1794.Cannon, p. 42 It undertook successful charges at the Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies in April 1794Cannon, p. 44 and at the Battle of Willems in May 1794Cannon, p. 55 and was present, but not actively engaged, at the Battle of Tournay later in May 1794.Cannon, p. 61 The regiment returned to England in December 1795Cannon, p. 65 and was next in action at the Battle of Alkmaar in October 1799 during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. =Napoleonic Wars= The regiment was reconstituted as a hussar regiment in 1807 as the 15th (The King's) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (Hussars).

On 14 April 1915, the squadrons returned to regimental control and the regiment was placed under the command of the 9th Cavalry Brigade in the 1st Cavalry Division. The regiment remained on the Western Front throughout the war. It participated in most of the major actions where cavalry were used as a mounted mobile force. They were also used as dismounted troops and served effectively as infantry.

UnI was closed by order of the state education authorities in 2007, due to pedagogical and financial irregularities. Closure In 2006, UnI came under investigation on alleged irregularities on several matters, relating to both its academics and management. In early 2007, it had entered into talks about possible merger with the Universidade Internacional, another private university; however, on 9 April 2007, the Portuguese Minister of Science, Technology and Higher Education, Mariano Gago, announced that UnI would be shut down by the Portuguese Government after the investigation reported serious pedagogical, ethical and financial irregularities. UnI shut down in October 2007. Following the investigation, twenty-six principles at Universidade Independente were indicted, and twenty-four brought to trial for their part in its mismanagement. Most of those indicted were convicted of crimes, mostly document forgery and tax evasion. Rui Verde, who is currently a Professor at Oxford University, the editor at the journalism platform MakaAngola headed by Rafael Marques de Morais and a former vice-rector at the Independent University, was sentenced to 4 years and 2 months suspended prison sentence for falsifying documents, forgery and qualified tax fraud.

Particular attention is paid to the molecular mechanisms of the interaction of said pathogens with their host cells and host cell responses. In this case, emphasis is placed on the functional genomics of the host cell through RNA interference. * The Department of Cellular Microbiology is headed by Arturo Zychlinsky. The group's research focus is the hypothesis that chromatin may have evolved to have an immune function in eukaryotes. The group is testing this hypothesis by looking at \\"Neutrophil Extracellular Traps\\" (NETs), which were discovered by the group, and by studying the role of histones in the immune system. * The Vector Biology research unit is headed by Elena Levashina. It is studying the role mosquitoes play in regulating the development of malaria parasites. * Marcus Taylor is the leader of the \\"Visualisation of Immune Signalling\\" research group. His group is trying to decipher cellular information transfer in the context of infections and immune responses. *Igor Iatsenko heads the new research group \\"Genetics of Host- Microbe Interactions\\". Its aim is to understand the mechanisms of how the host discriminates and responds to different microbial challenges. *Matthieu Domenech de Cell√®s is the leader of the new research group \\"Infectious Disease Epidemiology\\". Their focuses on the population biology of infectious diseases, with a view to understanding how individual-level mechanisms of infection translate into population-level dynamics. *Mark Cronan heads the research group \\"In vivo cell biology of infections\\".

They plan to accomplish this through the use of technologies, vehicles and procedures developed by NASA and aerospace companies over the last 25 years. Space Island Project The Space Island Project is a project whose goal is to create a stand-alone commercial space infrastructure supporting manned business activities in Low Earth orbit (LEO) 400 to 500 miles above earth. The centerpiece of this project is the Space Solar Energy Initiative which will collect energy with solar panel satellites and then beam this energy to receiving towers on Earth using \\"very weak microwave beams.\\" The goal was to have a massive space station in Low Earth Orbit with as many as 20,000 passengers to start and doubling the population every decade.

They argue that previous attempts at commercial space projects have had a dependency on revenue and subsidies from government agencies, but that they have a funding plan that would be viable through capitalizing on commercial markets such as solar power satellites.

Antiquarian booksellers affiliated to the League adhere to the ILAB Code of Ethics, and the League aims to server as a global network for the rare book trade. History The idea of forming an international organization of antiquarian booksellers that would beneficially link national associations of antiquarian booksellers was originally conceived by the former president of the Dutch Association, Menno Hertzberger. As a Jew, he had spent part of the Second World War hiding from the Nazis. To quote him: \\"Five long years (of war) had put up ‚Ä¶ barriers between nations. There was no communication. This enforced extra chauvinism - worse, hatred. Was there a possibility to do something about inter-human relationships, to bring nations more together? This was my dream. But how could it be realized? Only on common ground, on mutual interests. Therefore, for an antiquarian bookseller, by THE BOOK!\\" Aus dem Antiquariat: Issues 1‚Äì12, 1977 In 1947 representatives from five countries, Denmark, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden, met in Amsterdam to discuss the formation of such an organization, with the aim of establishing open markets, to foster friendship and understanding, and to counteract the animosity and suspicion engendered by World War Two. The president of the British Association, Percy H. Muir, chaired the first conference and became a major role player in the evolution of the League; Muir also assembled the important scientific library of Ian Fleming, later author of the James Bond novels - through Muir, Fleming himself became a director of the London booksellers Elkin Mathews.Lycett, Andrew; Ian Fleming, p.76. London; Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1995 The ILAB was formally incorporated in Copenhagen in September 1948, with ten participating countries, among them Belgium, Finland, Switzerland, Norway, Italy, Great Britain, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark. William S. Kundig from Switzerland was elected the first ILAB President in the history of the League. In his opening speech the Danish bookseller Einar Gr√∏nholt Pedersen defined the universal aims and ethics of all ILAB antiquarian booksellers: =Present status= 22 national associations and some 2000 rare booksellers in 32 countries under one roof: Members of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers are the national associations, their members are affiliated to the League, and known as ILAB booksellers or ILAB affiliates. ILAB Congresses and ILAB Book Fairs are important market places of the rare book world. The ILAB Breslauer Prize for Bibliography is awarded every fourth year to outstanding academic works on bibliography and the history of the book. The ILAB Stolen Book Database aims to prevent book thefts worldwide. ILAB's website contains information on books, manuscripts, autographs and prints. Each national association affiliated to the League has its own website, all of which are brought together under the umbrella of ILAB. Code of Ethics The League publishes, and upholds, a code of ethics and good practice based on the wide experience of all its member nations. ILAB affiliated booksellers are expected to follow this code. The display of the ILAB logo, and those of national associations, pledges to maintain authenticity of all material offered for sale, correct description of all such material, disclosure of all significant defects or restorations, accurate and professional pricing of all material, clear marking of all prices and care in the conduct of appraisals or valuations. ILAB Breslauer Prize for Bibliography The ILAB Breslauer Prize for Bibliography was first awarded in 1964.ILAB Breslauer Prize for Bibliography, official website. The Prize of $10,000 is awarded every fourth year to the author(s) of the most original and outstanding 'book about a book' in the broad field of bibliography worldwide. Any aspect of bibliography (e.g. enumerative, textual, history of the book, design, binding, book trade, etc.) is admitted. Certain categories are not eligible, notably manuscripts, catalogues of books intended for sale and translations of works appearing in another language. Apart from the Prize, the jurors may at their discretion award Honourable Mentions to other deserving entries. The purpose of the Prize is to draw attention to what it regards as the best academic work being done in the field, to reward and honour it in appropriate terms, and to publicise the League's support for original scholarship. The panel of judges (or jurors) consists of three professional scholars or librarians and three antiquarian booksellers. They are chosen with an aim to represent the widest possible range of nationalities so that the panel is qualified to adjudicate on books in various languages and on all aspects of bibliography and the history of the book. Georges A. Deny (of Brussels) was appointed as the first Secretary of the ILAB Prize for Bibliography. He laid down the ground rules and supervised the first and second Awards. He was succeeded by Dr. Frieder Kocher-Benzing (of Stuttgart) who was the longest serving Secretary presiding over the third to eleventh Prize, then by Konrad Meuschel (Germany), Raymond Kilgarriff (Great Britain), and Mitsuo Nitta (Japan). In 2008, the name of the Prize was changed into ILAB Breslauer Prize for Bibliography to honour a generous gift granted by the Breslauer Foundation which was set up by Dr. Bernard H. Breslauer (1918‚Äì2004), an ILAB dealer who had a lifelong passion for bibliography. The first ILAB Prize for Bibliography was awarded in 1967 to Jean Peeters-Fontainas, followed by famous scholars like Claus Nissen, Wytze Hellinga, I. C. Koeman, Francois Weil, Gerhard D√ºnnhaupt, Anthony Hobson, and Lucas Heinrich W√ºthrich.

The name comes from the Celtic word clyst meaning 'clear stream'. The village is a major part of the electoral ward of Clyst Valley. At the 2011 Census this ward population was 2,326. Description Clyst St Mary contains Westpoint Arena and Showground, the Crealy Adventure Park, the Cat and Fiddle Training Ground for Exeter City F.C. and has a small industrial estate, Langdon's Business Park and a major office development. The population has risen steadily, it was 97 in 1801, 157 in 1901 and 642 in 2004.South West ID data resource This figure for the parish excludes all residents living on the north side of the main village street, who are counted within the parish of Sowton, a hamlet 1 mile to the north. Both parishes are now administered collectively as Bishop's Clyst, named after the Bishop's Court, former palace of the Bishop of Exeter, situated between them. The village of Clyst St Mary itself has three main areas: *the old village, site of the school, village hall, shop/post office and pubs; *the Winslade Park estate - in the grounds of the old manor house, across the A3052, home to the majority of the population and the old church *the Cat and Fiddle mobile home park, east of the old village. Additionally the parish includes various outlying farms and hamlets. Historically, the village was recorded in the Domesday Book as 'Bishop's Cliste' and is best known for its late 12th-century bridge across the River Clyst, long the main route between Exeter and London. Rebuilt in 1310, it is the oldest bridge in Devon and for over seven hundred years constituted part of the main road connection between Exeter and London. Battle of Clyst St Mary The medieval bridge over the River Clyst at Clyst St. Mary Clyst St Mary was the site of one of the decisive battles in the 1549 Prayer Book Rebellion, when West Country resistance to the Protestant Reformation was quashed. After the Battle of Woodbury Common on 4 August 1549, the rebels under the control of Humphrey Arundell had re-grouped with the main contingent of 6,000 at Clyst St Mary, but on 5 August were attacked by a central force led by Sir William Francis, under the control of John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford. After a ferocious battle Russell's troops gained the advantage leaving a thousand Cornish and Devonians dead and many more taken prisoner, 900 of whom were massacred later that day at Clyst Heath. The village was burned and many of the combatants and villagers drowned in the river.Philip Payton. (1996). \\"Cornwall\\". Fowey: Alexander Associates .

There is also a large office complex in Winslade Park, the site of the original manor house and, subsequently, a boarding school. The complex was initially developed by the London & Manchester group, later this site was taken over by the Friends Provident group. Apart from the refurbishment of the old school (Winslade House) in the 1980s there was a development of newer buildings on the adjacent land of Grindle House. These buildings house the Devon region DEFRA offices (in Clyst House). Winslade Park is the name for the grounds containing Winslade House, Clyst House and the other facilities here.

He was known for his popular novels, which primarily consisted of mysteries and erotica. Early life Kajiyama was born in Keijo (present day Seoul) in Japanese- occupied Korea, where his father was a civil engineer. He lived in Korea to the end of World War II, when he was repatriated together with his parents to his father's home town of Hatsukaichi, in Hiroshima Prefecture. He was a graduate of the Hiroshima Normal School (the predecessor to Hiroshima University). After graduation, he worked as an investigative reporter, and submitted short stories and small articles to literary magazines such as Shukan Shincho and Shukan Bunshun. In 1961, Kajiyama was hospitalized for three months with tuberculosis. Literary career In 1962, Kajiyama published his first novel, Kuro no shisosha (‚ÄúThe Black Test Model‚Äù), which he wrote in a documentary style. The novel was an all-time bestseller in Japan for several years, and started the genre of the industrial espionage novel in Japan. The story involves two motor companies vying to produce a new sports car. The intense competition in the Japanese automobile industry causes the companies to resort to industrial espionage to gain an advantage. The protagonist of the story even sacrifices his girlfriend in order to beat the other company. However, eventually he realizes the futility of sacrificing his personal life for the uncaring corporation, which regards him as only a disposable cog in a huge machine. The novel was made into a motion picture by Daiei Motion Picture Company in 1962, directed by Yasuzo Masumura. Its success was such that Daiei subsequently released ten more thriller-action films with similar themes, each using the word \\"black\\" in its title. Kajiyama also followed up on the novel‚Äôs success with a number of bestsellers, including a series of ‚ÄúPolice Woman‚Äù novels which were serialized in the Shukan Shincho magazine in 1966. By 1969, he was one of the highest paid authors in Japan. However, in 1972, he had a relapse of his tuberculosis, and retired to his villa in Izu, from which he continued to write, and to participate in the activities of the Japanese chapter of the PEN International. However, few of Kajiyama's popular novels have been translated into English, and he is known more in the West for his works on Korea under Japanese rule. Kajiyama was awarded the Naoki Prize, a prestigious literary prize, in 1963 for a work on Korea: Richo zanei ÊùéÊúùÊÆãÂΩ± (\\"Shadows of the Yi Dynasty‚Äù). In 1965 he began serializing a novel about Soka Gakkai, but a flood of complaints from Soka Gakkai supporters caused the editor of the magazine so much stress that he went missing; the series was never completed. Kajiyama died suddenly of cirrhosis of the liver while at a hotel in Hong Kong, where he was researching materials for a new book. After his death, his library was donated to the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Because of his background, Kajiyama was attracted both to the culture and people of Korea and the question of Japanese overseas migration. He collected more than 1,000 volumes of materials, some of which were classified documents of the Government-General of Korea in preparation of an epic on the history of Japanese migration, but the project was never completed due to his untimely early death.

Biography Anthony Browne was the eldest of the six sonsElzinga states there were sevens sons. of Sir Anthony Browne by his first wife, Alice Gage (d. 31 March 1540/1), the daughter of Sir John Gage of Firle, Sussex. Browne was elected a member of parliament for Guildford in 1545, and named standard-bearer jointly with his father in 1546. Before 16 February 1547 he was appointed as an equerry in the royal stables. He was among the forty Knights of the Bath created at the coronation of King Edward VI on 20 February 1547. According to Elzinga, Browne's conservative views, and particularly his support for Henry VIII's daughter, Princess Mary, antagonized the Edwardian regime, but he was nonetheless re-elected for Guildford in 1547, and at his father's death on 28 April 1548 was allowed to purchase his wardship for ¬£333 6s 8d, although he was replaced as standard- bearer, as being too young for the position. He inherited from his father an estate worth at least ¬£1,177 12s 2d per annum. On reaching the age of majority he was restored to the position of standard-bearer, and had licence to enter on his lands on 4 May 1550. He was Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex from 1552 to 1553, and returned as MP for Petersfield, Hampshire, in March 1553, although nothing further is known of his role in the House of Commons. He appears to have taken no active part in the succession crisis which followed the death of Edward VI, despite receiving a letter from the Privy Council on 8 July 1553 and a letter from Lady Jane Grey herself two days later. After Queen Mary's accession to the throne in July 1553 Browne was appointed to several positions in the royal household. From October 1553 he was Keeper of Guildford Park. In April 1554 he was appointed Master of the Horse to Queen Mary's consort, Philip II of Spain, for which he was granted an annuity of ¬£200. From June 1554 he was steward and keeper of the chase at Hampton Court Palace. However, in early September 1554 King Philip replaced the English appointees in his household with Spaniards, and Browne lost his position as Philip's Master of Horse. Browne also continued to hold civic offices. In April 1554 he was elected Knight of the Shire for Surrey, and in the same year was a Justice of the Peace for Surrey and Sussex. At Queen Mary's marriage to King Philip at Hampton Court on 2 September 1554, Browne's second wife, Magdalen Dacre, walked in the bridal procession, and Browne was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Montagu. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 12 November, and is said to have attended regularly. From 16 February to 24 August 1555 Montague travelled to Rome as one of the English ambassadors sent to treat with Pope Julius III for the restoration of Catholicism in England. He was installed as a Knight of the Garter on 17 October 1555. In 1557 he served under William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, as lieutenant-general of the English forces in Picardy at the siege of St Quentin. On 28 April 1557 he was appointed to the Privy Council. He was one of fifteen executors of Queen Mary's will, and one of the chief mourners at her funeral. When Queen Elizabeth came to the throne in November 1558, Montague was replaced on the Privy Council, and in the Parliament of 1559 spoke against the new regime's measures for religious reform, including bills for uniformity in religion, for the re-establishment of the royal supremacy, and for the dissolution of the religious houses which had been restored during Queen Mary's reign (Montague himself had founded two chantries, one at Battle Abbey, and one at Midhurst). In 1563 he again spoke against a bill involving the oath of supremacy. Despite his opposition to the regime's religious reforms, Montague retained Queen Elizabeth's favour through his prudence and loyalty. He was sent on diplomatic missions to Spain in 1560 and 1565. According to Elzinga, Montague had landed income in the 1560s of between ¬£2000 and ¬£3000 a year, and as one of the wealthiest peers in Sussex was reappointed as joint Lord Lieutenant of Sussex during the Northern Rebellion in 1569. However, in November both Montague and his son-in-law, Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, were implicated in the rebellion. In a letter dated 1 December 1569 the Spanish ambassador, Guerau de Spes, wrote to the Duke of Alba that both Montague and Southampton 'have sent to me for advice as to whether they should take up arms or go over to your Excellency'. According to Akrigg, Montague and Southampton set sail for Flanders, but were driven back by contrary winds. Although they were ordered to come immediately to court to explain their actions, to all appearances things were smoothed over, and neither Montague nor his son-in-law was punished for his involvement. In the following year Montague's son-in-law was in more serious trouble, although Montague himself appears to have escaped unscathed. After Pope Pius V's excommunication of the Queen, English Catholics were required to choose between loyalty to religion and loyalty to the sovereign. Southampton sought counsel from John Lesley, Bishop of Ross, at a secret meeting in the marshes of Lambeth, where they were intercepted by the watch, and in consequence, on 18 June 1570 the Privy Council ordered Southampton's arrest and confined him to the house of Henry Beecher, Sheriff of London. On 15 July he was placed in the custody of Sir William More at Loseley, where More was under instructions to induce Southampton to take part in Protestant devotions in the household. After doing so, Southampton was released in November. A year later, in September 1571, under questioning concerning the Ridolfi plot, the Bishop of Ross incriminated Southampton by revealing the entire story of their meeting in Lambeth marsh. Southampton was arrested at the end of October and confined to the Tower for 18 months. He was finally released on 1 May 1573, and again placed in the custody of Sir William More at Loseley. On 14 July he was permitted to live with Montague at Cowdray, although his liberty was still restricted, and on 6 October 1573 Southampton wrote elatedly to Sir William More from Cowdray House to announce the birth of his son, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. In the year prior to Southampton's death, Montague's relationship with his son-in-law was severely strained. In about 1577 Southampton, for reasons unknown, had forbidden his wife ever to see again a certain Donsame, 'a common person'. When in 1580 it was reported to him that she had been seen at Dogmersfield with Donsame, he forever banished her his 'board and presence', forcing her to live at one of his Hampshire estates under close surveillance. The Countess defended herself with spirit in a long letter to her father on 21 March 1580, denying adultery and accusing one of the Earl's servants, Thomas Dymock, of having been the cause of the contention between herself and her husband. An indication of the rift between Montague and Southampton over the latter's treatment of his wife can be found in an entry in the register of the Privy Council recording that one of Southampton's servants had been committed to the Marshalsea on 23 February 1580 'for certain misdemeanours by him used against Mr Anthony Brown, the eldest sonne of the Lord Montacute'. When war broke out with Spain in 1585, Montague was removed from his position as Lord Lieutenant. However the following year he proved his loyalty to the Queen as one of the peers who tried Mary, Queen of Scots, and in 1588 aided in the defence against the Spanish Armada, leading a troop of horsemen with his son and grandson. In August 1591 the queen honoured Montague by spending six days at Cowdray House.Michael Questier, Catholicism and Community in Early-Modern England (Cambridge, 2006), pp. 170-174: Elizabeth Heale, 'Contesting Terms' in J. E. Archer & E. Goldring & S. Knight edd., The Progresses, Pageants, & Entertainments of Queen Elizabeth I (Oxford, 2007), pp. 199-204. He entertained her lavishly, and in reward she conferred knighthoods on Montague's second son, George Browne, and Montague's son-in-law, Robert Dormer, 1st Baron Dormer. In 1590 Montague and his daughter Mary were negotiating with Lord Burghley for a marriage between Mary's son, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, and Lord Burghley's eldest granddaughter, Elizabeth Vere, daughter of Burghley's daughter, Anne Cecil, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. However the match was not to Southampton's liking, and in a letter written in November 1594, about six weeks after Southampton had turned 21, the Jesuit Henry Garnet reported the rumour that 'The young Erle of Southampton refusing the Lady Veere payeth ¬£5000 of present payment'. Montagu's monument in St Mary's parish church, Easebourne, Sussex Montague died at his manor house in West Horsley, Surrey, on 19 October 1592 of a lingering illness, and was buried at Midhurst in Sussex on 6 December. His tomb of marble and alabaster, surmounted by a kneeling effigy of himself and recumbent effigies of his two wives, so closely resembles the Southampton monument at Titchfield as to be, according to Elzinga, 'a testament to the closeness between Montague and Southampton'.

Life and work Frulovisi was from Ferrara and grew up in Venice. It was there that he wrote his first works, a set of comedies which were performed by schoolboys. They were some of the first examples of this genre in Renaissance Italy. In the early 1430s, Frulovisi travelled to Naples and then returned north to his hometown of Ferrara. There he sought employment at the court of the ruling d'Este dynasty, in 1434 dedicating to them his dialogue on government, De Republica. He may also have written there two further comedies. He did not stay there for long, however; he travelled across the Alps, reaching in England probably in 1436. He was employed in the household of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and wrote for him both a poem celebrating the duke's martial exploits, Humfrois, and a biography of Humfrey's late brother, Henry V of England. This latter work, the Vita Henrici Quinti, is the work for which Frulovisi is best known; it has long been considered the earliest posthumous biography of Henry V, though, in fact, it was heavily derivative of another work, the Vita et Gesta Henrici Quinti, once ascribed to Thomas Elmham.D. Rundle, \\"The Unoriginality of Tito Livio Frulovisi's Vita Henrici Quinti\\", English Historical Review, cxxiii (2008), pp. 1109 - 1131. The only published edition of Frulovisi's Vita is that made by Thomas Hearne in the eighteenth century. It was also translated into Italian in the fifteenth century by Pier Candido Decembrio and into English in the first years of the reign of Henry VIII. Once again, Frulovisi did not stay long in his place of residence: he left England for good in 1440, and returned to Italy. He was for a time in Milan and then journeyed to Barcelona, via Toulouse. There is little information about his later years, though it appears that he trained as a medical doctor. Works * C. W. Previt√©-Orton ed., Opera hactenus inedita T.

They are named after mathematicians Paul Erd≈ës and Alfr√©d R√©nyi, who first introduced one of the models in 1959, while Edgar Gilbert introduced the other model contemporaneously and independently of Erd≈ës and R√©nyi. In the model of Erd≈ës and R√©nyi, all graphs on a fixed vertex set with a fixed number of edges are equally likely; in the model introduced by Gilbert, each edge has a fixed probability of being present or absent, independently of the other edges. These models can be used in the probabilistic method to prove the existence of graphs satisfying various properties, or to provide a rigorous definition of what it means for a property to hold for almost all graphs.  Definition  There are two closely related variants of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi random graph model. A graph generated by the binomial model of Erd≈ës and R√©nyi (p = 0.01) *In the G(n, M) model, a graph is chosen uniformly at random from the collection of all graphs which have n nodes and M edges. For example, in the G(3, 2) model, each of the three possible graphs on three vertices and two edges are included with probability 1/3. *In the G(n, p) model, a graph is constructed by connecting nodes randomly. Each edge is included in the graph with probability p independent from every other edge. Equivalently, all graphs with n nodes and M edges have equal probability of ::p^M (1-p)^{{n \\\\choose 2}-M}. :The parameter p in this model can be thought of as a weighting function; as p increases from 0 to 1, the model becomes more and more likely to include graphs with more edges and less and less likely to include graphs with fewer edges. In particular, the case p = 0.5 corresponds to the case where all 2^\\\\binom{n}{2} graphs on n vertices are chosen with equal probability. The behavior of random graphs are often studied in the case where n, the number of vertices, tends to infinity. Although p and M can be fixed in this case, they can also be functions depending on n. For example, the statement :Almost every graph in G(n, 2ln(n)/n) is connected. means :As n tends to infinity, the probability that a graph on n vertices with edge probability 2ln(n)/n is connected, tends to 1. Comparison between the two models The expected number of edges in G(n, p) is \\\\tbinom{n}{2}p, and by the law of large numbers any graph in G(n, p) will almost surely have approximately this many edges (provided the expected number of edges tends to infinity). Therefore, a rough heuristic is that if pn2 ‚Üí ‚àû, then G(n,p) should behave similarly to G(n, M) with M=\\\\tbinom{n}{2} p as n increases. For many graph properties, this is the case. If P is any graph property which is monotone with respect to the subgraph ordering (meaning that if A is a subgraph of B and A satisfies P, then B will satisfy P as well), then the statements \\"P holds for almost all graphs in G(n, p)\\" and \\"P holds for almost all graphs in G(n, \\\\tbinom{n}{2} p) \\" are equivalent (provided pn2 ‚Üí ‚àû). For example, this holds if P is the property of being connected, or if P is the property of containing a Hamiltonian cycle. However, this will not necessarily hold for non-monotone properties (e.g. the property of having an even number of edges). In practice, the G(n, p) model is the one more commonly used today, in part due to the ease of analysis allowed by the independence of the edges. Properties of G(n, p) With the notation above, a graph in G(n, p) has on average \\\\tbinom{n}{2} p edges. The distribution of the degree of any particular vertex is binomial:, Eq. (1) : P(\\\\deg(v) = k) = {n-1\\\\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-1-k}, where n is the total number of vertices in the graph. Since :P(\\\\deg(v) = k) \\\\to \\\\frac{(np)^k \\\\mathrm{e}^{-np}}{k!} \\\\quad \\\\text{ as } n \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\text{ and } np = \\\\text{constant}, this distribution is Poisson for large n and np = const. In a 1960 paper, Erd≈ës and R√©nyi The probability p used here refers there to N(n) = \\\\tbinom{n}{2} p described the behavior of G(n, p) very precisely for various values of p. Their results included that: *If np < 1, then a graph in G(n, p) will almost surely have no connected components of size larger than O(log(n)). *If np = 1, then a graph in G(n, p) will almost surely have a largest component whose size is of order n2/3. *If np ‚Üí c > 1, where c is a constant, then a graph in G(n, p) will almost surely have a unique giant component containing a positive fraction of the vertices. No other component will contain more than O(log(n)) vertices. *If p<\\\\tfrac{(1-\\\\varepsilon)\\\\ln n} n, then a graph in G(n, p) will almost surely contain isolated vertices, and thus be disconnected. *If p>\\\\tfrac{(1+\\\\varepsilon) \\\\ln n} n, then a graph in G(n, p) will almost surely be connected. Thus \\\\tfrac{\\\\ln n} n is a sharp threshold for the connectedness of G(n, p). Further properties of the graph can be described almost precisely as n tends to infinity. For example, there is a k(n) (approximately equal to 2log2(n)) such that the largest clique in G(n, 0.5) has almost surely either size k(n) or k(n) + 1. Thus, even though finding the size of the largest clique in a graph is NP-complete, the size of the largest clique in a \\"typical\\" graph (according to this model) is very well understood. Edge-dual graphs of Erdos-Renyi graphs are graphs with nearly the same degree distribution, but with degree correlations and a significantly higher clustering coefficient. Relation to percolation In percolation theory one examines a finite or infinite graph and removes edges (or links) randomly. Thus the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi process is in fact unweighted link percolation on the complete graph. (One refers to percolation in which nodes and/or links are removed with heterogeneous weights as weighted percolation). As percolation theory has much of its roots in physics, much of the research done was on the lattices in Euclidean spaces. The transition at np = 1 from giant component to small component has analogs for these graphs, but for lattices the transition point is difficult to determine. Physicists often refer to study of the complete graph as a mean field theory. Thus the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi process is the mean-field case of percolation. Some significant work was also done on percolation on random graphs. From a physicist's point of view this would still be a mean-field model, so the justification of the research is often formulated in terms of the robustness of the graph, viewed as a communication network. Given a random graph of n ‚â´ 1 nodes with an average degree . Remove randomly a fraction 1 ‚àí p‚Ä≤ of nodes and leave only a fraction p‚Ä≤ from the network. There exists a critical percolation threshold p'_c=\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\langle k\\\\rangle} below which the network becomes fragmented while above p'_c a giant connected component of order n exists. The relative size of the giant component, P‚àû, is given by : P_\\\\infty= p'[1-\\\\exp(-\\\\langle k \\\\rangle P_\\\\infty)]. \\\\, Caveats Both of the two major assumptions of the G(n, p) model (that edges are independent and that each edge is equally likely) may be inappropriate for modeling certain real-life phenomena. Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi graphs have low clustering, unlike many social networks. Some modeling alternatives include Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert model and Watts and Strogatz model. These alternative models are not percolation processes, but instead represent a growth and rewiring model, respectively. A model for interacting Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi networks was developed recently by Buldyrev et al.  History  The G(n, p) model was first introduced by Edgar Gilbert in a 1959 paper studying the connectivity threshold mentioned above. The G(n, M) model was introduced by Erd≈ës and R√©nyi in their 1959 paper. As with Gilbert, their first investigations were as to the connectivity of G(n, M), with the more detailed analysis following in 1960. See also *, the graph formed by extending the G(n, p) model to graphs with a countably infinite number of vertices. Unlike in the finite case, the result of this infinite process is (with probability 1) the same graph, up to isomorphism. * describes ways in which properties associated with the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model contribute to the emergence of order in systems. * describe a general probability distribution of graphs on \\"n\\" nodes given a set of network statistics and various parameters associated with them. * , a generalization of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model for graphs with latent community structure * * References Literature   Weblinks  * Video: Erdos-Renyi Random Graph Category:Random graphs Renyi model ","title":"Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model"},{"id":"10477223","text":"Miriam Marx Allen (May 19, 1927 ‚Äì June 29, 2017) was an author and the daughter of Groucho Marx, and his first wife, Ruth Johnson.

Sijthoff, Leiden. significantly later than in most other countries. It was a period of severe economic crisis in the 1930s which affected countries around the world, including the Netherlands. In the United States, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 is understood as the start of the Great Depression. But in the Netherlands the depression started more gradually, in 1929‚Äì1931, while the economy had been in a gradual decline for a longer period. In the Netherlands the depression lasted significantly longer than in most countries, partly because of structural characteristics of the Dutch economy and partly because of the policy of the government. The refusal to drop the gold standard plays a central role. The Great Depression led to political instability and riots, and can be linked to the rise of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands. The depression in the Netherlands lessened at the end of 1936, but real economic stability did not return until after World War II. Prelude (1918-1929) Because of its neutrality in World War I, the Netherlands did not face the problems of war reparations, war damage and population loss which caused economic problems in other European countries. But because of the international character of the Dutch economy these problems also had their consequences for the Netherlands. Especially the unrest and economic problems in Germany, one of the Netherlands' main trading partners, in the early 1920s plunged the Netherlands into a severe depression until 1925 (lowest point reached in 1923). After 1925, partly because of economic improvements in Germany, the post-war depression in the Netherlands ended and the country rejoined the gold standard. However, among others because of strong trade restrictions in Germany, this improvement was limited and did not cause an economic boom as in some other European countries and the United States (associated with the Roaring Twenties). In spite of these slight economic improvements the Dutch economy struggled with structural problems in the period before the Great Depression. Trade restrictions and economic protectionism had not fully disappeared after World War I, and world trade failed to pick up again after the war. The Dutch economy had long been dependent on international trade and finance (in 1929 an estimated 30% of the GNP came from export), and especially the big shipping sector suffered from the lack of trading opportunities. Another problem was the combination of high post-World War I birthrates and increasing labour productivity, which meant that any increase of demand did not cause general welfare increase or a decrease of unemployment. Poverty and support A line of unemployed people in Amsterdam, 1933. Until 1931 the social consequences of the economic crisis had been limited; by decreasing work hours and wages, mass unemployment had so far been avoided in most sectors. However, around 1931 mass unemployment did start and those workers who could keep their jobs often had to accept significant wage cuts. Rough estimates of unemployment show a surge between 1930 and 1932, and a steady increase up to the end of 1936.Griffiths, Richard, e.a. (1987) The Netherlands and the Gold Standard, 1931-1936. NEHA, Amsterdam. Not every sector of the economy suffered equally; while the shipping and trading sectors were hit especially hard, some specialised sectors, such as the tobacco industry, survived the first stage of the depression relatively unharmed. At the start of the depression, employed workers still saw their wage cuts matched by strong decreases of the price of consumption articles. But after the first years of the depression they too suffered from a decrease in real income. For the increasing numbers of unemployed, the situation was much worse. Until the 1930s, Dutch society did not have the experience and infrastructure needed to deal with mass unemployment. In large parts of society, it was felt that unemployed people should above all be stimulated to find work, so only income support at subsistence level should be given. Even though finding work had now become impossible for large numbers of people, social sentiments towards the unemployed changed only slowly. Labour unions had funds for temporary income support for newly unemployed workers, to which the government added some subsidy. So union members were spared real poverty for a limited period. In the later stages of the depression, however, these union funds became depleted while the government also reduced its subsidy, forcing unions to steadily decrease the time period and amount of support. Non-unionised workers and workers whose union support period had run out depended on a government poverty fund, which supported them up to subsistence level. This minimal income support came with a heavy social stigma, which reflected the values of contemporary society. Support receivers had to report at a government agency twice a day, waiting in the endless lines of unemployed which became a symbol of the depression. They also had to allow government inspectors to visit them at home and investigate their daily life, which quickly became a strongly hated practice among the unemployed. Social stigmatisation also took the form of clearly recognisable signs, such as red coloured subsidised clothing and the especially painful sign that a person was exempt from bicycle taxation (to be worn on a bicycle or on one‚Äôs clothing). In addition to scarce government aid, there were private initiatives to support the poor. The most important of these organisations was the Nationaal Crisis Comit√© (National Crisis Committee), established by Princess Juliana in 1931. But because of the limited scale of this organisation, it was unable to structurally improve the situation. Social unrest As most other countries, the Netherlands experienced significant social unrest during the Great Depression. But except for a number of impressive events, this unrest was actually quite limited in scale. Statistics of labour strikes, for example, show that during the 1931‚Äì1937 period strikes were actually less common in the Netherlands than in the previous years of economic stability from 1925 to 1930. At the height of the Great Depression in the Netherlands, the number of strikes was lowest. [4] Another form of protest was rentstriking, the refusal by a tenant to pay rent to a landlord. This form of protest was also quite limited in scale, partly because of harsh government intervention. More impressive was the strike or mutiny in 1933 of the sailors of , an armored ship of the Royal Netherlands Navy. As earlier in the United Kingdom (Invergordon Mutiny), the sailors protested a cut of their wages. The mutiny ended when the Dutch army bombed the ship, killing 22 of the sailors and forcing the rest of the crew to surrender. In 1934 another impressive event took place known as the Jordaan riot. A reduction of the already low government unemployment support sparked protest and riots in several cities in the Netherlands, most strongly in the Jordaan neighbourhood of Amsterdam. Between 4 July and 9 July, the riots and subsequent harsh intervention by police and military police claimed six lives and wounded dozens more. The upheaval of the Great Depression can also be linked to a rise of xenophobia and the, albeit limited, success of the National Socialist Movement (NSB). Founded in 1931, the NSB gained some popularity during the depression, with a peak of support in terms of its membership in 1936. When the strength of the depression lessened after 1937, support for the NSB fell again. Government policy Hendrik Colijn, Prime Minister during much of the Great Depression. An important difference between the Great Depression in the Netherlands and the situation in most other affected countries was the role of the government. Until the late 1930s the Dutch government, headed from 1933 to 1939 by the Anti-Revolutionary statesman Hendrik Colijn, could be described as non- interventionist and strongly internationalist. Its economic policy focussed mainly on keeping a balanced budget for government spending and income. While this government policy was typical for contemporary European and American governments, it was applied especially strictly in the Netherlands until the late stages of the depression. In the first years of the depression government policy limited itself to supporting the most heavily affected sectors of the economy. In 1931 a wheat law was issued (Dutch: Tarwewet), which forced importers of foreign wheat to add a quantity of more expensive Dutch wheat before sale, to promote the troubled Dutch agriculture. Starting in 1932 a series of \\"crisis laws\\" was issued to further subsidise the agricultural and shipping sectors, and to enable a measure of government control on import, export and capital flows. From 1934 onward the Dutch government also experimented with a Labour Fund (Dutch: Werkfonds) to provide subsidised workplaces for the unemployed, often on large scale public works (comparable with the New Deal in the United States). The scale of these government interventions was however too small to really change the situation. While government intervention on the economy was very limited, the Dutch government did lower its spending (including income support to the poor and unemployed) and raised taxes to keep its budget balanced. The effect of this was that while poverty increased, government support to the poor decreased. Such a government policy is heavily criticised by the Keynesian school of economics, which at that time was still in its infancy. Keynesianism stresses that governments should play an active role in promoting public and private consumption during an economic depression, so a balanced government budget should only be aimed at on the long run. The Dutch government was also very reluctant to intervene in its trade policy. While most industrialised countries strongly increased their trade restrictions from the early stages of the Great Depression onward, the Dutch government still hoped for international cooperation to solve the economic crisis. Only after the failed 1933 World Economic Conference, when it became clear that countries had to solve their economic problems by themselves, did the Netherlands increase its trade barriers to a more significant level. But as described earlier the Netherlands was still unwilling to drop the gold standard, and instead joined an agreement between the last European countries to maintain the gold standard. This subjected the Dutch economy to fierce foreign competition, forcing Dutch firms to strongly cut their costs in order to survive this situation. In the process wages and employment were cut, and the depression deepened. While the economic situation gradually improved in most industrialised countries around 1933-1934, the Great Depression was still getting worse in the Netherlands. Gradual recovery As in most other affected countries, the end of the Great Depression in the Netherlands was gradual, but in the Netherlands, recovery did not start before 1936, when the country abandoned the gold standard. Fall of the gold standard By 1933, only a few European states still remained with the gold standard, while among others the United Kingdom and the United States had abandoned it. By cooperating in international negotiation as a \\"gold bloc\\" and lowering trade restrictions among themselves these states tried to survive harsh foreign competition without accepting currency devaluation. Internal trade failed to solve their problems, however, and by 1935 only France, Switzerland and the Netherlands remained in this gold bloc. When France finally decided to accept devaluation in 1936, the Netherlands had no choice but to follow. While the Netherlands had been so reluctant to drop the gold standard, it quickly brought an economic boost after years of decline. In 1936 the Dutch stock market started climbing again, trade slowly recovered and unemployment stopped growing. Finally the country could now profit from the ongoing economic recovery that had been taking place for many of its trading partners. Preamble to World War II In 1937 the short period of economic recovery in the Netherlands stagnated again when the United States suffered its Recession of 1937‚Äì38. Another reason for stagnation were the rising political tensions caused by Germany's increasingly aggressive behaviour, causing uncertainty and the withdrawal of capital from European economies. At the same time the effects of the depression became less visible as European states started to rearm themselves in the preamble of World War II. The Netherlands started its rearmament relatively late and imported much of its weaponry, but by 1938 the artificial economic recovery caused by pre-war preparations also had its effects on the Netherlands. By 1939, large numbers of formerly unemployed people had been drafted into the army, while rising defence expenditure (the budget tripled between 1936 and 1939) artificially revived several sectors of the economy. Right before World War II an event took place which could have been very influential, had it happened earlier. The cabinet led by Hendrik Colijn was succeeded by the De Geer cabinet, which included two members of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP) for the first time in history. The new cabinet proposed an ambitious strategy to invest large sums of money in public works to finally end the depression. But before this new policy could fully be implemented the Netherlands was dragged into World War II. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands, and the Dutch economy transformed into a war economy.

Founded in 1857 as Lind University by a group of Presbyterian ministers, the college has been coeducational since 1876 and an undergraduate- focused liberal arts institution since 1903. Lake Forest enrolls approximately 1,600 students representing 47 states and 81 countries. Lake Forest offers 30 undergraduate major and minor programs in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, and features programs of study in pre-law, pre-medicine, communication, business, finance, and computer science. The majority of students live on the college's wooded 107-acre campus located a half-mile from the Lake Michigan shore. Lake Forest is affiliated with the Associated Colleges of the Midwest. The college has 19 varsity teams which compete in the NCAA Division III Midwest Conference. History Young Hall, the tallest building in the city of Lake Forest, houses most of the humanities departments on campus Lake Forest College was founded in 1857 by Reverend Robert W. Patterson as a Presbyterian alternative to the Methodist Northwestern University in Evanston. It was originally named Lind University after Sylvester Lind, who had given $80,000 to launch the school. Patterson and his fellow Chicago Presbyterians established the town of Lake Forest and the university roughly halfway between Evanston and Waukegan two years after the Chicago and Milwaukee Railway began service from Chicago. They hired St. Louis landscape architect Almerin Hotchkiss to design the town of Lake Forest with a university park at its center. Hotchkiss used the area's wooded ravines and forest as guidelines to plat a park-like, curvilinear layout for the town. Lake Forest Academy, a boys' preparatory school and the first project of the university, began offering classes in 1858; collegiate-level courses began in 1860. By the mid-1860s, a small New England-style village had been established with an academy building, a Presbyterian church and several homes. The school had a medical college from 1859‚Äì1863, which later split off and eventually became part of Northwestern University, now known as the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. In 1865, the name became Lake Forest University. In 1869 Ferry Hall, a girls' preparatory school and junior college, opened as a division of the university. It later merged with Lake Forest Academy in 1974. In 1876 Mary Eveline Smith Farwell started Lake Forest College, a coeducational division of the university, under the leadership of the Reverend Patterson. In 1878, College Hall (now Young Hall) was built following a fire that destroyed the former hotel being used for classes. The Reverend James Gore King McClure arrived in Lake Forest in 1881 as the pastor of the Presbyterian Church. Under his influence over the next 50 years, the college experienced a large transition \\"from a pluralistic graduate and professional emphasis to a singular undergraduate liberal arts focus,\\" says Lake Forest College archivist Art Miller, who co-wrote 30 Miles North: A History of Lake Forest College, Its Town, and Its City of Chicago. During this time, the college's theater group, the Garrick Players, the yearbook, and student newspaper, The Stentor, were all formed. In 1890 Lake Forest established a relationship with the Chicago College of Dental Surgery, Chicago's first dental school, to serve as its dental department. This affiliation ended in 1902. The Lake Forest School of Music opened as a division of the university in 1916, incorporating and extending the courses in music hitherto given in other departments. A summer school of landscape architecture was instituted in 1916. By 1925, Lake Forest College split from Lake Forest Academy, and the school's only focus was on undergraduate liberal arts. Following World War II, the college experienced further growth, taking control of what is now South Campus and constructing the Alumni Memorial Fieldhouse. In 1960, William Graham Cole, from Williams College, took over as president and brought with him Eastern faculty and students, further diversifying the campus. During his time as president, in 1965, the school's name was officially changed to Lake Forest College. In March 2010, the college received $7 million from alumna Grace Groner. Faculty The teaching faculty consists of 178 members. Lake Forest has a student-to-professor ratio of 13:1, and the average class size is 19. No classes at Lake Forest are taught by teaching assistants. All faculty hold a doctorate or equivalent degree.Peterson's Four-Year Colleges 2008. Fern Oram, ed., Peterson's 2007, p. 1723. See list of Lake Forest College people for notable faculty. Lake Forest professors regularly include undergraduates in their primary research and supervise independent research projects. Faculty members receive fellowships and grants from such notable organizations as the Fulbright Program, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, National Endowment for the Humanities, Freeman Foundation, Mellon Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Getty Trust, Goldsmith Foundation, and Kemper Foundation.

Lake Forest College's admissions selectivity rank according to The Princeton Review is 88 out of 99.http://www.princetonreview.com/schools/college/CollegeAdmissions.aspx?iid=1022662 This ranking is determined by several institutionally-reported factors, including: the class rank, average standardized test scores, and average high school GPA of entering freshmen; the percentage of students who come from out- of-state; and the percentage of applicants accepted.http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/articles/find/ratings.asp#selectivity The acceptance rate for the Class of 2015 was 50% from a total applicant pool of 3,411, yielding a class of 406 students. Student life Approximately 1,500 students attend the college, and about 86% live on campus. Among the largest and most active student groups on campus are: the student radio station (WMXM), Student Government, PRIDE (LGBT), SPB (organizes on-campus entertainment) and the Greek organizations. Located 30 miles north of Chicago, Lake Forest College is roughly an hour‚Äôs commute from the city. The Metra rail line, located in downtown Lake Forest, is a 15-minute walk from campus, where trains run approximately 25 times per day. =Center for Chicago Programs= At the Center for Chicago Programs, students can learn about events in the city and surrounding suburbs, get guidance on transportation to the city, and suggestions of where to go when they get there.

The handball teams have won 49 national championships and have received national media attention. The handball team competes in Division I through USHA (not NCAA). Lake Forest College has been a member of the Midwest Conference since 1974. It was a member of the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin from 1946-1963, and of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1919-1937. Lake Forest College was present at the 1895 meeting that formed the now Division I Big Ten Conference, but did not join the conference. The Sports Center, originally constructed in 1968, has long been home to Forester Athletics. But after the completion of a $17-million, recreation and fitness addition, the building was renamed the Lake Forest College Sports and Recreation Center. Outside of collegiate athletics, the campus is home to the original Halas Hall, the practice and front office facility for the NFL's Chicago Bears from 1977 until 1997. When the team built a new facility with the same name four miles to the west, the building was renovated into dormitories, while retaining the Halas Hall name. The practice field was renamed Farwell Field and serves as the main field for Foresters football and soccer.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on October 27, 1956, and stars Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. Plot Bugs Bunny is singing \\"This Is My Lucky Day\\" when he comes on an ad in the newspaper wanting a rabbit for a show at the QTTV-TV studio. When he gets there, the producer makes Bugs climb a ladder wired to a 10,000-volt fuse box. Unbeknownst to Bugs, it is a hunting show starring Elmer Fudd called The Sportsman's Hour, sponsored by The French Fried Fresh Frozen Rabbit Company. He teaches the audience about how to hunt a rabbit. He signals the cue for Bugs to come up out of the hole by pushing a button to activate the fuse box. When Bugs emerges, Elmer starts shooting. Bugs will not cooperate being shot at and Bugs takes this as professional jealousy, but on a scale he had never imagined. As Bugs leaves the studio with Elmer in pursuit, the producer holds up a sign to the camera that says \\"Program Temporarily Interrupted. Please Stand By.\\" Elmer chases Bugs all over the studio. In the first room, Bugs does a show called You Beat Your Wife (a parody of You Bet Your Life) and Bugs dressed as Groucho Marx contests Elmer. As Bugs walks off, Elmer sees Bugs in disguise and Bugs kisses him. In the next room Elmer gets a cherry pie in his face for the show You're Asking For It (a parody of You Asked for It). In the following room Bugs plays \\"Liver-ace\\" (a parody of Liberace), and when Elmer comes in, he is playing the piano. When Bugs sees Elmer, he shows piano keys like teeth, calls Elmer \\"his brother George\\", and tells Elmer to take the candelabra over to Mother. The candles are actually sticks of dynamite that blows up Elmer. While chasing Bugs out of the studio and looking for him, Elmer asks Bugs (who is dressed as a studio usher) if he has seen a rabbit go by. Bugs sends Elmer into a studio that was filming You Were There (a parody of You Are There) which was reenacting Custer's Last Stand. As Elmer comes out having been attack by Indians, Bugs redirects Elmer to Studio C for The Medic. Elmer says \\"Oh, much obliged\\" as he is leaving with a tomahawk in the back of his head and three arrows in his back. Elmer continues his search for Bugs stating that unless he finds \\"that wabbit\\", his career will be ruined. Finally, Bugs appears dressed as a producer, then sends Elmer into a show called Fancy Dress Party (a parody of The Arthur Murray Dance Party), Elmer gets changed into a rabbit costume, and Bugs gets into Elmer's hunting outfit. Bugs goes back on The Sportsman's Hour and shoots Elmer in his rabbit suit as Elmer gets angry. Bugs then comes in dressed as Ed Norton from The Honeymooners and gives Elmer a cigar with Groucho Marx's glasses and eyebrows while quoting \\"Hey, hey hey! Take it easy. Have a cigar. Geez, what a Groucho.\\" Production details The part where Bugs is a studio page at the TV studio is repeated in the 1959 cartoon People Are Bunny, this time with Daffy Duck as his victim. That is the second time that Bugs has played Groucho Marx to avoid Elmer. The first time was Friz Freleng's cartoon Slick Hare (1947), but Elmer comes much closer to catching Bugs in that Groucho scene than in the one in Wideo Wabbit, by means of disguise as Groucho's brother Harpo. When Bugs is masquerading as Liberace and playing the piano, the part where he gets his fingers tied in a knot was reused animation from another Freleng cartoon, Rhapsody Rabbit (1946). When Elmer is tracking Bugs' footprints while giving tips, music is reused from A Wild Hare where Bugs taps on Elmer's head and introduces his catch phrase. McKimson (who directed this cartoon) animated A Wild Hare without receiving screen credit. The call letters for the TV station in the cartoon, \\"QTTV\\", is lifted from KTTV, a local television station in Los Angeles. The exterior of the QTTV studio bears more than a passing resemblance to that of the CBS Television City complex. This is the final Bugs Bunny cartoon which uses the Carl Stalling melody What's Up, Doc? over the title cards. Butler would later use the Ed Norton voice for Yogi Bear. In the mid-1990s, whenever Cartoon Network would have technical difficulties interrupting a broadcast, in lieu of a slide showing the channel logo/name, a screenshot of the producer holding the \\"Program Temporarily Interrupted - Please Stand By\\" sign up to the TV camera from this cartoon would be used (sometimes a Cartoon Network station identification slide was also used with characters from various Hanna- Barbera/MGM in a blue checkerboard background as a secondary screenshot during Technical Difficulties). For unknown reasons, whenever one episode of The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries is about to end a shot of that scene is shown for 1 second. The producer is a caricature of comedian Frank Nelson, best known for his recurring role on The Jack Benny Program and his drawn-out way of saying \\"Yeeeeeeeeessss?\\" Availability * Wideo Wabbit is available, uncut and restored, on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3, Disc 2.

Day one is held on Easter Saturday and is one of the highest attended race days in Australia. The Von Doussa Steeplechase (named after founder Alfred von Doussa) takes place on day one and is a preliminary to the Great Eastern Steeplechase held on Easter Monday.

Many families camp for the whole weekend in the paddocks adjacent to the track, and some have done so all their lives. Patrons travelled by train from Adelaide to nearby Balhannah railway station, from the course, from 1884.

It includes a Roman Catholic church, RT√â Raidi√≥ na Gaeltachta regional studios, a Gaelic Athletic Association club and a golf club. History During the Land War of the 1880s, the people of Derrybeg were led by Fr. James McFadden (Irish: S√©amus Mac Ph√°id√≠n), who urged his parishioners to support the Land League and the Plan of Campaign. After a series of anti-landlord sermons, the Resident Magistrate ordered Father McFadden's arrest. On Sunday 3 February 1889, Royal Irish Constabulary District Inspector William Limbrick Martin (locally known as An Mh√°irt√≠nigh) arrived at Derrybeg's Roman Catholic church, Teach Phobail Mhuire with the intention of arresting Father McFadden immediately after Mass. As Father McFadden left the church interior, he was still dressed in his vestments and was carrying the Eucharist in the Ciborium. Upon seeing Father McFadden, District Inspector Martin drew his sword and charged the priest with the blade upraised. Horrified, Father McFadden's parishioners cried that District Inspector Martin was attacking the priest with a sword and attacked the policeman. District Inspector Martin was severely beaten and died upon the spot. Father McFadden and his parishioners were arrested and tried for first degree murder. A change of venue was granted to Crown prosecutors, who were also allowed to pack the jury with Protestants. In his 1928 memoirs, Tim Healy, who defended Father McFadden and his parishioners, described how he had argued the case at trial. Healy reminded the court that, under English law, it was a death penalty offense to strike a judge in his robes. He explained that, to the Catholics of Donegal, it was even more horrendous of a crime to assault a priest in his vestments. In response to Healy's statements, the Crown prosecutors offered a plea bargain which spared all defendants the death penalty. Father McFadden was sentenced to time served and his parishioners received prison sentences of varying degrees.Healy memoirs online, chapter 22History of Gweedore, Chapter One District Inspector William Martin was buried in the Church of Ireland cemetery in Ballyshannon, under an inscription which described him as having been, \\"cruelly murdered while nobly doing his duty at Derrybeg.\\" References External links Category:Gaeltacht places in County Donegal Category:Gaeltacht towns and villages Category:Geography of Gweedore ","title":"Derrybeg"},{"id":"10477450","text":"Petru Stoianov (born October 29, 1939, Vinga, Arad County) is a Romanian composer.

Life and career According to his birth certificate, Marx was born as Simon Marx in Alsace, then part of the Second French Empire. Due to his place of birth, he was known as \\"Frenchie\\". His parents were Simon Marrix and Johanna Haennchen Isaak; he came to the U.S. from France in 1880. He met Minnie in New York where he was working as a dance teacher. They married in 1884 and had six sons. Their first son, Manfred, born in 1885, died in infancy. The other children were Leonard (Chico), born in 1887, Adolph (Harpo) in 1888, Julius (Groucho) in 1890, Milton (Gummo) in 1892, and Herbert (Zeppo) in 1901. Marx was an excellent pinochle player, a game he taught to his two eldest sons. Marx became a tailor, although apparently not a very good one. According to Groucho, he was a talented cook, often convincing the landlord to delay their rent pay time with a good meal. In his show An Evening With Groucho, Groucho reminisced about his father, Sam: Harpo put the bad tailoring down to the fact that Frenchie never took the time to measure a client for a suit, preferring to guess their size. He would then take the suits that clients had rejected, travel to New Jersey, and sell them door-to-door. In his last interview, Zeppo joked that his father \\"was a very bad tailor but he found some people who were so stupid that they would buy his clothes, and so he'd make a few dollars that way for food\\". Marx made a cameo appearance in his four sons' film Monkey Business (1931), sitting on top of luggage behind the brothers on the pier as they wave to the First Officer, having slipped off the ship without being arrested as stowaways.

The first fixture of that name was held in 1877, following a race in 1876 which has been called the \\"Onkaparinga Handicap Steeplechase\\"; both just prior to formation of the Onkaparinga Racing Club (now Oakbank Racing Club). The distance of the race is 4950 metres making it the second longest horse race in Australia held on a public course. The most famous jump is the fallen log which is literally a log about a metre high. All other jumps are brush fences. The height of jumps has been reduced in recent years to reduce the risk of falls and make for safer racing. The race uses a different course to other races held at Oakbank with horse using an inner track passing on the inside of a hill. Unlike other races that require two racecallers the Great Eastern can be viewed in its entirety from the grandstand.

It was anciently the manor house of Umberleigh, site of the mediaeval Umberleigh Chapel, the ruins of which survive, and supposedly of the 10th-century royal palace of King Athelstan Umberleigh is a former large manor within the historic hundred of (North) Tawton,Thorn, Caroline & Frank, Domesday Book, Vol. 9, Devon, Chichester, 1985, part 2 (notes), chap. 13,1 but today a small village in North Devon in England. It used to be an ecclesiastical parish, but following the building of the church at Atherington it became a part of that parish. It forms however a part of the civil parish of Chittlehampton, which is mostly located on the east side of the River Taw. The manor of Umberleigh, which had its own entry in the Domesday Book of 1086, was entirely situated on the west side of the River Taw and was centred on the Nunnery which was given by William the Conqueror to the Holy Trinity Abbey in Caen, Normandy. The site was later occupied by the manor house of Umberleigh, the present Georgian manifestation of which, a large and grand farmhouse, is known as \\"Umberleigh House\\". Next to the manor house in about 1275 was founded Umberleigh Chapel, now a ruin the single remaining wall of which forms the back wall of a farm implements shed. Descent of the manor =King Athelstan= According to the Devon historian Tristram Risdon (d.1640),Risdon, T., Survey of Devon, 1810 edition, pp.316‚Äì7 Umberleigh was a royal manor held in demesne by King Athelstan (circa 893/895-939), King of the West Saxons from 924 to 927, and King of the English from 927 to 939. He built at Umberleigh a palace and next to it a chapel dedicated to the Blessed Trinity which served the royal family and household. Within the manor of Umberleigh Athelstan later founded two churches, at Bickington, now High Bickington and at Atherington, each of which he endowed with two hides of land. =Norman Conquest= Immediately prior to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 the manor of Umberleigh had been held by Brictric, as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. He was probably the great Saxon thane Brictric son of Algar.Thorne, part 2, 13,1 A person named Brictric was also the pre-Conquest holder of the single possession in Dorset of the Church of the Holy Trinity of Caen, the post-Conquest holder of Umberleigh. In the Domesday Book of 1086 Umberlei is listed as the sole possession of the Eccl(esi)a (de) S(ancta) Trinitat(e) Cadom(ensis), the Church of the Holy Trinity of Caen, Normandy, the 12th-century Norman church of which survives today as the Abbaye de Sainte-Trinit√©, also known as the Abbaye aux Dames (\\"Abbey of Ladies\\"), due to the fact it was founded by William the Conqueror (1066‚Äì1087) and his wife Matilda of Flanders, before the Norman Conquest of England, as a Benedictine monastery for women. The building work began in 1062 and finished in 1130. Umberleigh subsequently became a holding of the feudal barony of Gloucester, granted by King William II (1087‚Äì1100) to Robert FitzHamon (d. 1107), whose daughter and sole heiress Maud married Robert de Caen, natural son of King Henry I (1100‚Äì1135).Sanders, I.J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.6 =Soleigney family= Arms of de Soleigny: Quarterly argent and gules.Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.446 The first subsequent holder of the manor of Umberleigh identified by Risdon and Pole was Asculph de Soleigny (or de Solarys; Latinised as Halculfus de SoleinnioPole, p.422), also lord of the manor of adjacent Atherington, d. 1171), who lived at Umberleigh during the reign of King Henry II (1154‚Äì1189). He was succeeded by his son, either Gilbert (according to Risdon), or Phillip de Soleigny (according to Pole). Both father and son fought under King Henry II during his battles to succeed King Stephen (1135‚Äì1154). Gilbert/Phillip de Soleigny married Avis (or Hawis) de Redvers, daughter of \\"Baldwin de Redvers, Earl of Devon\\", and according to Risdon the sister of \\"Richard Rivers, Earl of Devon\\", probably Richard de Redvers, 4th Earl of Devon (d.1193). For her dowry Hawis was given by her father the manor of Stoke Rivers, which thus passed to her husband.Pole, p.411. Stoke Rivers descended to Willington and Beaumont, and thence to the Chichesters with Shirwell Gilbert/Phillip de Soligny left a daughter Mabill de Soligny as sole heiress, who married Jordan de Champernon, into whose family Umberleigh passed. =Champernon/Champernowne family= Arms of the Champernon/Champernowne family: Gules, a saltire vair between twelve billets or. A 13th-century effigy, originally cross-legged, believed to be the crusading knight Sir William de Champernon, now situated against east wall of north aisle, Atherington Church, removed circa 1820 from the Umberleigh Chapel. It is comparable to the 13th-century effigies in the Temple Church in London. differenced version of their maternal arms of Champernon (see below).Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.317 These ancient arms are shown in 19th-century stained glass in Atherington Church impaling the Champernowne arms. Heralds' Visitation of Warwickshire, 1619 (Wellington de Hurley): Gules, a saltire vair. The Dering Roll of Arms lists the arms of Rauf de Wiltone as Gules, a saltire vair. The Champernon family, sometimes Latinised Campo Arnulfi (\\"field of Arnulph\\") originated in the Cambernon area of Lower Normandy, and their arrival in England was associated with the Norman Conquest. Many members of the family later adopted alternate spellings such as Champernoun, Champernowne, and Chapman. The immediate line of descent from Jordan and Mabill de Champernon is unclear. According to Risdon, their sole heir was a daughter, Joan de Champernon (implying perhaps that her issue son adopted the name Champernon). However, Pole's account assigns two sons to Jordan and Mabill: Richard de Champernon, who died without issue, and Jordan de Champernon (II). At Umberleigh, William de Champernon, apparently a grandson of Jordan II, was by his wife Eva, the father of another Joan de Champernon (II), also a sole heiress. Joan II who lived during the reign of King Edward I (1272‚Äì1307)Pole, p.411, re Stoke Rivers, a manor also held by Joan de Champernon married Sir Ralph de Willington (II; see the following section) of Gloucestershire, but retained her maiden name, which she used in legal documents. For instance, an (undated) grant during her widowhood, confirmed by \\"Peter, Bishop of Exeter\\" (apparently Peter Quinel (reigned 1280‚Äì1291), gave land to Umberleigh Chapel.

Based in Concord, North Carolina, United States, ACN began operations in the United States in 1993. , the company reported that it operates in 27 countries. In 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Donald Trump and three of his children alleging fraud, false advertising, unfair competition, and a now-dismissed allegation of racketeering for their involvement with ACN. The lawsuit is ongoing as of April 2020.  Business model The company is based in Concord, North Carolina, United States. ACN has international offices located in Montreal, Canada; Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Sydney, Australia; Wroc≈Çaw, Poland; Ume√•, Sweden; Seoul, South Korea and Mexico. ACN's income disclosure statement bears the warning that \\"not all ACN independent representatives make a profit and no one can be guaranteed success as an ACN independent representative.\\"  History  In 1993, Robert Stevanovski, Greg Provenzano, and twin brothers Tony and Mike Cupisz, founded the American Communications Network, Inc. ACN opened for business in January 1993 with twenty initial \\"independent representatives\\". ACN's initial business was as a marketing arm for a long-distance reseller called LCI Communications. This relationship lasted for five years until LCI was acquired by Qwest Communications. By 1998, ACN was listed in Inc. Magazine's \\"Inc. 500\\" list as No. 22 in this annual list of the 500 fastest growing private companies in America. ACN operated as a gas and electricity retailer, through the subsidiaries ACN Energy and ACN Utility Services, prior to its energy assets being acquired by Commerce Energy Group in 2006. In 2008, ACN moved its headquarters from Farmington Hills, Michigan to Concord, North Carolina. In 2014, ACN expanded operations to Latin America, beginning first with Mexico. In 2016, ACN expanded operations in Japan. By 2019, ACN was operating in 26 countries and five continents. From 2006 until he announced his presidential candidacy in 2015, ACN had a business relationship with former The Apprentice executive producer Donald Trump. Trump spoke at ACN events, featured their products on an episode of The Apprentice, and took part in ACN promotional videos. Following the official beginning of his 2016 presidential candidacy, all references to Donald Trump were removed from the ACN website, and Trump distanced himself from the company in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \\"I know nothing about the company other than the people who run the company,\\" Trump told them. \\"I‚Äôm not familiar with what they do or how they go about doing it, and I make that clear in my speeches.\\"  Services  ACN offers landline telephone service (local and long distance), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), high-speed Internet, satellite television, cellular phone through the company's own mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), Flash Wireless, and home security services, primarily to consumers, and secondarily to small businesses. Beginning in 2011, ACN also began offering an ACN-branded international calling smartphone app available for iPhone, Android and Symbian, reselling WiMAX wireless Internet, and technical support service for personal and business computers, as well as getting back into the energy reselling market through partner XOOM Energy. With variations depending upon the country of operation, provision of ACN's services follows three models: #The reselling of ACN-branded services ultimately originating in an incumbent provider. This is exemplified by local and long-distance telephone, where ACN buys local telephone service from an incumbent provider such as Qwest or AT&T;, and bills customers in its own name. This model was made possible by telephone industry deregulation beginning in 1996; prior to this, ACN was involved solely in reselling long- distance telephone service. It was the expansion of deregulation internationally that made it possible for ACN to begin to operate outside the United States. #Acting as a sales agent for the service provider, where an ACN representative sells the service, but order fulfillment, billing, and servicing is performed by the branded provider. In the US, ACN resells Internet service through AT&T.; ACN offers wireless services through its own MVNO called Flash Wireless on Sprint and Verizon's networks. Television services are provided through DIRECTV and Dish Network. Home security and automation is offered through Vivint. ACN now also resells energy (electricity and natural gas) through Planet Energy and Xoom Energy. #The selling of ACN- branded and provided services. These are Voice over Internet Protocol in which ACN owns and maintains its own network of servers. Starting in January 2011, ACN has also added an ACN-branded computer technical support service to its service offerings.  Legal cases  On June 13, 2002, ACN settled a case with the Bureau of Consumer Services in Pennsylvania wherein it was alleged that IBOs were \\"slamming\\", or switching consumer services without authorization. ACN disputed the allegations and the exact details of the settlement are under court seal. However, the suit alleged that approximately 135 informal complaints were filed with the Bureau of Consumer Services (BCS) between June 2000 and November 2001, consisting of 22 consumers alleging that their generation service was switched without authorization (\\"slamming\\"), 81 alleged instances of overcharging (\\"cramming\\"), and 32 complaints with allegations of various violations of the commission's regulations contained in Chapter 54, 56, and 57 of Title 52 of the Pennsylvania Code. In August 2010, the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Monica Lindeen announced the issuance of a Cease and Desist Order and Notice of Proposed Agency Action against ACN, Inc. and several of its founders for allegedly operating a pyramid scheme. In September 2010, the Commissioner moved to vacate the Cease and Desist Order in full settlement of the case.Motion to Vacate Temporary Cease and Desist Order In the course of the Commissioner's investigation, the Commissioner determined that the actions giving rise to the initial concerns were not part of the ACN business model, but instead were isolated instances taking place by certain ACN's independent representatives in Montana. The Commissioner and ACN agreed that ACN would implement additional training with its independent representatives to assist them in better understanding their responsibilities as ACN independent representatives and that ACN would contact its Montana video phone customers to assist them with the installation of their service. In July 2019, a SDNY District Judge permitted state-level charges of fraud, false advertising, and unfair competition against Donald Trump and his children Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric related to their involvement with ACN. (The judge, however, dismissed racketeering (RICO) allegations against the family.) The Trumps are accused of not having disclosed that they were being paid by ACN when they recommended ACN as a good investment. As part of the discovery process, the Trumps were ordered in March 2020 to provide information from Trump Organization business records for 15 years back to 2005. The Trumps sought to take the case to private arbitration, but the SDNY District Judge denied their request on April 8, 2020. On May 18, 2020, the District Court ruled against ACN and Donald Trump's motion for a Stay in the case. Trump had sought a stay during his term as President of the United States.

He was one of the last masters who was called a Kensei (sword saint).  Curriculum and Characteristics  The curriculum of the ry≈´ha contains mainly kenjutsu, iaijutsu and naginatajutsu, but the main weapons used are the long and short swords (katana and wakizashi).(in English) Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ is a very intense duelling style which focuses on simple and fast techniques where no unnecessary movements are made. Controlling the enemy's centre line with the kiri-otoshi and dominating him with extremely fast tsuki-waza are the signature techniques of this ry≈´ha. The principles of this style are that a perfect technique should contain defence and offence in one action. Characteristic of the training is the use of onigote (heavily padded gloves) like in its ancestor styles Ono-ha Itt≈ç-ry≈´ and Nakanishi-ha Itt≈ç-ry≈´ which are used in several kumitachi-kata (two person practice).(in English) This kind of training became more and more obsolete towards the end of the Edo-period with the spread of gekiken and the use of bogu and shinai. Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ is also one of the remaining ry≈´ha which still practices kumitachi with bokuto (wood swords). The Habiki kata is practiced using habiki (real swords with the sharp edge removed).(in Japanese) Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ also has Iaijutsu (Hokushin-ry≈´ iai ÂåóËæ∞ÊµÅÂ±ÖÂêà). Now only some teachers know the techniques. Some techniques are depicted in old papers in the Kumamoto prefectural library (ÁÜäÊú¨ÁúåÁ´ãÂõ≥Êõ∏È§®). It is a very simple iaijutsu, with 4 kata for sitting (corresponding to an enemy in front or behind), 4 kata for standing (corresponding to an enemy in front or behind), and 3 kata for hiki-waza (stepping backwards). In Noda-Konishi's line, some kata have been added to Gogy≈ç-no-kata (‰∫îË°å„ÅÆÂΩ¢) and Batt≈çjutsu (ÊäúÂàÄË°ì). Gogy≈ç-no-kata has 5 kumitachi and 3 kodachigumi which looks very similar to Koshi-Gogy≈ç-no-kata (È´òÂ∏´‰∫îË°å„ÅÆÂΩ¢), which was Nakanishi-ha's kata revised by Takano Sasaburo (È´òÈáé‰Ωê‰∏âÈÉé) in 1908. In 1932, Noda Wasaburo (ÈáéÁî∞Âíå‰∏âÈÉé) and Kobayashi Sadayuki (Â∞èÊûóÂÆö‰πã) demonstrated 7 Kumitachi and 3 Kodachi-gumi as Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ at Kyoto-Butokuden (‰∫¨ÈÉΩÊ≠¶Âæ≥ÊÆø) (Refer to The program of 36th Butoku-sai great demonstration festival No.3 Á¨¨‰∏âÂçÅÂÖ≠ÂõûÊ≠¶Âæ≥Á•≠Â§ßÊºîÊ≠¶ÊúÉÊºîÊ≠¶Áï™ÁµÑ ÂÖ∂‰∏â). The number of kumitachi kata is 2 more than that in Gogy≈ç-no-kata. Batt≈çjutsu is not the Chiba family's Hokushin-ry≈´ iai. The katas' names and techniques were introduced by Konishi Shigejiro (refer to Kendo Nippon, Mar. 1978 12‚Äì15), but the techniques and the katas' names differ from the Edo-Meiji period's densho texts. For example, Unry≈´-ken (Èõ≤ÈæçÂâ£), Hien- gaeshi (È£õÁáïËøî) and Taih≈ç-ken (Â§ßÈµ¨Ââ£).  Famous swordsmen  Towards the end of the Bakumatsu period (1853-1867), the Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ was one of the three biggest and most famous ry≈´ha all over Japan. Swordsmen of the Hokushin Itt≈ç- ry≈´ had a strong influence on the development of modern kend≈ç in the late 19th century. Also many famous and politically influential people were masters of this swordsmanship school. Some of the most prominent figures are: * Sakamoto Ry≈çma ÂùÇÊú¨ÈæçÈ¶¨ (Famous revolutionary) * It≈ç Kashitar≈ç ‰ºäËó§Áî≤Â≠êÂ§™ÈÉé (Military advisor of the Shinsengumi) * Yamaoka Tessh≈´ Â±±Â≤°ÈâÑËàü (Founder of the Itt≈ç Sh≈çden Mut≈ç-ry≈´) * Chiba Sana ÂçÉËëâ„Åï„Å™ (Daughter of the 1st Chiba-D≈çj≈ç headmaster, also known as Chiba Sanako) * Yamanami KeisukeÂ±±ÂçóÊï¨‰ªã (Vice commander of the Shinsengumi) * T≈çd≈ç Heisuke Ëó§Â†ÇÂπ≥Âä© (Captain of the 8th squad of the Shinsengumi) * Kiyokawa Hachir≈ç Ê∏ÖÊ≤≥ÂÖ´ÈÉé (Founder of the Kiyokawa-school and Roshigumi) * Yoshimura Kanichir≈ç ÂêâÊùëË≤´‰∏ÄÈÉé (Kenjutsu instructor of the Shinsengumi) * Negishi Shorei Ê†πÂ≤∏ÊùæÈΩ¢ (13th S≈çke of the Annaka-han Araki-ry≈´ and founder of the Negishi-ry≈´ (Shurikenjutsu)) * Okada Sadagoro Â≤°Áî∞ÂÆö‰∫îÈÉé (Famous swordsman of the Bakumatsu and Meiji period and 14th S≈çke of the Annaka-han Araki-ry≈´) * Nait≈ç Takaharu ÂÜÖËó§È´òÊ≤ª (A key developer of modern kendo) * Takano Sasaburo È´òÈáé‰Ωê‰∏âÈÉé (A key developer of modern kendo) * Monna Tadashi ÈñÄÂ•àÊ≠£ (A key developer of modern kendo) * Mochida Moriji ÊåÅÁî∞Áõõ‰∫å (One of the most famous kendoka of the 20th century) * Hoshino Amachi ÊòüÈáéÂ§©Áü• (Novelist, scientist, also Yagy≈´ Shingan-ry≈´ shihan) * Sakurada Sakuramaro Ê´ªÁî∞Ê´ªÈ∫ø (Master of Ono-ha Itt≈ç-ry≈´, Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´, founder of Chuwa-Itt≈ç-ry≈´ ‰∏≠Âíå‰∏ÄÂàÄÊµÅ) * Suzuki Naonoshin Èà¥Êú®Áõ¥‰πãÈÄ≤ (Master of Yagy≈´ Shingan-ry≈´, Ono-ha Itt≈ç-ry≈´, Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´, and founder of Tenshin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ Â§©Ëæ∞‰∏ÄÂàÄÊµÅ)  Ranking System  The Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ has three teaching steps: *Shoden Âàù‰ºù (entry-transmission) *Ch≈´den ‰∏≠‰ºù (middle-transmission) *Okuden Â••‰ºù (inner- transmission) Like many other kory≈´, Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ traditionally awards makimono-scrolls and/or inka-j≈ç. There is no modern dan/ky≈´ system in this school. The traditional five scrolls of Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ are: #Kirigami Ââ™Á¥ô #Hatsumokuroku ÂàùÁõÆÈå≤ #Kaj≈çmokuroku / Seigandenju ÁÆáÊù°ÁõÆÈå≤ / ÊòüÁúº‰ºùÊéà #Ch≈´mokuroku / Menkyo ‰∏≠ÁõÆÈå≤ / ÂÖçË®± (full transmission of all techniques) #Daimokuroku / Menkyo- Kaiden Â§ßÁõÆÈå≤ / ÂÖçË®±ÁöÜ‰ºù (full transmission of the ry≈´ha) The so-called Naginata Mokuroku Èï∑ÂàÄÁõÆÈå≤ also exists and is normally issued together with the Menkyo (Ch≈´mokuroku). It certifies the mastery of all naginatajutsu techniques of the school. Some names of the naginata kata are the same as those in the Hokushin Mus≈ç-ry≈´ (ÂåóËæ∞Â§¢ÊÉ≥ÊµÅ) densho (‰ºùÊõ∏). In Tottori-han (È≥•ÂèñËó©), the Sadakichi line (ÂÆöÂêâÁ≥ª) also awards Hon-mokuroku (Êú¨ÁõÆÈå≤) like Ono-ha Itt≈ç-ry≈´ (the Sadakichi line's densho collected in Tottori prefectural museum (È≥•ÂèñÁúåÁ´ãÂçöÁâ©È§®) ). However, the Shusaku line (Âë®‰ΩúÁ≥ª) has only three Mokuroku, which are the Hatsu-Mokuroku (ÂàùÁõÆÈå≤), the Chu-Mokuroku-Menkyo (‰∏≠ÁõÆÈå≤ÂÖçË®±) and the Dai-Mokuroku-Kaiden (Â§ßÁõÆÈå≤ÁöÜ‰ºù), written in \\"Kenpo Hiketsu\\" by Chiba Shusaku (ÂçÉËëâÂë®‰Ωú„ÄåÂâ£Ê≥ïÁßòË®£„Äç). During the Bakumatsu period, Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ was very popular due to the decreased number of mokuroku to 3 from 8, the Ono-ha Itt≈ç-ry≈´'s pass number. In all Bujutsu ry≈´ha, students have to pay money or send gifts to the instructor when issued with a mokuroku, therefore Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ was a more accessible ry≈´ha for poor farmers and bushi. Also, a part of the students joined in the coup of the Edo Bakufu with other new ry≈´ha students, such as those from Shinto Munen-ry≈´).  Lineage  = Old main lines = The two main lines were that of the founder Chiba Shusaku Narimasa at the Edo-Genbukan, and that of the founder's younger brother Chiba Sadakichi Masamichi at the Chiba-D≈çj≈ç. Towards the end of the Meiji period, the line of the Edo-Genbukan became extinct. The Chiba-D≈çj≈ç line, unlike that of the Edo-Genbukan has survived until today.

The teaching-line of the Edo-Genbukan disappeared soon after the D≈çj≈ç was closed at the end of the Meiji period. The Chiba-D≈çj≈ç was also closed at the beginning of the Taisho period. The Chiba family, which did not practice the school but owned the family documents has survived until today. The 5th generation head of the family, Chiba Hiroshi, did not practice or train in the school, nor was there anyone actively practicing under him. Therefore he renounced his family's claims and documents to ≈åtsuka Y≈çichir≈ç Masanori, the 6th S≈çke who trained under Konishi Shigejir≈ç of the Noda-ha Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´. ≈åtsuka recreated the Chiba-line in 2013, and was then succeeded by a German citizen named Markus L√∂sch, who later changed his name to ≈åtsuka Ry≈´nosuke when he became Menkyo-Kaiden in 2014. He later was appointed the 7th S≈çke in March 2016. = Regional Lines = At the middle of the Meiji-period there were many side branches, founded by pupils of the two main lines. One of the most famous was the Tobukan in Mito. It was established by Kozawa Torakichi, a student of the Edo-Genbukan. Kozawa Torakichi was also an instructor at the Kodokan (ÂºòÈÅìÈ§®), the official clan school of the Mito-clan. After the Meiji- restoration and the abolishment of the traditional clan system the Kodokan was closed, so in order to continue teaching, Kozawa Torakichi opened his own D≈çj≈ç, the Tobukan. There he taught Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ together with Shin Tamiya-ry≈´ (Êñ∞Áî∞ÂÆÆÊµÅÊäúÂàÄË°ì) and Suifu-ry≈´ (Ê∞¥Â∫úÊµÅÂâ£Ë°ì) (Torakichi's second son Kozawa Jiro Atsunobu (Â∞èÊæ§‰∫åÈÉéÁØ§‰ø°) inherited Suifu-ry≈´ kenjutsu from his own other D≈çj≈ç). This Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ line is also the line of the school which is a member of the Nihon Kobudo Kyokai.

The distance is officially listed as about 5500 metres because many sections of the race are run in open paddocks with little or no fences. The race is the longest horse race run in Australia on a public course. There are 33 obstacles, more than any other steeplechase in the world. Horse run clockwise and counter-clockwise at various points of the race and features a section in open paddocks. When re-entering the racetrack itself horses turn left on the first lap and right on the second. This has created problems on many occasions when horses have tried to veer left rather than right second time around. Knowledge of the course and stamina are vital to the chances of horse and rider. With the Great Eastern Steeplechase and VRC Grand National it is considered to be one of the top three Australian steeplechase races. The Grand Annual was first run in 1872. It was known as the Warrnambool Handicap Steeple until 1877, the Grand National Steeple from 1878 until 1881, the Warrnambool Handicap Steeple again until 1894, and the Grand Annual Steeple since 1895. The 2009 event was the 132nd running (the race was not held between 1942 and 1946 and was abandoned in 1971). The winner Sir Pentire, is notable for not having raced for two years and two days prior to contesting this event. The race record is held by Hoki (1996) at 6min 38.4 sec.

Its programming can also be heard on FM translator W243EM, 96.5 MHz. History WBNR signed on in 1959 as a 1,000 watt directional antenna daytime only station built, engineered, owned and operated by Robert Gessner and brothers Sy and Al Dresner The original studio location is in close proximity to Denning's Point, a location on the Hudson River that has an archaeological record going back 5,000 years. Many staffers and former staffers felt that this explained a usually high reported incidence of paranormal activity in the studio building. It was not until 1987 that WBNR was licensed for 480 watts night time operation with a DA2 antenna pattern. For many years it was owned by brothers Robert and Al Lessnor of Candid Camera fame. The station served the community with Middle of the Road (MOR) music format, local news and sports. It was heavily involved with Beacon community events and was the flagship station for Army Football until 2003.

In 1815 it was consolidated with the 6th, 16th, 22nd, and 32nd Regiments of Infantry into what is at present the 2nd Infantry Regiment.Lt. Thompson, J.K The Twenty Third Regiment of Infantry in The Army of the United States, Historical Sketches of Staff and Line With Portraits of Generals-In-Chief. BG Theo F Rodenbough and Maj William S Haskin Ed. by 1896 p. 692 The modern 23rd Infantry regiment was formed during the American Civil War; the regiment saw action in American wars up to the US War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War. It included a battalion of volunteers made up of active and reserve French military personnel who had been sent to the Korean Peninsula as part of the United Nations force fighting in the Korean War. Korean War =Battle of Chipyong-ni (13-15 February 1951)= Chipyong-ni was defended because the commanding general of Eighth Army (Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway) decided to make a stand there against the Chinese Communists. U.S. Army In Action DA Poster 21-47 Breakthrough at Chipyong-Ni In the chronology of Korean battles, the fighting for Chipyong-ni followed the withdrawal from northern Korea at the end of 1950, a brief Eighth Army offensive that began on 5 February 1951, and a full-scale Chinese counteroffensive that struck a week later. The 23rd Regimental Combat Team made the decisive defense of Chipyong-ni on 13‚Äì14 February 1951. This action followed the patrol ambush and the subsequent Battle of the Twin Tunnels area some high ground three miles southeast of Chipyong-ni. After the Twin Tunnels operation, the 23rd Infantry Regiment (2nd Infantry Division) proceeded on the afternoon of 3 February to the town of Chipyong-ni and set up a perimeter defense. Chipyong-ni was a small crossroads town half a mile long and several blocks wide, situated on a single-track railroad. Besides the railway station there were several other brick or frame buildings in the center of the town, but most of the buildings were constructed of the usual mud, sticks, and straw. At least half of them were already reduced to rubble as the result of previous fighting in the town. Encircling Chipyong-ni were eight prominent hills that rose to an average height of 850 feet above the rice paddies and buildings in the valley. These hills provided excellent defensive positions, but to have occupied them would have stretched the front-line defensive positions along 12 miles of ridgelines and formed a perimeter with a 3 to 4-mile diameter. Instead, the regimental commander (Colonel Paul L. Freeman), stationed his infantrymen on lower ground around a tight perimeter about a mile in diameter. On three sides of the town the line followed small hills; on the northwest section the infantrymen dug their holes across a half-mile strip of rice paddies. During the ten days after going into position at Chipyong-ni, Col. Freeman's regiment dug in and strengthened its positions. The 37th Field Artillery Battalion (attached to the regiment), arrived on 5 February. Battery B, 82nd Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion, joined the regiment, adding six M16 and four M19 flakwagons to the defense of the town. Several days later Battery B, 503rd Field Artillery Battalion (a 155-mm howitzer unit), was attached to reinforce the 37th Field Artillery Battalion. The infantry companies dug in their machine guns, registered their mortars, laid antipersonnel mines, and operated daily patrols to the encompassing high ground. The regimental Heavy-Mortar Company divided the fire of its platoons and sections among the sectors of the perimeter, the artillery registered on all probable avenues of enemy approach and all units established good communication lines. There was time to coordinate the infantry, artillery and air support into an effective combat team. Company G The following narrative describes the fighting for Chipyong-ni that occurred in that sector of the 2nd Battalion's perimeter defended by Company G, 23rd Infantry. The howitzers of Battery B, 503rd Field Artillery Battalion, were in position at the bottom of Company G's hill so that the artillerymen were drawn into the same battle. The commander of the 2nd Battalion (Lt.Col. James W. Edwards) placed all three of his rifle companies on the front line to cover the sector assigned to his battalion. This was the southern rim of the perimeter. Within the companies, two company commanders committed their three rifle platoons. The other company (F), to which Col. Edwards assigned the center and smallest sector, manned its part of the line with only two platoons, leaving its support platoon as the battalion reserve. The narrow supply road leading southwest from Chipyong-ni went under the railroad on the southern edge of the town and then, within a third of a mile, passed two embankments of red clay where the road cut through the two ends of a U-shaped hill. Company G started at the second of these two road cuts and extended left (east) along the southern side of the U. It was not much of a hill, only a couple of contour lines on the map. Infantrymen could climb the smooth hump of earth in a few minutes. The 1st Platoon of Company G held the right end of the hill next to the road cut. The 3rd Platoon had the center position (the highest part of the hill) and extended its line left to the bend of the U. The 2nd Platoon was down in the rice paddies between the 3rd Platoon and Company F. Men from the two platoons on the hill dug their holes just over the top of the forward slope. The positions restricted the fields of fire somewhat but provided good observation, especially for the 3rd Platoon, which could see all areas to the south except for a dead spot in a dry creek bed just in front of its right flank. There were two other significant features near the 3d Platoon's area. At the foot of the hill and just beyond the dry creek bed was a cluster of 15 or 20 buildings that made up the village of Masan. The second feature was a narrow spur of ground that formed a link between the 3rd Platoon's hill and a large hill mass to the south. The 2nd Platoon in the rice paddies lacked satisfactory observation but had good fields of fire across the flat land to its immediate front. In addition to its own Weapons Platoon, Company G's supporting weapons included a section of 75-mm recoilless rifles, a section of heavy machine guns from Company H, and a platoon of 81-mm mortars under command of Lt. James Whitaker which was dug in near the edge of the town and had a forward observer (Lt.Whitaker) stationed with Company G. There were also forward observers from the regimental Heavy-Mortar Company and from the 37th Field Artillery Battalion with Company G. During the daytime men from the 75-mm recoilless rifle section manned their weapons, but at night they replaced them with two .50 caliber machine guns to prevent having their positions disclosed by the back-blasts of the recoilless rifles. The Ammunition and Pioneer Platoon set up two fougasses (drums of napalm), the first on the road just south of the road cut, the second in the rice paddies in front of the 2nd Platoon. The 1st Platoon, which was next to the road, also strung barbed-wire across the road and in front of its position. There was not enough wire available to reach across the company front. Colonel Edwards supervised the siting of all weapons, and the digging of the holes which he insisted be of the standing type and deep enough for good cover. When Battery B, 503rd Field Artillery Battalion, arrived, its 155-mm howitzers went into position in the small bowl formed by the U-shaped ridge of which Company G occupied one side. The howitzers were laid by platoon to support the east, north and west sectors of the regimental perimeter. To the rear of the howitzers, the artillerymen set up a tent for the fire direction center (FDC) personnel. Behind that, near the bottom of Company G's hill, were several other tents for the mess and supply sections. A liaison officer from the 37th Field Artillery Battalion to Battery B (Captain John A. Elledge), and the commander of Company G (Lieutenant Thomas Heath) worked out a plan for the joint defense of the sector. This plan provided for the use of the artillery's machine guns in the front line and, if necessary, the use of some artillerymen as riflemen while skeleton crews manned the howitzers. The two officers also set up an infantry-artillery machine-gun post in the road cut with a six-man crew to operate two weapons, one .50 caliber and one .30 caliber. This road cut was also the dividing line between Col. Edwards's 2nd Battalion sector and that of the French battalion (a regular battalion of the 23rd Infantry). Offensive and counter-offensive While the 23rd RCT built up its defenses, an Eighth Army general offensive got under way on 5 February with X Corps, in the center of the line, attacking to make a double envelopment of the town of Hongch'on, an important enemy build-up area. The attack moved slowly until the night of 11 February, when the Chinese launched a full-scale counteroffensive with two columns driving south, aimed at the towns of Hoengseong and Wonju in X Corps' sector. The vigorous enemy attack drove through two ROK divisions and turned the United Nations' attack into a withdrawal that rolled the front lines south between 5 and 20 miles. Before the Chinese attack, the front lines of X Corps were well ahead of Col. Freeman's Chipyong-ni perimeter, but as the units went south, sometimes fighting through enemy roadblocks, Chipyong-ni became a conspicuous bulge on the left of the corps' line. Eventually the bulge was cut off from X Corps and the 23rd was completely surrounded. Day 1 of the battle At the 23rd Infantry's perimeter, the usual patrols for the daylight hours of 13 February reported increased enemy activity crowding close to Chipyong-ni on three sides, north, east and west. The Air Force observation plane operating with the RCT reported enemy groups moving toward the perimeter from the north and east. Observers called for artillery fire against those enemy columns within reach, while the tactical air control party directed forty flights of aircraft against other enemy groups beyond artillery range. Beginning about 22:00, the Chinese launched a series of probes and attacks designed to locate and drive the 23rd Infantry out of their defensive positions. These ceased shortly after sunrise due to the threat of American air control. Day 2 of the battle The Americans were low on ammunition by the second day in addition to having suffered about 100 casualties. Air support kept the Chinese from attacking during daylight hours on the 14th. At dusk the Chinese resumed their artillery attack followed shortly afterward by ground attacks. A fierce prolonged battle ensued with the forces on the south side being forced out of position. The battle on the south side continued all day on the 15th even in the face of American close air support. The Chinese were determined to destroy the 23rd to allow them to continue to force the X Corps south. Late in the afternoon, the Chinese were forced back outside of the defensive positions. Elements of the 5th Cavalry Regiment (Task Force Crombez) with tank support arrived as the fight was ending with the Chinese withdrawing. Aftermath The Chinese failure to eliminate the 23rd at Chipyong-ni effectively ended the Chinese effort to drive the American forces into the sea. UN casualties were 51 killed, 250 wounded, and 42 missing. The Chinese had lost about 2,000 killed and suffered about 3,000 wounded. The effect on the Eighth Army was tremendous. Shortly afterward the UN launched Operation Killer and then Operation Ripper which forced the Chinese back to the north. The result was the start of peace negotiations in July 1951. =Heartbreak Ridge (13 September - 15 October 1951)= After withdrawing from Bloody Ridge, the Korean People's Army (KPA) set up new positions just 1,500 yards (1,400 m) away on a seven-mile (11 km) long hill mass. If anything, the Communist defenses were even more formidable here than on Bloody Ridge. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division's acting commander, Brigadier General Thomas de Shazo and his immediate superior, Major General Clovis E. Byers, the X Corps commander, seriously underestimated the strength of the North Korean position. They ordered a single infantry regiment‚Äîthe 23rd‚Äîand its attached French battalion to make what would prove to be an ill- conceived assault straight up Heartbreak's heavily fortified slopes. All three of the 2nd Division's infantry regiments participated, with the brunt of the combat borne by the 23rd and 9th Infantry Regiments, along with the attached French battalion. The attack began on 13 September and quickly deteriorated into a familiar pattern. First, American aircraft, tanks and artillery would pummel the ridge for hours, turning the already barren hillside into a cratered moonscape. Next, the 23rd's infantrymen would clamber up the mountain's rocky slopes, taking out one enemy bunker after another by direct assault. Those who survived to reach the crest arrived exhausted and low on ammunition. The North Koreans counterattacked repeatedly. Many of these counterattacks were conducted at night by fresh troops that the North Koreans were able to bring up in the shelter of neighboring hills. The battle progressed for two weeks. Because of the constricting terrain and the narrow confines of the objectives, units were committed piecemeal to the fray, one platoon, company, or battalion at a time. Once a particular element had been so ground-up that it could no longer stand the strain, a fresh unit would take its place, until the 23rd Infantry as a whole was fairly well shattered. The fighting was savage and the ridgeline (called Heartbreak by the American infantrymen) changed hands many times in an exhausting series of attacks and counterattacks. Several units up to company size (100-200 men) were wiped out. The Americans employed massive artillery barrages, airstrikes and tanks in an attempt to drive the North Koreans off the ridge, but the KPA proved extremely hard to dislodge. Finally, on 27 September, the 2nd Division's new commander, Major General Robert N. Young, called a halt to the \\"fiasco\\" on Heartbreak Ridge as American planners reconsidered their strategy. As long as the North Koreans could continue to reinforce and resupply their garrison on the ridge, it would be nearly impossible for the Americans to take and hold the mountain. After belatedly recognizing this fact, the 2nd Division crafted a new plan that called for a full divisional assault on the valleys and hills adjacent to Heartbreak Ridge to cut the position off from further reinforcement. Spearheading this new offensive was the division's 72nd Tank Battalion, whose mission was to push up the Mundung-ni Valley west of Heartbreak Ridge, destroying enemy supply dumps in the vicinity of the town of Mundung-ni. It was a bold plan, but one that could not be accomplished until a way had been found to get the 72nd's M4A3E8 Sherman tanks into the valley. The only existing road was little more than a track that could not bear the weight of the Shermans. Moreover, it was heavily mined and blocked by a six-foot (2 m) high rock barrier built by the North Koreans. The 2nd Division's 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion braved enemy fire to clear this obstacle and build an improved roadway. While they worked, the division's three infantry regiments‚Äî9th, 38th and 23rd‚Äîlaunched coordinated assaults on Heartbreak Ridge and the adjacent hills. On 10 October the sudden onslaught of a battalion of tanks racing up the valley took the enemy by surprise. By coincidence, the thrust came just when the Chinese 204th Division was moving up to relieve the North Koreans on Heartbreak Ridge. Caught in the open, the Chinese division suffered heavy casualties from the American tanks. For the next five days the Shermans roared up and down the Mundung-ni Valley, over-running supply dumps, mauling troop concentrations and destroying approximately 350 bunkers on Heartbreak Ridge and in the surrounding hills and valleys. A smaller tank- infantry team scoured the Sat'ae-ri Valley east of the ridge, thereby completing the encirclement and eliminating any hope of reinforcement for the North Koreans on Heartbreak. The armored thrusts turned the tide of the battle, but hard fighting remained for the infantry before French soldiers captured the last communist bastion on the ridge on 13 October. After 30 days of combat, the Americans and French eventually secured Heartbreak Ridge. Both sides suffered high casualties: over 3,700 American and French and an estimated 25,000 North Korean and Chinese. The U.N. and U.S. command, which decided that battles like Heartbreak Ridge were not worth the high cost in blood for the relatively small amount of terrain captured. For this reason, Heartbreak Ridge was the last major offensive conducted by U.N. forces in the war. Sporadic battles along the line of contact between U.N. and communist forces continued to be fought until the armistice was signed in July 1953, but they were usually initiated by the North Koreans or Chinese. Re-designation of 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment The unit derived from the 4th Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 1st Armored Division, which served in Mannheim, Germany until the unit was sent, along with the rest of the brigade, to Fort Lewis, Washington, in the summer of 1994. That fall, the battalion was reflagged as the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. Vietnam service Stryker Battalion The 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry was reactivated on 16 March 2004 at Fort Richardson, Alaska. The battalion was organized as a Stryker battalion and assigned to the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Stryker) and deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) from August 2005 to December 2006 for sixteen months. The battalion was inactivated on 15 December 2006 and reactivated on 16 April 2007 as a Stryker infantry battalion at Fort Lewis, Washington and assigned to the 4th Brigade Combat Team (Stryker), 2nd Infantry Division. Operation Iraqi Freedom  In October 2003, as a part of 3-2 SBCT 1st Bn 23rd Infantry deployed from Fort Lewis to Kuwait and then to Iraq as part Operation Iraqi Freedom in the First Stryker Brigade. 1-23IN Deployed to FOB Pacesetter after one month of training in Kuwait. The Battalion moved via ground to FOB Pacesetter under 4th Infantry Division where they conducted operations in Ad Deluiyah. On 8 December B Co 1-23IN lost SPC Blickenstaff, SPC Wesley and SSG Bridges in a vehicle rollover on their first mission. The unit continued operations through the month of December as part of Operation Ivy Blizzard. The Tomahawk Battalion then moved to Mosul, Iraq where the battalion conducted a relief in place with units from the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). 1-23IN occupied combat outpost on the western side of the Tigris River and conducted numerous combat operations to attempt to remove the insurgent threat in the Nineveh Province. The Battalion conducted numerous raids, traffic control points and neighborhood engagements to remove insurgents from the city. All the while having the units history being chronicled by Colby Buzzell. Most notably the attack on 4 August 2004. Where the entire battalion repelled and attack from a large coordinated citywide attack from insurgents. Operation Enduring Freedom =Deployment and elections= Starting on 9 July 2009, 5-2 SBCT deployed from Fort Lewis, Washington to Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. After completing equipment preparation and troop-leading procedures, the battalion conducted a tactical road march to FOB (Forward Operating Base) Wolverine in Zabul Province on 5‚Äì6 August. Company A moved south of the Sur Ghar Mountains to FOB Sweeney, an outpost that was occupied by a USSF ODA and Afghan National Army Soldiers. They quickly settled into the area around the village of Shinkay and began counter-insurgency (COIN) operations. The next element to move out from Wolverine was Company C, which conducted a road march through Qalat to Shajoy, the second largest city in Zabul Province. Here they began the establishment of a company combat outpost that would be known as \\"Sangar\\", as well as the inception of COIN operations designed to provide security to the populace. Company B remained at FOB Wolverine with the battalion headquarters, and began conducting operations in Surri, a subdistrict of Shinkay. Upon their arrival into sector, the battalion partnered with the Afghan National Army and Police Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and prepared for the Afghan National Election. Battalion personnel provided security at several polling stations in Zabul Province in order to ensure that the election was free and fair. The voting occurred without incident, much to the credit of the Soldiers and ANSF who worked to ensure that the Taliban could not intimidate voters. There was limited enemy contact throughout Ramadan, with the exception of Company C, who experienced a suicide attack in the Shajoy Bazaar which wounded 15 US soldiers and one interpreter. The first battalion mission planned was Operation 'Longview', which encompassed multiple clearing operations in Zabul Province; it was aimed at keeping the enemy from establishing a firm foothold in several key locations. Once Ramadan ended, the enemy became more aggressive, especially in Surri. Company B met the enemy several times in \\"the football\\", the area between Route Duck and Route Bull, this incident included the second in command of Taliban fighters in Zabul Province, Mohammad Khan. Khan set an ambush near the village of Mado, but was wounded in the fight and forced to flee. Intelligence reports later confirmed that Mohammad Khan had been killed in the engagement. The Taliban sought vengeance for their loss, and stepped up their attacks on coalition forces. On 24 September, members of Company B initiated a pressure plate improvised explosive device (IED) near the town of Omar Zai, killing three US soldiers and wounding three others. This incident led the battalion to adopt a more enemy-focused mission, and was the impetus behind Operation 'Laconia', the clearing of Omar Zai, Gazak Kalay, Bowlan Kalay, Patukheyl Kalay and Melizay Kalay. This operation, partnered with the ANA, led to the discovery of two IED caches and the disruption of the IED cell operating southwest of FOB Wolverine. In October, as part of Operation 'Longview', Company A conducted Operation 'Treadstone': a partnered clearing of the Rowghani, Band Kalay, and Karim Khel areas north of Shinkay. Company C conducted Operation 'Chinehs': a battalion minus clearing of the Chinehs area north of Shajoy, known as the home of the shadow governor of Zabul. This mission yielded several IED caches, as well as the discovery of a madrassa where young men were trained to be suicide bombers. In November, 4th Battalion's (4-23 IN's) sister battalion, its Battalion, 17th Infantry (1-17 IN), suffered the loss of seven soldiers in an IED strike in the Arghandab River Valley in Kandahar Province. This incident led to the brigade minus mission Operation 'Focus Hold', where B Company, 4ht Battalion (B/4-23) was ordered to move from FOB Wolverine to COP Jelawar in the southern Arghandab in order to assist 1-17 IN. Company C continued building COP \\"Sangar\\" and conducting patrols in Shajoy, until 19 November when a VBIED (car bomb), struck the joint ECP of COP \\"Sangar\\" and FOB Bullard, killing two paratroopers from the 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry (1-508th PIR). This led to the reestablishment of Operation 'Las Cruces': the tightened control of Shajoy City that occurred between 20‚Äì24 November, as well as the arrival of engineers and materials for the improvement of force protection on the COP. While 4-23 IN soldiers ate Thanksgiving dinner at their bases, RC South was preparing a FRAGO for 5/2 SBCT. On 6 December, the brigade received a change of mission to stop COIN operations and focus on securing freedom of movement on the highways of southern Afghanistan. As part of this, 4-23 IN was to move out of Zabul Province and occupy bases in Helmand Province, in order to provide security on Highways 1 and 601. The battalion commander gave the order to consolidate all units at FOB Wolverine and prepare for movement. Company A was the first element to leave Zabul, moving into FOB Ramrod in the Maiwand District of Kandahar Province, alongside 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry (2-1 IN). Personnel began the area assessments of their new AO along HWY 601 from Durai Junction to Lashkar Gah. Company B was released from 1-17 IN on 28 December and moved to FOB Tombstone, from which they would begin operations along Highway 1 west of the city of Gereshk. The battalion headquarters and Company C were last to move, occupying FOB Price, a joint Danish, British and American base outside the city of Gereshk, in Helmand Province. The expansion of FOB Price required a large scale logistical move of building materials and life support equipment in order to establish the operations center, motor pool, ANA training academy, living areas, and security towers. FOB Price eventually grew to over twice its original size. Company C picked up its sector, responsible for Highway 1 between Gereshk and Durai Junction. Headquarters Company, which had previously owned battle space in Zabul, instead supervised the creation of the Mohawk Academy, which began the training of ANA soldiers in basic skills such as first aid and marksmanship. =Helmand Province= Upon arriving in Helmand Province, the battalion, partnered with 6/4/205 ANA and the Lashkar Gah ANP, executed Operation 'Helmand Sunrise', which focused on securing the highways by means of traffic control points, culvert denial emplacement, persistent surveillance, and training of the ANA and ANP along HWY 1 and HWY 601. During January, the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade and RC South planned Operation Moshtarak, the clearing of the known Taliban stronghold in central Helmand Province known as Marjeh. 4-23 IN was chosen to participate in this operation. The battalion leadership met Marine commanders at FOB Dwyer as early as 20 January to plan for the clearing of Marjeh, specifically focusing on the battalion's role in clearing the Badula Qulp area along the Trekh Zabur Canal, which would be known as Operation 'Helmand Spider'. 5/2 SBCT would attach A/1-17 IN to 4-23 IN for the operation, while B/1-17 IN would occupy FOB Tombstone and pick up operations in the B/4-23 IN sector while they were participating in Operation 'Moshtarak', as a continued presence on the highways was deemed critical to mission success. Operation 'Helmand Spider' began on 8 February and lasted for 26 days. Task Force Mohawk, partnered with 1/1/205 ANA, cleared south along the Trekh Zabur Canal, conducting a link up with 3/6 Marines at the \\"5 points\\" intersection in southern Nad-e Ali District. Following this, A/1-17 IN and B/4-23 IN pushed west into northern Marjeh to conduct disruption operations, while the Reconnaissance Platoon conducted screening along the northern corridor in order to prevent the infiltration of Taliban reinforcements. Task Force Mohawk continued operations until 6 March, when they were relieved by elements of 3/6 Marines. In the month long operation, the task force had 15 enemy KIA, 9 enemy WIA, 23 IEDs found and cleared, 8 IED strikes, and 497 individuals enrolled in biometric systems. 4-23 IN and its supporting elements were recommended by Task Force Leatherneck for a Presidential Unit Citation for their actions in Marjeh. During February, several smaller company operations were conducted along HWY 601 and in the Yakhchal valley. Company A conducted Operation '601 Cougar', clearing north through Gavban in the southern Yakhchal, which yielded a great amount of intelligence about the enemy in the area. Company C conducted missions in Mohammad Karim Kalay, as well as Yakhchal, in order to disrupt enemy forces influencing HWY 1. Throughout the remainder of the deployment, 4-23 IN continued to provide freedom of movement along the highways, while simultaneously planning to hand over their vehicles and equipment to the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment and hand over the Helmand battlespace to the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade and the Danish battlegroup. The final battalion operation was the move back to Zabul Province in order to set up operations for the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment to assume responsibility. =Return to U.S.= 4-23 Infantry returned to Fort Lewis in July 2010 following its 12-month deployment. The battalion was part of the first Stryker unit to deploy to Afghanistan. 4-23 Infantry was the only Stryker battalion operating in the remote, mountainous terrain of Zabul Province, which required greater logistical coordination, maintenance, and care of equipment than any other unit. The battalion was the only infantry unit in Afghanistan to be tasked to move across two provinces and set up operations in an entirely new area. 4-23 Infantry was the only U.S. Army unit to take part in Operation 'Moshtarak', the largest offensive operation in Afghanistan since the war began in 2001. 4-23 Infantry was also the only U.S. Army infantry battalion operating in the volatile Helmand Province. 4-23 Infantry as part of 5th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division was the second U.S. Army brigade to deploy with the Landwarrior system. =Afghanistan 2012 Deployment= 4-23 Infantry deployed in April 2012 under the reflagged 2nd Stryker Brigade, known as the Lancers, 2nd Infantry Division to the Maiwand and Zharai District and returned to Joint Base Lewis-McChord in January 2013. 1-23 Infantry deployed in March 2012, 3rd Stryker brigade combat team, to Panjwai district, Kandahar province, Afghanistan. The Taliban proclaimed Panjwai as the birthplace of the Taliban movement in the early 1990s. 1-64 Armor deployed and was attached to 1-23 Infantry throughout their deployment.

The first edition was published in 1936 by John Lane, The Bodley Head Ltd, London, and has since been through more than 12 editions and translated into more than 30 languages. It has 68 chapters over 672 pages and is published by Penguin Books India. Publication Besides the postscript and a few small changes, Nehru wrote the biography between June 1934 and February 1935, and while entirely in prison. The first edition was published in 1936 and has since been through more than 12 editions and translated into more than 30 languages. An additional chapter titled 'Five years later', was included in a reprint in 1942 and these early editions were published by John Lane, The Bodley Head Ltd, London. The 2004 edition was published by Penguin Books India, with Sonia Gandhi holding the copyright. She also wrote the foreword to this edition, in which she encourages the reader to combine its content with Nehru's other works, Glimpses of World History and The Discovery of India, in order to understand \\"the ideas and personalities that have shaped India through the ages\\". Content Nehru clarifies his aims and objectives in the preface to the first edition, as to occupy his time constructively, review past events in India and to begin the job of \\"self-questioning\\" in what is his \\"personal account\\". He states \\"my object was...primarily for my own benefit, to trace my own mental growth\\" He did not target any particular audience but wrote \\"if I thought of an audience, it was one of my own countrymen and countrywomen. For foreign readers I would have probably written differently\\". The book includes 68 chapters, with the first titled 'Descent from Kashmir'. Nehru begins with explaining his ancestors migration to Delhi from Kashmir in 1716 and the subsequent settling of his family in Agra after the revolt of 1857.Tharoor, Shashi (2008). Nehru: The Invention of India. Arcade Publishing, Mumbai. Chapter four is devoted to \\"Harrow and Cambridge\\" and the English influence on Nehru. Written during the long illness of his wife, Kamala, Nehru's autobiography is closely centred around his marriage. In the book, he describes nationalism as \\"essentially an anti-feeling, and it feeds and fattens on hatred against other national groups, and especially against the foreign rulers of a subject country\\". He is self-critical and writes ‚ÄúI have become a queer mixture of the East and the West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere. Perhaps my thoughts and approach to life are more akin to what is called Western than Eastern, but India clings to me, as she does to all her children, in innumerable ways.‚Äù He then writes that ‚ÄúI am a stranger and alien in the West. I cannot be of it. But in my own country also, sometimes I have an exile‚Äôs feeling‚Äù. He includes an epilogue on 14 February 1935. On 4 September 1935, five and a half months before the completion of his sentence, he was released from Almora District jail due to his wife's deteriorating health, and the following month he added a postscript whilst at Badenweiler, Schwarzwald, where she was receiving treatment. Responses M.G. Hallet, working for the Home department of the Government of India at the time, was appointed to review the book, with a view to judging if the book should be banned. In his review, he reported that Nehru's inclusion of a chapter on animals in prison, was \\"very human\\", and he strongly opposed any ban of the book. According to Walter Crocker, had Nehru not been well known as India's first prime minister, he would have been famous for his autobiography.Shintri, Sarojini (1984).

Bruns Collegiate is a secondary school in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada established in 1972. It has approximately 790 students in Senior 1 - 4. It offers a varied curriculum with a total of 130 courses.  History  The school was named after Brother Joseph H. Bruns S.M., who had a lengthy and renowned career as an educator in St. Boniface. He served as Superintendent for twelve of his thirty-six year career. The school opened its doors to students in the suburb of Southdale in September 1972. Principals *Mr. G. A. Guilbault, Principal 1972 - 1975 *Mr. Moe Oye, Vice-Principal 1972 - 1979, 1980 - 1996 *Mr. Hank Neufeld, Principal 1975 - 1980 = Liberal phase = In its early years, J. H. Bruns experienced some growing pains. During this phase, the school had a differentiated staffing model. In this model, the staff was committed to an open area and team teaching approach. The community consisted mainly of parents employed predominantly as civil servants who would have preferred to be able to afford private schools but still placed a high value on education . In general, the staff did not live in Southdale. Initially, J. H. Bruns shared its gymnasium and sports facilities with the Southdale Recreation Association. During this period, the school functioned as a middle school offering grades 5 to 8. Each year thereafter a grade was added. *Grades 5 ‚Äì 8 1972 - 1973 *Grades 5 ‚Äì 9 1973 - 1974 *Grades 7 ‚Äì 10 1974 - 1975 *Grades 8 ‚Äì 11 1975 - 1976 *Grades 9 ‚Äì 12 1976 - 1977 In September 1974 Grade 6 went to Shamrock School and completed their grade 8 there. During the 1974‚Äì1975 academic year, the open area, team teaching model evolved into the TRUMP model. The TRUMP model originated in Oklahoma, USA and was named after Lloyd Trump, an American educator. J. H. Bruns was third school in Canada to adopt this model. Many professional development trips were made to Calgary, Denver, and Minneapolis in order to perfect the delivery of programs using the TRUMP model. An important aspect of the model was the continuous progress concept. \\"Unit packs\\" were created by teachers, and the students worked at their own pace. Another important aspect of the model was the Student Advisory Group (STAG). The STAG model meant a teacher met every day with a cross-graded group of students. The STAG teacher was responsible for the overall progress of his/her students. Thus the STAG teacher collected data from the subject teachers on these particular students. This included academic progress, attendance, and behavior data. The STAG teacher also contacted parents and conducted parent-teacher conferences for these students. The STAG teacher did not necessarily teach the student any of the courses. The STAG teacher also booked students into resource periods for extra instruction when necessary. In the late evening of October 30, 1975, a disastrous fire occurred at J. H. Bruns Collegiate. The fire originated in the upper level of the school. As a result of the damage, classes were held in the gymnasium and the library. By the spring of 1976 classrooms were renovated, and a new wing was added to the school, which included the Industrial Arts and Human Ecology facility. By 1976 the TRUMP model began to lose its prominence. Moreover, by the late 1970s, the philosophy of Bruns started to shift to a much more formal academic structure. Parents expressed concern about their children being prepared for university . By June 1977, J. H. Bruns Collegiate held its first convocation exercises. = Conservative phase = The second distinct period in the history of the school occurred between 1980‚Äì1996. The administrators at the helm during this time frame were: *Mr. Peter Janzen, Principal 1980 - 1996 *Mr. Moe Oye, Vice- Principal 1980 - 1996 J. H. Bruns still had a staff. The community continued to be mainly parents employed predominantly as civil servants. During this time span, the semester system was entrenched. The periods were eighty minutes in duration, and a full teaching load consisted of six courses, with three in each semester. The school became highly structured, and more walls went up. The open area model was completely disbanded, and the STAG system was terminated. Homerooms met on a \\"needs only\\" basis. It was also the end of continuous progress. Discipline at the school was enhanced. The classroom was the sole focus of monitored learning. Budget cuts began in the late 1980s and early 1990s and J. H. Bruns was severely affected. As a result, the structure of the semester system changed. The periods were now fifty-five minutes in length, with double periods of 110 minutes for each course twice in a cycle. There were also some courses that continued throughout the year, but met only every second day. The teaching load was now seven courses with a three and a half split each semester. Department heads, which had been in existence since the school's inception, were also cut throughout the division due to budget restraint. In addition, the provincial government mandated provincial exams in English Language Arts and Mathematics in grade 12. The government also mandated the formation of Parent Advisory Councils in every school in the province if the parents so desired. At this juncture in J. H. Bruns‚Äô history, the Learning Centre came into existence, In the early 1990s it was designed to assist students with learning difficulties. The addition of the Learning Centre signaled another change at J. H. Bruns. It was no longer a strictly academic school, preparing students only for university. The school began to accommodate students with various learning capabilities.  Present: Inclusion  This brought J. H. Bruns to another distinct period in its history. The administrators at the helm were: *Mr. Neil Johnson, Principal 1996 - 2001 *Ms Gail Atkins, Vice Principal 1996 - 2002 *Mr. Bob Town, Principal 2001 - 2013 *Ms Irene Nordheim, Vice Principal 2002 - 2005 *Ms Marilyn Thorington, Vice Principal 2005 - 2006 *Ms Karen Haluschak, Vice Principal 2006 - 2009 *Mr. Ray Houssin, Vice Principal 2007 - 2010 *Ms Patti Field, Vice Principal 2009 - 2011 *Mr. Curt Krahn, Vice Principal 2010 - 2014 *Ms Charlene Smallwood, Vice Principal 2011 - 2015 *Mr. Henri P√©loquin, Principal 2013 - 2018 *Mr. Greg Meade, Vice Principal 2014 - 2016 *Ms Julie C√¥t√©-Marinelli, Vice Principal 2015 - 2018 *Mr. Joel Shimoji, Vice Principal 2016 - 2020 *Ms Julie C√¥t√©- Marinelli, Principal 2018 - 2018 *Mrs. Carrie Schimnowski, Vice Principal 2018 - 2018 *Mr. Ralph Wagner, Principal 2018 - 2019 *Ms Julie C√¥t√©-Marinelli, Vice Principal 2018 - 2019 *Ms Elaine Solinski, Vice Principal 2019 - Present *Ms Julie C√¥t√©-Marinelli, Principal 2019 - Present *Mrs. Carrie Schimnowski, Vice Principal 2020 - Present Overall, J. H. Bruns strives to accommodate students of different levels of ability. The school has now evolved from assuming that all students should be prepared for university entrance, to a reality that some students would better utilize their talents in other educational endeavours. The Learning Centre has now become a significant component of the school's program and has been renamed Academic Prep. At this juncture, the teacher's role is not strictly classroom oriented. Teachers are expected to become active members of the school's team. They are drawn in many directions and are more often called upon to be involved in many additional tasks, both curricular and extra-curricular. During this era J. H. Bruns‚Äô history has been affected by many outside influences. There are provincial exams, with curricular changes that emphasize outcome-based education. There are few \\"01\\" (general) courses. Technology use to enhance student learning has become a major thrust in the school. Pierre Radisson Collegiate closed its doors to become the St. Boniface Arts and Technology Centre (now the Louis Riel Arts and Technology Centre). Students who may have been streamed out of the community to Pierre Radisson in the past for special learning programs are now integrated into J. H. Bruns. Academic Prep becomes the key to success for many of these students. Senior I to Senior II students who have learning difficulties must be accommodated and mainstreamed into the classroom in order to advance to Senior III and go on to graduate from Bruns. The government has also mandated an \\"open boundaries\\" model which has also influenced the school's direction. There has also been a change in the school's timetable. The school has seventy-three minutes periods, with no double periods. A full teaching load continues to be seven classes. However, the teaching day has now been lengthened. The Manitoba School Improvement Plan (MSIP) is also driving school change at J. H. Bruns, with many committees in place in order to facilitate this. In the 2014-2015 school year, J.H. Bruns Collegiate submitted a hockey team to the Winnipeg High School Hockey League, they were accepted into the \\"B\\" division. They played their first game on October 8, 2014 against the Miles Macdonell Collegiate Buckeyes at Terry Sawchuk Memorial Arena. Bruns won the game 7-2. They finished the regular season with a record of 10 wins, 11 losses, and 1 shootout loss. That year, they were eliminated from the WHSHL Playoffs in the first round by the West Kildonan Collegiate Wolverines.

Malt loaf has a chewy texture, and often contains raisins. Malt loaf is usually eaten sliced and spread with butter for tea. Malt flour is sometimes used to supplement the flavour of the malt loaf. History In 1889, John Montgomerie of Scotland filed a U.S. patent application titled \\"Making Malted Bread,\\" which was granted in 1890. This patent asserted a prior patent existed in England dated 1886. Montgomerie claimed a novel saccharification process, which involved warming a portion of dough mixed with diastatic malt extract to an appropriate mash temperature and holding it for a time to allow the extract's enzymes to break down some of the starch into maltose. Commercial production \\"Soreen\\" () is a popular brand of malt loaf. The name is derived from \\"Sorensen\\", the name of the family that once owned the company, and \\"Green\\", a business partner; hence the name Soreen. In 2003 Warburtons sold the brand to Inter Link Foods; in 2007 Soreen became part of McCambridge Group. In 2014 UK food group Samworth Brothers bought the Soreen brand for an undisclosed sum. \\"Aunt Ellen's\\" is another popular brand of malt loaf. Both are produced in Manchester. \\"Harvo\\" was a brand of malt loaf which was made at the company's bakery at 257 Lawley Street, BirminghamSite of Harvo, 257, Lawley Street, Birmingham: until the company went bankrupt in 1973. In some areas, the name Harvo or Harvo Loaf is still often used to describe malt loaf, regardless of the brand. The Harvo trademark was later held by one of the Premier Foods companies, associated with its takeover of Rank Hovis McDougall, RHBB (IP) Ltd; The Harvo trademark expired in 2006. Variants in other countries In December and during the holiday season, a similar type of bread called v√∂rtbr√∂d (literally ‚Äúwort bread‚Äù) is popular in Scandinavia. The dough's water is supplied by beer wort, adding sweetness and flavour to the bread. Several different spices and fruits commonly associated with Christmas are also added, e.g., cloves, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom and raisins. Malt bread is one of many variants of baguettes sold in Russia. It is produced in local city bakeries.

The doctrine is called \\"historic\\" because many early church fathers (such as Ireneaus, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, and Papias) appear to have held it. Post-tribulational premillennialism is the Christian eschatological view that the second coming of Jesus Christ will occur prior to a thousand-year reign of the saints but subsequent to the great apostasy (and to any tribulation). Comparison Premillennialism is a view alternative to both postmillennialism, which teaches that the second coming of Jesus will occur after a thousand-year period of righteousness, and to amillennialism, which teaches that the thousand-year period is not meant to be taken literally but is the current church/messianic age. The two major species of premillennialism are historic and dispensational premillennialism, the latter of which is associated with pre-tribulational and mid-tribulational views. See the summary of Christian eschatological differences. A major difference between historic and dispensational premillennialism is the view of the church in relation to Israel. Historics do not see so sharp a distinction between Israel and the church as the dispensationalists do, but instead view believers of all ages as part of one group, now revealed as the body of Christ. Thus, historic premillennialists see no issue with the church going through the Great Tribulation, and they do not need a separate pre-tribulational rapture of some believers as the dispensational system requires. History Proponents of historic premillennialism include Baptists, Presbyterians,the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and several Evangelical groups.

She was built in 1984 by Valmet, Finland for Birka Line as Birka Princess. The ship sank on 5 April 2007, after running aground near the Greek island of Santorini the previous day, leaving two passengers missing and presumed dead. History Originally named Birka Princess, the ship was built by the Finnish state-owned company Valmet at their Vuosaari shipyard in HelsinkiVessel SEA DIAMOND - DNV Exchange at a cost of 350 million Finnish markka (‚Ç¨58,9 million). She was delivered in 1986 and operated for Birka Line in the Baltic Sea cruiseferry market, sailing on 24-hour cruises between Stockholm in Sweden and the √Öland Islands in Finland. Between 1990 and 2003 she also made longer cruises around the Baltic Sea during the summer season. MS Birka Princess in her original exterior appearance and livery.

Like most cruiseferries in the Baltic Sea, she was built to ice class 1A. In 1999 she was extensively refitted at Lloyd Werft in Germany at a cost of approximately US$26 million.Louis Takes Delivery of a New Large Cruise Ship - Press release, 17 March 2006 (PDF) The fore superstructure was extended and streamlined and 62 new passenger cabins were added, including a new deck of cabins above the bridge. In October 2004, when the new MS Birka Paradise was delivered, the Birka Princess started making two-night cruises from Stockholm to Turku, Helsinki and Tallinn, as well one weekly 24-hour cruise from Stockholm to Mariehamn. The new itineraries proved largely unsuccessful, and on 2 January 2006, the ship was laid up in Mariehamn and put up for sale. In February 2006 she was sold to the Cyprus-based Louis Cruise Lines for US$35 million (‚Ç¨29.4 million).Birka Line to sell one of its two cruise vessels to Cyprus - Helsingin Sanomat, 14 February 2006. As built, the ship only had an indoor pool in the sauna section on deck 2 in the bow of the ship. A new outdoor swimming pool was installed and the sundeck area increased at Turku Repair Yard, Naantali. She entered service in the Mediterranean Sea as the second former Birka Line ship in the Louis Cruise Lines fleet, after MS Princesa Marissa, the former MS Prinsessan/Finnhansa. After the sale she was registered in Valletta, Malta. She changed flags in late 2006.

Sinking Attempts to prevent the stricken cruise ship from sinking On 5 April 2007, at around 16:00 EEST (13:00 UTC) the ship ran aground on a well-marked volcanic reef east of Nea Kameni, within the caldera of the Greek island of Santorini, began taking on water, and listed up to 12 degrees to starboard before her watertight doors were reportedly closed (a report which was later refuted when the wreck was examined). The 1,195 passengers, mostly Americans and 60 Canadians, were initially all reported to be safely evacuated in three-and-a-half hours, with four injuries. Some passengers, including a group of 77 students from Paisley Magnet School in North Carolina, were evacuated from the car ramp through the former car deck onto boats, but some passengers had to climb down rope ladders from the higher decks. The ship was towed off the rocks, and her list stabilized. Later, it was reported that two French passengers were missing. The Santorini caldera, the final resting place (marked) of Sea Diamond The large amount of water taken on board led to the ship sinking shortly before 7:00 EEST on 6 April 2007, only a few hundred metres from the shore.Cruise ship sinks after hitting Mediterranean reef (Images) Video footage shows that, toward the end, the ship completely capsized before settling stern first onto the sea floor. It was later reported that the tip of the bulbous bow was only 62 metres (203 feet) below sea level, but the stern was in water up to 180 metres (590 feet) deep. It is feared that the wreck would soon slide deeper and sink into the submerged caldera of the volcanic island. It has been speculated that the deep, almost vertical shore of the bathtub-like caldera made it impossible to beach the ship and save her from becoming a total loss. =Missing= Two French citizens, Jean Christophe Allain, aged 45, and his daughter Maud, 16, were listed as missing. Allain's wife said her cabin filled with water when the ship struck rocks and that she narrowly escaped. She was not sure whether her husband and daughter made it out because the events happened so suddenly. Her son was on deck at the time and was evacuated safely.Two passengers missing after luxury cruise liner sinks in the Aegean Sea The family were accommodated in cabin 2014 an outside standard cabin on the starboard side of the vessel on deck 2, the lowest passenger deck.

State television reported they were charged with causing a shipwreck through negligence, breaching international shipping safety regulations and polluting the environment. Additional charges could be made depending on the fate of the two missing passengers. All six were released until further notice but if convicted they could face a five-year prison sentence.Greek cruise ship's personnel face negligence charges over sinking, USA Today, 7 April 2007 Empty life rafts automatically released in water, now covered with oil slicks from the Sea Diamond On 13 April 2007, it was reported that investigators using a remotely controlled submarine found the ship's data recorder (VDR). In a struggle to protect the data, they secured it in a special sterilized bin and the authorities were to have transferred it to the United States in order to reveal the saved data, an action that only the manufacturer of the VDR can perform. The Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said the recorder could reveal details of the sinking of the ship which could be used in the prosecution of crew members. DNV, one of the world's leading classification agencies, stated in their press release that \\"At the time of the accident, DNV had issued class certificate, safety management certificate and ship security certificate. Sea Diamond had no overdue surveys and no condition of class\\". For the Sea Diamond to have been issued a Class certificate, her water-tight doors would have to have been fully operational. Investigations carried out by the defense team of the Master of the Vessel and Louis Cruise Lines, after a lawsuit had been filed against them, have included a new hydrographic survey of the area of the accident in Santorini. This survey was carried out by Akti Engineering, and discovered discrepancies between the actual mapping of the sea area and the official charts used by the Sea Diamond (and all other vessels) at the time of the accident. The detailed survey claimed that the reef, which the Sea Diamond struck is, in fact, lying at from shore and not at a distance of , as is incorrectly marked on the nautical chart. The official chart also shows the depth of the water at the area of impact varying from , whilst the recent survey shows that it is only .Louis press release: M/V Sea Diamond Struck the Reef and Sunk Due to Incorrect Mapping of the Area, Retrieved 2 November 2007 The findings obtained by Akti Engineering have since been passed on to the Hellenic Hydrographic Office of the Hellenic Navy and other responsible authorities, with the aim that the necessary changes to maritime charts should be made and similar accidents to be prevented. According to a branch reviewing source, the Hellenic Hydrographic Office initially rejected the new mapping, but a later study confirmed the findings of Akti. A Greek scuba diver gathering evidence for a judicial investigation of the Sea Diamond shipwreck died in October 2007 from decompression sickness after ascending too quickly. =Aftermath= In order to avoid an oil spill, plans were made to recover some of fuel from the ship's tanks. As of 20 September 2007, fuel had started to leak into other parts of the ship, but not yet into the surrounding environment. In June 2009, the fuel was pumped off the wreck.Sea Diamond: ŒüŒªŒøŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÅœéŒ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œµ Œ∑ Œ±œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒªŒ∑œÉŒ∑ Œ∫Œ±œÖœÉŒØŒºœâŒΩ H ŒùŒ±œÖœÑŒµŒºœÄŒøœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆ daily, 16 June 2009 On 14 May 2007, it was announced that Louis Cruise Lines had bought M/S Silja Opera (renaming it M/S Cristal) to replace the Sea Diamond. On 19 June 2007, the owners, operator and captain of the Sea Diamond cruise ship were fined ‚Ç¨1.17 million for causing marine pollution. On 21 August 2007, a lawsuit was filed in United States federal court on behalf of the passengers who were aboard the ship when she sank.Cruise Bruise: Cruise Ship Sinking Results In Two Deaths, Retrieved 6 November 2007 After six years in the courts, the Sea Diamond captain and an insurance company employee were given 12- and 8-year jail sentences, respectively. The Greek newspaper Eleftherotypia (now defunct) speculated no actual jail time would be served. =Raising= After the sinking there was much demand from the residents of Santorini for the wreck be raised and removed. Further questions were posed but never answered as to why the ship was moved to deeper water to be allowed to sink in the first place. In May 2011, the Greek government claimed that removing the Sea Diamond would be \\"too costly\\" and said that the 150-million-euro cost of raising the ship should be the responsibility of the insurers and company that owned the ship. The latter two have no plans to raise the ship, however, and nothing will be resolved. In October 2017 the Merchant Marine Ministry of Greece announced the wreck will be raised, out of environmental and navigational concerns. It is an artificial reef for now.

He designed coins for countries around the world, and became especially well known as London-based designer of collectors' items in the 1970s and 1980s. Devlin was born in Geelong, Victoria, Australia, and became an art teacher, specialising in gold and silversmithing. In 1957, he obtained a post at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and studied for a Diploma of Art in gold and silversmithing. He was awarded scholarships to study at the Royal College of Art in London in 1958, and was awarded a Harkness Fellowship by the Commonwealth Fund. He spent the two-year fellowship at Columbia University in New York City where he met and married his first wife, Kim Hose, in 1962. Devlin's initials are located at the bottom of the reverse of the 1966 Australian 50 cent coin. He returned to teach in Melbourne and subsequently became an inspector of art schools. He rose to fame when, in 1964, he won a competition to design the first decimal coinage for Australia. In 1965, he moved to London and opened a small workshop. This marked the beginning of Devlin's own style, which often took the form of limited editions, the most popular being Easter eggs and Christmas boxes, now collectors' items. He adapted and devised new techniques to produce a wide variety of textures and filigree forms, and became well known in London's West End, producing a new collection each year. He had a prestigious showroom in Conduit Street from 1979 until 1985. In 1966 a Stuart Devlin fine silver sculpture was commissioned by Ford of Britain to celebrate the release of the new Mk IV Ford Zephyr and Zodiac range of motor vehicles. He has designed furniture, interiors, jewellery, and commissioned pieces of all types, including trophies, clocks, centrepieces, goblets, candelabra, bowls, and insignia. Among his most popular commissions, Devlin has designed coins and medals for 36 countries throughout the world, including precious coins for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and the medals for the founding awards of the Australian honours system in 1975: the Order of Australia, the Australian Bravery Decorations and the National Medal. In 1982, Devlin was granted the Royal Warrant of Appointment as Goldsmith and Jeweller to Her Majesty the Queen. He married his second wife, Carole Hedley-Saunders, in 1986. He was Prime Warden of the Goldsmith's Company 1996‚Äì97. After he stepped down from that role, he continued to work with the Goldsmiths, and particularly involved in the developing of a new institute for future Goldsmiths, and also with various other aspects which involve opportunities for up-and-coming jewellers and goldsmiths, including a summer school and 'getting started' course. Having closed his London workshop, Devlin retired to Littlehampton, West Sussex. He ceased drawing after he suffered a stroke in 2014. Devlin died on 12 April 2018 at the age of 86.Devlin Honours Devlin was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1980 Birthday Honours for service to the art of design and an Officer of the Order of Australia in the 1988 Australia Day Honours in recognition of service to the craftsmanship as a goldsmith, silversmith and designer.

Biography Born in the village of Foase, in the Atwima District of the Ashanti Region in Ghana, West Africa, he worked in various jobs in science and medical-related fields while maintaining his interest in music. In 1957, when the former British colony of the Gold Coast became the independent country of Ghana, Koo Nimo first received national acclaim through the formation of the Addadam Agofomma ensemble. Many of his songs tell traditional stories and are sung in the Twi language. Along with one or two guitars and vocals, the traditional Ashanti palmwine ensemble consists of traditional instruments of West Africa, including the apentemma and the donno, the frikyiwa (metal castanet), the prempensua (rhumba box), the ntorwa (hollow gourd rattle with beads or seeds woven around it on a net), and the nnawuta (consisting of two iron bells that provide the key rhythmic pattern) or dawuro (banana-shaped bell).

In 1998, he was employed as a Professor of Ethnomusicology at the University of Washington in Seattle, USA, for two years, before taking a similar position at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. In 2006, Koo Nimo moved back to Ghana, to the city of Kumasi. He appeared in a January 2007 episode of the American travel show Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, where he is shown playing music, discussing his music, and enjoying a lunch of stewed greater cane rat with host Anthony Bourdain.Joseph Teye-Kofi, Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations: Ghana, Vimeo, 8 January 2007. Awards, honours and memberships In 1979, in recognition of his services to Ghanaian music as performer, teacher and administrator, Koo Nimo was elected President of MUSIGA (the Musicians' Union of Ghana). His countrymen appreciated not only his music, but his love and respect for tradition. In 1985 Koo Nimo was appointed interim chairman of COSGA, the Copyright Society of Ghana. More recently he has been made an honorary life member of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music, along with such distinguished names as Professor J. H. K. Nketia and John Collins. In February 1991, in recognition of his services to music and to his country, Koo received the prestigious Asanteman award from the Asantehene. In March, he received the Flagstar Award from ECRAG (Entertainment Critics and Reviewers Association of Ghana). In 1991, he was invited to serve on the National Folklore Board of Trustees. In March 1997, the Ghana government celebrated the 40th anniversary of independence by awarding gold medals to forty of its distinguished citizens, one of whom was Koo Nimo. This was in recognition of his efforts to preserve traditional culture. In the next month he received the Konkoma Award for his contribution to Ghanaian Highlife Music.

It usually does not have a Guest of Honor, though often, especially when held in conjunction with a related convention, it may share a guest with the main convention. Informal in nature, relaxacons are generally small, ranging from 50 to 200 attendees. They are often invitation or word-of-mouth only. Frequently, they are a chance for the organizers of a large convention to get together with the other organizers and relax once the convention is over, and are held a month or more after the regular convention. Some large conventions use relaxacons as a reward for volunteers, and as a way of using up leftover supplies (much the way a dead dog party does). This can be seen as contributing to SMOF-ish behaviours, which some members of fandom can find off-putting. Common fannish lore is that Midwestcon (started in 1950) was the first convention to label itself a relaxacon. However, the organizers first applied the term to the convention in 1966, according to Jack Chalker, and the term had been used in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1957. Sercon Relaxacons are often contrasted with \\"sercon\\" conventions, ones (purportedly) devoted solely to SERious CONstructive discussion of science fiction topics. Organizers of most of those conventions sometimes described as \\"sercon\\" tend to be uncomfortable with the label, since the term originally implied a highly unfannish lack of a sense of fun and self-perspective.

Initially, ARF was formed to support the research endeavors of faculty members from the Armour Institute of Technology, predecessor to the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). IITRI is headquartered on the IIT campus in Chicago, but operates as an independent, not-for-profit research organization. Between its founding in 1936 and 2000, IITRI developed research operations in approximately two dozen locationsIIT 2003 Annual Report on Research, p. 23. across the United States. The IITRI staff grew to approximately 1700 employees who performed research and development programs with an annual research budget exceeding $200 M per year. Historically, as a major national science research center, work involved both unclassified and classified (secret) research. In 2002, IITRI became entirely focused on the life sciences. All other science and engineering divisions were spun off into Alion Science and Technology,IIT 2003 Annual Report on Research, p. 21. a separate employee-owned corporation. Since 2002, research at IITRI has been entirely focused on biomedical research, with particular emphasis on pre-clinical toxicology, safety evaluations, and drug discovery and development. In 2006, IITRI formed Technology Research, Inc. (TRI), as a wholly owned subsidiary in which research programs that fall outside of IITRI's not-for-profit charter can be conducted.

Current activities Current investigations at IITRI are focused on biomedicine as a contract research organization (CRO), with particular emphasis on non-clinical toxicology, inhalation toxicology and technology, microbiology and molecular biology,Sagripanti; et al. (2010) (journal article) [see author affiliations]. and drug discovery and development for cancer and infectious diseases. IITRI conducts research programs with particular emphasis on studies to support Investigational New Drug applications and New Drug applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Current Divisions of IITRI IITRI currently performs research in five Technical Divisions: Toxicology, Inhalation Toxicology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, Carcinogenesis and Cancer Chemoprevention,Mehta; et al. (2010) (journal article) [see author affiliations]. and Drug Discovery. =Toxicology= Scientists working in IITRI's Toxicology Division have performed non-clinical toxicology studies for U.S. Government and medical industry sponsors for more than thirty years. Current programs involve acute, subchronic and chronic studies in both rodent and non-rodent model systems to support new drug research. In addition to general toxicology studies, IITRI scientists routinely perform pharmacokinetics and metabolism (PK/ADME) studies, reproductive toxicology studies, safety pharmacology studies, and studies involving a variety of specializations and clinical endpoints. A particular strength of the scientific staff is the integration of non-routine evaluations (genomics/gene expression, cell biology, biochemistry, and enzymology) into the conduct of non-clinical toxicology protocols. =Inhalation Toxicology= IITRI's Inhalation Toxicology Division integrates the efforts of doctoral- level inhalation scientists and engineers with experienced, doctoral-level toxicologists to conduct non-clinical toxicology studies in support of Investigational New Drug (IND) and New Drug (NDA) Applications. Studies are performed in both rodent and non-rodent species. Nose-only and whole body exposures are performed using metered dose inhalaers, nebulizers, atomizers, powder dispensers, and vapor generation systems, with continuous on-line monitoring to document test atmosphere composition. Study endpoints are similar to those performed by scientists of the Toxicology Division, and commonly involve safety evaluations. Safety Pharmacology studies are performed to determine the effects of drugs and other xeniobiotics on the function of the central nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and urinary/renal systems. Cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies are performed using telemetry instrumentation. =Microbiology and Molecular Biology= Scientists working in IITRI's Microbiology and Molecular Biology Division work in genetic toxicology, immunotoxicology, applied microbiology, genomics and gene expression, and molecular diagnostics. Genetic Toxicologists at IITRI routinely perform bacterial mutagenesis assays (Ames Tests), mammalian mutagenesis assays (mouse lymphoma and other tests), DNA damage assays (micronucleus and chromosomal aberration assays), and cytotoxicity assays. Molecular biologists perform a wide range of studies in gene expression, including genomics evaluations using several different platforms. IITRI has studied immunotoxicology for more than 25 years. In the early 1980s, IITRI scientists were key participants in the original tripartite program (with the NIEHS and the Medical College of Virginia) in which murine immunotoxicology bioassays were developed and validated. Subsequently, IITRI scientists played a major role in the development and validation of the local lymph node assay (LLNA) for the rapid detection of agents that induce hypersensitivity. IITRI's Microbiology and Molecular Biology Division operates both Biosafety Level-2 and Biosafety Level-3 laboratories for in vitro and in vivo studies, and is approved by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct studies with a broad range of pathogenic agents. This work involves molecular diagnostics, drug and vaccine efficacy evaluations, drug and vaccine safety evaluations, and decontamination studies. =Carcinogenesis and Cancer Chemoprevention= The focus of research efforts in Carcinogenesis and Cancer Chemoprevention Division is the prevention of cancer by pharmacologic, nutritional, or hormonal interventions. IITRI has done preclinical studies of cancer prevention for more than 30 years, and IITRI scientists have published more than 200 peer-reviewed papers in the field. Originally focused entirely on the prevention of experimental breast cancer, scientists working in IITRI's Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention Division have conducted studies directed at mechanisms of carcinogenesis and prevention of cancer in the breast, prostate, lung, colon, urinary bladder, oral cavity, liver, skin, and hematopoietic system, among other organ sites. The earliest studies conducted by this group (in the 1970s) focused on the prevention of cancer by natural and synthetic analogs of vitamin A (retinoids). This work has expanded substantially since that time, and currently involves a wide range of natural products (soy isoflavones and protease inhibitors, tea polyphenols, organic selenium compounds, vitamin D and derivatives), hormones and hormone analogs, and pharmacologic agents originally developed for other indications. Mechanistic studies are performed at the cell, biochemical, and molecular levels, and preclinical drug discovery and development studies involve a wide range of in vitro and in vivo screening, efficacy, and preclinical toxicology programs. =Drug Discovery= The various research efforts in the foregoing divisions supports Drug Discovery Division with Investigational New Drug (IND) Applications and New Drug Applications (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as submissions to other regulatory agencies. Studies comply with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. IITRI's expertise in non-clinical studies also supports the development of drugs for cancer prevention and therapy.

It contrasts with involuntary euthanasia, when euthanasia is performed against the will of the patient. The different possible situations considered non-voluntary euthanasia are when the decision to end the life of the patient is 1) based on what the incapacitated individual would have wanted if they could be asked, 2) based on what the decision maker would want if he or she were in the patient's place, and 3) made by a doctor based on their own criteria and reasoning. Legal status Euthanasia can all be divided into passive or active variants. Passive euthanasia entails the withholding of common treatments, such as antibiotics, necessary for the continuance of life. Active euthanasia entails the use of lethal substances or forces, such as administering a lethal injection, to kill and is the most controversial means. A number of authors consider these terms to be misleading and unhelpful. Active non-voluntary euthanasia is illegal in all countries in the world, although it is practised in the Netherlands on infants (see below) under an agreement between physicians and district attorneys. Passive non-voluntary euthanasia (withholding life support) is legal in various countries, such as India, Albania, and many parts of the United States and is practiced in English hospitals. Non-voluntary euthanasia has been heavily debated. For example, Len Doyal, a professor of medical ethics and former member of the ethics committee of the British Medical Association, argued for legalization, saying in 2006 that \\"[p]roponents of voluntary euthanasia should support non-voluntary euthanasia under appropriate circumstances and with proper regulation\\". Arguing against legalization, Peter Saunders, campaign director for Care Not Killing, an alliance of Christian and disability groups, called Doyal's proposals \\"the very worst form of medical paternalism whereby doctors can end the lives of patients after making a judgment that their lives are of no value and claim that they are simply acting in their patients' best interests\\". Slippery slope debate Non-voluntary euthanasia is cited as one of the possible outcomes of the slippery slope argument against euthanasia, in which it is claimed that permitting voluntary euthanasia to occur will lead to the support and legalization of non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia, although other ethicists have contested this idea. Non-voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands Severe hydrocephalus. Infants like this can be subject to non- voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands if the parents and doctors decide it is the best choice for their child. In other jurisdictions, the doctors involved may be prosecuted. Permitted euthanasia in the Netherlands has been regulated by law since 2002. It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. Prior to the establishment of that law, euthanasia and assisted suicide in the Netherlands were already tolerated for many years, as for example described by G. van der Wal and R. J. Dillmann in 1994. In a 1994 study, of the studied 5000 requests in the Netherlands, in about 1000 of the cases, doctors prescribed drugs with the explicit goal of shortening the patient's life without the explicit request of the patient, which can be considered cases of non-voluntary euthanasia. Since 2004, the Netherlands, also has a protocol to be followed in cases of euthanasia on children under the age of 12 (see also below), which was ratified by the Dutch National Association of Pediatricians, although the practice remains technically illegal. Together with colleagues and prosecutors, Eduard Verhagen developed the Groningen Protocol, in which cases prosecutors will refrain from pressing charges. Non-voluntary euthanasia on children =Newborns and euthanasia= Active euthanasia on newborns is illegal throughout the world, with the de facto exception of the Netherlands mentioned above. Because a newborn child is never able to speak for themselves, euthanasia on newborns is by definition non-voluntary. An early example of documented cases of child euthanasia are those performed by the surgeon Harry J. Haiselden in Chicago in the early 20th century. =Ancient Greece= In ancient Greece, non-voluntary euthanasia of children was practiced as an early form of eugenics, the belief and practice of improving the genetic quality of the human population, usually by withdrawing care (i.e. passive euthanasia) rather than a physical extermination, an act termed as ‚Äúexposure‚Äù.

His music is produced almost entirely with analog synthesizers and drum machines. His debut album, Madingley, was released in 2006 on Toronto's Noise Factory Records. Minisystem is often defined in contrast to Intelligent dance music and glitch. Combining simple drum sounds from the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines arranged in a dance progression with melodic and warm tones from a variety of vintage analog synthesizers, Minisystem has been compared to Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk. His music has been described as \\"synth-pop\\". Biography Lee was raised on his family's farm near Guelph, Ontario. Lee cites his early experiences in this rural setting as inspiration for his music. His first album gets its title from the name of the family farm. Lee went on to earn a BSc from the University of Waterloo, then later moved to England to study for his PhD at the University of Cambridge. Lee returned to Canada in 2002, this time settling in Toronto where he is currently a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. Since he began producing music, Lee has performed in Toronto as part of the Bit_Rock Alumnae, Math Hooker and Vague Terrain series of events. Musical influences Lee's early musical influences include The Smiths, Depeche Mode, A Flock of Seagulls, and The Monks. While in Waterloo he was first exposed to experimental electronic artists such as Autechre and Aphex Twin. While in Cambridge, Lee took an active role in the budding electronic music scene by putting on shows at which he would sometimes DJ. Aspiring to create similarly experimental music during this time, Lee purchased a digital synthesizer and digital sampler, which he reportedly hated and soon after sold. Lee's next purchase was a Roland Juno-106 synthesizer, which unlike his earlier purchases would become a mainstay of his studio environment.

It amalgamated with the 62nd (Wiltshire) Regiment of Foot to form the Duke of Edinburgh's (Wiltshire Regiment) in 1881. History =Formation= The regiment was raised in Edinburgh by Major- General Gage John Hall as the 99th Regiment of Foot, in response to the threat posed by the French intervention in Spain, in March 1824. It was a distinct unit, unrelated to earlier units designated as the 99th Regiment of the British Army. In 1832, the new 99th Regiment received its county title, becoming the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot. =The Victorian era= Sir Colin Campbell, colonel of the regiment in the 1830s, by William Salter A memorial erected by the 99th Regiment of Foot at Anglesea Barracks, Hobart to commemorate the soldiers of the regiment killed during the New Zealand Wars. This is the only monument built by British soldiers in Australia to commemorate their casualties. During its early years, the 99th spent much of its time in the Pacific. The first detachments of the 99th Regiment arrived in Australia with transported convicts aboard the transport ship North Briton, destined for Tasmania, in 1842.the Brits in Oz The rest of the 99th arrived on with successive shipments of convicts. The 99th rotated through various colonial posts during much of 1842 until being ordered to Sydney, Australia. However, the 99th soon earned an unsavory reputation, alienating the locals to such an extent that an additional regiment had to be assigned to Sydney. The 11th Regiment of Foot's principal job was keeping the men of the 99th under control. The 99th remained in Tasmania for three years before being dispatched to New Zealand to take part in the New Zealand Wars. Detachments of the 99th took part in the Hutt Valley Campaign, seeing action at the Battle of Battle Hill. Three government soldiers and at least nine NgƒÅti Toa were killed. Following the capture of Te Rauparaha in 1846, the Regiment would depart New Zealand and return to Australia, although detachments would be sent as needed to reinforce the British forces in New Zealand for the next few years to keep the peace. For its service in the First Maori War, the regiment earned its first battle honour: New Zealand. In 1856, the regiment rotated back to the British Isles. The 99th spent its next two years at various garrisons in Ireland, until in 1858, it was ordered to join the Aldershot garrison. While at Aldershot, the regiment earned its reputation as an extraordinarily well drilled and well turned out regiment.H.L. Wicks, Regiments of Foot: A Historical Record of All The Foot Regiments of British Army (Southampton: The Camelot Press, 1974) p. 140. Following its tour of duty at Aldershot, the regiment rotated to India in 1859. After serving at various Indian stations, the 99th was called to active service to form part of General Sir Hope Grant's force during the Second Opium War. Assigned to the 2nd Division, commanded by Major-General Sir Robert Napier, the 99th took part in the Third Battle of Taku Forts and the Battle of Palikao. The regiment also participated in the sack of Peking, where among the loot carried off, the regiment took a Pekinese dog which belonged to the Chinese Empress. The dog, named Lootie, was taken back to England where it was presented to the Queen Victoria. For its service in China, the regiment earned the battle honour: Pekin 1860. Rather than return the 99th to India, the regiment was ordered to join the Hong Kong garrison, securing the new Kowloon territory acquired by the Convention of Peking. The regiment remained as the Hong Kong garrison until 1865, but found themselves in trouble in autumn 1864, with eleven of their number on trial for murder and riot following serious altercations, first with a party of Malay seaman, and then the local police. Three days of mayhem left eight men dead, including Private Landale of the regiment, and the 99th Foot were immediately sent to Kowloon and with the local Volunteers taking up picket duties on HKI. In November, the eleven were put on trial but acquitted. However, the 99th were posted out of Hong Kong, and in early February 1865, they were replaced by 9th (the East Norfolks). The 99th boarded HMS Tamar - which had delivered the 9th - bound Cape Town. From 1865 until 1868, the 99th served in South Africa. While in South Africa, Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, inspected the regiment as part of a tour of the colony. The regiment impressed him so much that he took a continued interest in the regiment for the rest of his life. This culminated in permission being granted to re-title the regiment. In 1874, the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot became the 99th Duke of Edinburgh's (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot, taking its title from Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. After returning to England in 1868, the regiment returned to South Africa in 1878 in time to take part in the Anglo-Zulu War. Assigned to Lord Chelmsford's column, they marched to the relief of British forces under Colonel Charles Pearson besieged by the Zulu impis. At the Battle of Gingindlovu, the 99th helped defeat a Zulu impis which tried to overrun the British while laagered. Although it would not participate in the final battle at Ulundi, the 99th was honoured for its service in Anglo-Zulu War, being awarded the battle honour South Africa 1879. =Amalgamation= As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 99th was linked with the 62nd (Wiltshire) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 38 at Le Marchant Barracks in Devizes. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 62nd (Wiltshire) Regiment of Foot to form the Duke of Edinburgh's (Wiltshire Regiment).

She was a full-rigged galleon with draft and capacity of 200 tons. She carried officers, crew, and a priest. Explorations In 1542 Cabrillo was the first European to explore the coast of present-day California. He had three ships: the 200-ton galleon San Salvador, the 100-ton La Victoria, and lateen-rigged, 26-oared San Miguel. The two ships were not the square-rigged galleons commonly used for crossing open ocean. Rather, they were built in Acajutla, El Salvador, and the ship San Salvador, was named after Pedro de Alvarado's newly founded city in western El Salvador, San Salvador, the ship San Miguel was named after the second newly founded city in eastern San Miguel, El Salvador, and the ship Victoria was named after the Victory of Pedro de Alvarado against the long and arduous battle against the Native American resistance in El Salvador. In 1540 the fleet sailed from Acajutla, El Salvador, and reached Navidad, Mexico on Christmas Day. While in Mexico, Pedro de Alvarado went to the assistance of the town of Nochistl√°n, which was under siege by hostile natives, and was killed when his horse fell on him, crushing his chest. Following Alvarado's death, the viceroy took possession of Alvarado's fleet. Part of the fleet was sent off to the Philippine Islands under Ruy Lopez de Villalobos and two of the ships were sent north under the command of Cabrillo. Navidad is some northwest of Manzanillo, Colima. A requirement of exploration ships was the ability to sail with ease into small harbors. The ships were rigged with triangular sails supported by swept booms. This sail arrangement, a forerunner to the sails found in the modern-day fore-and-aft rig of sloops, ketches and yawls, made the craft more agile and gave them the ability to point higher into the wind than square riggers. Departing from Navidad on 27 June 1542, Cabrillo discovered San Diego Bay on 28 September. He went ashore and claimed the land for Spain. Continuing his explorations northward, he landed on Santa Catalina Island on 7 October and described nearby San Clemente Island. (He gave names to his discoveries, but all were renamed later.) He continued north as far as the Russian River before turning back to overwinter at Santa Catalina. Cabrillo died there of an infected injury on 3 January 1543. His second-in-command brought the ships and crew back to Navidad, arriving on 14 April 1543.Kelsey, Harry. 1986. Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo, pages 159-161. The Huntington Library, San Marino. San Salvador replica San Salvador replica build site, March 2013 Starting in spring 2011 and concluding in 2015, the Maritime Museum of San Diego built a full-sized, fully functional, historically accurate replica of San Salvador. The ship was constructed in full public view at Spanish Landing park on Harbor Drive in San Diego. The keel was laid on 15 April 2011. The construction site, called \\"San Salvador Village\\", opened 24 June 2011 and was open to the public. The project gave people the opportunity to see an example of sixteenth century shipbuilding, which was the first modern industrial activity in the Americas. The replica galleon is long with a beam of . When completed, San Salvador was launched on San Diego Bay and became part of the Museum's fleet of historic and replica ships. As of April 2015 construction was nearly completed, and a launch ceremony was planned for 19 April 2015. However, on April 8 the ceremony was postponed due to \\"unanticipated technical complications involving the movement and lifting of the ship\\". The ship was eventually moved by barge to a boatyard in Chula Vista. She made her public debut on 4 September 2015, leading a parade of tall ships for the start of San Diego's annual Festival of Sail. At that time she was powered by an auxiliary engine since she had not yet been fitted with sails. She opened for public tours in September 2016 and now sets sail regularly on public sightseeing tours. In 2018, her original mizzen lateen yard was replaced with a lighter version. The original was considered to be too heavy, resulting in difficulties maneuvering and possible damage to the mizzen mast. Over a dozen crew members were required to remove the original yard, while only four were need to place the replacement. Model of San Salvador Cabrillo's flagship San Salvador has been described as having four masts: a square-rigged foremast, lateen-rigged main and mizzen-masts and an even smaller mizzen-type mast with a boom that swung well outboard, in the style of the modern-day yawl. La Victoria is described as having two masts, both lateen rigged. A model of San Salvador was built by Se√±or Manuel Monmeneu in association with the Naval Museum in Madrid, Spain. The model project was sponsored by the Portuguese-American Social and Civic Club of San Diego. This model depicts San Salvador more like La Victoria, with two major masts.

The Boisgelin of Cuc√© are the Cadet branch of the maison de Boisgelin). His cousin is the famous author Louis de Boisgelin. Biography Boisgelin was born in Rennes. Achieving remarkable success in his studies at the seminary of Saint-Sulpice and the Sorbonne, the death of his elder brother made him the head of his family, and giving up his birthright, he dedicated his life to the Catholic Church. He rose rapidly through the hierarchy of the church, first made Vicar- General of Pontoise; then in 1765 he was created Bishop of Lavaur; and on 4 November 1770 he was appointed Archbishop of Aix in Provence. Boisgelin also had the honour of delivering the funeral orations of both of the future king Louis XVI's parents, the Dauphin in 1765, and the Dauphine in 1767. As Archbishop of Aix he won for himself the name of skillful administrator and princely benefactor. Provence owes to him the digging of a canal bearing his name, several works of public utility, such as a bridge at Lavaur and educational institutions for poor children. When in a time of scarcity and of political ferment, at the outset of the French Revolution, Aix was threatened with violence and famine, the archbishop by his firmness, great ascendancy, wisdom, and generosity, proved its savior. The mob had pillaged the public granaries, and had answered by insults the summons of authority; as president of the Estates of Provence, Boisgelin assembled the magistrates, chief citizens, and merchants, dispelled their fears, and prevailed upon these men to procure for Aix an abundant supply of grain, towards the payment of which he contributed one hundred thousand livres. He issued a pastoral letter to his clergy, asking them to urge the people to restore to the granaries the grain they had carried. away. The people obeyed and, flocking to the cathedral, expressed their gratitude. At the coronation of Louis XVI he delivered an address demanding relief for the impoverished. In 1776, he was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He was appointed in 1787 member of the Assembly of notables. French Revolution Boisgelin was elected to represent the higher clergy of his province at the States-General, in 1789 by the s√©n√©chauss√©e of Aix. His practical political wisdom and moderation appeared on many occasions; he voted, in the name of the clergy, for the union of the three orders, the abolition of feudal rights, and offered 400 million livres to the public treasury; but he opposed the abolition of tithes and the confiscation of church property. His political sagacity and eloquence made him the recognized leader and spokesman of thirty bishops, his colleagues in the assembly. He spoke the language of liberty and that of religion with equal eloquence; he would have every citizen share in the establishment and maintenance of the government, with his political rights as indestructible as his natural and civic rights. He served as one of the earlier presidents of the National Assembly (23 November - 4 December 1789). The majority of the assembly voted for the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. It denied the supreme jurisdiction of the pope, subjected ecclesiastics to the civil power, and decreed that all the members of the clergy, beginning with those in the assembly, should take the oath of allegiance to the constitution, under penalty of exile and the forfeiture of their salaries. Boisgelin rose to champion the cause of the Church: \\"Let the law\\", he exclaimed in the assembly, \\"leave us our honor and liberty; take back your salaries.\\" It was he who wrote the famous \\"Exposition of Principles\\", signed by all except four of the bishops of France, condemning the civil constitution; it was he who in the name of his colleagues corresponded during two years with Rome; he who in a letter, dated 3 May 1791, proposed to the bishops to lay their resignations at the feet of Pius VI; in 1801 he effectively made to Pope Pius VII the sacrifice not accepted by Pope Pius VI. In exile When persecutions drove him out of France he went to England. In his answer to a letter from Edmund Burke in which the orator expressed his admiration for the spirit of disinterestedness and dignity of character of the French episcopacy, he complained that he was expelled from France in the name of that liberty he had in perfect faith contributed to establish, and under whose protection he hoped to end his days. Boisgelin returned to France when Napoleon restored peace to the Church and to France by his Concordat, 15 July 1801. In 1802, he was raised to the archiepiscopal See of Tours and soon after created cardinal. Works In 1776 he was chosen member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. His works include: *\\"Collection de diverses pi√®ces en vers\\" (1783); *\\"L'art de juger d'apr√®s l'analogie des id√©es\\" (1789); *\\"Consid√©rations sur la paix publique adress√©es de la R√©volution\\" (1791); *\\"Exposition des principes sur la constitution du clerg√©\\" (1791); *\\"Le Psalmiste, traduction des Psaumes en vers\\" (1799); *\\"Traduction des H√©ro√Ødes d'Ovide\\" (1784).

Computer labs, and Science labs, as well as video rooms were built.  Patron saint  Saint Jean- Baptiste de la Salle = St. Jean-Baptiste de la Salle = see: Jean-Baptiste de la Salle St. Jean-Baptiste de la Salle was born in Rheims, France on April 30, 1651. He was 29 years old when he realized that the educational system of his day was inadequate to meet the needs of the poor children of seventeenth century France. To provide a Christian and human education, De La Salle founded a religious community of men, the Brothers of the Christian Schools (Fratres Scholarum Christianarum), dedicated to the instruction of youth, especially the poor. De La Salle died on Good Friday, April 7, 1719. He was canonized a saint of the Catholic Church in 1900 and declared \\"Universal Patron of All Teachers\\" by Pope Pius XII in 1950. The feast of St. Jean- Baptiste de La Salle is celebrated on the 15th of May by the worldwide Lasallian movement.

The state had authorized a limited form of domestic partnerships from 2002 to 2011, and the formation of civil unions from 2011 until the state began recognizing same-sex marriages in 2013.  History  Same-sex marriage was debated in the 1990s. Rhode Island State senator Catherine Graziano said in 1999 that \\"I have been married for 45 years and could never tolerate [same-sex marriage] or support it.\\" Despite such political opposition, in 2002 Rhode Island allowed unregistered domestic partnerships that provided a small number of legal benefits to same-sex couples. For example, the surviving spouse of such a partnership, if a police officer, fire fighter, or correctional officer, could receive a death benefit. Domestic partners could adjust their state taxes to reflect the costs of health insurance premiums. Domestic partners could control the funeral arrangements of a deceased partner. This status became inactive with the state's adoption of civil unions. In February 2007, Attorney General Patrick C. Lynch issued an opinion advising that same-sex marriages performed in Massachusetts be recognized in Rhode Island. He said that \\"his interpretation permitted recognition of the marriages, although he acknowledged that it was just an opinion and did not have the force of law.\\" The Human Rights Campaign noted that \\"This is not a binding opinion and the attorney general noted that this question will most likely be answered by the courts.\\" =Courts= In September 2006, Massachusetts Superior Court Justice Thomas E. Connolly ruled that same-sex couples who live in Rhode Island can marry in Massachusetts. The ruling was a response to a 1913 law that prohibited Massachusetts from performing marriages that were not legal in the couple's home state. The ruling did not affect the status of such marriages in Rhode Island. In December 2007, the Rhode Island Supreme Court held, in a 3‚Äì2 opinion, that the state's Family Court lacks jurisdiction to hear a divorce petition involving a same-sex couple who were married in Massachusetts. Justice William P. Robinson III wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice Frank J. Williams and Justice Frank Flaherty. Justice Paul Suttell's dissent was joined by Justice Maureen McKenna Goldberg. =Civil unions= Civil unions were issued by the state of Rhode Island between July 1, 2011 and August 1, 2013. In 2001, there was an attempt (similar to Vermont's Act 91) to create civil unions under Rhode Island's Domestic Relations Law (H01-5590). Any Rhode Island laws applying to marriage would have also applied to the newly created civil unions. The bill was introduced in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, but the Judiciary Committee defeated it. In May 2011, a bill to legalize civil unions was introduced in the Rhode Island General Assembly. On May 19, 2011, the bill passed the Rhode Island House of Representatives by a vote of 62‚Äì11, with two Representatives not voting. The Rhode Island Senate then passed bill on a vote of 21‚Äì16 on June 29. The Governor signed the bill on July 2, 2011, and the bill retroactively took effect as of July 1, 2011. The legislation included extensive and controversial exemptions that allow any religiously affiliated organization or institution, such as schools, universities and hospitals, to deny recognition of spouses in civil union, which made it unpopular with advocates of same-sex marriage. Participation in civil unions was very low. As of February 2012, only 46 couples had established civil unions. Civil unions became unavailable on August 1, 2013 when the bill legalizing same-sex marriage took effect, but existing civil unions are still recognized. = Marriage= In early 2011, legislation to legalize same-sex marriage was introduced. Governor Lincoln Chafee, an independent at the time, had previously indicated that he would sign such legislation if it were approved by the State Legislature. In April 2011, the legislation stalled due to lack of support in the Legislature and contentious debate. On May 14, 2012, Governor Chafee signed an executive order recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages. On January 3, 2013, Representative Arthur Handy and Senator Donna Nesselbush introduced legislation to legalize same-sex marriage. The House version had 42 of 75 members as sponsors, while the Senate version had 11 of 38. On January 7, Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin called the legislation \\"immoral and unnecessary\\" and recommended a referendum over enacting same-sex marriage by statute. Governor Chafee said on January 11 that he would probably veto such a referendum. The Episcopal Bishop of Rhode Island, W. Nicholas Knisely, said he was \\"eager to see our state legislature join many others across the country in passing legislation to ensure civil marriage equality.\\" The House Judiciary Committee approved the legislation unanimously on January 22. The House passed the bill on a 51-19 vote two days later. The Rhode Island Council of Churches endorsed the legislation on January 31. On April 23, all 5 Republican state senators announced their support for the legislation‚Äîthe first time a party's caucus in a State Legislature has supported same-sex marriage unanimously‚Äîand the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the legislation in a 7-4 vote while defeating a proposal to present the issue to voters as a referendum. On April 24, the Rhode Island Senate passed an amended version of the bill by a 26-12 vote. On April 30, the House Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the legislation. The House passed the legislation on May 2 on a vote of 56 to 15, and Chafee signed the legislation the same day. Bishop Tobin reiterated his opposition the same day and wrote a letter to Rhode Island Catholics that said \\"homosexual acts are ... always sinful\\" and advised that \\"Catholics should examine their consciences very carefully before deciding whether or not to endorse same-sex relationships or attend same-sex ceremonies. To do so might harm their relationship with God.\\" The legislation took effect on August 1, 2013. From that day, the definition of marriage in the state of Rhode Island has been the following:  Public opinion  An independent May 2009 poll conducted by Brown University showed that 60% of Rhode Islanders supported legalizing same-sex marriage, while 31% opposed doing so. Various polls have been commissioned by participants in the same-sex marriage debate, including by Rhode Island Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders and the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), which opposes same-sex marriage. The poll results reflect different question wording and sampling, with NOM's polls generally showing far weaker support for same-sex marriage than other polls. Forty-three percent of Rhode Islanders are Catholic. A survey by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research for Rhode Island Marriage Coalition in August 2010 showed that 63% of Catholics supported same- sex marriage provided it did not infringe on the church's right to choose whom it marries. Public Policy Polling reported that a poll taken in January 2013 found 57% of Rhode Island voters supported the legalization of same-sex marriage and 36% opposed legalization. Given other options, 31% preferred civil unions to marriage and 13% opposed all forms of legal recognition for same-sex relationships. A survey conducted by the Taubman Center for Public Policy at Brown University on February 21‚Äì23, 2013, found that 60.4% of Rhode Island voters supported same-sex marriage and 26.1% opposed. 2015 and 2016 PRRI polls found that 69% and 67% of Rhode Islanders supported same-sex marriage, respectively.The American Values Atlas: Rhode Island, 2015The American Values Atlas: Rhode Island, 2016 In 2017, support of same-sex marriage had increased to 78%, with 17% being opposed and 5% being undecided.The American Values Atlas: Rhode Island, 2017  See also  * LGBT rights in Rhode Island * Same-sex marriage in New England * Same-sex marriage in the United States  References  Category:Rhode Island law Category:LGBT in Rhode Island Category:2013 in LGBT history Rhode Island ","title":"Same-sex marriage in Rhode Island"},{"id":"10478399","text":"\\"This I Swear\\" is the second single from the album Now & Forever released by Kim Wilde in 1996.

The park began in 2007 as a project of (R)Evolution studios, a local artist group, and Syracuse's Public Arts Task Force (a sub-group within \\"40 Below\\", a project of the city's Metropolitan Development Agency). Its initial aim was to use an urban vacant lot as a space for creative activity for the community. History The inaugural exhibition, curated by Ty Marshal, featured the works of local and regional artists working primarily in steel, and commenced with an opening weekend for the park from June 1 to June 3, 2007. The park has since seen several seasonal shows and temporary installations, including the first long-term sculptural installation for the park, \\"Lipe Art Shark\\", a concrete and steel sculptural art wall and shelter structure by Brendan Rose, unveiled in May 2010. The project and the park itself are currently managed by the Stewards of Lipe Art Park (SLAP), a 'spin-off' of the Public Arts Task Force. =Charles Lipe shop= Lipe Art Park aims to nurture art and creativity in an urban, outdoor, public space and to foster a positive and dynamic vision for the community, celebrating Syracuse's rich history and natural environment. Located in a historically thriving, creative neighborhood (the near west side), Lipe Art Park was named after a local inventor and businessman, Charles E. Lipe, who owned the C. E. Lipe Machine Shop at 208 S. Geddes Street. Established in 1880, this shop became an incubator for inventors, with 360 patents coming from the building at the corner of S. Geddes and West Fayette Streets, in Syracuse. C.E. Lipe was known for his many inventions, including a cigar-rolling machine, a broom-winding machine, motion picture equipment, automatic looms and time recorders. =Local history= The park is located on an urban brownfield site where a multi-track train yard lay in the 19th and early 20th centuries, a yard whose round-house was the site of an important anti-slavery rally in 1852 at which the eminent abolitionist Frederick Douglass spoke. In addition to bringing art, art space, and an awareness of local history to the community, the park is intended to provide a beautiful place in which to experience art, history and nature. Landscape gardens and plantings will not only bring beauty and comfort to visitors, but will be used to begin to restore the ecological health of the brownfield site, and provide ecological information to the public in the process.

The town is situated some fifteen miles to the east of Toulouse. Lavaur had the reputation of being one of the strongest centers of Catharism, being referred to as sedes Satanae, atque erroris haeretici primatica ('seat of Satan and prime source of heretical error' The diocese consisted of some 80‚Äì90 parishes. It hosted one abbey, that of Sor√®z,Gallia christiana XIII, pp. 354-368. a convent of the Clarisses, a convent of the Daughters of the Cross, a convent of Dominicans, one of Franciscans, one of Capuchins, two of reformed Dominicans, and two houses of the Doctrinaires.Pr√™tres de la Doctrine Chr√©tienne (in Latin: Congregatio Patrum Doctrinae Christianae), founded in Avignon in 1582 by C√©sar de Bus. The diocese produced some 35,000 livres for the bishop. The diocese was abolished by the Concordat of 1801. History Huguenot control (purple) and influence (violet), 16th cent. The diocese had its primitive origins in a donation made in 1098 by three sons of Guillaume Seigneur of the chateau of Lavaur, one of whom was Isarn, the Bishop of Toulouse. They gave to the monks of Saint-Pons the church of Saint-√âlan (Alain) in the territory of Toulouse, not far from their chateau, on the left bank of the River Ago√ªt; the church was in need of rebuilding; the mission of the monks was to rebuild the church, around which grew a small town (villa). During the Albigensian Crusade the town, which was politically in the County of Toulouse and subject to the heretic Count Raymond of Toulouse, was besieged.Compayr√©, pp. 458-459. The town was fortified in the 13th century. The monastery church became the Cathedral of Saint-Alain in the fourteenth century, when the diocese was created.Gallia christiana XIII, p. 331. De Vic and Vaissete, p. 448 (added by the later editors). Pope John XXII created the diocese of Lavaur in a bull dated 22 February 1317.Gallia christiana XIII, Instrumenta no. ix, pp. 268-271. The Cathedral Chapter had twelve Canons,Gallia christiana XIII, p. 331. De Vic and Vaissete, p. 438. among whom were the dignities of Provost,Gallia christiana XIII, pp. 352-355. Archdeacon, Sacristan, and Precentor. The Bishop had a vote in Chapter meetings, though he was not a member of the Chapter. There were also four hebdomidary chaplains and twenty-eight ordinary chaplains. From 1622, the town of Lavaur became headquarters for the royal operations against Henri, Duke of Rohan. The Count de Vieule was named Governor of Castres and Lavaur, and the C√©sar, Duke of Vend√¥me, the natural brother of Louis XIII, was placed in charge of operations.Compayr√©, p. 461. Under Louis XIV, the King took a more active role in determining the talents of prospective bishops of Lavaur.Compayr√©, p. 470. In 1671 the city of Lavaur had approximately 3,000 Catholics, and the diocese had approximately 65 parishes.Ritzler, V, p. 406, note 1. In 1768, there were perhaps 4,000 Catholics, and there were 88 parishes.Ritzler, VI, p. 433, note 1. A list of the parishes and their personnel is given by Th. Bessery, \\"L'√©tat des paroisses du dioc√®se de Lavaur √† la fin de l'Ancien R√©gime,\\" Albia Christiana 9 (1912), pp. 251-273. =The French Revolution= In 1790 the Constituent Assembly passed a number of anti- Catholic laws, the culmination of which was the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which reduced the number of dioceses in France from 135 to 83, and made these dioceses coterminous with the new civil administrative districts, the 'd√©partements'. The old dioceses were abolished. Clergy were to be provided with salaries, but they were required to take an oath of allegiance to the State. Bishops were to be elected by the electors of each department, rather than appointed by the King and approved by the Pope, as had been provided for in the Concordat of Bologna of 1516 between Francis I and Leo X. An elector need not be a Catholic, which meant that non-Catholics would be taking part in the selection of Catholic bishops. The inevitable result was schism between the French 'Constitutional Church' and the Roman Catholic Church. The diocese of Lavaur, which was on the schedule of dioceses to be abolished, was subsumed into the new 'dioc√®se de Tarn', a suffragan of the Metropole du Sud, with its seat at Albi. The electors of Tarn duly met at Castres on 13‚Äì15 March 1791, and elected Abb√© Jean-Joachim Gausserand as their Constitutional Bishop; it was presumed that Cardinal de Bernis, in refusing to take the oath, had resigned the See of Albi. The Bishop of Lavaur had protested and fled to Spain. Gausserand was consecrated in Paris on 3 April 1791 by the Metropolitan of Rhone-et-Loire (Lyon), Antoine-Adrien Lamourette. The new bishop's reception in Albi was frosty, and in Lavaur it was icy. After the Terror, when religion was reconstituted, Gausserand discovered that he had lost 200 priests through abdication, and that 40 were married; several had left their priestly duties and were functioning as civil administrators. In 1797 he admitted that fewer than 100 priests continued to function in the 'diocese of Tarn'. When the Concordat of 1801 was negotiated between First Consul Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII, Gausserand refused to submit or recant, and, when steps were being taken in 1808 to place him under Interdict, he removed himself to Toulouse. He died on 12 February 1820. In the implementation of the Concordat of 1801, the diocese of Lavaur was not restored.

He is also noted for the design of stage and acoustics as well as interactive media and software. He has received recognition for his work from a number of festivals in Europe and has won two Swedish Grammis awards. He has been a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music since 1998. Biography =Education= Parmerud was born in Lidk√∂ping, Sweden. After working as a photographer from 1972 to 1974, Parmerud began his music studies in 1978 at the H√∂gskolan f√∂r Scen och Musik (Conservatory of Theatre and Music) at the University of Gothenburg, where his teachers included the electronic-music composer and visual artist Rune Lindblad. He also studied with electronic-music pioneer Lars Gunnar Bodin Electronic Music Studio (EMS) in Stockholm (Peterson 2001; Parmerud n.d.). =Career= Parmerud has been active since the 1970s in music (instrumental and electro-acoustic), multimedia and interactive art and music for videos, dance and cinema (Anon. 2011a). He has been commissioned to write works for institutions in Canada, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Norway and Denmark. His music represented Swedish radio at the Prix Italia on two occasions (Parmerud n.d.; Anon. 2011b). As a stage performer, Parmerud does electro- acoustic music alone or with other artists, mostly in Europe, Mexico, and Canada (Parmerud n.d.). His performances includes music, video, and performance, with his narratives often ending without a conclusion, leaving that up to the audience (Anon 2011a; Parmerud n.d.). During the late 1980s and 1990s he worked extensively together with composer Anders Blomqvist, with whom he wrote the music for a two-hour documentary on Greta Garbo, which in turn produced Strings and Shadows, in which the harp's sounds are transformed electronically (Peterson 2001). Their live performances, sometimes including fireworks, toured several countries in Europe (Parmerud n.d.; Anon. 2011b) Appearances in Mexico include participation in the Visiones Sonores event in Morelia in 2010 to present ‚ÄúHyperspace, a presentation of new 3D sound software‚Äù and a composition called ‚ÄúCrystal Counterpoint.‚Äù He presented a piece called ‚ÄúBlowUp‚Äù in Mexico City, a piece commissioned by Espacio de Experimentaci√≥n Sonora of the Museo Universitario de Arte Contemp√≥raneo (Anon. 2010a; Anon. 2010b). His most recent performance in Mexico is at the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Guanajuato in 2011 (Anon. 2011a). Parmerud has had some performances in the United States. In 1997, ‚ÄúGrains of Voices‚Äù was performed on United Nations Day at the organization's New York headquarters (Parmerud n.d.; Anon. 2011b). At the Other Minds Festival he performed a piece called \\"La vie m√©canique\\" (\\"The Mechanical Life\\") generated entirely from machine sounds which include electronically generated sounds of planes taking off, humming refrigerators, clanking brakes and the release of steam from a train (Scheinin 2008). For the last decade, Parmerud has been dedicated to acoustic design, designing facilities in Berlin, Paris, Mexico City and Reykjav√≠k (Anon. 2011a). He has designed concerts and has been the artistic director of large indoor and outdoor audio-visual events (Parmerud n.d.; Anon. 2011b). He founded AudioTechture with Olle Niklasson, a company which specializes in acoustic interior design from homes to public spaces. He has worked as a sound and software designer for interactive audio-visual installations. Works such as ‚ÄúThe Fire Inside,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Living Room‚Äù and ‚ÄúLost Angel‚Äù have been shown in Berlin, Paris, Mexico City, Leon, Gothenburg and Reykjav√≠k (Anon. 2011b). From 1999 to 2006, he worked with the Danish group Boxiganga to develop new interactive video installations and stage design. From 2000 to 2002, he worked with Canadian choreographer Pierre-Paul Savoi composing as well as designing software and sound. A work called the ‚ÄúSeventh Sense‚Äù was developed with Canadian choreographer Mireille Leblanc (Parmerud n.d.; Anon. 2011b). Musical style Although he has written instrumental and multimedia music, he is most noted for his electro-acoustic music, which often combines tapes with instruments or voices. This characteristically results in processes of interaction and transformation between the different sound sources, as well as within one voice, instrument, or chord. Examples include Remain, for orchestra and tape, Alias (based on vocal sounds and quotations from John Dowland and Carlo Gesualdo), and Retur, for saxophone quartet and tape (Peterson 2001). One of his works, called Grains of Voices, is based on recordings made in various parts of the world, examining the human voice in various states. The texts of its various sections are based on the Biblical Creation story, nursery rhymes, prayers, and poems (Peterson 2001). This includes indigenous chants, opera, protests, improvisation, prayer and recordings from television, radio and other media, as well as poetry from Hemingway, Hesse, and Joyce. It focuses on language, the role of voice, and how it relates to music. The piece was first performed live at the United Nations headquarters due to its international nature (Anon 2011a). Honours Parmerud is one of Sweden's best-known musicians outside of the country. His first major recognition was in 1978 when his piece ‚ÄúProximities‚Äù received first prize at the international music festival in Bourges, France, since then receiving twelve more from the same festival (Anon. 2011b). He has received honors from the Prix Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria, Metamorfosis in Belgium, Electronic Arts Award in Sweden, Noroit Prize in France, and the ICMA Prize for Composition. More recent awards include the Gigahertz Preis in Germany in 2008 and the Qwartz Pierre Shaeffer Prize in France in 2009 (Anon. 2011b). He has received two Swedish Grammis awards for best classical album of the year (Parmerud n.d.; Anon. 2011b). He has been a member of The Swedish Royal Academy of Music since 1998 (Parmerud n.d.). Recordings His work has been issued on two vinyl albums and two CDs, appearing on many more as a contributor (Anon. 2011b). * Jeu d'ombres (empreintes DIGITALes, IMED 0367, 2003) * Grains of Voices (Caprice, CAP 21579, 1996) * Osynlig Musik / Invisible Music / Musique invisible (Phono Suecia, PSCD 72, 1994) * Maze; Y√†n (Caprice, CAP 1320, 1987) * Yttringar (Ton Art, TONART 17, 1984) List of works * Alias, for tape (1990) * Bows, Arcs and The Arrow of Time (2004), string orchestra, computer, and video * Coda (1984) * Cut 1, 2, 3 Progress (1996) * Dreaming in Darkness (2005), 6-track tape * Efterbild (1997‚Äì98), orchestra, and computer * L'espace qui vous regarde (2001), audiovisual installation * √âxor (1986), piano * The Fire Inside (2000), audiovisual installation * Floden av Glas (The River of Glass) (1978‚Äì81), incidental music * Les fl√ªtes en feu (1999) * Genom landskap av glas (1976) * Grains of Voices (1994‚Äì95) * The Heart of Silence (1997‚Äì98), multimedia (choir, electroacoustic tape, photography, and dance) * Inori (1987), harpsichord, and synthezeiser * Inside Looking Out (1992), ensemble instrumental, ordinateur et bande * Intermediate I (1994) * Intermediate II (1994) * Intermediate III (1994) * Intermediate IV (1994) * Isola (1985‚Äì86), chamber orchestra, and tape * Jeux imaginaires (1993) * Kr√©n (1983) * Lost Angel (2004), interactive audiovisual installation, and dance performance * Mandala (1983) * Maze (1985‚Äì86) * Mirage (1995‚Äì96), chamber ensemble, and tape * N√§rheter (fr√•n ig√•r och natten) (1978), text-sound * Les objets obscurs (1991) * Out of Sight (1981) * Phoenix I (1997) * Prolog (1981) * Proximities (1978) * Reed my Lips (1990), wind quintet, and tape * Remain (1980), orchestra, and tape * Renaissance (1994) * Repulse (1986) * Retur (1992‚Äì93), saxophone quartet, and tape * Rit (1981) * Ritual Melodies (1990) * Strata: m√©moires d'un amoureux (2001), music for the choreography by Pierre-Paul Savoie * Stringquartett (1988) * Strings & Shadows (1993), harp, and tape * SubString Bridge (1999), guitar, and interactive computer * Tangent (1989) * Tide In (2001), two singers, and motion tracking system * Time's Imaginary Eye (1979), soprano, and tape (with slides) * La vie m√©canique (2004) * Y√†n (1985), percussion ensemble, and tape * Yttringar (1983), soprano, cello, trombone, piano, 3 percussions, and tape * Zeit aus Zeit (The Stockhausen Variations) (2001‚Äì02), piano, percussion, and live electronics References *Anon. 2010a.

Mobile computing is less well established than mobile telephony, partly because of the lack of a common standard infrastructure for secure seamless mobile computing for the Internet. With the increasing number of mobile workers, a secure mobile architecture specification is needed to allow businesses and individuals to maintain secure connections when moving or mobile. Secure Mobile Architecture (SMA) grew from work in The Open Group's (TOG) Mobile Management Forum (MMF). The MMF developed a demonstration of proprietary seamless secure session management across different networks, which was given at The Open Group Conference in Berlin, April 2001. This led to the development by the MMF together with The Open Group Directory Interoperability Forum (DIF) of the Business Scenario ‚Äì The Executive on the Move. This business scenario described the requirements for directories to support mobile computing. The Open Group then worked on a Challenge to vendors of directories and related products to provide support for mobile computing. The SMA activity became a task group in The Open Group and the participants developed the Secure Mobile Architecture (SMA) over a three-year period, publishing in February 2004. The architecture described in the SMA Vision and Architecture was developed by a team of Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, Motorola, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Netmotion Wireless, Wheatstone Consulting and the University of St Thomas. Its central features were the use of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP), cryptographic identities, secure directories, and location to make policy-based information about users and the network available to applications, management systems, and intelligent network components. A directory schema appropriate for this purpose was developed and worked out in detail. Secure Mobile Architecture Components *Host Identity Payload (HIP): provides a mechanism by which the identity of the equipment or its user is carried securely in every packet. *Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): provides cryptographic identities for the HIP protocol. *Secure Directory: retains information about the user, the owner, the machine, and other policy relevant information. *Location: the location of the user or computing device is an integral part of the secure and mobile architecture. Starting in 2004, Boeing developed an SMA implementation for its Intranet- connected moving production lines and its secure mobile computing requirements. The intent is to provide the Boeing implementation of SMA as an open-source, open-standards approach to secure mobile computing. The Open Group is envisioned to be the holder of that implementation. An SMA Alliance is being considered to expand the broadened use of SMA for enterprises or any organization in need of a secure seamless mobile computing infrastructure.

By the end of the War he was promoted to the rank of Captain. He was one of Lt. General James Longstreet's most trusted aides.Lt Thomas Jewett Goree Early life Thomas J. Goree was born on November 14, 1835 in Marion, Alabama. At age 15, he and family moved to Huntsville, Texas. At age 18, he attended Baylor College, from which he graduated with a Law degree. With other partners, he formed a law firm in Montgomery, Texas in 1858, later moving it to Houston. At the start of the American Civil War in 1861 he left his law firm and headed for Virginia to volunteer for the Confederacy. Civil War Service On the boat from Galveston, Texas to New Orleans, he met Maj. James Longstreet, who had resigned his commission in the United States Army and was also traveling to Virginia to offer his services to the Confederate states. Lt. Goree, who was eventually promoted to captain, served as Longstreet's aide throughout the war and was involved in almost every battle in which Longstreet's corps took part, from Blackburn's Ford to Appomattox. He was never wounded, although he had several horses shot out from under him and his clothing was riddled with bullet holes. Postbellum Goree Unit After Appomattox, Goree accompanied Longstreet home to Alabama. Goree returned to Texas in 1865 and took over operations at the Raven Hill Plantation near Huntsville, which his mother had purchased in 1858. He ran the plantation and continued to practice law until 1869. On June 25, 1868, Goree married Elizabeth Thomas Nolley who was head of Andrew Female College at Huntsville. The couple spent a year at the Raven Hill Plantation and then moved to the Moffattville Plantation near Midway in Madison County. In Midway, Goree operated a general mercantile business, Goree and Wakefield, while his wife organized a school. In 1873, the Goree family returned to Huntsville, where he formed a law partnership with Col. Leonard Anderson Abercrombie. That year, Goree was appointed a member of the board of directors, later board of commissioners, of the Texas State Prisons. In 1877, Governor Richard B. Hubbard appointed Goree superintendent of the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville, a title that was later changed to superintendent of penitentiaries. He served in that position for the next fourteen years. In 1891 he became the general agent for the Birmingham Iron Company, New Birmingham, Texas, and in 1893 he was named assistant general manager of the Texas Land and Loan Company at Galveston. The Goree Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, was named in honor of TJ Goree in 1935. The unit houses the state's Sex Offender Treatment Program and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Processing Center for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The unit is accredited by the American Correctional Association. Death Thomas Jewett Goree died of pneumonia in Galveston on March 5, 1905. He and Elizabeth had five children. One grandchild was the noted Texas artist and author John W. Thomason Jr. Thomas J. Goree and Elizabeth Goree are buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Huntsville, Texas. In popular media Goree was portrayed by Ivan Kane in Gettysburg the 1993 film version of Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels.

Fulton Eugene Eason (May 28, 1928 ‚Äì March 25, 2007) was a businessman from Springhill, Louisiana, who ran as a Republican in four elections for the Louisiana House of Representatives in calendar year 1991. He won the special election runoff on March 23 for a 9-month unexpired term from District 10, then encompassing all of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana. Eason was the first Republican ever to seek election to the heavily Democratic Webster Parish seat in the Louisiana House. Background Eason was born in Clarks, a lumbering town in Caldwell Parish, to Fulton Filmore Eason (1898‚Äì1968) and the former Jewel Parker (1901‚Äì1974), but he lived most of his life in Springhill, where he managed Stauffer Chemical Company for thirty-seven years.Eason advertisement, Minden Press-Herald January 15, 1991. Eason was twice a member of the Springhill City Council, having served from 1966 to 1970 and 1987 to 1991. From 1975 to 2006, he was a member of the Webster Parish Library Board, much of that time as the board vice-president under the president, Henry Grady Hobbs (1923‚Äì2012). Coincidentally, Hobbs, an attorney, twice lost races for the District 10 legislative seat. Eason served too on the Louisiana Highway 7 Corridor Commission, the Office of Community Services, and the North Webster Parish Industrial Board. He was a member of Rotary International and the Central Baptist Church of Springhill.Eugene Eason obituary, Minden Press-Herald, March 26, 2007. Legislative campaigns In addition to Eason, two educators, both since deceased, sought the representative position, Ralph Lamar Rentz, Sr. (1930‚Äì1995), the former Webster Parish School Board personnel director, and Faye Newsome, the principal of Minden High School, but neither polled sufficient votes to enter the determining runoff election. In the first balloting Eason trailed Patti Lou Cook Odom of Minden. She is the daughter of Thelma Louise \\"Lou\\" Cook (died 1994)\\"Services Slated for Lou Cook,\\" Minden Press-Herald, March 30, 1994, p. 1. and Harold Ray \\"Boe\\" Cook (1925‚Äì1997), who came to Minden in 1961 and became co-owners of the Minden radio station KASO. Odom's husband, Charles Deck Odom, is a former member of the Webster Parish Police Jury. Her son, Chad Odom, ran unsuccessfully in 2014 for mayor of Minden; he was narrowly defeated by the Republican incumbent Tommy Davis. In the runoff campaign for the state House, Eason challenged Odom from the political right. He questioned her backing for affirmative action, minority set-aside arrangements on public contracts, abortion, the Second Amendment, the 1984 Mondale-Ferraro ticket. Eason said that he had been supporting Ronald W. Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush while Odom was backing liberal Democratic candidates.Eugene Eason advertisement, Minden Press-Herald, March 22, 1991, p. 18. In 1987, Odom was elected to the Louisiana Democratic State Central Committee,Minden Press- Herald, September 24, 1987, p. 1. which Eason called a liberal political group. Eason defeated Odom, 3,659 (52.5 percent) to 3,309 votes (47.5 percent). With little time to accumulate a legislative record., he concentrated his attention to efforts to promote economic development and highway expansion within District 10. On November 16, 1991 Eason was unseated in the regular general election by the Democrat Everett Doerge, a retired school administrator from Minden. Doerge polled 8,389 ballots (50.03 percent) to Eason's 8,318 (49.97 percent), a margin of 71 votes. This election occurred at the same time that the Democrat Edwin Washington Edwards staged his fourth- term comeback in a nationally watched race against outgoing State Representative David Duke, a former figure in the Ku Klux Klan from Jefferson Parish.Louisiana Secretary of State, General election returns, November 16, 1991, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 2003, two members of the Webster Parish Police Jury, including Charles Odom, the husband of Eason's former legislative opponent, and Daniel Thomas, questioned Eason's long-term tenure as the chairman of the North Webster Industrial Park. The two jurors proposed that Charles Jacobs, then the city attorney for Springhill and later a judge of the Louisiana 26th Judicial District Court, be appointed to replace Eason on the industrial park board. Odom and Thomas claimed that Eason had been unwilling to cooperate with other industrial park members and municipal and parish officials in the administration of the facility. However, jurors voted 8‚Äì2 to retain Eason in the position. \\"The park speaks for itself. It is growing and successful. We've done a lot and we have a lot of good things on the horizon. ... All someone has to do is take a drive through the area and see how good things are going. I think I've done a damn good job and trust me, it hasn't been easy,\\" Eason said. Until 2018, Eason had been the only Republican since Reconstruction to have represented this particular legislative seat. The seat is now held by the second Republican in the position, Wayne McMahen of Springhill, who succeeded Harlie Eugene Reynolds of Dubberly, another retired educator, who resigned in 2018 from the state House to accept a position in the administration of Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards . Family and death Eason and his wife, the former Frances Smith, an educator, married on July 15, 1951. The couple had four children, John Wesley Eason of Victoria, Texas, Joy Kathleen Langston of Magnolia, Arkansas, David Eugene Eason of Houston, Texas, and Barbara Jean Dees of Springhill, Louisiana.

He was a professor at Tel Aviv University and winner of the 1990 Bialik Prize for Hebrew literature. His life and his research activity Kasher grew up in Kfar Vitkin, where he graduated from elementary school and high school. In his youth he wrote the radio feuilleton \\"Hilik Haviv\\" with his childhood friends and classmates Gad Yaacobi (later a government minister and member of the Knesset) and Micha Gisser (later professor of economics at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico). In the Israeli army, he served at the Nahal. He began his history teaching in Emek Hefer regional school in the early 1960s. He received a MA from Tel Aviv University‚Äîthe subject of his thesis, completed in 1966, was history background and messianism in Assumption of Moses. Kasher received his PhD in Jewish studies from Tel Aviv University in 1973. The dissertation subject was \\"The jurisric-political class and the rights system of the Jews of Egypt in the Hellenistic period and the Roman Principate\\". His advisor was . taught him and influenced his work. Kasher taught Jewish history in Tel Aviv University for many years and led the Center for the Study of Israel and its Settlements at Tel Aviv University, affiliated to Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi Institute. He retired in 2005. His speciality was the history of the Jews and Land of Israel during the Second Temple period. Awards In 1990, Kasher was the co-recipient (jointly with ) of the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought. His books =Jews, Idumaeans and Ancient Arabs= His book deals with two major subjects: first, the Idumeans Judaizing, located in Idumea and the Yturs in the Galilee and their integrating in the Jewish society. The Judaizing action describe in the Hellenistic Historiography as an act of compulsion by the Hasmonean, in order to abase their name. Kasher argues that the judaising conducted out of good will and cooperation of the nations who judaized with the Hasmonean. He examines the consequences of the Hellenistic influence in the Idumean society, and its implications on their relations with the neighbor Jewish nation, even though in the Bible the Idumean accused in co-operation with Babylon power and the ruin of Jerusalem and the temple in the year 586 BCE. The second part of the book deals with the Nabataeans relations with the Jews from 332 BCE to 70 AD. The relations start with great friendship in the beginning of the Hashmonean period and ends in the Alexander Jannaeus wars and the Roman rule. It is a pioneering monographic research, that was held in the first time by Aryeh Kasher. till his research historians used to study specially the Jewish People and the regime that conquer the country and hardly look for the non Jewish Israel country inhabitants. This because we hardly have national history papers of this nations authors, the archeological finding about them is scarce and the majority of the knowledge we have is from Josephus, who describe them through their relations with the Jewish people. =Kenaan, Paleshet, Yavan ve-Yisrael= The book describes the history of the Jews relating to their relations with the Hellenistic cities in Israel country, in chronological order, during the period from the country conquest by Alexander the Great till the end of the big revolt against the Romans. The Jews saw the citizens of the Hellenistic cities as the heirs of Canaan and the Philistines from the Biblical period, whom the Hasmonean try to distinct, in the spirit of the Biblians saying. with all that accompany political, economical and cultural rival, that gather strength since the Hellenistic period. =King Herod: A Persecuted Persecutor= Pioneers research about Herod the Great. Psychological biography about in collaborate with the psychiatrist professor . The book stands as an antithesis to : Herod the Great: the man and his deed, third edition, Bialik Institute, 1964. In this book Shalit describe Herod as king that contribute a great deal to the Jewish People due to his monumental building enterprises. Kasher choose in his study to another aspect in Herod personality: his murderousness and interpret him as suffer from a paranoid illness. Kasher's research based on Josephus's writing as a main source of knowledge. He was assisted by professor Witztum that using the psychological research tools in order to decipher the complex personality of Herod and diagnose his illness as inferiority complex, a man that murder his closest relatives and anyone who he suspect by the least sign of treason, including his wife and three sons.

It is Bresson's first film in color, and adapted from Fyodor Dostoevsky's 1876 short story \\"A Gentle Creature\\" (). The film is set in contemporary Paris. The tragedy is characterised by Bresson's well known ascetic style, without any dynamic sequences or professional actors' experienced and excessive expressions. Dominique Sanda, who plays the titular \\"gentle woman\\", made her debut in the film, starting her career as an actress. Bresson chose her just as a result of her first voice call. Although the film applies a background of 1960s Paris, such as Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle and Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, its theme adheres closely to the novella. Bresson subsequently made another adaptation of Dostoevsky, his next film Quatre nuits d'un r√™veur (Four Nights of a Dreamer) (1971) based on White Nights. Plot The film opens with a falling scarf, leading us to a young woman's dead body on the street. From the later scenes, we understand that the young woman was Elle (Dominique Sanda), who steps off the balcony of her Parisian apartment, plunging to her death. Why has she done it? As her distraught husband, Luc (Guy Frangin), looks over her dead body, and explores what led her to kill herself in a talk to the maid, the picture traces their lives together in flashbacks. Elle is A Gentle Creature‚Äîmeek, dreamy and thoughtful. She entrances Luc, who pursues her passionately. They marry, but the match never seems right. The story reveals their desperate, despairing miscommunication. Though they try many diversions (theater, television, films) these are momentary respites for the two of them (for Elle more-so, as we see with her interest in Hamlet, which plays out in an extended scene). Their dialogue only deepens her isolation and sadness.

IOI, which is listed on the Malaysian Stock Exchange or Bursa Malaysia, is a conglomerate managing oil palm plantations, producing specialty fats and oleochemicals, and developing property in Malaysia, Indonesia, the United States, and Europe. The IOI refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands is the largest palm oil refinery in Europe. IOI's oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia produce palm oil and palm kernel oil. These oils are made into specialty oils, metallic stearates and fats that are used in soaps, detergents, cosmetics and food additives. IOI Group is a leading real estate developer in Malaysia. Projects include townships, shopping malls, condominiums, office towers, and resorts. Early life Lee grew up northeast of Kuala Lumpur on a rubber plantation, where his father ran a small Chinese food shop. He left school at the age of 11 to help support his family, selling ice cream on a bicycle for four years before returning to finish high school. He thought work with one oil palm plantation company for a supervisory job, but was turned down. The reason given‚Äîhe didn't speak fluent English‚Äîimportant then because Europeans still owned most of the plantations. Lee, who was then only 22, was undeterred by Dunlop Estate's rejection. He went on to get a field supervisor's job with at another palm oil company. Twenty years later, Lee bought Dunlop Estate. In 2008, he recalled the happiest day of his life in an interview with the New Straits Times, saying, \\"My happiest day was in 1989 when I bought Dunlop Estate from Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd. This was because during the late 1960s, I had applied for a job at Dunlop Estate but they did not employ me because I was not adequately qualified. If they had employed me, I would probably not have owned the entire asset of Dunlop Estate today. This purchase marked a significant milestone in my life\\". Tree talker Lee adopted a hands-on managerial style and focused on maximizing palm oil yields. Lee's walkabouts on IOI's 152,000 hectares of oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia earned him the \\"tree talker\\" moniker among journalists, rival plantation companies, and bankers in Malaysia. At an awards reception speech in July 2009, Lee remarked on his moniker, saying, \\"I am always quoted as talking to the trees, so it looks like I have to continue talking to the trees to get another award\\".

The original setting was for the Riemann sphere, where it was about the existence of regular differential equations with prescribed monodromy groups. First the Riemann sphere may be replaced by an arbitrary Riemann surface and then, in higher dimensions, Riemann surfaces are replaced by complex manifolds of dimension > 1. There is a correspondence between certain systems of partial differential equations (linear and having very special properties for their solutions) and possible monodromies of their solutions. Such a result was proved for algebraic connections with regular singularities by Pierre Deligne (1970) and more generally for regular holonomic D-modules by Masaki Kashiwara (1980, 1984) and Zoghman Mebkhout (1980, 1984) independently. Statement Suppose that X is a smooth complex algebraic variety. Riemann‚ÄìHilbert correspondence (for regular singular connections): there is a functor Sol called the local solutions functor, that is an equivalence from the category of flat connections on algebraic vector bundles on X with regular singularities to the category of local systems of finite-dimensional complex vector spaces on X. For X connected, the category of local systems is also equivalent to the category of complex representations of the fundamental group of X. The condition of regular singularities means that locally constant sections of the bundle (with respect to the flat connection) have moderate growth at points of Y ‚àí X, where Y is an algebraic compactification of X. In particular, when X is compact, the condition of regular singularities is vacuous. More generally there is the Riemann‚ÄìHilbert correspondence (for regular holonomic D-modules): there is a functor DR called the de Rham functor, that is an equivalence from the category of holonomic D-modules on X with regular singularities to the category of perverse sheaves on X. By considering the irreducible elements of each category, this gives a 1:1 correspondence between isomorphism classes of *irreducible holonomic D-modules on X with regular singularities, and *intersection cohomology complexes of irreducible closed subvarieties of X with coefficients in irreducible local systems. A D-module is something like a system of differential equations on X, and a local system on a subvariety is something like a description of possible monodromies, so this correspondence can be thought of as describing certain systems of differential equations in terms of the monodromies of their solutions. In the case X has dimension one (a complex algebraic curve) then there is a more general Riemann‚ÄìHilbert correspondence for algebraic connections with no regularity assumption (or for holonomic D-modules with no regularity assumption) described in Malgrange (1991), the Riemann‚ÄìHilbert‚ÄìBirkhoff correspondence. Examples An example where the theorem applies is the differential equation : \\\\frac{df}{dz} = \\\\frac{a}{z}f on the punctured affine line A1 ‚àí {0} (that is, on the nonzero complex numbers C ‚àí {0}). Here a is a fixed complex number. This equation has regular singularities at 0 and ‚àû in the projective line P1. The local solutions of the equation are of the form cza for constants c. If a is not an integer, then the function za cannot be made well-defined on all of C ‚àí {0}. That means that the equation has nontrivial monodromy. Explicitly, the monodromy of this equation is the 1-dimensional representation of the fundamental group 1(A1 ‚àí {0}) = Z in which the generator (a loop around the origin) acts by multiplication by e2ia. To see the need for the hypothesis of regular singularities, consider the differential equation : \\\\frac{df}{dz} = f on the affine line A1 (that is, on the complex numbers C). This equation corresponds to a flat connection on the trivial algebraic line bundle over A1. The solutions of the equation are of the form cez for constants c. Since these solutions do not have polynomial growth on some sectors around the point ‚àû in the projective line P1, the equation does not have regular singularities at ‚àû. (This can also be seen by rewriting the equation in terms of the variable w := 1/z, where it becomes : \\\\frac{df}{dw} = -\\\\frac{1}{w^2}f. The pole of order 2 in the coefficients means that the equation does not have regular singularities at w = 0, according to Fuchs's theorem.) Since the functions cez are defined on the whole affine line A1, the monodromy of this flat connection is trivial. But this flat connection is not isomorphic to the obvious flat connection on the trivial line bundle over A1 (as an algebraic vector bundle with flat connection), because its solutions do not have moderate growth at ‚àû. This shows the need to restrict to flat connections with regular singularities in the Riemann‚ÄìHilbert correspondence. On the other hand, if we work with holomorphic (rather than algebraic) vector bundles with flat connection on a noncompact complex manifold such as A1 = C, then the notion of regular singularities is not defined. A much more elementary theorem than the Riemann‚ÄìHilbert correspondence states that flat connections on holomorphic vector bundles are determined up to isomorphism by their monodromy.

Concept Each year in the end of September, the festival offers a programme at 20 venues (in- and outdoor) in the city centre with more than 200 artists from over 25 countries, all presenting their creative vision about what Art is Today in terms of music, video and visual arts, film, photography, fashion, performing arts, theatre, contemporary dance and other disciplines and crossovers. Unique and custom-made productions and performances by the world's most creative artists can be expected at this 3 nights lasting annual festival. Partners TodaysArt works closely together with partners such as Club Transmediale from Berlin - Germany, Mutek from Montreal - Canada, DEAF from Rotterdam - The Netherlands and Wasted festival from Berlin - Germany. Pre-History TodaysArt festival originated from a pilot-festival called Sound/Vision, held on the Malieveld in The Hague on the hot summer day of July 27, 2002. Due to problems with the local council regarding noise nuisance, further editions of Sound/Vision were not organised in the future. The organisation of the pilot outdoor festival Sound/Vision, The Generator Foundation, started to focus towards the organisation of an indoor multidisciplinary festival in close cooperation with various cultural locations and sites in the city centre of The Hague. In September 2003 the first edition of the Cultuurnacht was being held on Saturday 20 September 2003 and an immediate success. With a diverse program, amongst 5.000 visitors enjoyed the first edition. Saturday 25 September 2 edition of Cultuurnacht took place and the growth of locations, acts, artistic inspiration and visitors was evident. History =2005= In 2005 the organisation decided the Cultuurnacht had outgrown its name. Due to a more and more global focus, without forgetting to promote and stimulate local talent, the name changed into TodaysArt festival. This 3rd edition expanded to two days (23 & 24 September) and nights instead of one, to cover an even broader spectrum of multidisciplinary acts and performances. Club Transmediale from Berlin hosted one of the bigger venues during one night. Online livestreaming from the main locations was added to the festival website in order to serve foreign virtual visitors. Highlights: Nederlands Dans Theater II =2006= In 2006 TodaysArt intensified their cooperation with the Royal Art Academy and the Royal Conservatory. Furthermore, an ever-growing cooperation with Club Transmediale resulted amongst others in one location being organised by their partner: Wasted festival, by Donna Summer aka Jason Forrest and DJ Pure. =2007= In 2007, the third edition of the TodaysArt Festival took place at more than 25 locations in the city centre, both in- and outdoor. The program consisted of more than 200 artists from over 25 countries, representing a broad spectrum of (electronic) music and (multimedia) art disciplines. The festival took place on 21 and 22 September 2007 in the city centre of The Hague, and was codenamed THX: The Hague International Airport. Among the musical genres represented were: dubstep, techno, detroit, hiphop, Italo disco, rave, disco, ambient, minimal, dancehall, hiphop, baila funk, darkcore, IDM, glitch, trance, breakbeat, bitpop, electro, motor rock and lo-fi. In addition, there were special showcases such as the Detroit Special, the French/German/UK-programs, the HipHop-program and the female-artists-only booty shaking dancehall baile disco party. The 2007 edition also featured an expanded program of interactive, digital, and multimedia arts and installations. Amongst others Daan Roosegaarde, Daan Brinkman and Robert Henke presented their installations this edition.http://www.artisttalk.eu/daan-roosegaarde-nl/ Highlights of 2007: United Visual Artists, Kool Keith, and Modeselektor & Pfadfinderei and the virtual landing strip.

Early life and education Roodt was born in the mining town of Springs, east of Johannesburg, South Africa. He completed his schooling in Johannesburg, after which he enrolled for a Bachelor's degree at the University of Witwatersrand. Roodt has six degrees, including a Ph.D. from the University of the Witwatersrand in Afrikaans, obtained with a thesis on the works of in 1994.Ondermyning in die prosa van John Miles: 'n postmoderne lesing. http://www.worldcat.org/title/ondermyning-in-die-prosa-van-john-miles- n-postmoderne-lesing/oclc/775690588 Career Roodt lectured at the University of Durban-Westville for a while, and in 1985 left South Africa for France to avoid conscription in the South African Defence Force. Times LIVE said that in the 1980s, Roodt was an anti-establishment anarchist, but that now \\"he is branded a right-wing reactionary\\" for his \\"vehement anti-ANC essays\\". Two of his literary works had been banned by the South African government in 1980, a time of strict censorship. After returning to South Africa in 1992, Roodt worked for Citibank until 1999, and in 2000 he co- founded PRAAG (Pro-Afrikaanse Aksiegroep, or Pro-Afrikaans Action Group), which describes itself as an extra-parliamentary movement devoted to the rights of Afrikaners. PRAAG also has a publishing division, which has published some of his recent works. Roodt has contributed articles to Focus, the journal of the liberal Helen Suzman Foundation, columns to American Renaissance, a white nationalist magazine, various scientific or academic journals in South Africa as well as a host of articles in South African newspapers. He has also appeared on television and radio talk shows in South Africa. In May 2011 Roodt stood for the Freedom Front Plus during the municipal elections as a candidate in Johannesburg, but was not elected. Roodt is the deputy leader and spokesperson of South African right-wing political party Front Nasionaal formed in late 2013 which promotes separatism and Afrikaner self-determination. The Sunday newspaper Rapport reported on 8 February 2015 that Roodt had been \\"voted out of the party\\" without him being aware of it.Dan Roodt uitgestem http://www.netwerk24.com/nuus/2015-02-08-dan- roodtuitgestem He was quoted in the article as saying that \\"he would henceforth be devoting his energy to his publishing company, Praag... I am disillusioned with Afrikaner politics. I am finished with Afrikaner politics.\\" Activism Roodt has strong views on the preservation of Afrikaans and Afrikaner culture, which has led to some controversy in the South African media. He maintains a blog and the PRAAG website, commenting on issues in South Africa. Roodt also regularly writes letters regarding political matters to various South African newspapers and the literary e-zine LitNet.Venter, A. 2007. Book Review: Aweregs: politieke essays. Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe, 47(3):pp. 501-502. Controversy Roodt caused a controversy after creating an internet site about South African journalist, writer and activist Max du Preez. Roodt explained that he had set up the site 'so that everyone who has always wanted to say something about \\"this idiot and prat\\", but did not have the means, now has the opportunity'. When contacted by Afrikaans Sunday newspaper Rapport for comment, Du Preez replied that 'it only confirms what I suspected: That Dan has a homo-erotic fixation with me'. In May 2011, the domain name in question was seized by the regulator of South African web domain names, and given to Du Preez. A judge ruled that Roodt had misused Du Preez's name as part of a slanderous campaign against the latter. The website has since been offline. In March 2010 Roodt advised Afrikaners to support the football team of the Netherlands instead of the South African team in the FIFA World Cup, hosted by South Africa in June and July 2010. In May 2010 Roodt travelled to Europe where he met with members of the Swedish Resistant Movement (Swedish: Svenska Motst√•ndsr√∂relsen) a Scandinavian group which describes itself as a National Socialist organisation. Roodt was the subject of a report for The Daily Show entitled The Amazing Racists by comedian John Oliver in June 2010 in which Roodt made a number of prejudiced statements about black South Africans. This led Oliver to satirically declare Roodt's views as representing ‚Äúsome of the finest examples of vintage bigotry.‚Äù Roodt stated that producers of the show had edited the interview to portray him in a negative light and threatened to sue the show. The South African Afrikaans civil rights organisation AfriForum publicly criticised Roodts statements as racist. In 2012, the Press Ombudsman ordered the weekly tabloid Sondag to publish a front-page apology to Roodt for publishing a defamatory article about him. Writing Roodt's first novel, Sonneskyn en Chevrolet (Taurus, 1980), is an anti-establishment commentary on South African society (and specifically Afrikaner society) of that time.Kannemeyer, J.C. 2005. Die Afrikaanse literatuur, 1652-2004. Kaapstad: Human & Rousseau. p.608. His only published volume of poetry to date, Kommas uit 'n boomzol (Uitgewery Pannevis, 1980), structurally parodies Komas uit 'n bamboesstok (Human & Rousseau, 1979), a volume of poetry by the Afrikaans poet D.J. Opperman. Afrikaans literary critic John Kannemeyer asserts that there is 'no one poem of any intrinsic value' in Kommas uit 'n boomzol, and similarly views Roodt's subsequent prose work Twee sinne (Taurus, 1985). Roodt's first publication after Twee sinne is a critical essay on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) entitled Om die Waarheidskommissie te vergeet ('Forgetting the Truth Commission', 2001). This would be PRAAG's first publication of one of Roodt's works. In 2004, PRAAG published the novel Moltrein, which is about a promising musician who leaves South Africa during the 1980s to avoid military service in the South African Defence Force.Kannemeyer, J.C. 2005. Die Afrikaanse literatuur, 1652-2004. Kaapstad: Human & Rousseau. p.609. In 2005 Roodt released The Scourge of the ANC (PRAAG), a critique of the ANC, and also of the former South African government under leadership of FW de Klerk. The following year, Aweregs (PRAAG, 2006), another collection of political essays, was released. Regarding Aweregs, Venter notes that if the ultimate aim of the book is > to demonstrate the author's pessimism regarding Africa, the African National > Congress (ANC), \\"the new\\" South Africa, and supporters of the idea that > Afrikaans can only survive by developing multilingualism in South Africa, > then Roodt's vision succeeds. But it is a limited and distressing vision. In 2015, Roodt published an essay Raiders of the Lost Empire: South Africa's English Identity (PRAAG) in which he \\"explores the country's 'new' English identity which is founded on the old colonial identity of the nineteenth century when the redcoats invaded the Cape of Good Hope.\\"Raiders of the lost Empire: South Africa‚Äôs ‚ÄòEnglish‚Äô identity ‚Äì by Dan Roodt http://praag.org/?wpsc-product=raiders-of-the-lost-empire-south-africas- english-identity-by-dan-roodt Personal life Roodt currently lives with his wife, Karin (n√©e Bredenkamp), and their three children in Johannesburg, South Africa.

It was formed on March 18, 2007 by the Italian Republican Party (PRI) and the Italian Liberal Party (PLI), both tiny liberal parties in the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition, due to their common reference to the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (of which PRI is member and PLI a would-be member). The federation is aimed principally at uniting the Republican and the Liberal traditions, but also at forming joint- list for the next elections and especially for the 2009 European Parliament election. The two Republican members of the Chamber of Deputies (Giorgio La Malfa and Francesco Nucara, both elected on Forza Italia's list) formed a component in the Mixed Group named \\"Republicans, Liberals, Reformers\\" along with Giovanni Ricevuto, a former member of the New Italian Socialist Party (NPSI). The federation between PRI and PLI, approved by the PRI's congress on 1 April 2007 and by PLI's congress on 24 June 2007, is open to the entry of other parties, movements and associations. Some members of the Liberal Reformers, led by Ernesto Caccavale (ex-PLI, ex-FI and ex-PL) left the group of Benedetto Della Vedova and formed the Italian Reformers, in order to start a collaboration with \\"Republicans, Liberals, Reformers\\". Also some former Liberals, Republicans, Radicals, Socialists and Social Democrats now members of Forza Italia could join the new political group. As of November 2007 the PRI-PLI federation was trying to reinforce collaboration with Liberal Reformers and Decide! with the final goal of ultimately creating a new liberal party. As PRI joined the People of Freedom in early 2008, however, the federation was effectively dissolved. The federation was almost disbanded in early 2008, when PRI and PLI decided to run the next general election separately: within the People of Freedom and as a stand-alone list respectively.

Design and Layout In 1969 Sir Roger Walters was commissioned by the Greater London Council to design a high density block of social housing to complement the already completed high rise buildings of commercial, educational and governmental establishments. It won a commendation in the 1971 Good Design In Housing awards. It is a building of fascinating quirks, both structurally and socially. Flats are situated on a raised \\"P\\" (for PODIUM) level, and on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th floor. The P level flats are a later 1980s addition but all the flats above it are split level scissor section flats, arranged over three primary floors and wrapped around a central communal corridor. This provides each flat with a dual aspect unobstructed by external corridors more usually found on high rise social housing in the area.  Tenant management  Perronet House set itself up as a Tenant Managed Organisation (TMO) under the UK's 'Right to Manage' legislation for council houses. However it was Southwark's first TMO to fail and management of the block returned to the council in 2004. In April 2012 a new Tenants and Residents Association was formed.

Its purpose is the examination of the use of linear engines for the propulsion of autonomous, rail mounted vehicles. Similar to the Transrapid the coaches are moved by linear motors, which have a very low need for maintenance. In contrast to Transrapid a magnetic field is only used for acceleration, the vehicles run on wheels on tracks. This concept allows for modification of existing conventional railway tracks. Overview The cabs can be ordered via cell-phone or the internet, and will be configured accordingly to the demands of the customer. In comparison to usual trains these vehicles are means of individual transport. Neither big stations, timetables nor prescribed routes are needed. An important feature is the creation of convoys of several cars with up to 10 passengers on the most frequently used tracks. The cars are not connected, but drive with low distance from each other. This reduces drag and so saves energy. Electronic systems and computers ensure that the cars maintain a certain distance from each other, and organize a fluent transport. Experimental track An experimental track exists near Paderborn, which allows the evaluation of the system.

Gordon had been sent to the Sudan to help Egyptians evacuate from Sudan after Britain decided to abandon the country in the face of a rebellion led by self- proclaimed Mahdi, Mahommed Ahmed. A contingent of Canadians was recruited to help the British navigate their small boats up the Nile River. The Nile Expedition was the first overseas expedition by Canadians in a British imperial conflict, although the Nile Voyageurs were civilian employees and did not wear uniforms. Photograph of Camel Corps, 2 Sikhs at the 'Ready'. Photograph by Felice Beato, 1884/85. The expedition was commanded by Garnet Wolseley. After Sir Herbert Stewart was mortally wounded Brigadier-General, Charles William Wilson took command of this group of about 1,400 men. On two Nile steamers Wilson's Desert Column reached Khartoum in the afternoon of 28 January 1885. It came two days too late: Khartoum had been seized by the Mahdists in the early hours of 26 January. Between 5,000 and 10,000 inhabitants were slaughtered, among them Gordon. Wilson received criticism afterwards for his delay in sailing to Khartoum, with Wolseley stating that Wilson had \\"lost any nerve he had ever possessed\\". Other sources however, spread the blame, particularly on Wolseley. The public in England also blamed Prime Minister William Gladstone for not having taken steps to relieve the siege of Khartoum and some historians have held Major-General Gordon responsible, because he had refused the order to evacuate while that was still possible. Background Not wanting to be involved in the costly suppression of the rebellion led by Mahommed Ahmed, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ordered Egypt to abandon its administration of the Sudan in December 1883. The British government asked General Gordon, former Governor- General of Sudan, to go to Khartoum and aid in the evacuation of Egyptian soldiers, civilian employees and their families. Travelling from London, General Gordon reached Khartoum on 18 February 1884. He immediately began sending women, children and wounded soldiers back to Egypt as the military situation deteriorated in the Sudan and the south of the country was in danger of being cut off from Egypt by the Islamic Mahdist army. Britain withdrew its troops from the Sudan until Khartoum was the last outpost remaining under British control. Gordon differed with the British government's decision to abandon the Sudan. He thought that the Islamic revolt had to be crushed for fear that it might eventually overwhelm Egypt. He based this on the Mahdi's claim of dominion over all Islamic lands. Defying orders from the British government to withdraw, General Gordon, leading a garrison of 6,000 men, began the defence of Khartoum. On March 18, 1884, the Mahdist army laid siege to the city. The rebels stopped river traffic and cut the telegraph line to Cairo. Khartoum was cut off from resupply, which led to food shortages, but could still communicate with the outside world by using messengers. Under pressure from the public, in August 1884, the British government decided to reverse its policy and send a relief force to Khartoum. Organising the Relief Force The Expedition was put under the command of General Garnet Wolseley, who had seen service in the Crimean War, Canada, the Gold Coast and southern Africa. The Expedition was composed of two officers and 43 soldiers from each British Light Cavalry Regiment.Gordon Relief Expedition Wolseley decided that the best way of reaching Khartoum would be to ascend the Nile River. Based on his favourable experience with them during his expedition along the Red River to Fort Garry (now Winnipeg) in 1869‚Äì1870 to suppress the Red River Rebellion, Wolseley asked the Governor General of Canada, the Marquess of Lansdowne,Miller, Carman,Lansdowne, Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of, Canadian Encyclopedia Accessed: 5 April 2007 if it would be possible to recruit a contingent of Canadian voyageurs to help him navigate the Nile. He requested that they be commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Fred C. Denison, who had served as Wolseley's aide-de-camp during the Red River expedition.W. Stewart WALLACE, ed., The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. V, Toronto, University Associates of Canada, 1948, 401p., p. 8. The Prime Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald, did not object once he was assured that the voyageurs were volunteers and would be paid by the British. Denison complied and on 15 September 1884, only 24 days after the request was received, 386 voyageurs set sail for Egypt. The Canadians were known at the time as the Nile Voyageurs. As the traditional role of the voyageur was waning, most were formerly employed helping transport log booms down rivers such as the Ottawa, Gatineau and Saguenay. Eighty-six of the voyageurs were members of the First Nations, mostly Caughnawaga,Louis Jackson, Our Caughnawagas in Egypt by , Montreal: WM. Drysdale & Co. 1895 an offshoot from the Mohawk and Ojibwa. The Nile Expedition for the relief of Gordon The Expedition On 7 October 1884, the Canadians reached Alexandria and headed south by a combination of shallow draft steam launch and train. On 26 October 1884, the Canadians met Wolseley and his force of 5,400 soldiers at Wadi Halfa. By November they were at the first of six cataracts and began their work of ascending the rapids. The southern progress of the expedition sped up with the experienced voyageurs manning the boats. The boats that Wolseley selected were modified Royal Navy whalers. They were almost long, wide and deep, and were equipped with twelve oars, two masts and a removable rudder. The boats had the capacity for a dozen men along with enough cargo to supply them for a hundred days. In mid-November, the expedition received word from General Gordon that he could only survive the siege for another forty days. The expedition was attacked by rebels at Abu Klea and Abu Cru, but was able to repel the rebels both times. Progress up the river was slow and often the boats had to be pulled through rapids by rope from shore. At several places the strength of the current necessitated several crews pulling one boat. They settled on a method of stationing the voyageurs at difficult stretches along the river, so that each group would become familiar with a particular stretch of water. Realising that time was running out for General Gordon in Khartoum, Wolseley split his force into two columns. He sent 2,400 men by camel on a 280 km shortcut across the desert to avoid the Great Bend of the Nile and reach the city sooner. The remaining 3,000 soldiers continued up the river. The Canadians‚Äô six-month contracts were soon to expire and they were asked to re- enlist. Though offered generous inducements, only 86 of the voyageurs, including their commander, Denison, signed up for a second six-month contract. The rest elected to return to Canada, hoping to arrive in time for the spring logging season. This did not halt the expedition, as the worst of the river was already behind them and the smaller number of soldiers travelling by river reduced the need for the Canadians. Denison and his men continued piloting the small boats up the river. General Gordon's last entry in his journal, dated 14 December 1884, read, ‚ÄúNow mark this, if the Expeditionary Force, and I ask for no more than 200 men, does not come in ten days, the town may fall; and I have done my best for the honour of our country. Good bye.‚Äù The Journals of Major- General C. G. Gordon, C.B., at Khartoum. London, 1885. On 26 January 1885, Khartoum fell to the Mahdist army of 50,000 men. At that time of year the Nile was shallow enough to cross by wading and the Mahdists were able to breach the city's defences by attacking the poorly-defended approaches from the river. The entire garrison was slaughtered, including General Gordon. His head was cut off and delivered to the Mahdi. Two days later the relief expedition entered the city to find that they were too late. After the Fall of Khartoum Emboldened by their victory at the Battle of Khartoum, the Mahdists attacked the British column ascending the river at Kirbekan, but were repulsed. However, the British commander General William Earle was killed. The British force retreated to Egypt. With the fall of Khartoum, Muhammad Ahmad controlled the whole of Sudan, allowing him to establish an Islamic state governed by Sharia law. He died less than six months later. His state survived him, but Sudan was re-conquered by the British in a campaign from 1895 to 1898, led by Lord Kitchener. Legacy On 17 April 1885, the Canadian contingent set sail from Alexandria for home. Sixteen Canadians had died on the expedition. They are memorialised in Canada's Peace Tower, which recognises all of Canada's war dead. Wolseley wrote a letter to the Canadian Governor General praising the Canadians' service and the British Parliament passed a motion thanking them for their efforts. A collection of records from the expedition was compiled and edited by C.P. Stacey, and published by the Champlain Society in 1959.

He was the son of Pierre Bidal (1612‚Äì1690), a French merchant and banker who did business with Christina of Sweden. He received from her the title of Baron of Harsefeld in Bremen, then in Swedish hands, when he was French ambassador in Hamburg. When Christina abdicated her throne on 5 June 1654 in favour of her cousin Karl Gustavus in order to practice openly her Catholicism, she went to live in France, in a beautiful estate at Vanves, possession of Pierre Bidal. The title Baron of Harsefeld was transformed to Asfeld in French and passed over from Pierre to Claude Fran√ßois. Claude Fran√ßois became mar√©chal de camp in 1702, lieutenant general in 1704 and commander in the Order of Saint-Louis in 1707. He played a major role in the War of Spanish Succession in Spain, under Berwick. He fought in the Battle of Almansa (1707), the conquest of Tortosa and Alicante, the Siege of Barcelona (1714) and the capitulation of Mallorca (1715). After the war, he was made Marquis d'Asfeld en Castille by King Philip V of Spain and knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. He was director- general of the French fortifications in 1715, member of the War council, military commander first in the Guyenne province (1719), later in Italy (1733). When Berwick was killed in the War of the Polish Succession by a cannonball at the siege of Philippsburg in 1734, Asfeld became commander-in-chief of the army of the Rhine. He was made Marshal of France in 1734. In 1728, he bought the domain and title of Count d‚ÄôAvaux. He married in 1717 Jeanne Louise Joly de Fleury, who died seven months later of smallpox. He remarried in 1718 with Anne Leclerc de Lesseville, who died in 1728 in childbirth. They had five children.

William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis Life He was the son of William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis, by Lady Elizabeth, younger daughter of Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester. Until 1722 he was known as Viscount Montgomery. At the coronation of James II, 23 April 1685, he acted as page of honour. From 8 May 1687 until November 1688 he was colonel of a regiment of foot, and was also deputy-lieutenant of six Welsh counties from 26 February to 23 December 1688. After the Glorious Revolution, efforts on behalf of James II resulted in Montgomery's committal to the Tower of London on 6 May 1689 and he was not given bail until 7 November. On 5 July 1690, and again on 23 March 1696 a proclamation, accompanied by a reward of ¬£1,000, was issued for his apprehension; on the later occasion he was suspected of complicity in the Jacobite assassination plot. In May 1696 he was outlawed, but a technical error on the part of the sheriffs of London enabled him to retain his estate. He surrendered on 15 December 1696, and was taken to Newgate Prison. Though he was reported to have given information concerning the plot, he remained there until 19 June 1697, when during an outbreak of gaol fever he was released on bail. Montgomery was not tried, and in November 1700 was ill at Ghent. In January 1701 King William III allowed him to travel from Flanders in order to raise money on his estate and pay debts. He paid a second visit to London on 25 May 1703, surrendered himself, and was admitted to bail. Financial difficulties led him to sell his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields to the Duke of Newcastle in May 1705. He was living in Powis House in Great Ormond Street in 1708. Arrested again during the Jacobite alarm in September 1715, Montgomery was considered harmless. He was eventually restored to his titles and estates, including Powis Castle, and was summoned to parliament as Marquess of Powis on 8 October 1722. By Jacobites he was styled Duke of Powis, and he and his eldest son prepared a statement of their claim to that title; but the claim does not seem to have been pressed. He died on 22 October 1745. Family Lady Mary, portrait by Michael Dahl Montgomery married Mary, eldest daughter and coheiress of Sir Thomas Preston, bart., of Furness. She died on 8 January 1724, and was buried at Hendon, where the marquess had property. By her Powis had two sons and four daughters. William, the eldest son, died unmarried on 8 March 1748. Edward, the younger son, died in 1734, having married Henrietta, daughter of James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave, by whom he had an only child, Barbara, born posthumously. Barbara married a kinsman, Henry Arthur Herbert, who was created Baron Herbert of Cherbury in 1743, and Earl of Powis in 1748.

It was created by Eric Wilhelm and Saul Griffith and launched in August 2005. Instructables is dedicated to step-by-step collaboration among members to build a variety of projects. Users post instructions to their projects, usually accompanied by visual aids, and then interact through comment sections below each Instructable step as well in topic forums. History After graduating from the Media Lab at MIT, Wilhelm and Griffith founded Squid Labs, an engineering and technology company specializing in design and consulting. Instructables started as an internal Squid Labs project, which later spun out as an independent company with Wilhelm as its CEO. Wilhelm still regularly contributes to the site. A prototype version of the site, complete with the initial content of electronics, cooking, kiting, and bicycle projects, was released in August 2005 at the O'Reilly Foo Camp conference. The original content focused mostly on such projects as building electronic or mechanical devices to solve common problems around the home. The scope of the project has expanded to include a larger array of categories, including Food, Living, Outside, Tech, Play and Workshop. Sponsored categories are sometimes added for companies to advertise a specific topic on the site. The site allows uploading of photos, diagrams, video and animation to help explain complex terminology and mechanisms in clear and understandable terms. Instructables employs a full-time staff, and also has a volunteer group, who feature well-documented articles, welcome new users, and help out around the site. On August 1, 2011, Autodesk announced the acquisition of Instructables. Community Once registered, members can create Instructables that are step-by-step descriptions of projects they want to share online. They are written in such a way that they easily allow other members to replicate, and share with the rest of the community. Members can also upload videos and slideshows, depicting a project that they have not documented. Multiple contests are held each month, each with a unique theme. People vote for entries in a specific competition that they think are of good quality and creativity, and prizes are awarded to the winners. An Instructables-sponsored contest will usually award T-shirts, patches and stickers, but often more extravagant prizes are awarded based on sponsor availability. A forum feature was added for members to post ideas, questions, discussions, requests for help, and all manner of other things. Later on, a dedicated question and answer system was also rolled out. Classes were introduced in February 2017 for members to enroll and learn skills to gain confidence in a variety of trades, like woodworking, welding, electronics, Arduino, baking, 3D printing, laser cutting, and a variety of other classes, offering over 35 classes. In the press Instructables has been profiled in Make, The Village Voice, Popular Science, The Daily Telegraph, and PC World. It has also received attention from National Public Radio (NPR). Pro membership In June 2009, Instructables introduced a \\"Pro\\" membership account for about $2 to $4 a month. Pro memberships quickly became controversial when many of the membership features were restricted to Pro members, while some new features were made available exclusively to Pro members. Users can earn Pro membership for free for three months by getting their content featured. If the content hits the home page or wins a prize in a contest, they can get one year free Pro membership.

His debut for the club, at the age of 17, came on 22 December 1998 in a Conference League Cup game away to Farnborough Town. He went on to make 16 league appearances during the 1999‚Äì2000 season, being named in the starting line-up 8 times. The following season, Mills was part of the Rushden squad that secured promotion to the Football League after winning the Football Conference, playing in 2 league games. Although expected to battle against relegation, the Rushden team of 2001‚Äì02 exceeded expectations by reaching the Third Division play-off final, though they lost to Cheltenham Town. During this time, Mills was still used as a fringe player, only playing 2 games. The Diamonds continued to impress in the league, finishing first in Division Three and winning promotion the next season. Mills established himself as one of the club's first choice midfielders, playing in 30 league games. Likewise, in the next campaign, Mills played a further 30 games, though the club had far less success as they were immediately relegated back to Division Three. He did, however, score his first goal for the club that season in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Tranmere Rovers. On 11 September 2004, Mills suffered a dislocated ankle in a league match against Oxford United, leading him to miss the rest of the 2004‚Äì05 campaign. After the success Mills had enjoyed in the early part of his career, he was then part of the Rushden team relegated to the Conference in the 2005‚Äì06 season. He left Nene Park on 20 April 2006, his contract cancelled by mutual consent having not played since early February. Rushden's relegation from The Football League was confirmed nine days later. =Crawley Town= Mills joined fellow Conference National side Crawley Town on 10 August 2006, though he also had an unsuccessful trial with League One side Yeovil Town in July.

He was not offered a contract extension by Rushden manager Garry Hill, and left the club in May 2007. =Tamworth= On 25 May 2007 Mills signed for Conference North side Tamworth, managed by Mills' namesake Gary Mills, though of no relation. On 24 October 2007, Mills was sacked by Tamworth following an argument with manager Gary Mills. The manager accused Mills of having \\"no bottle, no balls, and no discipline\\", regarding the player's lack of effort and reaction to being dropped from the first team. The player Mills, meanwhile, retorted that Tamworth was \\"the worst club [I have] ever been at.\\" =Kettering Town= Following his acrimonious departure from Tamworth, Mills went into talks with fellow Conference North club Kettering Town, signing for the club just three days later. He played 27 games, scoring twice, as the club stormed to promotion to the Conference National with 97 points. His contract was not renewed at the end of the season. =Stevenage Borough= Stevenage Borough in the 2009 FA Trophy Final Mills signed for Stevenage Borough on 13 May 2008, having been previously managed by manager Graham Westley whilst he was at Rushden & Diamonds.

However Mills quit the club in September 2011 when the travelling distances from his Northampton base became too much. =Nuneaton Town= After leaving Bath, Mills instantly signed for Conference North outfit, Nuneaton Town. In October 2011, Mills picked up a knee injury which ruled him out of action for three months. On 13 May 2012, Mills was a part of the Nuneaton side that was victorious in the Conference North play off final that earned promotion to the Conference National. =Lincoln City and Boston United= On Monday 21 May 2012 it was reported that Gary had signed a one-year contract with Lincoln and was named captain City.[18] On Monday 4 March 2013 it was reported that the Lincoln City captain left the club by mutual consent. In May 2013, Mills joined Boston United. He then signed on loan for King's Lynn Town in January 2014 on a deal that lasted until the end of the season. =Coaching and Management= Mills was assistant manager to Kevin Wilkin at Wrexham until March 2015 when he and Wilkin both left the club.

It is part of the Louis Riel School Division and has an enrollment of approximately 280 students. The school offers a wide range of programs for students of all skill levels and has a diverse student body that includes students from all over the world including International (Visa) Students from around the world. In September 2015, NMC incorporated ‚ÄúPropel‚Äù, a district- wide, semester-long elective project-based learning opportunity into the school's programming. In September 2016, NMC began a 4-year process of changing its educational model from a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù model to a school-wide project-based learning model. History = Origins =  Norwood Collegiate Institute  In 1914, a high school was established at the Tache School, a stone-structured building housing only ten rooms and a hall for assemblies, out of the need to extend education to a growing number of students beyond the 8th grade.t was then that Tache School began holding classes for Grades 9, 10, and 11 only. Students of the community of Norwood were allowed to complete their 12th grade education in one of the other schools in the community of St. Boniface. Boys were sent to Provencher School while the girls attended St. Joseph's Academy. As Tache School's attendance swelled beyond the capacity of the original Tache School, even when additions were built, some classes were taught in houses near the school and the Marion Street Salvation Army Hall. Once King George V School, now owned and operated by Springs Christian Academy, in 1916, classes in homes and at the Salvation Army Hall ceased. In 1927, following the establishment of the Norwood School District No. 2113 in 1925, Tache High School was given collegiate status and, thus, changed its name to \\"Norwood Collegiate Institute\\". With another increase in enrollment, plans were made for the school to move to a site already owned by the Norwood School Board. While changes were made in 1940, Grades 10, 11 and 12 students were moved to a temporary structure - temporary due to a shortage of funds because of the European War \\\\- on Highfield St. at St. Mary's Rd. Following the war, in 1947, the firm of Green, Blankstein, and Russell presented plans for the new building to house the students and staff of Norwood Collegiate Institute. It would take nearly a decade for the official opening, which took place on November 16, 1956.  Nelson McIntyre Collegiate  This portrait of Nelson K. McIntyre hangs in the front foyer of Nelson McIntyre Collegiate.To mark the historic occasion of the long- awaited high school (which would now house Grades 9 through 12), the school's new name, N.K. McIntyre Collegiate, was chosen in memory of Nelson K. McIntyre, who served as the chairman of the Norwood School Board at the time of his death. McIntyre, who laboured long and hard to see this new building through to fruition died only a few weeks before the official opening ceremony of the school, which was held on November 15, 1956 at the school's present location of 188 St. Mary's Road in the Norwood West area of the Winnipeg's \\"city ward\\" of St. Boniface. N.K. McIntyre Collegiate eventually went through another minor name change to become, simply, Nelson McIntyre Collegiate. = Arson = Over the years, the school has suffered from 3 fires. Two of the fires, though causing great damage to the textiles and graphic arts labs, were contained to the Industrial Arts/Human Ecology wing of the school and are, therefore, considered \\"minor\\" in comparison to the first fire which occurred in 1986. One broadcast, heard on Tuesdasy, July 22, 1986, stated that \\"an estimated $5 million fire had completed destroyed Nelson McIntyre Collegiate in Norwood\\". This fire was intentionally set, as evidenced by the point of origin on the second floor and spreading south the roofline. With the help of many, all files and records were safely and securely removed from the attached Norwood School Division board offices in under 45 minutes; however, the teaching staff were not as fortunate. Many of them lost years of paper records, teaching materials, and equipment. The official re-opening of Nelson McIntyre Collegiate, following this first fire, took place on November 15, 1987. = School Division Affiliation = Presently, Nelson McIntyre Collegiate (known by students as Nelson Mac, NMC, or lovingly as \\"The Mac\\") is a part of the Louis Riel School Division. and was the only high school in the Norwood School Division No. 8. In 1998, the Norwood School Division No. 8 amalgamated with the St. Boniface School Division No. 4. And in 2002, the recently conjoined St. Boniface School Division No. 4 was paired with the St. Vital School Division No. 6, in the province's efforts to restructure the existing 54 school divisions to 37. The new school division was named Louis Riel School Division (without a number designation) after Louis Riel, the key figure of the Red River Rebellion, and the Father of Manitoba. = Commemorated Honours = Commemorated Plaque at the entrance to the library at NMC Nelson McIntyre Collegiate's gymnasium is named in honour of James W. Downey. Mr. Downey was the Superintendent of Norwood School Division from 1969-1980. The gymnasium was officially opened on March 21, 1977. The school's library and resources centre, located on the main floor of the school, also stands in dedication of a former superintendent of schools of Norwood School Division No.8: Jacob Krueger. Memorial Plaque in Remembrance of Norwood Collegiate Institute's Veterans of World War II Nelson McIntyre Collegiate has, as part of its shared history with the former Norwood Collegiate Institute, the rare distinction of having veterans of World War II as part of its alumnae. And, as such, has had some of those alums give their life in the service of their country. A memorial plaque honouring the memory of the fallen soldiers hangs in the front foyer of Nelson McIntyre Collegiate. It reads: \\"In grateful memory of the former students of Norwood Collegiate Institute who gave their lives in the World War 1939 - 1945\\". It honours 33 fallen alumni of Norwood Collegiate Institute. = School Awards of Distinction = The first Merit Award was presented to S.E.Brock in 1928, and the oldest Nelson McIntyre trophy is the Norbridge Trophy presented by Frank Wade to the N.M.C. Badminton Club doubles, one for the boys and one for the girls in 1959.

History Following the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, a large number of Czechs and Slovaks arrived in the country from Austria-Hungary to foster its cultural and economic development. These included many intellectuals and entrepreneurs, such as the historian Konstantin Josef Jireƒçek (Minister of Education 1881‚Äì1882), the painters Ivan Mrkviƒçka and Jaroslav Vƒõ≈°√≠n, the archaeologists Karel ≈†korpil and Hermann ≈†korpil, the engineer and entrepreneur Ji≈ô√≠ Pro≈°ek and the Pro≈°ek family (who built Lavov most and Orlov most and founded the Sofia brewery), V√°clav Dobrusk√Ω (first director of the National Archaeological Museum), the brewer Franz Milde (founder of the Shumen brewery), the architects Josef Schnitter (long-time chief architect of Plovdiv), Anton√≠n Kol√°≈ô (first chief architect of Sofia) and Lubor Bajer (who designed Stara Zagora's modern street network), and many others. Besides urban emigration, the Law for the settlement of the desolated lands of 1880 attracted many ethnic Czech and Slovak colonists, mostly Protestants from the regions of the Romanian Banat (particularly Sf√¢nta Elena and NƒÉdlac) and modern Vojvodina, Serbia. The most notable site of the rural Czech colony in Bulgaria was the village of Voyvodovo, Vratsa Province, founded by Czech colonists in 1900 and reaching a population of 800 (of which over 600 Czechs, the rest Slovaks, Banat Bulgarians and Banat Swabians) in the 1930s. Other places where Czechs and Slovaks settled were the town of Gorna Oryahovitsa and the villages of Belintsi and Podayva, Razgrad Province, with a significant Slovak community also present in Pleven Province (Gorna Mitropolia, Podem, Brashlyanitsa).

In theory, this approach would dramatically reduce the amount of memory bandwidth required for 3D games and thereby lead to lower-cost graphics accelerators. The project took place during the introduction of the first high-performance 3D accelerators, and these quickly surpassed Talisman in both performance and price. No Talisman-based systems were ever released commercially, and the project was eventually cancelled in the late 1990s. Description =Conventional 3D= Creating a 3D image for display consists of a series of steps. First, the objects to be displayed are loaded up into memory from individual models. The display system then applies mathematical functions to transform the models into a common coordinate system, the world view. From this world view, a series of polygons (typically triangles) is created that approximates the original models as seen from a particular viewpoint, the camera. Next, a compositing system produces an image by rendering the triangles and applying textures to the outside. Textures are small images that are painted onto the triangles to produce realism. The resulting image is then combined with various special effects, and moved into the display buffers. This basic conceptual layout is known as the display pipeline. In general terms, the display changes little from one frame to another; generally for any given transition from frame-to-frame, the objects in the display are likely to move slightly, but their shape and textures are unlikely to change at all. Changing the geometry is a relatively lightweight operation for the CPU, loading the textures from memory considerably more expensive, and then sending the resulting rendered frame to the framebuffer the most expensive operation of all. For example, consider rendering settings of the era with 24-bit color, with basic 3D compositing with trilinear filtering and no anti-aliasing: At 640 x 480 resolution it would require 1,900 Mbit/s of memory bandwidth; at 1024 x 768 resolution it would require 4,900 Mbit/s. Even basic anti-aliasing would be expected to roughly double those figures.Allen Ballman, \\"What is Talisman?\\" , Microsoft Research, SIGGRAPH 1996 For reference, SGI's then-current RealityEngine2 machines featured a then-high memory bandwidth of about 10,000 Mbit/s, which was the reason these machines were widely used in 3D graphics. A typical PC of the era using AGP 2X could offer only 508 Mbit/s. The first attack on this problem was the introduction of graphics accelerators that handled the texture storage and mapping. These cards, like the original Voodoo Graphics, had the CPU re-calculate the geometry for every frame, and then send the resulting series of co-ordinates to the card. The card then handled the rest of the operation; applying the textures to the geometry, rendering the frame, applying filtering or anti- aliasing, and outputting the results to a local framebuffer. The bandwidth needs in such a system were dramatically reduced; a scene with 10,000 triangles might need 500 to 1000 kbit/s, depending on how many of the geometry points could be shared between triangles. =Tiled rendering= As scene complexity increased, the need to re-generate the geometry for what was essentially a fixed set of objects started to become a bottleneck of its own. Much greater improvements in performance could be had if the graphics card also stored and manipulated the polygons. In such a system, the entire display pipeline could be run on the card, requiring minimal interactions with the CPU. This would require the graphics card to be much \\"smarter\\"; as opposed to the very simple operations involved in applying textures, the card would now have to have a complete processor able to calculate the functions used in 3D modeling. At the time a number of companies were exploring this path, the so- called \\"transform and lighting\\" cards or T&L;, but the complexity and cost of the systems appeared considerable. One solution that was studied during this period was the concept of tiled rendering. This was based on the observation that small changes in camera position could be simulated by manipulating small 2D images, the \\"tiles\\". For instance, the movement of the camera into the scene can be simulated by taking each tile and making it slightly larger. Likewise, other movements in the scene can be simulated with the application of the appropriate affine transform. However, this process is only approximate, as the movement increases, the visual fidelity will decrease. Such a system may reduce the need to re-calculate geometry to every two to three frames on average. The problem with this approach is that not all tiles necessarily have to be re-rendered every time, only those that contain objects close to the camera. If the entire geometry is sent to the card then this task can be handled entirely on-card, but this requires cards of similar complexity to T&L; systems. If the geometry is kept under the control of the CPU, then ideally the card should be able to ask the CPU to re-render only those objects in tiles that are outdated. In many cases, this would require the CPU's rendering pipeline to be changed. In any event, the card and/or drivers need to know about the ordering and position of the objects, something that is normally hidden in the code. =Talisman= Talisman was a complete suite of software and hardware that attempted to solve the tiled rendering problem. The system shared some information about the tiles and the objects within them in order to find out which tiles were outdated. If a tile became outdated, the CPU was asked to re-render the objects in that tile, and send the results back into the driver and then to the card. Once a particular tile was rendered on the card, it was stored on the card in compressed format so it could be re- used on future frames. Microsoft calculated that each tile could be re-used for about four frames on average, thereby reducing load on the CPU by about four times. In Talisman, image buffers were broken down into 32 x 32 pixel \\"chunks\\" that were individually rendered using the 3D objects and textures provided by the CPU. Pointers to the chunks were then stored in a z-ordered (front to back) list for every 32 scan-lines on the display. One concern is that the chunks cannot be cleanly \\"stitched together\\", a problem that has sometimes been visible in various videogames using software rendering. To avoid this, Talisman also stored a separate \\"edge buffer\\" for every chunk that stored an \\"overflow\\" area that would cover gaps in the mapping. =Rendering pipeline= In a conventional 3D system, geometry is periodically generated, sent to the card for composition, composed into a framebuffer, and then eventually picked up by the video hardware for display. Talisman systems essentially reversed this process; the screen was divided into the 32-line- high strips, and while the video hardware was drawing one of these strips, the hardware would call the Talisman side and tell it to prepare the details for the next strip. The system would respond by retrieving any chunks that were visible in that strip given the current camera location. In the typical case many of the chunks would be obscured by other chunks, and could be ignored during compositing, saving time. This is the reason for the z-sorting of the chunks, which allows them to be efficiently retrieved in \\"visibility order\\". If the chunks could be modified without distortion, the proper affine transform was called to update the chunk in-place. If it could not, say because the camera had moved too much since the last full update, the CPU was asked to provide new geometry for that chunk, which the card then rendered and placed back in storage. Talisman had no analog of a framebuffer, rendering chunks on demand directly to the screen as the monitor's scan line progressed down the screen. This is an interesting analog with the Atari 2600, which uses a similar system to render 2D images on the screen, a method known as \\"racing the beam\\". In both cases, this reduced the amount of memory needed, and the memory bandwidth being used between the display system and video hardware. In both cases this also required dramatically tighter integration between the video system and the programs running it. In the case of Talisman, the programs were required to store their objects in a particular format that the Talisman software drivers understood, allowing it to be quickly picked up from memory during interrupts. History =Introduction= The Talisman effort was Microsoft's attempt to commercialize concepts that had been experimented on for some time. In particular, the PixelFlow system developed at a Hewlett- Packard research lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill can be considered Talisman's direct parent.Combined Issue:Microsoft Talisman \\"Repackages\\" Chapel Hill Concept When Talisman was first made widely public at the 1996 SIGGRAPH meeting, they promised a dramatic reduction in the cost of implementing a graphics subsystem.Jay Torborg and James Kajiya, \\"Talisman: Commodity Real-time 3D graphics for the PC\\", SIGGRAPH 1996 They planned on working with vendors to sell the concept of Talisman for inclusion into other companies' display systems. That is, Talisman was hoped to be a part of a larger media chip, as opposed to an entire 3D system that would stand alone in a system. Their basic system would support 20-30,000 polygons on a 1024 x 768 display at 32 bit/pixel, with a 40 Mpixel/s polygon rendering rate and 320 Mpixel/s image layer compositing rate. =Escalante= At the time, Microsoft was working with several vendors in order to develop a reference implementation known as Escalante. Samsung and 3DO were working together to design a single-chip DSP-like \\"Media Signal Processor\\" (MSP), combining Talisman functionality with additional media functionality. Cirrus Logic would provide a VLSI chip that would retrieve data placed in memory by the MSP, apply effects, and send it off for display. Known as the \\"Polygon Object Processor\\" (POP), this chip was periodically polled by another Cirrus Logic chip, the \\"Image Layer Compositor\\" (ILC), which was tied to the video circuitry. Additionally, Escalante intended to feature 4 MB of RDRAM on two 600 MHz 8-bit channels, offering 1.2 GB/s throughput.Francis Vale, Intel MMX vs. Microsoft Talisman: Abbott and Costello Do Multimedia, 21st; The VXM Network, 1997 Later Philips entered the fray with a planned new version of their TriMedia processor, which implemented most of Talisman in a single CPU, and Trident Microsystems, with similar plans. It was in the midst of the Talisman project that the first person shooter genre started to come to the fore in gaming. This created market demand for accelerators that could be used with existing games with minimal changes. By the time the Escalante reference design was ready for production, the market forces had already resulted in a series of newer card designs with such improved performance that the Talisman cards simply couldn't compete. Cards with large amounts of RAM arranged to allow for extremely high speeds solved the bandwidth issue, simply brute forcing the problem instead of attempting to solve it through clever implementation. Additionally, the Talisman concept required tight integration between the display system and the software using it. Unlike the new 3D cards coming to market at the time, Talisman systems would have to be able to ask the CPU to re-render portions of the image in order to update their chunks. This required the games to have a specific organization in memory in order to respond to these requests. In order to aid developers in this task, Direct3D was changed to more closely match the Talisman needs. However, for any game that had already been written, or those that didn't want to be tied to Talisman, this made the D3D system slower and considerably less interesting. =Disappearance= As a result of these changes, Talisman never became a commercial product. Cirrus Logic and Samsung both gave up on the system some time in 1997, leading Microsoft to abandon plans to release Escalante in 1997, and to external observers it appeared the entire project was dead.Francis Vale, Talisman, Part II: Microsoft Still Doesn't Get the 3D picture, 21st; The VXM Network, 1997 There was a brief rebirth soon after, however, when Fujitsu claimed to be working on a single-chip implementation that would be available in 1998, with rumors of similar projects at S3 Graphics and ATI Technologies.Mark Hachman, F\\"ujitsu To Bring Microsoft's Talisman To Life\\", Electronic Buyer's News, 16 September 1998 None of these systems ever shipped and Talisman was quietly killed. This was much to the delight of the 3rd party graphics accelerator vendors, as well as the people within Microsoft that supported them in the market with DirectX. =Legacy= Nevertheless, several of the ideas pioneered in the Talisman system have since become common in most accelerators. In particular, texture compression is now widely used. On more recent cards, compression has also been used on the z-buffers to reduce memory demands while sorting the display. The idea of using \\"chunks\\" to sort the display has also been used in a small number of cards, referred to as tile based rendering, but it only become competitive in the desktop space much later, with the release of NVidia's Maxwell-based GPUs in 2014. Many graphics processors specifically designed for mobile devices (such as cell phones) employ a tile-based approach. Only the one key idea of Talisman, asking for updates to geometry only \\"when needed\\", has not been attempted since.

The film features Vincent Spano, Stephen Mendillo and Chris Cooper.. Plot Nick Rinaldi (Spano) is the aimless son of corrupt property developer Joe Rinaldi (Lo Bianco), who is determined to provide for Nick after the death in Vietnam of the Rinaldi's older son. Rinaldi owns a derelict apartment building that blocks the construction of a mixed-use development that the equally corrupt mayor pushes hard for to boost his re-election chances. Bored at the no-show job organized by his father, Nick quits and turns to crime to assuage his debts and drug addiction. Joe is introduced arguing with idealistic alderman Wynn (Morton) about hiring more African- Americans, which Rinaldi is hesitant to do for political reasons. Nick joins his friends, low-rent thugs Bobby and Zip, who work for small-time hoodlum Carl (Sayles). Carl sets the men up with access to a local electronics store. Unbeknownst to the men, the owner is a close friend of Joe's. While breaking into the store, they are thwarted by the store's new security guard (who is Wynn's brother-in-law), who threatens to shoot them despite his gun being fake. Bobby and Zip are arrested and jailed while Nick flees. While the pair sit in jail, annoyed by delusional homeless man Asteroid (Strathairn), Nick begins to fall for Angela (Williams), a waitress at a local restaurant, who has a child by Rizzo (Denison), a young and hot-headed policeman. Rizzo, who stalks his ex-wife, is infuriated that Rinaldi is pursuing Angela, and hassles two young black boys as a result. The boys, deciding that they may as well live up to the way the police portray them, attack a professor jogging in a nearby park, later falsely claiming that the professor made advances toward them. Wynn privately expresses doubt in the story of the boys, but worries of his perception from the black community if he does not stand with the boys, especially from Malik (Tom Wright), an intense composite character that represents black power, Nation of Islam, and Pan-Africanist ideals. Nick's involvement in the botched robbery is revealed by Carl, who blackmails Joe into agreeing to allow one of Carl's henchmen to flood and deliberately set a fire in Rinaldi's slum (so that it may be cleared for the mayor's project) in exchange for the police dropping Nick from their warrant lists. Joe's relationship with Nick also takes a sour turn when Nick learns that his older brother, who Nick has been in the shadow of his whole life, was deployed to Vietnam as an alternative to prison for injuring a young woman as a result of a DUI. Elsewhere, community organizers rope Wynn into defending the stories of the boys that attacked the jogger. Realizing that the accused pedophile is one of his old college professors, Wynn visits him privately to encourage the man to drop the charges, arguing that if he goes public, the accusations of pedophilia will remain linked to his name. Carl's henchman torches Joe's apartment building, but Joe quickly realizes that the plan has gone awry as a young Hispanic woman and her baby, squatting in a part of the building thought by Joe to be abandoned, perish in the blaze. Wynn visits Desmond, one of the young boys involved in the jogger attack, and learns that the boys were lying. However, before he can act, the black community center reports that the professor agreed to drop the charges against the boys. Wynn, now fully embracing the city's ethos, leads a contingent of the black community to disrupt a fundraising dinner for the mayor. Desmond visits the home of the professor that the boys attacked, claiming he saw his address in the paper. The professor initially brushes him away, but Desmond apologizes for what happened and asks if he can accompany the man on a run, discovering that he is a professor of urban relations. Nick runs into a drunken Rizzo, who confronts Nick, shooting at him after the two men get into a scuffle. Rizzo's old patrol partner picks him up, and the new trainee, a Hispanic man, inquires whether Rizzo's gun is legal. After the new officer refuses to overlook Rizzo's illegal conduct, Rizzo grows angry as the car drives off. Joe finds Nick in the new property development, severely wounded. Joe calls for help, but the only person who hears his cries is Asteroid, who repeats them frantically to an empty street.

He was executed at Tyburn, London after the rebellion had been defeated. Origins He was the eldest son and heir of Roger Arundell (died 1536) of Helland, Cornwall, by his wife Johanna Calwoodleigh (died 1537), daughter and heiress of Humphry Calwoodleigh (attainted in 1497) of Calwoodleigh (modern Calverleigh) in Devon.Vivian, 1895, p.132, pedigree of Calwoodleigh Roger Arundell was a younger son of Sir Thomas Arundell (died 1485), Knight of the Bath, of Lanherne in Cornwall.

His maternal grandfather had been involved in the Perkin Warbeck rising against Henry VII in 1497.W.K Jordan, Edward VI: The Young King, London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd, 1968, p454 On the death of his parents in 1536 and 1537 he inherited large estates in both Devon and Cornwall. In 1549, Arundell became leader of the Cornish army which assembled first at Bodmin and was involved in the Cornish rebellion of 1549, which is also known as the Prayer Book Rebellion, against Edward VI. Previously he had been in charge of a small garrison on St Michael's Mount, which had defected to the rebels at the start of the campaign. During the 1549 siege of Exeter, Arundell and his troops had little artillery and had taken some small calibre guns from Plymouth and other forts of the King, including those on St Michael's Mount, St Mawes Castle, Pendennis Castle and Trematon Castle. The Cornishmen outside the walls of Exeter made the statement \\"and so we Cornishmen, whereof certain of us understand no English, utterly refuse this new English\\". At the battle of Sampford Courtenay, Arundell led a large contingent of rebels from the rear throwing the Royal troops into confusion. The rebels were forced to make another stand at Okehampton, before falling back to Launceston, where he was finally overpowered and imprisoned in the castle. On 19 August, he was transferred to the dungeons of Rougemont Castle in Exeter, before being taken with other rebels to the Tower of London in September. In November 1549, Arundell was taken to Westminster Hall where he was found guilty of high treason and condemned to be taken back to the Tower and later hanged, drawn and quartered. He was executed on 27 January 1550 and the estates of the ringleaders were distributed to those who had served the King in the rising. Sir Gawen Carew received most of Humprey Arundell's lands. Other Cornish leaders of the earlier Cornish Rebellion of 1497, Thomas Flamank, Michael An Gof and James Tuchet, 7th Baron Audley had also been executed at Tyburn in 1497.

Pearson Building on Sussex Drive. It was opened in 2008. The building, as named, serves as a de facto embassy in Canada for the Aga Khan, the Imam (spiritual leader) of the Nizari Muslims, through which the Aga Khan's office (under the auspices of the Aga Khan Foundation) can receive dignitaries of the Canadian government. Building and opening The building was initiated by the Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of the Nizaris in the presence of Adrienne Clarkson, Governor General of Canada, on June 6, 2005. It was designed by the internationally celebrated Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, together with the Canadian firm Moriyama & Teshima. The Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat was formally opened by Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Saturday, December 6, 2008 during an official visit of the Aga Khan to Ottawa. In addition to the Prime Minister, the opening was also attended by several federal ministers including Transport Minister John Baird, Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon and Minister of State for Status of Women Helena Guergis. Also in attendance were former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, writer John Ralston Saul, David Mulroney, chief of the PCO Afghan task force, his CIDA counterpart Stephen Wallace, former deputy minister of foreign affairs Peter Harder, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Chief Justice of Canada Beverley McLachlin, former ambassador to Washington Derek Burney, former Liberal foreign minister Bill Graham, former ambassador to the UN Allan Rock, Herb Gray, the longest serving MP in Canadian history and various ambassadors of other countries to Canada. The $54-million building is the first in the world to represent Aga Khan IV, spiritual leader of the world‚Äôs 15 million Nizaris. Based in Europe, he heads the Aga Khan Development Network, one of the largest private development networks in the world. The building houses 60 employees of the Aga Khan Foundation Canada, a non-profit development agency, and the Aga Khan Development Network Diplomatic Office. Prior to its opening in 2017, the Global Centre for Pluralism - an education and research centre - was based out of the Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat. Demands to see the building are so great the agency provides public tours twice a week. Some 30,000 people have walked through. Since 2009, the building has hosted about 100 events, such as lectures and workshops. The building includes a library and offices, as well as a residence and office for the Aga Khan‚Äôs use during visits.  Architecture  Designed by Moriyama & Teshima Architects in collaboration with the Pritzker Prize‚Äìwinning architect Fumihiko Maki, the Ottawa Delegation is the first building in the world that will represent the Ismaili Imamat and its institutions. It is configured as an elongated, rectangular ring, surrounding an interior atrium and an exterior courtyard that features a traditional Chahr-bagh Islamic garden. The building rests on a solid linear granite podium, and is covered by a glass dome through which light illuminates the atrium and courtyard. The building as a whole is inspired by natural rock-crystal and is an interplay of visual clarity, opacity and translucency. It houses meeting rooms, exhibition areas, a lecture theatre, resource center, and private apartments. Side view of the Delegation. The Aga Khan proposed that Maki take inspiration from rock crystal, which is at once translucent, transparent and opaque. The two-storey structure rests on a podium of black granite. It is clad in white Neoparies, a crystallized glass material with a marble-like texture that reflects light. Side walls are arranged in alternating bands of transparent and translucent glass. The simple rectilinear building contains an atrium topped by an asymmetrical glass dome. Surrounding the atrium is a patterned screen of cast aluminum, evoking screens of historic Islamic architecture. 2012 Governor General‚Äôs Medals in Architecture The Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat in Ottawa was named a recipient of the 2012 Governor General‚Äôs Medals in Architecture. The award recognises outstanding design in projects by Canadian architects, and is administered by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and the Canada Council for the Arts Act.

Some collar models also include a tone or vibrational setting, as an alternative to or in conjunction with the shock. Others include integration with Internet mapping capabilities and GPS to locate the dog or alert an owner of his/her whereabouts. Originally used in the late 1960s to train hunting dogs, early collars were very high powered. Many modern versions are capable of delivering very low levels of shock. Shock collars are now readily available and have been used in a range of applications, including behavioral modification, obedience training, and pet containment, as well as military, police and service training. While similar systems are available for other animals, the most common are the collars designed for domestic dogs. Types of devices =Pet containment systems= The most common use of shock collars is pet containment systems that are used to keep a dog inside the perimeter of the residence without the construction of a physical barrier. This use of shock collars is increasingly popular in areas where local laws or homeowners' associations prohibit the construction of a physical fence. Available systems include: in-ground installation to preserve the aesthetics of the yard; above ground installation to reinforce an existing barrier that was not sufficient in containing the dog; and wireless systems to allow for indoor use. Most pet containment systems work by installing a wire around the perimeter of the yard. The wire carries no current (as opposed to electric fences, which carry a current at high voltage that may be lethal in the event of unauthorized or defective installation or equipment) but forms a closed loop with a circuit box that transmits a radio signal to the receiver collar on the dog. As the dog approaches the perimeter the collar activates. =Bark control collars= Bark control collars are used to curb excessive or nuisance barking by delivering a shock at the moment the dog begins barking. Bark collars can be activated by microphone or vibration, and some of the most advanced collars use both sound and vibration to eliminate the possibility of extraneous noises activating a response. =Training collars or remote trainers= Training collars can be activated by a handheld device. Better quality remote trainers have a large variety of levels and functions, can give varying duration of stimulation, better quality stimulation, and have a beep or vibration option useful for getting the dog's attention. E-collars may be used in conjunction with positive reinforcement and/or utilizing other principles of operant conditioning, depending on the trainer's methods either as a form of positive punishment, where the correction is applied at the moment an undesired behavior occurs to reduce the frequency of that behavior‚Äîor as a form of negative reinforcement, where a continuous stimulation is applied until the moment a desired behavior occurs to increase the frequency of that behavior. Frame of reference Electrical shock is the physiological reaction, sensation, or injury caused by electric current passing through the body. It occurs upon contact of a body part with any source of electricity that causes a sufficient current through the skin, muscles, or hair. Commenting in his textbook on training and behaviour, Steven Lindsay wrote about the public perception of the term \\"shock\\" and its application in the description of training aids; \\"At low levels, the term shock is hardly fitting to describe the effects produced by electronic training collars, since there is virtually no effect beyond a pulsing tingling or tickling sensation on the surface of the skin ... the word shock is loaded with biased connotations, images of convulsive spasms and burns, and implications associated with extreme physical pain, emotional trauma, physiological collapse, and laboratory abuses ... the stimulus or signal generated by most modern devices is highly controlled and presented to produce a specific set of behavioral and motivational responses to it.\\" In an article for the trade magazine \\"Office for veterinary service and food control\\", Dr. Dieter Klein compared the effects of shock collars with other electrical stimulation products; \\"Modern devices ... are in a range in which normally no organic damage is being inflicted. The electric properties and performances of the modern low current remote stimulation devices ... are comparable to the electric stimulation devices used in human medicine. Organic damage, as a direct impact of the applied current, can be excluded.‚Äù Klein, Dieter R., 2000, How Dangerous are Remote Stimulation Devices for the Training of Dogs?‚Äù Amtstier√§rztlicher Dienst und Lebensmittelkontrolle \\"At 0.914 joules the electric muscle stimulation and contractions a human receives from an 'abdominal energizer' fitness product is exponentially stronger ‚Äî more than 1,724 times stronger‚Äî than the impulse a dog receives from a pet containment collar set at its highest level.\\" Technical considerations Electric shock can be characterised in terms of voltage, current, waveform, frequency (of waveform), pulse rate and duration. Although voltage, current and duration of shock can be used to calculate the amount of energy applied (in Joules), these are not indicators of the intensity of the stimulus or how it may be perceived by the recipient. Static electric shocks that are experienced in daily life are of the order of 20,000 to 25,000 volts, and yet are not painful or physically damaging because they are of very low current. Depending on design, e-collars collars can be set so that the shock delivered is only mildly uncomfortable. Variable settings of this kind are essential, so that the e-collar collar can be adjusted to the level that the dog requires, as situations change. E-collars are sometimes referred to as delivering a \\"static shock\\"; however, static electricity is direct current and carries little energy (order of millijoules). E-collars make use of alternating current. It is therefore inappropriate to refer to e-collars collars as delivering a static shock. Consistent stimulation requires good contact between the collar electrodes and the dog's skin. (The collar must be fitted according to the manufacturer's instructions.) Local humidity and individual variation in coat density, skin thickness and surface conductivity, also affect the delivery of the stimulation. The waveform, its frequency, the pulse rate, current, voltage and impedance are important determinants of likely response. \\"Many e‚àícollars appear to shift intensity levels by altering the pulse duration or repetition rate while keeping the output current and voltage relatively constant, depending on the electrode‚àískin load.\\" (Lindsay 2005, p. 573). Individual variations in temperament, pain sensitivity and susceptibility to startle of dogs, means that settings must be carefully adjusted to produce a stimulation that is perceived by the dog as only just aversive enough to stop the dog engaging in the unwanted behavior. Normally salient stimuli, such as noises, commands and even shocks, may have no effect on a dog that is highly aroused and focused on an activity such as hunting. Potential to cause harm In 1980 (revised 1987), the US Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), a branch of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), concurred in regulatory action against a manufacturer of a bark collar, stating \\"Complaints received, which were later corroborated by our own testing, included severe burns in the collar area and possible personality adjustment injuries to the dogs. The shocking mechanism was found to be activated not only by barking but by vehicle horns, slamming doors or any other loud noise. CVM concurred in regulatory action against the device since it was deemed to be dangerous to the health of the animal.\\" The standing policy of the US FDA is that \\"Dog collars which are activated by the noise of barking to produce an electric shock are considered as hazardous to the health of the animal.\\" No regulations exist specifying the performance characteristics or reliability of these devices, so there is considerable variation in shock level and waveform characteristics between manufacturers, and perhaps even between batches of collars from a single manufacturer. The lack of regulation or standards, and the fact that some of the safety features of shock collars are patented by specific manufacturers, means that the safety and operational characteristics of individual products cannot be verified. Training effectiveness Shock Collar The effectiveness of e-collars is highly debated, however it is not one sided. Each side has a wide variety of backers and activists from professors, to activists, and trainers. According to Pat Nolan, who has trained dogs for over thirty years, e-collar training is a key and effective use to train dogs (Nolan, 2011). According to the methods he describes in his book, regular and fair use is key in e-collar training. He details what fair use is, stating that it is key to keep a regular training schedule and set boundaries your pet understands.(Nolan, 2011) Deterring predation in the wild The Wildlife Society article addresses the use of shock collars as a way to prevent sheep from being preyed upon by wild coyotes. According to (Phillips, 1999) they tested these collars on coyotes for a four-month period and found that the collars stopped thirteen attacks on sheep herds. This also is said to deter future attacks by the tested coyotes. Collars have also been used on wolves for similar reasons. This document is the assessment of the shock collar on wolves‚Äô long-term behavior. The article talks about trying to alter wolves‚Äô behavior over an extended period of time using the collar. The consensus was while it did have an effect while in use and temporally after it was removed, the study concluded that longer exposure would be needed to have any substantial evidence (Hawley, 2008). As far as non-lethal alternatives these two sources both concluded that shock collars are the most effective deterrence to predators. Both groups continued their research and the Wildlife Society has developed a new and improved version that eliminates the risk of neck injury when used on animals that previous versions caused. They have increased battery life and the durability of the unit. They devised a unit that is worn like a back pack for the animal. Previous versions caused excessive rubbing and soreness as well as being irritating for the animal to the point were they would try to take the harness off. Scientific studies =Christiansen et al study (2001a)= Christiansen et al., looked at behavioural differences between three breeds of dogs when confronted by domestic sheep (138 dogs; Elkhounds, hare hunting dogs and English setters).Christiansen, Frank O., Bakkenb, Morten, Braastadb, Bjarne O., 2001, Behavioural differences between three breed groups of hunting dogs confronted with domestic sheep. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, Volume 72(2), pp. 115-129. Two testing procedures were used and shock collars were used to deter attacks on sheep. The first, a path test, involved observing the dogs' reactions to a set of novel stimuli (rag pulled across the track, bundle of cans thrown down, tethered sheep at 5m) as it was walked. The second test involved monitoring the dog's reaction to a free-roaming sheep flock in a field. In this study they identified several factors that predicted a high hunting motivation and attack severity. These were lack of previous opportunity to chase sheep, low fearfulness towards gunshots and unfamiliar people and general interest in sheep when encountering them. Younger dogs (<3 years of age) showed more pronounced initial hunting motivation and more frequent attacks. Elkhounds showed more hunting behaviour, more attacks and were more frequently given electric shocks during the tests. A shock collar was used to deter attacks on the sheep during the experiments. Shocks (3000V, 0.4A, duration 1 second) were delivered when dogs came within a distance of 1-2m of the sheep, and were repeated until the dogs left the area. The objective was to suppress an attack, but not to damage the hunting ability of the dogs. Despite frequently initiated chases and attacks, few shocks were delivered. This was because few dogs approached closer than 1‚Äì2 m, and the intention was to deter proximity to sheep rather than to associate hunting behaviour with an aversive shock, which would impair future hunting behaviour in other contexts. =Christiansen et al. study (2001b)= The dogs used in the first study were re-tested using the same procedures, to assess long-term impact of the training on their reaction to sheep.Christiansen, Frank O., Bakkenb, Morten, Braastadb, Bjarne O., 2001, Behavioural changes and aversive conditioning in hunting dogs by the second-year confrontation with domestic sheep. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, Volume 72, pp. 131-143. Again, in the free-running tests the dogs were fitted with a shock collar, which was used to deter approaches to within 1-2m of the sheep. Dogs that had previously been shocked in year 1 showed a significant increased in latency to approach a person during the path test (p<0.001), even though this was not a condition under which shocks had been delivered. Owners reported behavioral differences between year 1 and 2 in 24 of the dogs. 18 of the 24 dogs had shown no interest in sheep during that period, even though they had been interested in them during the first year tests. However, only one of those dogs had received shocks, so the change in behaviour could not be attributed to the use of the shock collar. When comparing owners‚Äô reports for the two years, the dogs showed a weaker inclination for chasing sheep and other prey than previously (p < 0:001), but this variable was not affected by shock experience. Dogs that had shown interest in sheep in year 1 showed a persistent interest in year 2. No dogs chased or attacked sheep as their first response, while half of them did so the first year. During the entire test period, the proportion of dogs attacking sheep was reduced to almost one fourth. The number of shocks administered per dog was reduced by the second year, and only one of the dogs that received shocks the first year needed shocks also the second year. The observations that both receivers and non-receivers of shocks the first year showed a reduction in the probability of chasing sheep, but the receivers showing a larger reduction, show that shock treatment provides an additional learning response. No adverse effects on the dogs were observed with this training procedure, but in their discussion the authors commented \\"In order to ensure no negative effects, we recommend that the electronic dog collar may be used for such purposes only if it is used by skilled trainers with special competence on dog behaviour, learning mechanisms, and of this particular device.\\" =Salgirli dissertation (2008)= The aim of Salgirli's study was \\"...to investigate whether any stress is caused by the use of specific conditioned signal, quitting signal, and/or pinch collars as alternatives to electric training collars, and if they do so, whether the stress produced in the process is comparable to the one with electric training collars.\\".http://elib.tiho-hannover.de/dissertations/salgirliy_ws08.pdf The study population were a group of 42 adult police dogs. The quitting signal was a conditioned frustration equivalent to negative punishment. It was conditioned by associating failure to obtain an anticipated food reward with a specific vocal signal. In the test, dogs were walked past a \\"provocateur\\" who attempted to taunt the dog into a reaction. If the dog reacted, it was punished, and if it failed to react on subsequent provocations then the punishment was deemed to have had a learning effect. The study is therefore a comparison of negative and positive punishment methods, and not a comparison of punishment with positive reinforcement. Learning effect was measured by assessing the number of dogs that learned to quit a behaviour after application of the punishing stimulus. There was no statistical difference in learning effect between the pinch and shock collar, but the quitting signal produced a significantly poorer learning effect compared to shock or pinch collars (p < 0.01 in both cases). \\"Although the pinch collar caused more behavioral reactions, in the form of distress, than the electronic training collar, the electronic training collar elicits more vocal reactions in dogs than the pinch collars\\"; the explanation for increased vocalisation in the shock collar group was that this was due to a startle response rather than pain reactions. Salivary cortisol was monitored to measure the stress levels of the dogs, but this data was not presented in the dissertation; behavioral observation was the sole measure of stress. The study concluded that the electronic training collar induces less distress and shows stronger ‚Äúlearning effect‚Äù in dogs in comparison to the pinch collar. Commenting on the quitting signal, the author stated \\"It should particularly be mentioned, that the quitting signal training was implied only on adult dogs within the frame of this study. Therefore, the results should not be interpreted as that the quitting signal can not be a suitable method in police dog training. As previously stated training of the quitting signal requires a hard and a structured procedure. Thus, if the training, namely the conditioning, begins in puppyhood, the quitting signal can also be an effective method in police dog training\\". Comparing the effects of the three punishment methods; \\"These results can probably be explained by that electronic training collar complies completely with the punishment criteria, which were defined by TORTORA (1982), in case of proof of the proficient and experienced user. On the other hand when applying the pinch collar, these criteria can not be met even though perfect timing is applied since reactions of the dog and effectiveness of the method depends on several different factors such as the willingness, strength and motivation of the handler, as well as his/her proficiency. In addition to that, the visibility of the administrator and, thus, of the punishment is another important factor influencing the efficiency of the pinch collar because the dog directly links the punishment with its owner. Therefore this method does not satisfy the ‚Äò‚Äòpunishment criteria‚Äô‚Äô at all. The quitting signal on the other hand requires criteria, such as good timing and structured training procedure, on account of complete conditioning to achieve effective results. Even if these criteria are met, the personality trait of the dog is another factor, which influences the efficiency of the signal.\\" =Schalke et al. study (2007)= Schalke et al. conducted a 7-month study to investigate the effect of shock collars on stress parameters, in a series of different training situations.Schalke, E., Stichnoth, J., Ott, S., Jones-Baade, R., 2007, Clinical signs caused by the use of electric training collars on dogs in everyday life situations. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 105, pp. 369-380. Heart rate and saliva cortisol were used to determine the stress levels in three groups of dogs. Group A received the electric shock when they touched the \\"prey\\" (a rabbit dummy attached to a motion device), Group H (\\"here\\" command) received the electric shock when they did not obey a previously trained recall command during hunting, and Group R (random) received random shocks that were unpredictable and out of context. Group A did not show a significant rise in cortisol levels; the other two groups (R & H) did show a significant rise, with group R showing the highest level of cortisol. Salivary cortisol was measured, as this procedure is less likely to cause stress related rise in cortisol. From this the researchers concluded that the dogs who could clearly associate the shock with their action (i.e. touching the prey) and as a result were able to predict and control whether they received a shock, did not show considerable or persistent stress. The evidence of increased stress in the other groups was felt to support earlier findings that poor timing and/or inappropriate use of a shock collar puts the dog at high risk of severe and ongoing stress. They conclude that \\"The results of this study suggest that poor timing in the application of high level electric pulses, such as those used in this study, means there is a high risk that dogs will show severe and persistent stress symptoms. We recommend that the use of these devices should be restricted with proof of theoretical and practical qualification required and then the use of these devices should only be allowed in strictly specified situations.\\" =Schilder & van der Borg study (2004)= Schilder and van der Borg conducted a study to compare the behavior of police service dogs that had previously been trained using a shock collar (Group S) with those that had not (Group C).Schilder, M.B.H., van der Borg, J.A.M, 2004, Training dogs with help of the shock collar: short and long term behavioral effects. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 85, pp. 319-334. In the training test no shocks were applied, but the animal's behavior was observed during training tasks. The intention was to investigate whether shock collar based training might have a long-term effect on stress-related behavior even in the absence of shock, and whether this related to specific features of the training context. Behaviors recorded included recognised indicators of stress (panting, lip-licking, yawning, paw lifting and body posture) as well as yelping, squealing, snapping and avoidance. During free walks on the training grounds, groups S dogs showed significantly more stress related behaviors and a lower body posture than group C dogs. During training, the same differences were found. The difference between the groups was more significant when training took place on the familiar training ground, indicating a contextual effect. The presence of the trainer was considered to be part of this context. The authors concluded \\"We concluded that shocks received during training are not only unpleasant but also painful and frightening.\\" Lindsay says of this study, \\"Schilder and Van der Borg (2004) have published a report of disturbing findings regarding the short-term and long- term effects of shock used in the context of working dogs that is destined to become a source of significant controversy.... The absence of reduced drive or behavioral suppression with respect to critical activities associated with shock (e.g., bite work) makes one skeptical about the lasting adverse effects the authors claim to document. Although they offer no substantive evidence of trauma or harm to dogs, they provide loads of speculation, anecdotes, insinuations of gender and educational inadequacies, and derogatory comments regarding the motivation and competence of IPO trainers in its place.\\" =Steiss et al. study (2007)= Steiss, et al., conducted a four-week study of adult shelter dogs‚Äô physiological and behavioral responses to bark control collars. Plasma cortisol was used as the stress measure. Dogs were randomly assigned to either a shock collar, a spray collar, or a dummy collar (control group). Dogs that were known to bark at an unfamiliar dog were used for the study. Test conditions involved presentation of an unfamiliar dog. Dogs wore activated collars for period of 30 minutes per day for three days in two consecutive weeks. The amount of barking was significantly reduced starting on the second day with both the spray and shock collars. There was no significant difference in effect between the two collar types. The treatment group dogs showed a mild yet statistically significant increase in blood cortisol level (an indicator of stress) only on the first day of wearing the collars (as compared to the Control Group.)Steiss, J.E., Schaffer, C., Ahmad, H.A., and Voith, V.L., 2007, Evaluation of Plasma Cortisol Levels and Behavior in Dogs Wearing Bark Control Collars. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 106, pp. 96-106. At the conclusion of the study, Dr. Steiss and her team concluded that \\"In the present study, with dogs wearing bark control collars intermittently over a 2-week period, the collars effectively deterred barking without statistically significant elevations in plasma cortisol, compared to controls, at any of the time points measured.\\" =Tortora Study (1983)= Tortora applied a method called \\"safety training\\" to treat aggression in 36 cases exhibiting a form of \\"instrumental aggression\\", selected after screening a population of 476 cases. \\"Instrumental aggression\\" was defined as describing aggressive acts that \\"do not have a clear evolutionary significance, are not directly related to emotional arousal, do not have specific releasing stimuli, are not directly modulated by hormones, and do not have an identifiable focus in the brain\\". Tortora states that in the context of the article \\"instrumental aggression\\" was specifically defined as \\"aggressive responses that have \\"a specifiable learning history, show a growth function over time and are modulated by their consequences. These dogs had few operant alternatives to gain reinforcement by compliance and were channeled down a path that allowed their innate aggressiveness to come under the control of the negatively reinforcing contingencies in the environment\\". The dogs initially behaved as though they \\"expected\\" aversive events and that the only way to prevent these events was through aggression. The dogs were therefore a highly selected subset that had not learned strategies for coping with threat. Each dog was trained to respond to a set of 15 commands taken from the AKC standard for CDX obedience. The commands were selected to provide control over the dog, and included \\"heel\\", \\"stand\\" \\"go\\", \\"come\\", \\"hold\\", \\"drop\\" and \\"sit\\". These behaviors were termed \\"safety behaviors\\". Training was divided into 9 stages, each of which was composed of 5‚Äì20 twice daily training sessions. Dogs could only progress to the next stage after passing a test. On average, dogs took 10‚Äì15 sessions to complete each stage. After training on basic commands, the dogs were trained to perform the behaviors they had already learned in order to avoid progressively increasing electric shock. After that, they were conditioned to perform a safety behavior to avoid a \\"safety tone\\" that let them anticipate the shock. In later stages of training, dogs were exposed to provocation by a distractor dog, and were punished using full intensity shock if they failed to perform a safety behavior or showed aggression. After training was complete, and the dogs were choosing to perform the safety behaviors instead of aggression, owners were taught to use the shock collar, and the training was transferred into everyday situations. The training resulted in a long-lasting and complete suppression of aggressive behaviour in the dogs. Dogs were followed up three years after the end of training, and the reduction in aggression was maintained.Tortora, Daniel F. Safety training: The elimination of avoidance-motivated aggression in dogs. https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1984-03181-001 https://doi.org/10.1037/0096-3445.112.2.176 Criticism PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) opposes the use of shock collars, stating \\"Dogs wearing shock collars can suffer from physical pain and injury (ranging from burns to cardiac fibrillation) and psychological stress, including severe anxiety and displaced aggression. Individual animals vary in their temperaments and pain thresholds; a shock that seems mild to one dog may be severe to another. The anxiety and confusion caused by repeated shocks can lead to changes in the heart and respiration rate or gastrointestinal disorders. Electronic collars can also malfunction, either administering nonstop shocks or delivering no shocks at all\\". CABTSG (The Companion Animal Behaviour Therapy Study Group), an affiliate group of the BSAVA (British Small Animal Veterinary Association), produced a policy statement on the use of shock collars, stating \\"Their effectiveness depends upon the pain and fear experienced by the animal, but to use them correctly requires detailed understanding of behaviour and its motivation, as well as very precise timing. Few operators are able to achieve any reliable success with these devices and the consequences of failure can be a worsening of the problem behaviour. The indiscriminate use of shock collars therefore poses a threat to the safety of the general public, as well as to the welfare of the animal. We believe that sufficient alternative methods of treatment exist that such electronic training devices are redundant. Therefore, as an association affiliated to BSAVA, it is our duty to recommend that shock collars and all other related training and control aids should be banned from sale or use\\". CABTSG has been renamed the British Veterinary Behaviour Association. The BSAVA produced a position statement on the risks associated with collars \\"The British Small Animal Veterinary Association (BSAVA) recommends against the use of electronic shock collars and other aversive methods for the training and containment of animals. Shocks and other aversive stimuli received during training may not only be acutely stressful, painful, and frightening for the animals, but may also produce long-term adverse effects on behavioural and emotional responses.\\". On the advice of the RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) and other welfare groups, the ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers) banned the use of shock collars for police dog training by all UK police forces. The current ACPO Police Dogs Manual of Guidance states \\"Equipment that is not approved for use in the training of police dogs includes remote training collars designed to give an electric shock and Pinch Collars\\". The RSPCA commissioned a review of the effects of shock collars from the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Bristol University, which is available online. It states \\"Given the lack of scientific evidence for the efficacy of behavioural modification using shock collars, particularly in the long term, in addition to the potential for mistakes or deliberate abuse and the difficulty in correcting such errors, the widespread use of these devices must be carefully considered.\\" The UK Kennel Club has an ongoing campaign to achieve a ban on the sale and use of shock collars; \\"The Kennel Club is against the use of any negative training methods or devices. The Kennel Club believes that there are many positive training tools and methods that can produce dogs that are trained just as quickly and reliably, with absolutely no fear, pain, or potential damage to the relationship between dog and handler.\\" \\"The Kennel Club in calling upon the Government and Scottish Parliament to introduce an outright ban on this barbaric method of training dogs.\\". The two British members of the World Union of German Shepherd Clubs (WUSV) have joined the Kennel Club in calling for a complete ban on shock collars, and passed a motion to exclude this equipment from any of its training branches during official club training times. The HSUS (Humane Society of the United States) provides the following comment on the use of aversive collars (choke chains, pinch collars and shock collars): \\"Some trainers use aversive collars to train \\"difficult\\" dogs with correction or punishment. These collars rely on physical discomfort or even pain to teach the dog what not to do. They suppress the unwanted behavior but don't teach him what the proper one is. At best, they are unpleasant for your dog, and at worst, they may cause your dog to act aggressively and even bite you. Positive training methods should always be your first choice.\\" They go on to comment on shock collars specifically: \\"The least humane and most controversial use of the shock collar is as a training device. The trainer can administer a shock to a dog at a distance through a remote control. There is a greater chance for abuse (delivery of shocks as punishment) or misuse (poor timing of shocks). Your dog also may associate the painful shock with people or other experiences, leading to fearful or aggressive behavior\\". The NCAE (Norwegian Council on Animal Ethics) \\"recommends the introduction of a ban electric training collars and similar remote-controlled or automatic electronic devices that cause your dog substantial discomfort. It should nevertheless be granted an exemption for such training carried out by authorized persons in order to prevent hunting of livestock and wildlife.\\" The APDT (Association of Professional Dog Trainers) says, \\"[Electronic] training collars should not be used by novice dog owners or by trainers who are not properly instructed in their use. Use of electronic training collars can result in trauma to your dog and generally are not recommended by positive reinforcement trainers\\". The AVSAB (American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior) produced a position statement titled The use of punishment for behavior modification in animals, the opening paragraph of which reads, \\"AVSAB‚Äôs position is that punishment (e.g., choke chains, pinch collars, and electronic collars) should not be used as a first- line or early-use treatment for behavior problems. This is due to the potential adverse effects which include but are not limited to: inhibition of learning, increased fear-related and aggressive behaviors, and injury to animals and people interacting with animals.\\" Praise In his 2005 textbook on training and behavior, Steven Lindsay writes \\"Instead of instilling social aversion and anxiety ... animal and human research supports the notion that competent shock [collar] training appears to promote positive social attachment, safety, and reward effects that may be provided and amplified via affectionate petting and reassuring praise. The preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that [electrical stimulation] escape/avoidance and pain reduction should promote long-term effects that are incompatible with fear and stress, making the trainer an object of significant extrinsic reward that actually enhances the dog's welfare via an improved capacity for social coping, learning, and adaptation\\". Steven Lindsay states \\"If minimizing the intensity, duration, and frequency of aversive stimulation during training is recognized as a significant factor in the definition of humane dog training, then the radio controlled e-collar must be ranked as one of the most humane dog-training tools currently available\\" \\"The International Association of Canine Professionals (IACP) strongly opposes legislation that bans or limits the humane use of any training tool, saying It is our conviction that limiting the humane use of training tools would result in a higher incidence of nuisance and dangerous dog behavior, and more dogs being surrendered to already over-burdened public shelters.... Dog training is a very diverse field with a single common thread: communication. Dogs are trained for many different tasks such as assisting the disabled, police work, herding, hunting, protection, competition and companionship. Professional trainers achieve these training goals by using a wide variety of tools to communicate with the dog, both at close range, and over long distances. Done effectively, this communication increases desirable behaviors and reduces the incidence of problem behaviors in dogs.... Any efforts to ban or limit the use of training tools would hinder this communication, and our ability to train dogs would suffer. Working dogs would no longer be able to achieve highly specialized tasks, and families with pet dogs would have fewer options available to correct behavioral problems.... Training tools, when properly utilized, are safe and humane\\". Randall Lockwood PhD, senior vice president, Anti-cruelty Initiatives and Legislative Services, The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was quoted in a 2007 White Paper titled \\"The Facts About Modern Electronic Training Devices,\\" produced by Radio Systems, a manufacturer of shock collars, \\"We recognize that older products were often unreliable and difficult to use humanely. But we feel that new technology employed by responsible manufacturers has led to products that can be and are being used safely and effectively to preserve the safety and well-being of many dogs and strengthen the bond with their human companions.\\" Legal status The use of shock collars is banned in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, and Germany, and in some territories of Australia, including New South Wales and South Australia The United States, China, Japan, France, Canada, South Korea, Russia, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, United Arab Emirates, Finland, New Zealand, Portugal and 168 other nations listed by the United Nations do not regulate the use of electrical collars. In March 2010, the Welsh Assembly voted to ban the use of shock collars in Wales. The ban was unsuccessfully challenged by Petsafe, a manufacturer of these devices, and the Electronic Collar Manufacturers' Association, who claimed that it breached Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention of Human Rights. In August 2018, it was announced that shock collars for cats and dogs would be banned in England. The Environment secretary Michael Gove said that shock collars caused unacceptable \\"harm and suffering\\". Animal charities, including the Kennel Club, the RSPCA and the Dogs Trust, welcomed the move. Legal cases involving shock collars The potential for shock collars to have a negative impact on behaviour has been recognised by the UK courts. In 2001 Ostarra Langridge was prosecuted after one of her dogs attacked and killed a Shih Tzu whilst on a walk. A control order, rather than a destruction order, was imposed as the magistrates accepted the defense that Ms. Langridge's dog's aggressive behaviour was attributable to the effects of the shock collar. \\"Ms. Langridge sought the help of a behaviourist when her dogs started to run away from her on their walks along the beach. The dogs were given shock collars, which Miss Langridge was told to keep on for three months and activate whenever they misbehaved. But the first time the dogs got a shock was by mistake, after a small dog they were walking past made Miss Langridge jump. From then on her pets associated the shocks with small dogs and became afraid of them. When Miss Langridge described the day in July when her dogs turned on a Shih Tzu she had tears in her eyes.\\". She stated \\"\\"They connected the pain of the electric shock with little dogs because of the first time I used the collar. The day that machine came in this house I regret.\\" On April 11, 2011, a 48-year-old man from Ogmore-by-Sea became the first person convicted of illegal use of a shock collar in Wales. He was subsequently fined ¬£2,000 and assessed ¬£1,000 for court costs. In 2002, the RSPCA, Victoria (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) lost a defamation lawsuit to Orion Pet Products, a shock collar manufacturer, and was ordered to pay $100,00 in damages. The RSPCA had falsely claimed that shock collars can cause burns and delivered 3,000 volt shocks to dogs. They made the \\"fanciful claim\\" that the current from a shock collar had caused a 60 Kilogram dog to perform backflips and resulted in brain damage. Justice Weinberg also found that the RSPCA claims that these collars caused epileptic fits, vomiting, seizures, burning and bleeding were misleading. The RSPCA's senior inspector had falsified evidence in an attempt to demonstrate that shock collars can cause burns.

In the United States, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 1995, women reported a six times greater rate of intimate partner violence than men.References Examining Assaults By Women On Their Spouses Or Male Partners: An Annotated Bibliography However, studies have found that men are much less likely to report victimization in these situations.

Pregnancy  Domestic violence during pregnancy can be missed by medical professionals because it often presents in non-specific ways. A number of countries have been statistically analyzed to calculate the prevalence of this phenomenon: * UK prevalence: 3.4% * USA prevalence: 3.2‚Äì33.7% * Ireland prevalence: 12.5% * Rates are higher in teenagers * Severity and frequency increase postpartum (10% antenatally vs. 19% postnatally); 21% at 3 months post partum There are a number of presentations that can be related to domestic violence during pregnancy: delay in seeking care for injuries; late booking, non-attenders at appointments, self-discharge; frequent attendance, vague problems; aggressive or over- solicitous partner; burns, pain, tenderness, injuries; vaginal tears, bleeding, STDs; and miscarriage. Domestic violence against a pregnant woman can also affect the fetus and can have lingering effects on the child after birth. Physical abuse is associated with neonatal death (1.5% versus 0.2%), and verbal abuse is associated with low birth weight (7.6% versus 5.1%). = Against men = Due to social stigmas regarding male victimization, men who are victims of domestic violence face an increased likelihood of being overlooked by healthcare providers. While much attention has been focused on domestic violence against women, researchers argue that domestic violence against men is a substantial social problem worthy of attention. The issue of victimization of men by women has been contentious, due in part to studies which report drastically different statistics regarding domestic violence. Men and women commit equivalent or similar rates of minor intimate partner violence via physical altercation, but more severe perpetration of physical violence tends to be committed by men, Pdf. and victimization reports generally show women being more likely to experience domestic violence than men.Desmarais, Sara L.

DOI: 10.1891/1946-6560.3.2.140 A 2013 review of the literature that combined perpetration and victimization reports indicate that, worldwide, most studies only look at female victimization. The review examined studies from five continents and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims. Sherry Hamby argues that victimization reports are more reliable than perpetration reports and therefore studies showing women being more likely to suffer domestic violence than men are the accurate ones.Hamby, Sherry. \\"A Scientific Answer to a Scientific Question: The Gender Debate on Intimate Partner Violence.\\" July 2015 Trauma Violence & Abuse 18(2)DOI: 10.1177/1524838015596963 A 2016 meta- analysis indicated that the only risk factors for the perpetration of intimate partner violence that differ by gender are witnessing intimate partner violence as a child, alcohol use, male demand, and female withdrawal communication patterns.\\"Gender Differences in Risk Markers for Perpetration of Physical.

By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples. In a survey by the Canadian Government, some 19% of lesbian women reported being victimized by their partners.Canadian Government‚ÄîAbuse in Lesbian Relationships Other research reports that lesbian relationships exhibit substantially higher rates of physical aggression.\\"[A 1991 study] reported, in a survey of 350 lesbians, that rates of verbal, physical and sexual abuse were all significantly higher in lesbian relationships than in heterosexual relationships: 56.8% had been sexually victimized by a female, 45% had experienced physical aggression, and 64.5% experienced physical or emotional aggression. Of this sample of women, 78.2% had been in a prior relationship with a man. Reports of violence by men were all lower than reports of violence in prior relationships with women (sexual victimization, 41.9% (vs. 56.8% with women); physical victimization 32.4% (vs. 45%) and emotional victimization 55.1% (vs. 64.5%).\\" Dutton, 1994 = Against children = The U.

Violence and the Family: Report of the American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Violence and the Family. 1996 Girls whose fathers batter their mothers are 6.5 times more likely to be sexually abused by their fathers than are girls from non-violent homes. In China in 1989, 39,000 baby girls died during their first year of life because they didn't receive the same medical care that would be given to a male child. In Asia alone, about one million children working in the sex trade are held in slavery-like conditions. = Between teenagers = Teen dating violence is a pattern of controlling behavior by one teenager over another teenager who are in a dating relationship. While there are many similarities to \\"traditional\\" domestic violence there are also some differences. Teens are much more likely than adults to become isolated from their peers as the result of controlling behavior by their boyfriend/girlfriend. Also, for many teens the abusive relationship may be their first dating experience and have never had a \\"normal\\" dating experience with which to compare it. While teenagers are trying to establish their sexual identities, they are also confronting violence in their relationships and exposure to technology. Studies document that teenagers are experiencing significant amounts of dating or domestic violence. Depending on the population studied and the way dating violence is defined, between 9 and 35% of teens have experienced domestic violence in a dating relationship. When a broader definition of abuse that encompasses physical, sexual, and emotional abuse is used, one in three teen girls is subjected to dating abuse.\\" Additionally, a significant number of teens are victims of stalking by intimate partners. Although involvement with romantic relationships is a critical aspect of adolescence, these relationships also present serious risks for teenagers. Unfortunately, adolescents in dating relationships are at greater risk of intimate partner violence than any other age group. Approximately one third of adolescent girls are victims of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner. Estimates of sexual victimization range from 14% to 43% of girls and 0.3% to 36% for boys. According to the Center for Disease Control, in 2009, nearly 10% of students nationwide had been intentionally hit, slapped, or physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend. Twenty-six percent of girls in a relationship reported being threatened with violence or experiencing verbal abuse; 13% reported being physically hurt or hit. Measuring Measures of the incidence of violence in intimate relationships can differ markedly in their findings depending on the measures used. Care is needed when using domestic violence statistics to ensure that both gender bias and under-reporting issues do not affect the inferences that are drawn from the statistics. Some researchers, such as Michael P. Johnson, suggest that where and how domestic violence is measured also affects findings, and caution is needed to ensure statistics drawn from one class of situations are not applied to another class of situations in a way that might have fatal consequences.New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse Other researchers, such as David Murray Fergusson, counter that domestic violence prevention services, and statistics that they produce, target the extreme end of domestic violence and preventing child abuse rather than domestic violence between couples.New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse =Europe= A Bulgarian poster urging people to open their eyes about domestic violence against women A 1992 Council of Europe study on domestic violence against women found that 1 in 4 women experience domestic violence over their lifetimes and between 6 and 10% of women suffer domestic violence in a given year. In the European Union, DV is a serious problem in the Baltic States. These three countries ‚Äì Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania ‚Äì have also lagged behind most post-communist countries in their response to DV. The problem in these countries is very severe, and in 2013 a DV victim won a European Court of Human Rights case against Lithuania. United Kingdom The British Crime Survey for 2006‚Äì2007 reported that 0.5% of people (0.6% of women and 0.3% of men) reported being victims of domestic violence during that year and 44.3% of domestic violence was reported to the police. According to the survey, 312,000 women and 93,000 men were victims of domestic violence.Crime in England and Wales 2006/07 The Northern Ireland Crime Survey for 2005 reported that 13% of people (16% of women and 10% of men) reported being victims of domestic violence at some point in their lives. The National Study of Domestic Abuse for 2005 reported that 213,000 women and 88,000 men reported being victims of domestic violence at some point in their lives. According to the study, one in seven women and one in sixteen men were victims of severe physical abuse, severe emotional abuse, or sexual abuse. In the United Kingdom, the police estimate that around 35% of domestic violence against women is actually reported. A 2002 Women's Aid study found that 74% of separated women suffered from post-separation violence. = North America = Canada In Canada, the Assembly of First Nations evaluation of the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program conducted by CIET offers an inclusive and relatively unbiased national estimate. It documented domestic violence in a random sample of 85 First Nations across Canada: 22% (523/2359) of mothers reported suffering abuse in the year prior to being interviewed; of these, 59% reported physical abuse. Results of studies which estimate the prevalence of domestic violence vary significantly, depending on specific wording of survey questions, how the survey is conducted, the definition of abuse or domestic violence used, the willingness or unwillingness of victims to admit that they have been abused and other factors. For instance, Straus (2005) conducted a study which estimated that the rate of minor assaults by women in the United States was 78 per 1,000 couples, compared with a rate for men of 72 per 1,000 and the severe assault rate was 46 per 1,000 couples for assaults by women and 50 per 1,000 for assaults by men. Neither difference is statistically significant. He claimed that since these rates were based exclusively on information provided by women respondents, the near-equality in assault rates could not be attributed to a gender bias in reporting.Straus, 2005 One analysis found that \\"women are as physically aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners\\". However, studies have shown that women are more likely to be injured. Archer's meta- analysis found that women in the United States suffer 65% of domestic violence injuries. A Canadian study showed that 7% of women and 6% of men were abused by their current or former partners, but female victims of spousal violence were more than twice as likely to be injured as male victims, three times more likely to fear for their life, twice as likely to be stalked, and twice as likely to experience more than ten incidents of violence. However, Straus notes that Canadian studies on domestic violence have simply excluded questions that ask men about being victimized by their wives. According to a 2004 survey in Canada, the percentages of males being physically or sexually victimized by their partners was 6% versus 7% for women. However, females reported higher levels of repeated violence and were more likely than men to experience serious injuries; 23% of females versus 15% of males were faced with the most serious forms of violence including being beaten, choked, or threatened with or having a gun or knife used against them. Also, 21% of women versus 11% of men were likely to report experiencing more than 10 violent incidents. Women who often experience higher levels of physical or sexual violence from their current partner, were 44%, compared with 18% of men to suffer from an injury. Cases in which women are faced with extremely abusive partners, results in the females having to fear for their lives due to the violence they had faced. In addition, statistics show that 34% of women feared for their lives, and 10% of men feared for theirs.O'Grady William (2011). Crime in Canadian Context: debates and controversies.

Retrieved on 2011-12-23. United States Approximately 1.3 million women and 835,000 men report being physically assaulted by an intimate partner annually in the United States. In the United States, domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women between the ages of 15 and 44. Victims of DV are offered legal remedies, which include the criminal law, as well as obtaining a protection order. The remedies offered can be both of a civil nature (civil orders of protection and other protective services) and of a criminal nature (charging the perpetrator with a criminal offense). People perpetrating DV are subject to criminal prosecution, most often under assault and battery laws. =Asia= In Russia, according to a representative of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs one in four families experiences domestic violence. Domestic violence is not a specific criminal offense, but it can be charged under various crimes of the criminal code (e.g. assault), but in practice cases of domestic violence turn into criminal cases only when they involve severe injuries, or the victim has died.

One study found that half of Palestinian women have been the victims of domestic violence.Alexander, Doug. \\"Addressing Violence Against Palestinian Women\\". International Development Research Centre (June 23, 2000). A study on Bedouin women in Israel found that most have experienced DV, most accepted it as a decree from God, and most believed they were to blame themselves for the violence. The study also showed that the majority of women were not aware of existing laws and policies which protect them: 60% said they did not know what a restraining order was. In Iraq husbands have a legal right to \\"punish\\" their wives. The criminal code states at Paragraph 41 that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights include: \\"The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom\\". In Jordan, part of article 340 of the Penal Code states that \\"he who discovers his wife or one of his female relatives committing adultery and kills, wounds, or injures one of them, is exempted from any penalty.\\" This has twice been put forward for cancellation by the government, but was retained by the Lower House of the Parliament, in 2003: a year in which at least seven honor killings took place. Article 98 of the Penal Code is often cited alongside Article 340 in cases of honor killings. \\"Article 98 stipulates that a reduced sentence is applied to a person who kills another person in a 'fit of fury'\\".

Plot In the present, Andrew Kwong is visited in his sleep by his dead grandmother, Eng Ahn. Andrew's wife Elizabeth is pregnant and Andrew is conflicted about it. Ahn tells him about his great-grandfather, Eng Tieng- Bin, who was a Chinese businessman in 1918. After spending time in the Philippines with Westerners, Tieng-Bin desires a modern life. He has returned to his home in rural China, where he has three wives‚ÄîEng Siu-Yong, Eng Luan, and Eng Eling‚Äîand a daughter, Eng Ahn, who calls herself the \\"Golden Child.\\" Tieng-Bin, who has been meeting with a Christian missionary, Rev. Anthony Baines, wishes to convert to Christianity and adopt a more Westernized lifestyle, but that puts him at odds against his family and traditions. After arguing about it with his wives, Tieng-Bin orders that Ahn's feet be unbound, considering it to be a backward and inhumane practice. In Act II, Tieng-Ban has Ahn and his wives meeting with Rev. Baines to learn about Christianity. Eng Luan embraces the religion as she hopes to become Tieng-Ban's only wife when he converts and has to choose among the three. Tieng-Bin feels most fondly for Eling, who is now pregnant, but she is conflicted about leaving the old traditions behind. Siu-Yong, addicted to opium, rejects Tieng-Bin's wishes to convert, and has Ahn spy on her husband's sessions with the reverend. When Tieng-Bin learns this, he destroys Siu-Yong's family altar. Luan and Eling are baptized along with Tieng-Bin, but Siu-Yong dies of an opium overdose. The ghost of Siu-Yong visits Eling and convinces her she will never be able to become fully Western like Tieng-Bin wants, and so Eling sacrifices herself and her unborn child. Ahn confronts a devastated Tieng-Bin and encourages him to continue pursuing a Western life for the benefit of the family. Back in the present, Andrew is afraid he'll fail as a father and husband like Tieng-Bin, but Ahn explains that despite his suffering, Tieng-Bin did bring his family into the future. His actions allowed her to come to America, become educated, choose her own husband and be a Christian. Andrew resolves to write about his family history and finally starts to feel a fondness for his unborn child. Critical reception The reviewer of the 2012 Off-Broadway production wrote: \\" 'Golden Child' is loosely based on the story of Hwang's Chinese great- grandfather's conversion to Christianity in the early years of the 20th century. Written with insight, compassion, and a sharp eye for the unintended consequences of clashing cultures, 'Golden Child' is one of Hwang's best works, as entertaining as it is thought-provoking...

It was produced by Hellmuth Walter Kommanditgesellschaft (HWK) commencing in 1943, with license production by the Heinkel firm's facilities in Jenbach, Austria. Design and development An early Walter HWK 109-509A-1 rocket motor, believed to be one of the best preserved in existence and possibly used for instructional purposes.HWK 109-509.A-1 Wkr.Nr. None - Shuttleworth Collection The cockpit of the Me 163 Komet is a mockup. (Shuttleworth Collection, UK) Early versions of the Me 163 had been powered by an earlier design running on a \\"cold engine\\" fueled with Z-Stoff. This fuel tended to clog the jets in the combustion chamber, causing fluctuations in power and potentially explosions. Worse, however, was the fact that the engine could not be throttled, and when the aircraft leveled off after its climb to altitude it quickly accelerated to speeds that caused serious compressibility issues. The RLM demanded that a version be developed with a throttle. HWK 109-509 A-1 Rocket Engine at Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center Virginia, USA. During this period Walter had also been working with a new fuel known as C-Stoff that gave off significant heat and was thus known as the \\"hot engine\\". C-Stoff was a mix of 30% hydrazine hydrate + 57% methanol + 13% water with a small amount of potassium-copper-cyanide. The oxidizer, known as T-Stoff, consisted of an 80%-concentration hydrogen peroxide-based formulation. The two reacted violently on contact.Botho St√ºwe, Peene M√ºnde West, Weltbildverlag , 1998 page 220, German The violent combustion process resulted in the formation of water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and a huge amount of heat sending out a superheated stream of steam, nitrogen and air that was drawn in through the hole in the mantle of the engine, thus providing a forward thrust of approximately 17 kN (3,820 lbf). To address the throttling issue, the new engine included turbopumps with two settings. The pumps were driven by a single turbine, powered by steam created by decomposing the T-Stoff with a wire mesh catalyst.Botho St√ºwe, Peene M√ºnde West, Weltbildverlag , 1998 Seite 221+222 Combined with a mechanical throttle, this provided four power settings from idle to full power for climbing. In practice it was found that throttling the engine dramatically decreased its fuel economy to the point that it did not extend the endurance of the aircraft as expected. This version was put into the Me 163B in spite of this problem. The ultimate solution to the throttling problem was the B and C series of the engine. These engines used two combustion chambers, the original one (retroactively given the name Hauptofen), and a second, smaller Marschofen chamber directly beneath the main Hauptofen chamber, tuned to provide the cruise power needed for high-speed level flight, about . This chamber provided that power at peak efficiency, so it did not suffer from the problems found while throttling on the original models. The throttle on the original combustion chamber was removed, and throttling was instead provided by turning the main engine on and off. This new version dramatically improved cruise endurance, with overall flight times improving from eight to twelve minutes, a 50% improvement. It was also mechanically simpler as the turbopumps were no longer throttled. The engine was an integral design with all components of the drive, with the exception of fuel tanks, locked in a cubical frame ‚Äî this frame was discarded for the 109-509C dual-chamber design.

This instrumental air was one of the first works for harpsichord published by Handel and is made up of four movements.Paul Henry Lang, George Frideric Handel, W. W. Norton and Company Inc, New York, 1966 An air is followed by five doubles (variations in the English division style): semiquavers in the right hand; semiquavers in the left hand; semiquaver triplets in the right and left hands; and finally demisemiquavers in both hands.  Handel's life  Around the time of 1720, G. F. Handel had just left his native land of Germany to London, accepting his new position at the Royal Academy of Music. Before that, Handel had already moved to England in 1712, spending his time based at the Burlington House before becoming house composer at Cannons in Middlesex.Newman Flower, George Frideric Handel: His Personality & His Times, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1948 It has been suggested that the move to Cannons was related to the fact that in 1717 there was reduced demand for his services in central London because operatic productions were experiencing a temporary downturn. At the end of Handel's stay at Cannons, the Duke and his friends helped him establish a new opera company in London, the so-called Royal Academy of Music.  The eight suites of 1720  Handel published his first eight harpsichord suites in 1720 with the following explanation: Among the eight suites published for harpsichord in 1720, Handel published his Suite no. 5 in E major, HWV 430. This suite consists of four movements: The Prelude, Allemande, Courante and Air and Variations; the first three movements having stylized dance rhythms. This suite was promulgated a year after Handel became Master of the Orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music, also known as the first Italian opera company in London.Mary Ann Parker-Hale, G. F. Handel: A Guide to Research, Garland Publishing, New York, 1988 Handel lived the remainder of his life in London after leaving Germany to work as resident composer for Earl of Carnarvon.Charles Cudworth, Handel, Clive Bingley, Shoestring Press, 1927  The name  There have been a number of explanations proffered as to why this movement was called The Harmonious Blacksmith, and by whom. The name was not given by Handel and was not recorded until early in the 19th century, when the movement became popular on its own (while Handel's music remained popular in England continuously after his death, it was only very selectively known.) = An unproven history = William Powell's infamous grave The story is that Handel, when working for James Brydges the future Duke of Chandos at Cannons between 1717 and 1718, once took shelter from the rain in a smithy, and was inspired to write his tune upon hearing the hammer on the anvil; the regularly repeated pedal note (B in the right hand) in the first variation, can give the impression of a blacksmith hammering. A variation on the story is that he heard the blacksmith singing the tune which would later become the Air; this explanation fits in nicely with Handel's general technique of borrowing tunes. Neither story is true. The legend began three-quarters of a century after Handel's death with Richard Clark in his Reminiscences of Handel (1836). Henry Wylde and Richard Clark then found an old anvil in a smithy near Whitchurch, Edgware, and fabricated a story to identify William Powell as the fictitious blacksmith, when, in fact, he had been the parish clerk. They raised a subscription for a wooden memorial to him, and in 1868, the people of Whitchurch subscribed again for a grandiloquent gravestone, still standing. It reads: \\"In memory of William Powell, the Harmonious Blacksmith, who was buried 27. of February 1780, aged 78 years. He was Parish Clerk during the time the immortal Handel was organist of this church. Erected by subscription, May 1868.\\" Handel had written his harpsichord suites of the 1720 publication before he lived at Cannons, when he was at Adlington Hall in Cheshire, or even earlier still. = Another possible history = William Lintern was a blacksmith's apprentice from Bath who later took up music and so was The Harmonious Blacksmith. The piece came to be called after him, probably because he published it under that name for reasons outlined in the following extract: Chappell was a respected musical historian and the story is probably true, but there is no copy of Lintern's edition of the piece in the British Museum, and Mr W. C. Smith, who worked at the museum and was a Handelian specialist of high standing, said that the earliest copy of the piece that he had yet (as of 1940) been able to find under the name The Harmonious Blacksmith was that published by the British Harmonic Institution, arranged as a piano-forte duet, the paper of which bears the watermark '1819'.  Origins of the music  As to the origins of the music, a bourr√©e by Richard Jones (1680‚Äì1740) features almost the same air in a minor key, though it is not known whether Jones preceded Handel or vice versa. A passage in Handel's opera Almira, written in 1704, is very like the Harmonious Blacksmith tune, so it is likely that it was his own. Beethoven used a similar theme for the subject of a two-part organ fugue. There also exist several early manuscript versions of this piece, in G major and entitled Chaconne. The overall shape and form of the variations are the same, but the melody as we know it is not yet fully formed, and there are significant improvements to texture and passagework throughout the later published version. Interesting, perhaps, is a complete lack of the insistent repetition of b' (d\\" through transposition), which has since been commonly associated with the image of a blacksmith striking his anvil.  Structure  The final movement of Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major, HWV 430, consists of the opening theme and five variations, all in E major. \\"Air and Variations\\" only modulates from the tonic key to the dominant, with no modal mixture. = Theme = The theme is in rounded, continuous binary form and is made up of two phrases, with the exposition beginning with the first musical phrase ending on a half cadence and the following phrase ending with a perfect authentic cadence resulting in a parallel period. The music is set in simple meter, with a 4/4 time signature throughout. Moving eighth notes create the foundation for both the right and left hand. Upon completion of the first phrase, the tonic key is reestablished and the right hand begins to play sixteenth notes until a perfect authentic cadence in measure ten, followed by recapitulation of the second phrase. The first measure outlines the tonic and dominant chords, followed in the next measure by a repeat of tonic and dominant chords until the fourth beat, where Handel applies a secondary dominant that leads to a [B major] chord on the first beat of the third measure. This initial motive is repeated in measures three and four, ending the first phrase on a half cadence. The second phrase begins on the tonic chord arpeggiated, followed by a IV chord. This I to IV is repeated until measure five, where the dominant chord is added to the progression, creating a common I, IV, V, I chord progression. This new phrase retains the same chord progression in measures seven and eight, ending the second phrase on a perfect authentic cadence. = Variation One = Variation one includes the same motivic ideas and adds arpeggiation of the chords with focus on the tonic and dominant key, B major. Both phrases are made up of five measures, with the first ending on a half cadence and the final phrase of the variation ending on a perfect authentic cadence. = Variation Two = The melody is switched between hands and is now played in the right hand with the left hand arpeggiating the harmonic chordal progression. The left hand plays sixteenth notes throughout this variation and the right hand only plays eighth notes, with the addition of trills in the second phrase. The motivic structure remains the same, with focus on only the tonic and dominant keys. = Variation Three = The third variation introduces the new musical idea of sixteenth note triplets in the right hand, with the left hand playing the melody in eighth notes. Variation three has the same progression and division of musical sections, but the melody is no longer in the right hand, with the left hand arpeggiating a harmony identical in structure to the theme and both preceding variations. = Variation Four = The penultimate variation trades the melody to the right hand, with the left hand playing sixteenth note triplets. This variation is almost identical in structure to its predecessor, with the roles of the hands switching. = Variation Five = The fifth, and final, variation consists of impressive scale work that is played by both hands, with each run of thirty-second notes being returned with another set of thirty-second notes in the following beat, usually played by the opposite hand. The same progression and structural ideas are maintained throughout this variation, ending on a descending E major scale starting on the dominant, resulting in a final perfect authentic cadence.  Literary mention  Pip, the main character in Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, is fondly given the nickname of Handel by the character Herbert Pocket, in honor of Pip's upbringing as a blacksmith, and in honor of this music: \\"We are so harmonious- and you have been a blacksmith\\". Saint Dunstan is named as the Harmonious Blacksmith in the 18th century poem \\"The Devil and Saint Dunstan\\". The piece is mentioned in Siegfried Sassoon's semi-autobiographical work Memoirs of a Fox Hunting Man. Aunt Evelyn is heard to be playing the piece one evening and the author recalls this happy memory during his time at the Front.  Musical influence  The Italian guitarist-composer Mauro Giuliani used the theme as the basis for his Variazioni su un tema di Handel (\\"The Harmonious Blacksmith\\"), Op. 107, for solo guitar in 1828. The German composer Louis Spohr used the theme as the basis for a variation movement in his Octet in E major, Op. 32. The theme is referenced at the beginning of the finale of Francis Poulenc's Concert champ√™tre. The Australian-born composer and pianist Percy Grainger based one of his most famous works on this melody. He first wrote his Variations on Handel's ‚ÄòThe Harmonious Blacksmith‚Äô in 1911. Shortly after, he used the first sixteen bars of his set of variations to create one of his most beloved pieces, Handel in the Strand. He wrote that the music ‚Äúseemed to reflect both Handel and English musical comedy‚Äù, hence the title. The composer made various versions of the work, most notably, a piano solo version (1930).

Created in 1981 by singer Robert Ernlund and guitarist , the band had national and as well as international success with songs like \\"Get You on the Run\\", \\"World of Promises\\", \\"Party All Over\\" and \\"Ready for the Taking\\" in the second half of the 1980s. They played at rock festivals like Monsters of Rock in 1988 in Germany. They were also the opening act for Queen in Sweden in 1986 and opened for W.A.S.P. during their first Swedish tour. They were signed to the labels Mercury and then Vertigo . The band originally disbanded in 1993 due to failing to maintain success with new singer Mats Lev√©n; however, former band members worked later together on two new songs for the 2006 compilation album Weapons of choice 1984-2006; the album sold better than expected, convincing them that the band was still relevant. This led to Treat being revived later that year, with most of its 1989-1991 line-up, including Ernlund and Wikstr√∂m, and signing up with Universal. They have since released three new studio albums: Coup de Grace, Ghost of Graceland and Tunguska.  History  = Formation and early days (1981-1985) = The band was founded in Stockholm, Sweden in 1981 as \\"The Boys\\" by singer Robert Ernlund and guitarists Anders \\"Gary\\" Wikstrom and Leif \\"Lillen\\" Liljegren, a former member of punk rockers KSMB, but it was not until drummer Mats \\"Dalton\\" Dahlberg joined the band in the summer of 1983 that the band began to gain a following. Dalton had attained some contacts with Swedish PolyGram Records, which at the time was looking for a new Swedish hard rock band to sign. Around the same time bass player Tomas Lind joined and the band began to record a demo tape. When asked in early interviews who influenced their sound the band members said that they were heavily influenced by bands such as Whitesnake, Journey, Kiss and Van Halen The band's demo tape landed them a deal with Mercury Records and they started recording their debut album Scratch and Bite, changing their name to Treat. The first single released from the album was \\"Too Wild\\"; the single received much airplay in Sweden and took the Swedish hardrock scene by surprise. Europe's vocalist Joey Tempest said in an interview that when he heard the song he knew it would be a hit so a couple of days later he wrote the song \\"The Final Countdown\\" as a rival to their single. At the same time \\"Too Wild\\" was released, bassist Tomas Lind left the band and was replaced by Kenneth Sivertsson, former bass player with the band Factory who had a couple of hits in Sweden in the late 1970s. The band released Scratch and Bite in the summer of 1985 and toured all over Sweden, but in August drummer Mats Dahlberg quit the band to form his own glam metal outfit Dalton, and was soon replaced with Leif Sundin who later played with Six Feet Under. = Success in Europe (1985-1991) = The band set about recording their second and most critically acclaimed album The Pleasure Principle in late 1985. It was released almost a year later in the summer of 1986 and suffered in the charts, largely due to Europe's album The Final Countdown storming the charts and the band was unfairly compared to Europe by the media and press. The song \\"Rev It Up\\" from the album was covered by American band Newcity Rockers and was a hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for them. The next album the band released was Dreamhunter, which spawned the successful single \\"World of Promises\\"; the video for the single received airplay on MTVs Headbangers Ball and was later covered by Swedish metal band In Flames on their 2000 album Clayman. During the recording of the album, drummer Leif Sundin left the band and was replaced by Jamie Borger. The band had only minor success with the album, but nevertheless managed to join the Monsters of Rock Tour 1988 in support of it. Soon after they completed the tour guitarist Leif Liljegren was fired from the band in December 1988, followed shortly by bassist Kenneth Siwertsson, who quit in February 1989 due to the band's lack of success. The band's final album of the 1980s was Organized Crime, released in September 1989 on Vertigo Records. For this album the band brought in bassist Joakim \\"Joe\\" Larsson (Ex- Six Feet Under, Power, Jammer) to replace Siwertsson. They also decided to replace Liljegren with a keyboard player instead of a new guitarist, in order to take some burden off Wikstr√∂m¬¥s shoulders, who always played both guitar and keys live. Patrick \\"Green\\" Appelgren (ex-Power), the younger brother of Mikael \\"√Ñpplet\\" Appelgren (European table tennis champion in the late 1980s), handled all keys from then on. The album did badly in the charts and was a commercial disappointment. The band toured in Japan in 1990 in support of the album, but achieved little success. This led lead guitarist Anders Wikstrom to leave the band, as he was tired of the band's lack of success. He later joined the grunge band Mental Hippie Blood. = Self-titled album and breakup (1991-1993) = In late 1990, the band replaced Ernlund with current Candlemass singer Mats Lev√©n, who had previously sung with the band Swedish Erotica and recorded their last album of the 1990s. The self-titled album Treat was released in 1992 and again failed to gain any success for the band and led to the band's break-up on 26 March 1993. = Reunion (2006-present) = In 2005 a compilation album was released called Weapons of Choice, which sold surprisingly well around the world and led to the band reforming with the 1989 line-up plus Nalle P√•hlsson on bass. The band then signed a deal with Universal and played at the Sweden Rock Festival on 10 June 2006. On 19 March 2010 the band released their reunion album Coup de Grace which was a great success for the band and has led to them touring the world for the first time since the 1980s. The album received positive reviews from the press. In July 2014, Treat played the V√§sby Rock festival in Upplands V√§sby, Sweden. Treat released their album, Ghost of Graceland on 13 April 2016. Their latest album, Tunguska was released in 2018.

Development The Fw 56 was developed, in accordance with a request by the Reich Air Ministry for an advanced fighter trainer, by Kurt Tank, chief engineer with Focke-Wulf. It was also considered for possible use as a home defence fighter. The first prototype flew for the first time in November 1933. A second prototype had some modifications made to the fuselage, and metal rather than wooden wings for flight testing. The third prototype, which flew in February 1934, reverted to the wooden wing and satisfied the technical designers. After comparison flights in 1935 against its two competitors - the Arado Ar 76 and the Heinkel He 74 - the Air Ministry ordered production to begin. About 1,000 aircraft were built, mostly used by Germany, though numbers were used by Austria and Hungary. A few were sold for private use, for instance to Gerd Achgelis, who later founded the helicopter company Focke- Achgelis with Henrich Focke.

The wing was of wood, covered mostly in plywood, while the trailing edge was fabric-covered. The fixed conventional undercarriage consisted of two cantilever main legs and a tailskid. The aircraft was powered by an air-cooled Argus inline engine and intended as a single-seat advanced trainer for the fledgling pilot trainee to transition to from the Bucher primary trainer. In addition, for its secondary role as an emergency fighter as well as aiding aspiring fighter pilot trainees in conversion, it was fitted with 2 fixed cowl-mounted 7.9mm MG17 machine guns as well as a removable ventral rack for 3 10kg bombs (inert practice bombs or, in the event, light antipersonnel fragmentation bombs) The Fw 56 was highly popular with pilots,Munson, K.

The Brethren or Brethren of the Coast were a loose coalition of pirates and privateers commonly known as buccaneers and active in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. They were a syndicate of captains with letters of marque and reprisal who regulated their privateering enterprises within the community of privateers and with their outside benefactors. They were primarily private individual merchant mariners of Protestant background usually of English and French origin. During their heyday, when the Thirty Years War was devastating the Protestant communities of France, Germany and the Netherlands while England was engaged in various conflicts, the privateers of these nationalities were issued letters of marque to raid Catholic French and Spanish shipping and territories. Based primarily on the island of Tortuga off the coast of Haiti and in the city of Port Royal on the island of Jamaica, the original Brethren were mostly French Huguenot and British Protestants, but their ranks were joined by other adventurers of various nationalities including Spaniards, and even African sailors, as well as escaped slaves and outlaws of various sovereigns. In keeping with their Protestant and mostly Common Law heritage, the Brethren were governed by codes of conduct that favored legislative decision-making, hierarchical command authority, individual rights, and equitable division of revenues. Henry Morgan was perhaps the most famous member of the Brethren and the one usually credited with codifying its organization. However, following the demographic changes which featured the rise of slave labor in the Caribbean islands, most maritime families moved to the mainland colonies of the future United States or to their home countries. A few, unable to compete effectively with slave labor, enamored of easy riches, or out of angst, continued to maintain the Brethren of the Coasts as a purely criminal organization which preyed upon all civilian maritime shipping. This second era of the Brethren began the age of piracy and brigandage which affected the Caribbean until socioeconomic and military changes of the late 18th and early 19th century finally broke its back. Many pirates made their journeys there; one of the most famous was Alexandre Exquemelin. A fictionalized, romanticized version of the Brethren was featured in the Pirates of the Caribbean films.

Chouhan sparks debate is a large lake which lies on the western side of the capital city of Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal, India. It is a major source of drinking water for the residents of the city, serving around 40% of the residents with nearly of water per day. Bada talaab, along with the nearby Chhota Talaab, meaning small lake in Hindi, constitute Bhoj Wetland, which is now a Ramsar site. History According to the local folklore, Bhojtal is said to have been built by the Paramara Raja Bhoj during his tenure as a king of Malwa (1005‚Äì1055). He is also said to have established the city of Bhopal (also named after him, then as Bhojpal) to secure the eastern frontier of his kingdom. There is a legend why they built the lake. Once king Bhoj suffered from skin disease and all Vaidyas (Doctor in English) failed to cure him. Then, one day a saint told the king to build a tank to combine 365 tributaries and then have a bath in it to wipe out the skin disease. Bhoj called upon his engineers to build up a huge tank. They spotted a place near river Betwa, which was 32 km away from Bhopal. It was found that it has only 359 tributaries. A Gond Commander Kalia fulfilled this shortage. He then gave the address of an invisible river. After merging the tributaries of this river the number 365 was completed. The lake was created by constructing an earthen dam across the Kolans River. An eleven gate dam called the Bhadbhada dam was constructed at Bhadbhada in 1965 at the southeast corner of the Lake, and now controls the outflow to the river Kaliasote. The lake was known as the Upper Lake or Bada Talab (\\"Big Pond\\") until March 2011 it was renamed to Bhojtaal in honour of the Great King Raja Bhoj who built it. A huge statue of Raja Bhoj, standing with sword, was also installed on a pillar on one corner of the lake to cement the name of Bhopal as the city of lakesBhopal May Become Bhojpal Soon . Outlook, 1 March 2011. In July 2016 :Bhopal Upper Lake dam gates opened so early in July after 38 years. Geography Bhojtal is situated on the west central part of Bhopal city and is surrounded by Van Vihar National Park on the south, human settlements on the east and north, and agriculture fields on the west. It has an area of 31 km2, and drains a catchment or watershed of 361 km2. The watershed of the Upper Lake is mostly rural, with some urbanized areas around its eastern end. The Kolans was formerly a tributary of the Halali River, but with the creation of the lake using an earthen dam and a diversion channel, the upper reach of the Kolans River and Bada Talaab now drain into the Kaliasote River. Social and cultural significance Since the construction of the lake in the 11th century, Bhopal city has grown around it. The people are religiously and culturally attached to the lakes. The lakes meet their needs of water supply and they wash clothes in them (very harmful for the lake ecosystem), cultivate water chestnut in Bhojtal and lotus in Chhota Talaab. The idols of gods and goddesses are also immersed in the lake during religious festivals, though the local administration is advising devotees not to do so. The Takia island in Upper lake has a tomb of the Shah Ali Shah, which has religious and archaeological significance. Economy and entertainment Tourists in Bhojtal The fishing rights to Bhojtal have been given on long lease by the Bhopal Municipal Corporation to a co-operative consisting of some 500 fishermen families. Fishing is mainly done on its south-eastern shores. The lake also serves as the source of water for irrigating a large area. There are 87 villages in its catchment area in the Bhopal as well as Sehore districts. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for people in these areas and most farmers have livestock as well. While some farmers have large landholdings, many farmers are small and marginal farmers with only a few acres of land. Bhojtal attracts tourists due to its scenic beauty. The National Sailing School was established at the Boat Club on its eastern side. This club offers various water sports such as kayaking, canoeing, rafting, water skiing, parasailing etc. A number of operators provide facilities for exciting trips by sail, paddle and motor boats. Van Vihar National Park, situated on the south-eastern side of the lake, attracts tourists. The road passing through it has on one side the animals in their natural habitats, and on the other hand is the scenic beauty of the lake. The other major attraction close to the lake is the Bhopal Zoo on the bank of the lake. This makes the lake a complete entertainment location for all visitors. The zoo is kept in quite natural way. Biodiversity Indian sarus crane The two lakes support flora and fauna.

It is operated by the Soulsville Foundation, which also operates the adjacent Stax Music Academy and The Soulsville Charter School, all located on one vibrant campus. History After Stax Records was forced into involuntary bankruptcy and closed in 1976, the Stax studio was sold by the Union Planters Bank to Southside Church of God in Christ, located nearby on McLemore Avenue. Except for a brief time when it was used as a soup kitchen, it was allowed to deteriorate so it was torn down in 1989. The neighborhood had deteriorated badly and by 1998, a group of concerned people and anonymous philanthropists spearheaded a nonprofit revitalization effort for the area which was dubbed Soulsville after the slogan \\"Soulsville U.S.A.\\" which Stax called its studio on its former theater marquee as a counterpoint to Motown Records' Hitsville U.S.A. Construction began on the Stax Museum and adjacent Stax Music Academy in April 2001. The Stax Music Academy, which had started programming at a nearby elementary school in 2000, opened in 2002 and the museum opened in May 2003. The Stax Museum is a replica of the Stax recording studio, the former Capitol Theatre, down to the sloping floor of studio A. It is a museum with videos, films, photographs, original instruments used to record Stax hits, stage costumes, interactive exhibits, and more than 2000 other items of memorabilia. Some of the standout exhibits include an authentic circa-1906-old Mississippi Delta church from Mississippi, reconstructed in the museum to help show the gospel roots of soul music; the Soul Train dance floor, Isaac Hayes' restored 1972 gold-trimmed, peacock-blue Cadillac El Dorado; and a changing gallery where special exhibits change five times each year. Custom Cadillac El Dorado built for Isaac Hayes. Because the Stax Museum is one of only a handful of museums in the world dedicated to soul music (the Motown Museum in Detroit is another), it not only celebrates the legacy of Stax Records and its artists such as Isaac Hayes, Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, the Staple Singers, Johnnie Taylor, Albert King, Booker T. & the MGs, Rufus and Carla Thomas and others, but also features other soul music labels such as Motown, Hi Records, Atlantic Records, and Muscle Shoals, and visitors are treated to vintage video footage of non-Stax artists such as Aretha Franklin, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Ann Peebles, The Jackson Five, Patti LaBelle, Parliament-Funkadelic, Sam Cooke, James Brown, Ike & Tina Turner, and others. The Stax Music Academy is a state-of-the-art facility where primarily at-risk youth are mentored through music education and unique performance opportunities they would otherwise likely never experience. In 2019, Justin Timberlake and the Levi's Music Project visited the academy for several days and installed a permanent songwriting lab, which has led to the students creating more original music and studying music business. The Soulsville Foundation also operates The Soulsville Charter School, an academically rigorous, musically rich college prep school where students study math, language arts, science, social studies, along with strings orchestra, band, and choir. Their Soulsville Symphony Orchestra has played for the likes of Stevie Wonder, John Legend, and Isaac Hayes.

Since then, both countries have placed considerable importance on the maintenance of an extremely close and supportive special relationship and the two countries have regularly exchanged high-level visits resulting in a variety of agreements. The PRC has provided economic, military, and technical assistance to Pakistan, and each country considers the other a close strategic ally. Bilateral relations have evolved from an initial Chinese policy of neutrality to a partnership with a smaller but militarily powerful Pakistan. Diplomatic relations were established in 1950, boundary issues resolved in 1963, military assistance began in 1966, a strategic alliance was formed in 1972, and economic co-operation began in 1979. China has become Pakistan's largest supplier of arms and its third-largest trading partner. China has given Pakistan a loan of US$60 million which was later made a grant after East Pakistan broke away. Recently, both nations have decided to cooperate in improving Pakistan's civil nuclear power sector. Maintaining close relations with China is a central part of Pakistan's foreign policy. In 1986, President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq visited China to improve diplomatic relations, and Pakistan was one of only two countries, alongside Cuba, to offer crucial support to the PRC after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. China and Pakistan also share close military relations, with China supplying a range of modern armaments to the Pakistani defence forces. China supports Pakistan's stance on Kashmir, while Pakistan supports China on the issues of Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan. Military cooperation has deepened, with joint projects producing armaments ranging from fighter jets to guided missile frigates. Chinese cooperation with Pakistan has reached economic high points, with substantial Chinese investment in Pakistani infrastructural expansion including the Pakistani deep-water port at Gwadar. Both countries have an ongoing free trade agreement. According to China's custom statistics the bilateral trade volume for the calendar year 2017 crossed the US$20 billion mark for the first time. In 2017 China's exports to Pakistan grew by 5.9% to reach $18.25 billion whereas Pakistan's exports to China fell by 4.1% to $1.83 billion. Pakistan has served as China's main bridge to the Islamic world, and also played an important role in bridging the communication gap between the PRC and the West by facilitating U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 visit to China. The relations between Pakistan and China have been described by Pakistan's ambassador to China as \\"higher than the mountains, deeper than the oceans, stronger than steel, dearer than eyesight, sweeter than honey, and so on.\\" According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Pakistan is China's biggest arms buyer, counting for nearly 47% of Chinese arms exports. According to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, 75% of Pakistanis view China's influence positively with only 15% expressing a negative view. In the Asia-Pacific region, Chinese people hold the third most positive opinions of Pakistan's influence in the world, behind Indonesia and Pakistan itself. IR scholars have observed that despite the PRC and Pakistan being \\"highly divergent societies and polities with conflicting views on central global issues\\", the two states have nevertheless forged a dynamic relationship over several decades ‚Äì something which supports the idea that realpolitik motivates foreign policies in the international system. Amin writes that relations between China and Pakistan: \\"represents a striking and paradigmatic example of how state power considerations, rather than culture, ideology, economic interest or composition of ruling elites, can determine foreign policy behaviour ‚Äì as conceptualised by the neo-realist school of International Relations (IR) theory.‚Äù Overview Karakoram Highway connects the two states. Pakistan has a long and strong relationship with China. The long- standing ties between the two countries have been mutually beneficial. A close identity of views and mutual interests remain the centre-point of bilateral ties. Since the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Pakistan has supported China on most issues of importance to the latter, especially those related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, and Tibet and other sensitive issues such as human rights. The Chinese leadership has acknowledged Pakistan's steadfast support on key issues. Pakistan helped China in reestablishing formal ties with the West, where they helped make possible the 1972 Nixon visit to China. Pakistan has collaborated with China in extensive military and economic projects, seeing both seeing each other as counterweight to Indian-Western alliance. Pakistan has also served as a conduit for China's influence in the Muslim world. China also has a consistent record of supporting Pakistan in regional issues. Pakistan's military depends heavily on Chinese armaments, and joint projects of both economic and militaristic importance are ongoing. China has supplied blueprints to support Pakistan's nuclear program. However these prints and designs were not decipherable due to their sophisticated scientific and mathematical language. Only Pakistani nuclear physicists qualified in the field and educated abroad were able to make sense of the designs and their requirements for the specific materials needed to build the bomb. Amin argues that the basis of the Sino-Pak entente from its beginning has been \\"a mutual need to pool together resources to contain perceived Indian aspirations to hegemony over South Asia\\". He continues: \\"Both China and Pakistan regard the entente as necessary to maintain a balance of power in the subcontinent favourable to themselves against an India that is believed by both Chinese and Pakistani strategists to be an expansionist power that occupies land regarded as properly belonging to Beijing and Islamabad respectively, and that is intent on expanding further\\". Though it is considered that India is largely a pacifist nation and does not intend to expand its international border. Relations prior to the founding of the modern states of Pakistan and the PRC Buddhist monks from the area of what is now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan were involved in the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism to Han dynasty China. The Han dynasty's Protectorate of the Western Regions bordered the Kushan Empire. Faxian travelled in what is now modern-day Pakistan. During World War II, the Hui Muslim imam Da Pusheng () toured the Middle East and South Asia to confront Japanese propagandists in Muslim countries and denounce their invasion to the Islamic world. Misinformation on the war was spread in the Islamic Middle Eastern nations by Japanese agents. In response, at the World Islamic Congress in Hejaz, Imam Du openly confronted fake Muslim Japanese agents and exposed them as non-Muslims. Japan's history of imperialism was explained by Du to his fellow Muslims. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the future founder of Pakistan, met with Imam Du. The Chinese Muslim's anti- Japanese war effort received a pledge of support from Jinnah. . is/jDCDc The Hindu leaders Tagore and Gandhi and Muslim Jinnah both discussed the war with the Chinese Muslim delegation under Ma Fuliang while in Turkey President ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º also met the delegation. Gandhi and Jinnah met with the Hui Ma Fuliang and his delegation as they denounced Japan. Diplomatic relations Pakistani Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai signing the Treaty of Friendship Between China and Pakistan in Beijing in 1956. Diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China were established on 21 May 1951, shortly after the Republic of China lost power in the Mainland in 1949.Pakistan and China Relations While initially ambivalent towards the idea of a Communist country on its borders, Pakistan hoped that China would serve as a counterweight to Indian influence. India had recognised China a year before, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru also hoped for closer relations with the Chinese. In 1956, Pakistani Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai signing the Treaty of Friendship Between China and Pakistan, marking closer bilateral ties. With escalating border tensions leading to the 1962 Sino-Indian war, China and Pakistan aligned with each other in a joint effort to counter India and the Soviet Union as both have border disputes with India. One year after China's border war with India, Pakistan ceded the Trans-Karakoram Tract to China to end border disputes and improve diplomatic relations. Since then, an informal alliance that initially began as mutual opposition towards India has grown into a lasting relationship that has benefited both nations on the diplomatic, economic and military frontiers. Along with diplomatic support, Pakistan served as a conduit for China to open up to the West. China has in turn provided extensive economic aid and political support to Pakistan. Disputed territory ceded to China in 1963. Henry Kissinger was on a secret mission to China facilitated by the Government of Pakistan, a fact known to very few people including Ambassador Hilaly. Since the two sides established their \\"all-weather diplomatic relations\\", there have been frequent exchanges between the two countries' leadership and peoples. For example, former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai received warm welcomes in all of his four visits to Pakistan. When Zhou died in 1976, then-Pakistani Ambassador to China rushed to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 8 in the morning without appointment. Upon arriving at the ministry, the ambassador cried due to his grief in front of Chinese diplomats. In 2004, a road in Pakistani capital Islamabad leading to the Diplomatic Enclave was named \\"Zhou Enlai Road\\". It is the first road in Pakistan that is named after foreign leaders. On 27 May 1976, then Chinese leader Mao Zedong, aged 83, received his last foreign guest Pakistani president Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto despite his critical illness, 105 days before his death. The presidential plane of PRC President Xi Jinping escorted by eight JF-17s upon entering Pakistani airspace on a two-day official visit (2015). On 22 May 2013, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's airplane was escorted by six JF-17 Thunder jets, jointly developed by the two countries, as it entered Pakistani airspace. The premier was also received by both Pakistani president and prime minister upon his arrival at the airport. On 20 April 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Pakistan as his first foreign visit of the year, also the first by a Chinese president in 9 years. Before his arrival, he published an article praising the friendship on Pakistani newspapers like Daily Jang. The Chinese president compared visiting Pakistan with visiting his brother's home. Like previous visit by Premier Li, the airplane was escorted by 8 JF-17 Thunder jets. Xi was given a grand welcome upon his arrival at Noor Khan airbase, a 21-gun salute and guard of honour was presented to him. Pakistan's military initially depended almost entirely on American armaments and aid, which was increased during the covert U.S. support of Islamic militants in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. The U.S. under President Richard Nixon supported Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.Shalom, Stephen R., The Men Behind Yahya in the Indo-Pak War of 1971 However, the period following the Soviet withdrawal and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led indirectly to the increasing realignment of the U.S. with the previously pro-Soviet India. The Pressler Amendment in 1990 suspended all American military assistance and any new economic aid amidst concerns that Pakistan was attempting to develop a nuclear weapon. Given the support that Pakistan had given them during the War in Afghanistan, many Pakistanis saw this as a betrayal that sold out Pakistani interests in favour of India. This belief was further strengthened as India had developed a nuclear weapon without significant American opposition, and Pakistan felt obligated to do the same. Consequently, the primarily geopolitical alliance between Pakistan and China has since 1990 branched out into military and economic cooperation, due to Pakistan's belief that the U.S. influence and support in the region should be counterbalanced by the Chinese. With the U.S.-led War in Afghanistan, there is a general sentiment in Pakistan to adopt a foreign policy which favours China over the United States.Global Security and Pakistan Foreign Policy Makers Urged to tie strongly with China compared to US Washington has been accused deserting Pakistan in favour of a policy that favours stronger relations with India, while Pakistan sees China as a more reliable ally over the long term. Since the September 11 attacks, Pakistan has increased the scope of Chinese influence and support by agreeing to a number of military projects, combined with extensive economic support and investment from the Chinese.  United Nations  In July 2019, Pakistan was one of 50 countries that backed China's policies in Xinjiang, signing a joint letter to the UNHRC commending China's \\"remarkable achievements in the field of human rights\\", claiming \\"Now safety and security has returned to Xinjiang and the fundamental human rights of people of all ethnic groups there are safeguarded. In November 2019, Pakistan was one of 54 countries that signed a joint statement supporting China's Xinjiang policies. In June 2020, Pakistan was one of 53 countries that backed the Hong Kong national security law at the United Nations. Military relations The JF-17 Thunder is a joint Pakistan- China project. There are strong military ties between China and Pakistan. This alliance between two neighbouring East-South Asian nations is significant geopolitically. The strong military ties primarily aim to counter regional Indian and American influence, and was also to repel Soviet influence in the area. In recent years this relationship has strengthened through ongoing military projects and agreements between Pakistan and China. Since 1962, China has been a steady source of military equipment to the Pakistani Army, helping establish ammunition factories, providing technological assistance and modernising existing facilities. Zulfiquar-class were designed and built jointly in China and Pakistan. Most recently, the Chinese Chengdu J-10B fighter was compared to its closest American counterpart, the Lockheed Martin F-16C Block 52/60, the most advanced F-16, for orders on either aircraft for the Pakistan Air Force, resulting in the wins of the Chinese Chengdu J-10B. Accordingly, the Chengdu J-10B had more advanced technology such as its radar and OLS targeting system, and its new generation stealthy features, such as its DSI intake gave it an edge over the Lockheed Martin F-16. China and Pakistan are involved in several projects to enhance military and weaponry systems, which include the joint development of the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft, K-8 Karakorum advance training aircraft, a tailor-made training aircraft for the Pakistan Air Force based on the Chinese domestic Hongdu L-15, space technology, AWACS systems, Al-Khalid tanks, which China granted license production and tailor-made modifications based on the initial Chinese Type 90 and/or MBT-2000. The Chinese has designed tailor-made advanced weapons for Pakistan, making it a strong military power in the South Asian region. The armies have a schedule for organising joint military exercises. China is the largest investor in Pakistan's Gwadar Deep Sea Port, which is strategically located at the mouth of the Strait of Hormuz. It is viewed warily by both the U.S. and India as a possible launchpad for the Chinese Navy, giving them the ability to launch submarines and warships in the Indian Ocean. China has recently pledged to invest nearly 43 billion US dollars. China's leadership appreciated Pakistan's fight against terrorism with a special mention of eliminating al-Qaeda, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), added the ISPR statement. In 2008, Pakistan had purchased military equipment from China for an improved quality of defence arsenal and force to fight the constant attack from foreign militants. This relationship still continues nine years later when Pakistan Army imported Chinese-built Low to Medium Altitude Air Defence System (LOMADS) LY-80 for its air defence system. In the past, China has played a major role in the development of Pakistan's nuclear infrastructure, especially when increasingly stringent export controls in Western countries made it difficult for Pakistan to acquire plutonium and uranium enriching equipment from elsewhere such as the Chinese help in building the Khushab reactor, which plays a key role in Pakistan's production of plutonium. A subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation contributed in Pakistan's efforts to expand its uranium enrichment capabilities by providing 5,000 custom made ring magnets, which are a key component of the bearings that facilitate the high-speed rotation of centrifuges. China has also provided technical and material support in the completion of the Chashma Nuclear Power Complex and plutonium reprocessing facility, which was built in the mid-1990s. On 26 January 2015, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during a conclusion of a two-day visit of Raheel Sharif to Beijing called Pakistan China's \\"irreplaceable, all-weather friend\\". Sharif also met Yu Zhengsheng, Meng Jianzhu and Xu Qiliang. On 19 April 2015, China concluded sale of eight conventional submarines worth $5bn, the biggest arms sale by China in its history. The vessels are supplied by the China Shipbuilding Trading Company, and financed to Pakistan at a low interest rate. =Counterterrorism= China, Pakistan and Afghanistan have coordinated to increase regional stability. Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that China intends to use Xinjiang as a base of economic development for the region, increasing security and facilitating trade. Economic relations Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative Pakistan has been one of China's major trade partners. Recently though, economic trade between Pakistan and China is increasing, and a free trade agreement has been signed. Military and technological transactions continue to dominate the economic relationship between the two nations, and China has pledged to increase their investment in Pakistan's economy and infrastructure. In 2011 China Kingho Group cancelled a $19 billion mining deal because of security concerns.\\"US finds new friend in Uzbekistan after Pakistan fallout.\\" Telegraph Media Group Limited, 30 September 2011. On 26 April, China Mobile announced $1 billion of investment in Pakistan in telecommunication infrastructure and training of its officials within a period of three years. The announcement came a day after China Mobile subsidy Zong emerged as the highest bidder in the 3G auction, claiming a 10 MHz 3G-band licence, qualifying for the 4G licence. On 22 April 2015, according to China Daily, China released its first overseas investment project under the Belt and Road Initiative for developing a hydropower station near Jhelum. The biggest development off late to open up the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has changed the situation completely as China has carved an enormous plan for economic growth and development in Pakistan as pointed out below in the next section. =China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor= Gwadar Port. The CPEC will connect Pakistan with China and the Central Asian countries with highway connecting Kashgar to Khunjerab and Gwadar. Gwadar Port in southern Pakistan will serve as the trade nerve centre for China, as most of its trade especially that of oil will be done through the port, which is operated by the China Overseas Port Holding Company, a state-owned Chinese company. Currently, sixty per cent of China's oil must be transported by ship from the Persian Gulf to the only commercial port in China, Shanghai, a distance of more than 16,000 kilometres. The journey takes two to three months, during which time the ships are vulnerable to pirates, bad weather, political rivals and other risks. Using Gwadar Port instead would reduce the distance and possibly the cost. The plan seeks to build on a market presence already established by Chinese enterprises, Haier in household appliances, ChinaMobile and Huawei in telecommunications and China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) in mining and minerals. In other cases, such as textiles and garments, cement and building materials, fertiliser and agricultural technologies (among others) it calls for building the infrastructure and a supporting policy environment to facilitate fresh entry. According to the plan, a key element in this is the creation of industrial parks, or special economic zones, would be done with the provision of water, perfect infrastructure, sufficient supply of energy and the capacity of self-service power. But the main thrust of the plan actually lies in agriculture, contrary to the image of CPEC as a massive industrial and transport undertaking, involving power plants and highways. The plan acquires its greatest specificity, and lays out the largest number of projects and plans for their facilitation, in agriculture. For agriculture, the plan outlines an engagement that runs from one end of the supply chain all the way to the other. From provision of seeds and other inputs, like fertiliser, credit and pesticides, Chinese enterprises will also operate their own farms, processing facilities for fruits and vegetables and grain. Logistics companies will operate a large storage and transportation system for agrarian produce, as stated by the plan in Dawn. The other common investment is expected in information and technology, a full system of monitoring and surveillance will be built in cities from Peshawar to Karachi, with 24-hour video recordings on roads and busy marketplaces for law and order. A national fibre-optic backbone will be built for the country not only for internet traffic, but also terrestrial distribution of broadcast TV, which will cooperate with Chinese media in the \\"dissemination of Chinese cultures\\". Views The support that China and Pakistan give each other is considered significant in global diplomacy, and has been compared to Israel‚ÄìUnited States relations. When confronted by US officials about Beijing's uncompromising support for Pakistan, Chinese General Xiong Guangkai famously said, \\"Pakistan is China's Israel.\\" Andrew Small, the author of The China-Pakistan Axis: Asia's New Geopolitics, characterizes this remark as \\"part explanation, part sarcastic jibe, delivered by (China's) military intelligence chief after one too many meetings with US counterparts on the subject.\\" According to a Pew survey of Pakistani public opinion in 2010, 84 per cent of respondents said they had a favourable view of China and 16 per cent had a favourable view of the United States. Similarly, the Chinese state-run media has portrayed Pakistan in a favourable light in regional issues. In 2013, this figure increased to 90% of Pakistanis having a favourable view of China. Pakistan and China have long praised the close ties the two countries have with each other. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf referred to China as Pakistan's \\"time- tested and all-weather friend\\", while in return Chinese president Hu Jintao has referred to Pakistan as \\"a good friend and partner\\". Some observers have noted these statements as occurring after Pakistani relations with the United States or India have become strained, such as after Osama Bin Laden was killed by American forces without Pakistan's prior permission. In July 2013 the Pew Research Center, as part of their Global Attitudes Project, declared Pakistan to have the most positive view of China in the world. According to the research, 81% of Pakistanis responded favourably to China. On the other hand, only 11% of Pakistanis had a favourable view of the United States, the lowest in the world. A common quotation referred to China-Pakistan Friendship is, \\"A Friendship Higher than the Heights of Himalayas and Deeper than the Depths of Arabian Sea\\". The author of The China-Pakistan Axis: Asia's New Geopolitics concludes the book by connecting the bilateral relationship to broader themes in Chinese foreign policy. According to the author, on the one hand, Pakistan is both a Chinese pawn (against India) and platform for power projection, but there are limits to this approach. For instance, as Small notes, \\"Beijing's counterterrorism strategy has been essentially parasitic on the United States being a more important target for transnational militant groups than China.

A fly or flye is a strength training exercise in which the hand and arm move through an arc while the elbow is kept at a constant angle. Flies are used to work the muscles of the upper body. Because these exercises use the arms as levers at their longest possible length, the amount of weight that can be moved is significantly less than equivalent press exercises for the same muscles (the military press and bench press for the shoulder and chest respectively). Due to this leverage, fly exercises of all types have a large potential to damage the shoulder joint and its associated ligaments and the tendons of the muscles connecting to it. They should be done with caution and their effects first tested while using very light weights; which are gradually incremented after more strength is gained. Equipment Flies can be performed using any weight that can be held in the hand. The simplest equipment to use is a dumbbell, though the exercise can also be performed using a cable machine. Flies can be performed supine, sitting or standing upright. When using a cable machine, the hands and arms move through the same anatomical plane as the dumbbell version. Using dumbbells for pectoral flies requires the use of stabilizer muscles associated with performing flies, when compared to performing flies with a cable machine. =Chest fly= Dumbbell chest fly The chest fly or pectoral fly (abbreviated to pec fly) primarily works the pectoralis major muscles to move the arms horizontally forward. If medially (internally) rotated, it is assisted in this by the anterior (front) head of the deltoideus in transverse flexion. If laterally (externally) rotated, the contribution of the deltoid is lessened and the pec major is strongly emphasized as the transverse adductor. The hands are usually brought out further than the elbows, in which case the flexors contract isometrically to inhibit undesired excess extension of the elbow. Muscles which do this are the biceps brachii, the brachialis and the brachioradialis. The biceps may also play a limited role in shoulder flexion. The straighter the elbow is, the more stretch in these muscles. For safety, many avoid locking out the joint. The movement is performed lying on the back on a bench, starting weights extended above the chest, meeting at the midsagittal plane. The arms are lowered through an arc passing through the transverse plane, terminating when the arm is roughly parallel to the floor, then returning to the starting position and repeating. This exercise can be done using other implements than dumbbells, such as kettlebells or weight plates. There are also machines such as the pec deck which perform a stabilized version of the movement while allowing people to sit upright. Butterfly-machine-2.pngButterfly machine fly (pec deck) start Butterfly-machine-1.pngButterfly machine fly (pec deck) end Dumbbell-flys-2.pngDumbbell fly start Dumbbell-flys-1.pngDumbbell fly end If using a cable machine, the body leans forward to counterbalance the weight moved, with the feet braced and the elbows are positioned slightly below shoulder height. The arms move the same arc as a bench fly, relative to the torso.

Recordsetter World Record holder Jason Faulkner (Incredible Faulk) is featured in a video Completing 47 lifts with 65 Lb. Dumbbells in 1 minute. This surpasses Eamonn Keane's Guinness Record by 1,200 Pounds for Most weight Incline fly lifted in 1 minute. =Inverted fly= The inverted fly (also known as a bent-over lateral raise, reverse fly or rear delt fly) works the posterior deltoid. This movement is the opposite of a chest fly. The exercise is performed with the torso parallel to the ground, facing down, with the hands in front of the face. Arms are moved through the transverse plane in an arc until parallel to the ground (or the limit of the range of motion of the shoulder is reached), then returned to the starting position and repeated. In terms of glenohumeral movement, the posterior deltoid does not work alone, and is assisted by other muscles. If the shoulder is neutrally rotated (elbows pointing outward then towards the scapulae as they lift) the posterior deltoid will be assisted in this transverse extension by the lateral rotators of the rotator cuff: the infraspinatus and teres minor. If the shoulder is externally rotated (elbows pointing towards the hips) then it will be assisted in this transverse abduction by the middle deltoid head. This fly, while it seems like an isolation movement, is actually a compound movement because it involves movement in a second joint: the scapulothoracic. The scapulae will retract (adduct) during this type of fly. The muscles that perform this function are the rhomboids and the trapezius. If the lifter drops their elbows closer to their hips (rather than bringing them outward) the latissimus dorsi will come into play and deemphasize the use of the aforementioned muscles that cross both joints, as the lats bypass the scapulae and attach directly to the lumbar fascia. A variation involves sitting upright and using a cable machine; the machine is next to the shoulder opposite the muscle being worked (in line with the coronal plane), and the hand moves through the transverse plane across the front of the body at approximately eye level. =Shoulder fly= Dumbbell shoulder fly The shoulder fly (also known as a lateral raise) works the deltoid muscle of the shoulder. The movement starts with the arms straight, and the hands holding weights at the sides or in front of the body. Body is in a slight forward-leaning position with hips and knees bent a little. Arms are kept straight or slightly bent, and raised through an arc of movement in the coronal plane that terminates when the hands are at approximately shoulder height. Weights are lowered to the starting position, completing one \\"rep\\". When using a cable machine the individual stands with the coronal plane in line with the pulley, which is at or near the ground. The exercise can be completed one shoulder at a time (with the other hand used to stabilize the body against the weight moved), or with both hands simultaneously if two parallel pulleys are available. This movement, when the shoulder is kept in neutral rotation, primarily targets the middle head of the deltoid. The anterior (front) and posterior (back) heads of the deltoid will also co-contract to aid in the abduction function. If the shoulder is laterally (externally, outwardly) rotated, the anterior deltoid becomes the prime mover of the glenohumeral joint, the posterior deltoid de-activates, and the middle head assists. By bending at the waist or leaning against a bench, the line of pull created allows the lateral deltoid to be isolated to a higher degree. The Complete Guide to Side Lateral Raises If repetitions are done explosively, it is possible for form to deteriorate and other muscles may come into play to do work instead of the deltoid, by generating upward and rotation momentum. The muscles which can be used to \\"cheat\\" in this movement are primarily the serratus anterior and the upper fibers of the trapezius, both of which elevate and upwardly rotate the scapulae. Dumbbell-lateral-raises-2.png Dumbbell- lateral-raises-1.png Common errors * External rotation of shoulder - If external rotation occurs during the lift, the rotatory cuff muscles are activated. If the weight is lifted while the shoulder is in the externally rotated position, the anterior deltoid does all the work. In both cases, utilisation of the lateral deltoid is decreased to a great extent thereby defeating the purpose of the exercise. * Shoulder extension - Shoulder extension occurs when the elbows travel behind the shoulders during the lift. This movement, too, decreases the utilisation of the lateral deltoids. * Throwing the weight up - Using the hips or spine to generate momentum also lessens the emphasis on the lateral deltoids. * Complete upright position - Keeping the body totally straight increases the chances of the anterior deltoid being used.

The special was a series of comedy vignettes wrapped around the horror film Universal's House of Frankenstein. Two weeks later, the show became a weekly series which aired at 1:00 a.m. on Saturday nights. 1975-1982: Doctor Madblood's Movie Each week Doctor Madblood's Movie presented a film from the Universal 77 Horror Hits package. Comedy vignettes were shown before and after the film and before and after each commercial break, featuring Doctor Madblood (a fictional retired mad scientist from Pungo, Virginia) and various other characters. Doctor Madblood was played by Jerry Harrell.HighBeam The series spawned a fan club and several fan conventions. 1982-1989: Doctor Madblood's Nightvision In 1982, following a seven-year run on WAVY-TV, the series moved to the Tidewater public television station WHRO-TV, where it was renamed Doctor Madblood's Nightvisions and syndicated to public television stations in Virginia. Following a two-season run, the show continued in weekly syndication on six cable outlets in New England throughout the 1980s. The Doctor also returned to Tidewater television screens with a prime-time Halloween special on WAVY-TV in 1984, Doctor Madblood's Halloween Howl, which wrapped around the 1960 Hammer Studios film The Brides of Dracula. For the first time, this special incorporated Doctor Madblood and other characters from the vignettes into the movie itself. Another Halloween special on WAVY-TV followed in 1986, with an all-night triple feature marathon. 1989-2002: Doctor Madblood's Movie In 1989, Doctor Madblood's Movie returned to weekly television in Tidewater on the local Fox affiliate WTVZ-TV. In this incarnation, Doctor Madblood was joined by series regulars Mike Arlo and Craig T. Adams, who had become the voice of Brain as well as many other characters, and newcomer Penny Palen, who portrayed the doctor's nurse Patience Dream. Also joining the regular cast was Carter Perry, who became one of Madblood's monsters, Ernie K. Carter's affiliation with the program began as an editor on \\"Nightvisions\\" and \\"Halloween Howl,\\" and as a director and producer during the WTVZ-TV years. The program continued on WTVZ until the spring of 2002. During that time, the show celebrated both its 20th and 25th anniversaries, re-uniting cast members from various versions of the series. 2002-2007:Doctor Madblood Presents In the fall of 2002, Doctor Madblood moved into a weekly prime-time slot on WSKY-TV, which broadcast in the Tidewater (now known as Hampton Roads) market on cable channel four. In this incarnation, known as Doctor Madblood Presents The Friday Night Frights, the show wrapped around episodes of television series, similar to Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Boris Karloff's Thriller. In 2004, the program moved to prime-time on Saturday nights, becoming simply Doctor Madblood Presents, and wrapping around Rod Serling‚Äôs Night Gallery. This version of the show included the celebration of Doctor Madblood's 30th year on television. Doctor Madblood Presents concluded its run on WSKY-TV in August 2007, bringing to a close the doctor's television career.

Conference & Incentive Travel Magazine ranked Jack Morton Worldwide as the number one agency based upon 2016 event-based turnover. In 2016, Event Magazine named them the top brand experience agency. Company history Jack Morton Worldwide, as it is known today, was named after its founder, Irvin Leonidas \\"Jack\\" Morton who was born in 1910 on a tobacco and cotton farm in Newport, North Carolina. Morton eventually earned his high school diploma at the age of 22 and moved to Washington D.C. and enrolled in The George Washington University while supported himself by working at Western Electric dispatching sound engineers to movie theaters. While attending George Washington, Morton joined a fraternity, became a member of the interfraternity council, and soon began booking bands for fraternity dances. The bands then asked Morton to represent them in other venues in Washington. Morton printed up business cards for Jack Morton Orchestras, using the fraternity house payphone and his Western Electric office for messages. After a short stint as a refrigerator salesman, Morton started booking bands to fraternities and sororities in Washington under the name of Jack Morton Enterprises (later changed to Jack Morton Productions). He later began booking orchestras in hotels, resorts, and night clubs in the Washington area. =1940s= After World War II the business expanded beyond the Washington area with the opening of additional offices in New York and Chicago. Large corporations were now looking to redesign their conventions to attract and entertain customers and employees, not just to do business. The new hotels now had banquet and meeting facilities with sound systems that were ideally suited to host the conventions that trade and professional associations. During this time the modern business convention was emerging and large corporations began to see conventions as a good place to do business. American businesses would expand the scope and scale of the events they organized for their customers and employees with world class entertainment from radio and Hollywood. Jack Morton Productions produced events and trade shows for corporations like Johnson & Johnson, General Motors and industry associations like American Trucking Association using entertainers such as Lawrence Welk, Bob Hope, George Burns, Jack Benny, and Red Skelton. =1950s= Starting in the 1950s, Jack Morton Productions expanded to produce entire conventions and promotional events in major cities around the United States. The American Trucking Association was his first big convention client and the trade group stuck with Morton for 35 years; =1960s= In the early 1960s, William I. \\"Bill\\" Morton, the son of Jack Morton, joined the company and helped to expand the company into the area of audio-visual productions and changed the name of the company to Jack Morton Productions (JMP). It was during this time when JMP became a full-service corporate communications agency, producing entertainment programs, training programs, audio-visuals, and video conferences for a variety of corporations and trade associations. =1970s= By 1977 Bill Morton had become Chairman and CEO, with offices opened in San Francisco (1972) and Atlanta (1976). During this time, the company grew to include capabilities including planning, exhibits and environments, themed attractions and multimedia. =1980s= Offices opened in Detroit (1987), Los Angeles (1987), Boston (1990) and Minneapolis (1990) and the company began to shift its focus from an entertainment production company to a full service creative agency. =1990s= In April 1998, the holding company, Interpublic Group, bought Jack Morton Company for a stock transaction that according to the Wall Street Journal was likely worth more than $50 million. =2000s= In 2000 Jack Morton acquired about 40 percent of rival Caribiner International, Inc. assets, paying $90 million for its events and communications division, which included the staging of sales meetings, events, and exhibits. Later in 2000, Jack Morton Company renamed itself as Jack Morton Worldwide rather than take on the Caribiner name. Bill Morton retired in 2003 after more than a quarter- century of leading the company his father founded. In recent years Jack Morton Worldwide has added capabilities in areas such as: print, television, digital, public events (Special Olympics, 2004 Summer Olympic Opening and Closing Ceremonies); exhibits; digital media; content marketing; broadcast design (The Colbert Report, ESPN Sports Center); and more focused markets like Latinos.

Molten metal is then removed by a blast of air. It employs a consumable carbon or graphite electrode to melt the material, which is then blown away by an air jet. This process is useful for cutting a variety of materials, but it is most often used for cutting and gouging aluminum, copper, iron, magnesium, and carbon and stainless steel. Because the metal is blown away by the air jet, it does not need to be oxidized. This process differs from plasma cutting operations because in air carbon cutting an open, unconstricted arc is used, and the arc operates separately from the air jet.WeldGuru.com, \\"Let the Weld Guru guide you through the world of CAC, Carbon Arc Cutting\\", 2008, http://www.weldguru.com/CAC.html (April 17, 2008) Air pressure for the jet usually varies from 60 to 100 psi (4-7 bar). The carbon electrode can be worn away by oxidation due to heat buildup. This can be reduced by coating the electrodes with copper. As the sharpened carbon electrode is drawn along the metal, an arc forms and melts the metal. The air jet is used to blow away molten material. This can be dangerous, as the molten material can be blown substantial distances.Serope Kalpakjian, Steven R.

A former prefect, Blanc also worked as head of the RATP (1989-1992), Air France (1993-1997) and Merrill Lynch France (2000-2002). Blanc was elected to the National Assembly from the UDF party in 2002. As member of the New Center party, Blanc was appointed to the newly created position of Secretary of State of the R√©gion Capitale (\\"Greater Paris\\"), a position he held between March 18, 2008 and July 4, 2010. He retired in 2012 from the National Assembly after two terms.  Early life and education  Christian Blanc is the son of Marcel Blanc, a member of the French Resistance and exotic fruits merchant. Blanc studied at the Montesquieu high school in Bordeaux before enrolling in SciencesPo Bordeaux. He became one of the main leaders of the National Union of Students of France, where he met future Prime Minister Michel Rocard. Active at the time in the University Antifascist Front for Peace in Algeria, Blanc is subsequently invited by Fidel Castro to the Latin American Solidarity Conference in Cuba in the summer of 1967. = Senior official = After graduation, Blanc joined a subsidiary of the Caisse des d√©p√¥ts, a French public sector financial institution, before becoming bureau chief at the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Closely associated with Michel Rocard, Blanc ran his 1980 Presidential Campaign. From 1981 to 1983, Blanc was the chief of staff for European Commissioner Edgar Pisani. He becomes prefect in the Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es region (1983-1984). Christian Blanc became secretary general of the Nouvelle-Cal√©donie region with Edgard Pisani, and was then appointed prefect of Seine-et-Marne (1983-1985). In 1988, Blanc returned to Nouvelle-Cal√©donie as head of the ‚ÄúMission of dialogue‚Äù mission of the French government, tasked with finding a political solution to the conflict that was shaking the island at the time. He negotiated the Matignon Agreements, adopted by referendum in November 1988. = Business executive = In 1989, Christian Blanc became the president of RATP. He resigned in 1992, following a spat with the government. During his presidency, RATP decided to create the first automated metro line ‚Äì Paris M√©tro Line 14. He was subsequently appointed CEO of Air France in 1993 and tasked with rescuing the company. Under Blanc's leadership, AirFrance became profitable again in 1997. In 1997, Blanc offered a new strategic plan to continue the restructuring of the company, only to clash with newly elected Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. The disagreement with the government over the need to privatize AirFrance led to Blanc's resignation in 1997. Between 1998 and 1999, Christian Blanc served as an advisor to the Lebanese carrier Middle East Airlines. Between 1999 and 2001, Blanc was the administrator of the Action Against Hunger. At the same time he ran two startups: Skygate, a developer of small-scale satellite receptors, and Karavel, an online travel agency. In 2000, Blanc was appointed president of Merrill Lynch France. He narrowly escaped the September 11 attacks because he had gone outside for a cigar when the planes struck the World Trade Center. In September 2014, Christian Blanc was designated CEO of Syphax Airlines, a position he held for just two months because the Tunisian company had failed to go through the necessary administrative procedures allowing it to hire a foreign employee. = Political career = Blanc began his political career as a member of future Prime Minister Michel Rocard's team in the 1970s, helping Rocard win election as mayor of Conflans-Sainte Honorine in 1977. During Fran√ßois Mitterand's presidency, he refused offers from both Rocard and later Edith Cresson to enter government and instead remained in his position with the RATP Group. Blanc stood for election in the 2002 legislative elections in the third electoral district of Paris, running under the banner of the √ânergies democrats (Democratic Energies) and winning 9.63% of the vote. He was elected to the National Assembly to represent the third district of Yvelines on 15 December 2002, replacing Anne-Marie Idrac, who had stood down to become president of the RATP. Winning in the first round, Blanc became a member of the UDF party group in the National Assembly. In 2003, Prime Minister Jean- Pierre Raffarin tasked Blanc with an economic development project. Six months later, Blanc submitted an official report, entitled For an Ecosystem of Growth, whose recommendations included creating business clusters. The French government began putting Blanc's recommendation into effect from 2004 onwards. In 2006, Blanc called on President Jacques Chirac to resign for the sake of ‚Äúaccelerating reforms‚Äù and to put an end to ‚Äúparalysis.‚Äù The same year, he launched the ‚ÄúCommittee for the Modernization of France‚Äù together with Alain Lambert and Jean-Marie Bockel that sought the ‚Äúcomprehensive and coherent‚Äù modernization of the French economy and French society. Blanc also took part in the P√©bereau Commission, which calculated France's national debt at ‚Ç¨2 trillion. Blanc was a supporter of the presidential candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential election and became member of the New Center party during the legislative elections, in which he was re-elected in the first round. Between 2002 and 2007, Blanc served as president of √ânergies democrats and the founder of √ânergies 2007, movements which supported reforming the French state and pursuing further European integration. As Vice- President of the New Center, he ran in the 2008 French local elections to become the mayor of Le Chesnay, a wealthy western suburb of Paris, but secured only 36.28% of the vote and failed to unseat the incumbent mayor in a three- way race. = State Secretary for Greater Paris (2008-2010) = On March 18, 2008, Blanc was appointed Secretary of State of the R√©gion Capitale (\\"Greater Paris\\"), a new position in the French Government of Fran√ßois Fillon. Blanc was responsible for crafting the legal framework for the ‚ÄúGreater Paris‚Äù project, which entered into law in May 2010 and provided for a network of automated metro lines surrounding Paris. After the French Parliament's enactment of the Greater Paris law, Blanc announced his resignation from the government on July 4, 2010. In June 2010, after Blanc dismissed his chief of staff, allegations regarding his tax situation appeared over the next eight days in France's Canard Encha√Æn√© newspaper. One week later, the same newspaper claimed that Blanc allegedly used his secretarial budget to purchase cigars worth ‚Ç¨12,000 over the course of ten months, a claim which was widely reprinted by French media. In an interview with the Figaro, Blanc accused his former chief of staff Guillaume Jublot, who had been recently fired by Blanc, of feeding false information to the Canard Encha√Æn√©. After discussions with then-Prime MInister Fran√ßois Fillon, the two men released a statement in which they jointly declared it \\"suitable that Mr. Blanc honors his personal expenses in full.\\" The matter helped accelerate Blanc's decision to leave government, with the opposition and elements of press speculating that his exit might be a tactic by the ruling UMP to turn media attention away from President Nicolas Sarkozy's role in the Woerth-Bettencourt scandal. The UMP denied any such links. Blanc retook his seat in the National Assembly after leaving the government in August 2010 and declined to stand in the 2012 legislative elections. On December 2, 2011, the High Court of Paris found Christian Blanc to have acted in good faith in relation to the cigar affair and dismissed those charges against him. Whereas the initial claims had been widely covered by the press over the course of several weeks, this acquittal was met with radio silence. In 2015, Odile Jacob published Blanc's book Paris, ville-monde (Paris, World City), in which Blanc lays out a strategy for France to reclaim a leading role in the global economy.

It links the Adam Clark Square and the Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge at river level to Buda Castle above. The line was opened on March 2, 1870, and has been in municipal ownership since 1920. It was destroyed in the Second World War and reopened on June 4, 1986. A feature of the line are the two pedestrian foot bridges which cross above it. These were present when the line opened, were removed in 1900 when the castle's garden was extended, and rebuilt to the original design in 1983. History The building of the line started in the July 1868, the first test run was on 23 October 1869. The Sikl√≥ has operated for the public since 2 March 1870. This funicular rail was the second in Europe, only Lyon had a similar transportation system at that time. During the Second World War the cars and the terminals were destroyed by bombs. The remnants of the funicular were then dismantled. Replacement with escalators was considered later. Reconstruction of the funicular was decided in 1965, and several plans were made, but the construction works were delayed. A midibus service between the two termini (line \\"V\\") was launched in 1975. This was in operation until the line was finally reopened in 1986.

It was among the most popular radio shows broadcast in the United States. In 2016, the show ranked number 20 on the Talkers Magazine 2016 Heavy Hundred list of the most important talk show hosts in America; Ingraham was the highest-ranking female host listed. The show primarily focused on politics, pop culture, and media bias; topics of interest included race relations, trends in education, the Middle East, and the legacy of feminism. The show aired from 2001 to 2018. Background Ingraham's show, one of several to launch in 2001 as the conservative talk radio genre expanded in popularity, originally aired on the now defunct Westwood One Network. Ingraham joined the Talk Radio Network in 2004. In June 2008, Ingraham temporarily left the air due to a contract dispute. A number of hosts filled in for her, primarily Tammy Bruce and Monica Crowley. Ingraham returned at the end of the month. Ingraham left TRN in November 2012 after her contract expired. The show returned on January 3, 2013, after Ingraham took ownership of the property, with plans to include more discussions about pop culture. On November 14, 2018, Ingraham announced that the program would not return from its annual December hiatus, as she intended to spend more time with her family and focus on her television show The Ingraham Angle. She continued to produce material for Courtside's PodcastOne.\\"Laura Ingraham To End Syndicated Show; Move To PodcastOne\\" from Radio Insight (November 14, 2018)  Major issues featured  = Illegal immigration = Ingraham frequently advocated \\"securing the borders\\" by putting more resources into stopping illegal immigration. Ingraham had a segment called \\"The Illegal Immigration Sob Story\\" alert in which she highlighted media articles that, in her view, sought to garner sympathy for illegal immigrants. = Radical Islam = The show frequently raised the topic of radical Islam. Ingraham discussed current events and media reports about the War on Terror and what she believes to be a growing faction of Islam: Jihadists. = Bioethics = Ingraham often discussed bioethical issues, opposing abortion on demand, human cloning and embryonic stem-cell research. She was an outspoken opponent of Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 (2006), a ballot measure legalized human cloning; Ingraham argued that the initiative was deceptive. Every January 22, Ingraham promoted the anti-abortion March for Life. = Raunch culture = Ingraham discussed sex and pornography on her show. She criticized people such as Howard Stern, Hugh Hefner, and others who she claimed have pervaded American culture with what she describes as \\"filth\\" at the expense of \\"traditional American values\\".

The crops in the greenhouse are irrigated by captured rainwater and desalinated river water. Food is grown without carbon emissions, no agricultural waste is discharged into the watershed and no pesticides are used. The Science Barge is also a public education tool and hosts school groups from Westchester, New York City and the greater New York area visiting during the week, and the general public on weekends. From 2006-2008, the Science Barge docked for periods of two months at each of six stops along the Manhattan waterfront with the goal of educating the public on urban sustainable agriculture. In 2015, Nathalie Manzano-Smith and Ted Caplow won the Knight Cities Challenge grant competition from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation with a proposal to build a Miami Science Barge and moor it in Museum Park in downtown Miami, FL. The Miami Science Barge opened on Earth Day, April 22, 2016. The following April, the Barge was gifted to Frost Science Museum. Compared with the original Science Barge, the Miami Science Barge places more emphasis on marine science, conservation, and sustainable aquaculture, while also updating many of the urban agricultural systems featured on the original. Early history in Manhattan The Science Barge was conceived and designed by Ted Caplow and built by New York Sun Works, a non- profit organization that developed the project in order to educate students and teachers about the science of sustainability through hydroponic farming. The exhibits and ecological experiments that comprise the Science Barge float on a steel deck barge, approximately 115 feet long, constructed in the 1940s and used for cargo and utility work in New York Harbor until leased by New York Sun Works from Hughes Marine in 2006. The Science Barge urban farm systems were built on the barge in Red Hook, Brooklyn in the summer of 2006, and deployed briefly to pier 92 before opening to the public at pier 84 on May 4, 2007, adjacent to the Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises; and the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum. Over the next two years, the barge also made several visits to pier I in Riverside Park South as well as the Chelsea Piers complex in lower Manhattan. Move to Yonkers Yonkers After touring for two years, New York Sun Works sought a permanent home for the Barge and decided to sell the Science Barge to Groundwork Hudson Valley in Yonkers, NY in October 2008 for $2.00.http://www.groundworkhv.org/programs/science-barge/faqs/ Groundwork Hudson Valley is a non-profit organization focused on environmental justice in distressed communities in the lower Hudson Valley. In November 2008, the Science Barge docked in Yonkers, at the mouth of the Saw Mill River. The site has helped attract visitors to the downtown Yonkers area especially due to its accessibility by mass transit. The placement by the Saw Mill River, a major Hudson River tributary, has called attention to the current restoration work and continued the revitalization of downtown Yonkers. Groundwork Hudson Valley uses the Science Barge to provide a research, training, and development platform for its Yonkers-based food programs including the Get Fresh Yonkers Food Co-op, Farmers Market, and Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA). Technical details The greenhouse on the barge is approximately 1200 ft2, purchased new from Nexus, Inc and constructed in place on the barge. The structure is aluminum and secured to the barge deck via bolts and custom-made welded steel brackets. The walls of the greenhouse are glass and the roof is a rigid, doubled walled polycarbonate plastic. Ventilation is achieved via four mechanical fans, a padwall evaporative cooling system, and a large, automatically controlled atrium roof vent to maximize passive ventilation. Rainwater is harvested from the greenhouse roof and stored in tanks with a 1200-gallon aggregate capacity before being used to irrigate hydroponic crops in a broad and constantly evolving variety of different growing systems and media. The barge has also hosted a number of aquaponic and marine science experiments, including cultivation of tilapia, catfish, crayfish, clams, and oysters, among others.http://nysunworks.org/file_download/3/science-barge- brochure.pdf The energy systems on the barge, in their original configuration, included 2.5 KW of solar capacity mounted on passive trackers, 2 kW of micro wind turbines, a 4 kW biodiesel backup generator, a large lead-acid battery bank providing 1000 amp-hours at 48 volts, and associated support hardware. The barge also deployed a semi-custom reverse osmosis system to desalinate water from the Hudson River for backup use.http://nysunworks.org/file_download/4/technical-description Response The public launch of the Science Barge on May 4, 2007 was attended by dignitary speakers including New York City Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe, New York State Senator Thomas Duane, noted ecological design pioneer John Todd, who in his public remarks called the Science Barge \\"a crucible for visualizing the city of the future\\" and United Nations senior adviser Jeffrey Sachs who said that ‚ÄúThe Science Barge is not only an invitation to ideas and learning, but to change.‚Äùhttp://nysunworks.org/thesciencebarge/what-they- saidhttp://news.cnet.com/New-York-barges-into-sustainable-urban- farming/2100-11395_3-6181583.html In March 2009, the Science Barge was named \\"Best Class Trip\\" by New York magazine in its annual \\"Best Of...\\" issue.https://nymag.com/bestofny/kids/2009/class-trip/ In July 2009, GOOD created a short video of the purpose and methods of the Barge.GOOD Magazine short video summarizing the Science Barge In the same month, former CBS News Anchor Dan Rather hosted an episode of \\"Dan Rather Reports\\" on the Barge.

Citylink services were clearly distinguished in station announcements and timetables. Citylink also had a separate logo (right) and had a section of the Central Trains website. The brand was very similar to Regional Railways' Alphaline brand, both in the type of services (expresses, but not \\"InterCity\\") and in the level of on-board service. The \\"Citylink\\" brand was axed during 2007, in preparation for the ending of the Central Trains franchise in November 2007. Commencement of services Central Trains long-distance services were re- branded as \\"Central Citylink\\" services in 2003. This was part of the re- franchising agreement that extended the Central franchise from 2003 to 2006. The plan was to operate fast and frequent express services operated by air- conditioned, modern trains, as opposed to the local commuter trains in the Birmingham area- these would remain just as \\"Central Trains\\" services. To give the service more of an \\"Intercity\\" feel, it was decided that seats would be reservable in advance, and most services would offer at-seat catering.National Express Group BBC NewsA guide to Central Citylink Central created a logo, unique adverts and a section of the Central Trains website for the brand. Announcements started distinguishing Citylink services soon after. Central Trains' Guide 1 timetable was designated for all Citylink services, and highlight the special features of the brand.Central Trains' timetables Routes A map of the 4 Citylink routes The four Central Citylink routes were: #Birmingham‚ÄìLiverpool #Liverpool‚ÄìNorwich #Birmingham‚ÄìStansted Airport #Nottingham‚ÄìCardiff There was also one evening peak service from Birmingham to Preston, but with no equivalent Southbound service. Reliability Due to the length of many of the routes (Liverpool to Norwich = 5 hours), services were prone to delays later on in the day, when delays had built up. This was not helped by the fact that Central Citylink operated on certain east‚Äìwest cross- country lines, which are slow and poorly maintained when compared to the higher-speed north‚Äìsouth lines from London. They also competed with other rail companies on some routes, restricting flexibility of the timetable. They played second fiddle to the InterCity operators ‚Äì if a Virgin Trains's service (for example) was to be running late, it would get priority over a Citylink Train . This normally meant sitting idle on a stretch of track, waiting for that Virgin Train to go past. Many Citylink trains started off on time, but ended up delayed, purely as a result of giving way to an InterCity train. Fleet Citylink did not have a dedicated fleet of its own, but most services were operated using Class 170 and Class 158 diesel multiple units from the Central Trains fleet. Services between Birmingham and Liverpool usually used Class 350 Desiro electric multiple units.

He sat in the four seat of the Great Britain Eight, which made the final of the World Rowing Championships in Seville. He occupied the same seat a year later when the Eight won the World Cup event at Lucerne, and a bronze medal at the championships in Milan. 2004 was the year that Hodge entered the British rowing scene. The buildup to the Olympics for the GB Men's Rowing Squad was somewhat disrupted due to illness, injury and variable form. Hodge and his partner Alex Partridge then won the final selection trials. Partridge was promoted to Britain's top boat until sidelined by injury, Hodge remained in the eight. Illness to the Eight's stroke ‚Äì Tom James ‚Äì the night before their Heat in the Olympic competition was a particular blow, and whilst James returned for the repechage, the crew failed to make the final, finishing 9th overall. Having stroked Oxford to victory in the 2005 Boat Race, Hodge returned to international competition. Following the retirement of Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell and Ed Coode, a new coxless four was formed with Andrew, his Oxford crewmate Pete Reed, Alex Partridge and Olympic Champion Steve Williams. Hodge went on to win gold with this crew (Tom James was promoted in place of Alex Partridge) in Beijing to defend Great Britain's title in the event. Post-Olympics Hodge and Reed decided to attempt a pair project with a view to competing at London 2012 in that event. Unfortunately due to the emergence of the New Zealand pair of Eric Murray and Hamish Bond (future world best time holders and Olympic champions) the likelihood of a gold medal in the event was unlikely and so the pair were moved back into the coxless four in 2012 to strengthen that boat's chances. The crew of Hodge, Reed, Tom James and Alex Gregory went on to win the gold medal at the Olympic rowing regatta and beat their Australian rivals who had pushed them hard through the season. Hodge was world champion in the men's eight and four during 2013 and 2014 respectively. After being diagnosed with glandular fever during 2015, Hodge was forced to miss the entire racing season. He began his comeback in the autumn of 2015 and was selected to represent Great Britain at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the men's eight. After an inconsistent season, the British eight won Olympic gold on the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas in Rio over Germany and the Netherlands. He announced his retirement after the Olympics. Gold postbox for Andrew Triggs Hodge in Hebden =Other= Hodge has been a member of Molesey Boat Club since 2000 when he moved to London. Just hours after winning the 2005 World Cup event at Dorney Lake, Eton, Hodge made a guest appearance in St Catherine's College 1st VIII, who were competing in Summer Eights. He was joined in that crew by fellow international competitors Christopher Liwski and Colin Smith. The crew bumped Hertford College that day. Hodge was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to rowing.

It can be used as a simple component framework (to, for example, create dynamic grids on otherwise static pages), but also as a full framework for building single-page applications. Originally built as an add-on library extension of YUI by Jack Slocum on April 15, 2007, beginning with version 1.1, Ext JS retains no dependencies on external libraries, instead making their use optional.Ext JS as of version 2.0 works with different base libraries or adapters. (e.g. YUI, jQuery, Prototype), or it can work stand-alone. The capability to work with multiple base libraries was removed in the 4.0 release. Nowadays Ext JS can be used both as a single script (with all classes and components in one file) or by building the application with Sencha Cmd. Features =GUI controls (components)= Ext JS includes a set of GUI-based form controls (or \\"widgets\\") for use within web applications: * text field and textarea input controls * date fields with a pop-up date-picker * numeric fields * list box and combo boxes * radio and checkbox controls * html editor control * grid control (with both read-only and edit modes, sortable data, lockable and draggable columns, and a variety of other features) * tree control * tab panels * toolbars * desktop application-style menus * region panels to allow a form to be divided into multiple sub-sections * sliders * vector graphics charts = Themes and toolkits = Sencha also provides some themes to style the components. Changing a theme requires simply changing CSS and a script of the theme. When using Sencha CMD a re-build of the application might be required. All components should work with each theme, but their look&feel; will change. For example Classic theme has rather small elements not suited for touch devices. Neptune Touch has bigger elements better suited for tablets and phones. Ext JS comes in two flavours called modern and classic toolkit. They differ not only with available themes but there are also some API differences between them. So it is not as easy to migrate from one toolkit to the other as it is for themes. There are plans to even out some differences between the toolkits in Ext JS 7.1, which is planned for 2019. = Programming toolkit = Ext JS is a composition of classes that has many capabilities. Some examples: * an abstract layer for browsers (e.g. \`Ext.isArray\` that can be used as a replacement for \`Array.isArray\`) * state management (stores) * server communication layer (proxies and \`Ext.Ajax.request\`) * layout and window management * event management (with simplified creation of custom events for custom components) * routing = Class system = Ext JS has its own class system. Classes are defined with \`Ext.define\` and then an instance can be created with \`Ext.create\`. Some classes (e.g. components and stores) can have aliases and can be created by an alias. Instances of components are created automatically when the parent component is created. Class can extend both custom and built-in classes. Typically custom components would extend built in components (e.g. \`MyApp.views.ProductsTable\` would extend built-in \`Ext.grid.Panel\`). There is a built-in dynamic loader so classes can have dynamic dependencies (loaded on-demand). There are two types of dependencies in ExtJS. Dependencies declared with \`requires\` property are loaded before the instance of the class is created. Dependencies defined in \`uses\` property might be loaded after the instance of the class is created. It is also possible to override classes. Even built-in classes. Overriding built-in classes might be useful to e.g. provide internationalization or create patches. Overridden class gets merged with new declaration. Each class can be overridden as many times as required (e.g. providing i18n and then l10n).  Ext JS version history  =Ext JS 2.0= Ext JS version 2.0 was released on 4 December 2007. This version was promoted as providing an interface and features more similar to those traditionally associated with desktop applications. Also promoted were the new user documentation, API documentation, and samples. Ext JS 2.0 did not provide a backward compatibility with version 1.1. A migration guide was developed to address this. =Ext JS 3.0= Ext JS version 3.0 was released on 6 July 2009. This version added communication support for REST and a new Ext.Direct server side platform. New flash charting and ListView elements were added to the standard display components. It was backwards compatible with version 2.0 code. =Ext JS 4.0= Version 4.0 of the Ext framework was released on April 26, 2011. It includes a completely revised class structure, a revised data package, an animation and drawing package that uses SVG and VML, and revised charting and theming. It also includes an optional architecture that provides a model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller (MVC) style of code organization. =Ext JS 5.0= Version 5.0 of the Ext JS framework was released on June 2, 2014. It includes the ability to build desktop apps on touch-enabled devices‚Äîusing a single code base, a Model View ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, two-way data binding, responsive layouts, and other component upgrades with support for adding widgets inside a grid cell for data visualization and big data analytics. Ext JS 5 also includes an upgraded touch-optimized charting package along with additional financial charting capabilities. Ext JS 5 supports modern and legacy browsers including: Safari 6+, Firefox, IE8+, Chrome, and Opera 12+. On the mobile platform, Ext JS 5 supports Safari on iOS 6 and 7, Chrome on Android 4.1+, and Windows 8 touch-screen devices (such as Surface and touch- screen laptops) running IE10+. Important: From the Ext JS 5 version you cannot buy license for fewer than 5 developers. =Ext JS 6.0= Version 6.0 of the Ext JS framework was released on July 1, 2015. It merges the Sencha Touch (mobile) framework into Ext JS. =Ext JS 7.0= Version 7.0 of Ext JS framework was released on August 29, 2019. Ext JS 7.0 was a minor release. Several components were added to the Modern Toolkit. The Classic Toolkit received the Material Design Theme. Sencha On 15-Jun-2010, the merge of Ext JS with JQTouch and Rapha√´l was announced forming a new organisation called Sencha Inc. Ext JS continues to be available as a main product on the new Sencha website together with Sencha Touch, Sencha GWT (now Sencha GXT), Sencha Architect, Sencha Animator and Ext core. On 23-Aug-2017, Sencha was acquired by IDERA (which in turn owns Embarcadero Technologies). Embarcadero is known for acquisitions of rapid application development software such as Delphi (which relies on Object Pascal as its primary programming language). {{cite web url=https://www.sencha.com/company/press/idera-inc-acquires- sencha-to-strengthen-developer-tools-business/ title=IDERA, Inc.

Ext.NET  Ext.NET is an ASP.NET component framework integrating the Ext library, current version (as of September 2017) is 4.4 which integrates ExtJS version 6.5.1. License history YUI-Ext was available under the BSD license. In April 2008 the open source license associated with Ext was changed. In version 2.0.2, the authors stated that Ext was available under an LGPL-style license as long as you \\"plan to use Ext in a personal, educational or non-profit manner\\" or \\"in an open source project that precludes using non-open source software\\" or \\"are using Ext in a commercial application that is not a software development library or toolkit\\". This was no longer the case with Ext 2.1. The Ext authors claim that section 7 of the LGPL as it is worded did not apply to \\"conditions\\" which their license required before distribution under the LGPL was permitted as opposed to \\"additional restrictions\\" which section 7 allowed a distributor to remove. On 20 April 2008, Ext 2.1 was released under a new dual license structure which allowed the options of the full GPL 3.0 license or a proprietary license. The change in license over time, from a permissive open source license to a restrictive dual license, caused controversy in the Ext user community. Sencha has published details about its commercial and GPL license terms on its website. In November 2018 Sencha announced its Community Edition that is free but restricted by annual revenue of either a person or company using ExtJS.

It has been used in countries such as Turkey and India to curb illegal opium production. The main mechanism used under opium licensing is a shift from cultivation and/or production for the illegal market towards legal uses such as the production of essential medicines such as morphine and codeine. Proposal for Afghanistan Currently, an international think tank called The International Council on Security and Development (ICOS), formerly known as The Senlis Council, is investigating whether this policy option could be used to solve the massive drug problem in Afghanistan.Security and Development Policy Group - The Senlis Council The organization is calling for a new village-based poppy for medicines system that would be able to boost rural development, create stability and increase the grip the Karzai Administration has on isolated poppy growing areas in the country. Equally, cheap Afghan-made could respond to the acute shortage of poppy-based medicines internationally. In June 2007, the Council released a technical blueprint for a poppy for medicine project in Afghanistan and called for a pilot project to create Afghan Morphine to be put in place at the next planting season (see The Senlis Council: \\"Poppy for Medicine\\" ) =Counterarguments= The Bush Administration objected to ICOS's recommendations. In February 2007, the U.S. Department of State, through the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, issued a response to the ICOS's proposal. They argued that the price difference between licit and illicit poppies would discourage farmers from participating, a problem that could be overcome only by massive subsidies. The United Nations International Narcotics Control Board finds little to no unmet demand for licit Afghan poppies in international markets. While Turkey, India, Pakistan, and Bolivia have adopted similar plans, decades of conflict have left most of Afghanistan country radically underdeveloped, both economically and institutionally. Large portions of the country remain largely under the control of Taliban insurgents, and these conditions pose serious difficulties for a successful licensing program.

(The two companies had previously cooperated in a similar project called Mission in Snowdriftland.) The game launched on April 3, 2007 and was only playable through the month of April. After the extra Toxic disabled play on April 30, 2007, a new version of the game, presenting new features and 3D visuals, was released on Q4 2010 for the Wii as a downloadable game for the WiiWare service. Gameplay Chick Chick Boom is a single-player artillery game. The player commands a team of yellow-colored chicks and must use weaponry and defensive items to defeat the opposing team of black-colored chicks, led by a black Easter Bunny nicknamed the \\"Poster Bunny\\". To activate a weapon or defense item, the player needs to trace an image with a certain degree of accuracy for it to register and activate. Like Mission in Snowdriftland, Chick Chick Boom was scored by Fabian Del Priore. The tutorial screen displaying what must be traced for each command. The chicks will bounce throughout their field aimlessly until given commands to maneuver or send attacks. The player selects a command and is then prompted to trace a simple outline in order to activate the command. Afterwards, the command cannot be used again until the icon representing it \\"refills.\\" Some commands refill faster than others. Each drawing is given an accuracy rating, and a drawing must have an accuracy rating of at least 70% to register at all. The higher the accuracy percentage, the more effective the command. Upon finishing the ten introductory levels, Pro Mode is activated, which is essentially an \\"endless play\\" mode where the Poster Bunny's chicks are revived immediately. A wallpaper is rewarded to the player for the completion of each introductory level. They appear in the Download center on the main menu and can be accessed at any time later. The wallpapers include Mario Hoops 3-on-3, Kororinpa, Pok√©mon Ranger, Wii Menu, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Justice for All, WarioWare: Smooth Moves, Hotel Dusk: Room 215, Wii Sports, Harvest Moon DS, and Diddy Kong Racing DS. =Offensive commands= * Weight - A shadow appears on the opponent's field where the weight will drop, and after a short delay, a large object will fall from the sky, crushing any chicks below. The more accurate the drawing, the larger and more damaging the object. Some items include television sets, elephants, safes and sofas with Chubby Snow from Mission in Snowdriftland sitting on them. If two or more chicks are crushed by the same weight, the player can launch two weights simultaneously on the next turn. If a player defeats multiple chicks with the same weight, one of the player's chicks will receive a hard hat, increasing their defense against future attacks. * Bomb - A bomb is tossed into the opponent's field with a timer on the front of it. Upon reaching zero, the bomb will explode. The size of the explosion and the speed of the countdown correspond with the accuracy of the drawing, and a perfect drawing's explosion can almost fill the entire field. If all five of the opponent's chicks are hit with a single blast, one of the player's chicks will become a bomb defuser, allowing the chick to defuse any of the opponent's bombs by touching them. Water from rain and sprinklers will also automatically defuse any bombs. * Lightning - Thunder clouds constantly drift over both fields. When one is present, the Lightning command becomes available. Lightning will brew within the cloud, and a short time later, it will strike every chick on the side of the battlefield it is floating over. The accuracy of the drawing can make increase the lightning's strength so much that it can defeat the entire team in a single strike. * Toadstool - Poisonous mushrooms will appear on the opponent's field. If a chick touches them, they become green in color, their speed is dramatically lowered, and they lose small amounts of life constantly. The poison effect can wear off over time. The power of the mushrooms and quantity of them that grow corresponds with the drawing's accuracy. * Balloon - A hot-air balloon appears on the opponent's field, and if a chick jumps into it, they will slowly drift into the sky. Once floating off the screen, the chick is automatically defeated. The size of the balloon corresponds with the accuracy of the drawing, and the bigger the balloon, the faster it will rise. Bomb explosions and lightning strikes can hit the chicks floating in the balloons and free them from their hold, and if caught under rain, the balloon will slowly descend. =Defensive commands= * Move - All of the player's chicks will move to the left or right side of their field. This command is vital in avoiding weights, bombs, and keeping out of balloons until they naturally float away on their own. The accuracy of the drawing will keep the chicks in that area of the field longer. Some chicks may also ignore the command if the accuracy is low. * Lightning Rod - By activating this, an opponent's lightning strikes will redirect to the lightning rod, leaving the chicks unharmed. The accuracy of the drawing creates a larger lightning rod, and if the lightning rod is small, it may not be able to redirect all of the lightning's power, leaving some chicks open for damage regardless. * Medicine - This command will heal any chicks under the effect of poisonous mushrooms. However, if the accuracy is too low, it may not fully heal them. Furthermore, the sun will occasionally shine on the player's field, usually following rainstorms. If the medicine command is activated in that brief moment, all of the player's chicks receive heavy life recovery. * Sandbags - When a chick is trapped in a balloon, this command will place a sandbag on the balloon in an attempt to bring it back down to the ground. The size and weight of the sandbag depends on the accuracy of the drawing, and three sandbags total can be placed on a balloon. (Any sandbags drawn after the third are ignored.) A high accuracy balloon can be almost impossible to recover without three high accuracy sandbags to match it. =Other commands= Along with these commands, the player is offered the use of water sprinklers. Occasionally, it will protrude from the player's field. By clicking on it with the cursor, water will cover the field, defusing any opponent's bombs. Furthermore, while the sprinkler is active, earthworms will crawl around the field. If a chick touches a worm, life is automatically recovered. Worms will also appear when a raincloud appears over either team's field. WiiWare Chick Chick Boom made a transition to WiiWare with new features and full 3D graphics. Based on information on the official website, the game has been released in the PAL region on October 29, 2010, in Japan on December 21, 2010 and on December 27, 2010 in North America.

His body was buried at the local cemetery, and when the war between England and France was concluded, his body was exhumed and conveyed back to his home country in 1548. This event occurred shortly after a French attempt to capture the Isle of Wight, an invasion which was concluded by the English victory at the Battle of Bonchurch.

A French version, \\"Dr√¥le de fille\\" was recorded by Sylvie Vartan on the album 2'35 de bonheur in 1967. The song Like Born a Woman, which was also written by Martha Sharpe, Single Girl contained some sentiments that were ostensibly skeptical of men (for example, \\"I know all about men and their lies\\"). But whereas Born a Woman was seen by some as having feminist overtones, Single Girl was essentially more traditional in outlook ‚Äì a young, isolated woman anticipating that \\"some day\\", despite not knowing anybody, people being \\"phoney\\" and the nights getting \\"so lonely\\", she would find waiting for her a man to \\"lean on\\". As one later commentator put it, drawing a contrast with Julie Rogers' The Wedding (1964), \\"Single Girl ... touched a nerve with every 'wallflower' who possessed a record player\\".Sleeve notes for It's My Party: Hit Girls of the Sixties (Pickwick CD, 1989) The score of Single Girl was notable for its gradual crescendo towards the end and a piano backing that, between the closing lines, :Someday I‚Äôll have a sweet loving man to lean on :The single girl needs a sweet loving man to lean on, contained two distinctive high notes that were apt to linger in the mind of the listener. Billboard described Single Girl as \\"a strong piece of ballad material with driving rhythm background\\".Quoted in sleeve notes for A Single Girl CD, 2002 The production overall conveyed very well the sense that \\"to make it in pop music in the 1960s, a girl needed a really strong song and a strong production, as well as a lot of tenacity and dogged determination\\".Sleeve notes for It's My Party: Hit Girls of the Sixties (Pickwick CD, 1989) Notes Category:1966 singles Category:Song recordings produced by Chips Moman Category:Sandy Posey songs Category:1966 songs ","title":"Single Girl"},{"id":"10481272","text":"The Krivaja is a river in central-northern parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a right tributary of the Bosna River. Its source is confluence of the Stupƒçanica and the Bio≈°tica rivers at the western outskirts of town of Olovo. From there the Krivaja flows through the scenic gorge between mountains of Zvijezda and Konjuh (mountain), with lot of small mountain streams and small rivers inflow from both sides. Finally, the Krivaja meets the Bosna River at the vicinity of town of Zavidoviƒái. The river is well known for rafting, canoeing and freshwater fishing. The Krivaja basin is known for an abundant ichthyo-fauna, rich in species, some of which are critically endangered, such as hucho (also known as Danube Salmon or Danube Taimen) (Lat. Hucho hucho). All the Krivaja tributaries and especially its headwaters are important spawning grounds for both Danube Taimen and its prey, Common nase (Chondrostoma nasus) and Grayling (Thymallus thymallus). The Kaljina, its parent the Bio≈°tica, and the Stupƒçanica are main source of the Krivaja waters, and all three are unspoiled in sense of water quality, their hydromorphology, natural surrounding and river biodiversity.

He studied at the University of Canterbury, completing a doctorate on the manipulation of environmental sound sources in electroacoustic music. In 1989, with the assistance of the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council of New Zealand (now the Creative New Zealand), he travelled to the UK to further his studies of electroacoustic music composition working privately in the studios of the University of East Anglia (Norwich, UK) with Denis Smalley. He returned to New Zealand in 1990 to take up a position at Victoria University of Wellington where he became a Senior Lecturer and Director of the Electroacoustic Music Studios. In November 2000 he joined the Music, Technology and Innovation Research Centre at De Montfort University in Leicester (UK) where is now Professor of Composition. His main interest in composition continues to be in acousmatic music, particularly forms based on the interplay between recognizable natural sound sources and computer-based studio transformations, but also combines electroacoustics with instrumental media. He has received a number of international awards, including First Prize in the 1996 Stockholm Electronic Arts Award (Sweden) (for his work Inner), a First Prize in the 34th Bourges International Electroacoustic Music and Sonic Art Competition (France, 2007) (for Ricordiamo Forl√¨) and Second Prize in the 4th Concurso Internacional de M√∫sica Eletroac√∫stica de S√£o Paulo (CIMESP ‚Äô01, Brazil) (for Liquid Sky).

Mannix, an economist who also was a political appointee at the Environmental Protection Agency, serving as Associate Administrator for Policy, Economics, and Innovation from September 18, 2005, until January 20, 2009. Career Currently, Dudley is a Distinguished Professor of Practice at the George Washington University Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration.http://regulatorystudies.columbian.gwu.edu/susan-e-dudley In September 2009, she founded the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center, which \\"raise[s] awareness of regulations‚Äô effects and improve[s] regulatory policy through research, education, and outreach.\\"http://www.gwu.edu/~regstudies/Home.html In September 2010 Dudley was appointed as a member of the Administrative Conference of the United States. As of January 2015 she is Vice-President, and President-Elect, of the Society for Benefit-Cost Analysis. President Bush first nominated Dudley to serve as the OIRA Administrator on July 31, 2006. The Senate Governmental Affairs and Homeland Security Committee held a hearing on Dudley‚Äôs nomination on November 13, but did not hold a vote to confirm her. Bush re-nominated Dudley on January 9, 2007; appointed her to serve as a senior advisor at OIRA on January 30, 2007; and gave her a recess appointment as OIRA Administrator on April 4, 2007. On January 6, 2009, the recess appointment expired and Bush designated Dudley as Acting Administrator of OIRA until his term of office ended on January 20, 2009. From 1998 through January 2007, Dudley worked at the non-profit Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where she directed the Regulatory Studies Program from 2003 to 2006. As an adjunct professor at the George Mason University School of Law from 2002 to 2006, she designed and taught courses on regulations and led regulatory clinics. Earlier in her career, Dudley served as a career civil servant, working as a policy analyst at the Environmental Protection Agency (1984-1985), an economist at OIRA (1985 ‚Äì 1989), and an economist advisor at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (1989 - 1991). From 1991 until 1998, she was Vice President and Director of Environmental Analysis at Economists Incorporated, a consulting firm. Dudley has authored more than 25 publications on regulatory matters, including e-rulemaking, electricity, health care, the environment, and occupational safety. She has served on the boards of the Association of Private Enterprise Education, the International Foundation for Research in Experimental Economics‚Äîfounded by Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist Vernon L. Smith, and the National Federation of Independent Business Legal Foundation (now the NFIB Small Business Legal Center). She has also served as a member of several committees and boards in the Commonwealth of Virginia, including the Virginia Environmental Education Advisory Committee (2000-2002), the Administrative Law Advisory Committee (2000-2003), and the Virginia Waste Management Board (1996-2001). Dudley holds a Master of Science degree from the MIT Sloan School of Management (1981) and a Bachelor of Science degree (summa cum laude) in Resource Economics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (1977). Controversies Dudley has been termed a conservative academic and her work at the Mercatus (\\"Market,\\" in Latin) Center generally promoted market solutions over government regulation. She argued, for example, that consumers should be able to choose the efficiency of their household appliances, rather than have the government set energy efficiency standards. She also famously argued against an EPA effort to reduce surface ozone stating that smog-free skies would lead to significantly more skin cancers and cataracts.Ozone NAAQS Comments: Comments on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs Proposed National Ambient Air Quality Standard , Susan E. Dudley, March 12, 1997, p. 4/ES-1, retrieved December 22, 2013 On July 11, 2008, Dudley publicly objected to EPA's analysis of various ways to control greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, and transmitted the objections of four cabinet members and four other agency heads. All of these objections were published along with EPA's analysis, which it prepared in response to the April 2007 Supreme Court ruling that EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gases. The act of an administration publishing a document and disavowing its own conclusions was described as an \\"extraordinary move\\" by the Wall Street Journal and \\"tortured policy\\" by the Washington Post. On April 17, 2009, the Obama administration took the next administrative step under the Clean Air Act by finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and the environment; however, it reaffirmed the Bush administration's position that legislative action by Congress would be far preferable.

It saw service for three centuries, including the First World War and the Second World War. The regiment survived the immediate post-war reduction in forces, but following the 1957 Defence White Paper, it was amalgamated with the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, forming the Queen's Own Hussars in 1958. History Sir John Cope, Colonel 1741-1760; a competent soldier, now remembered for the 1745 defeat at Prestonpans =Formation; 17th Century= In April 1689, several Independent Troops of Scots Horse were formed as a short-term response to the 1689-1691 Jacobite Rising in Scotland. These were re-organised in December 1690 as two regiments, one commanded by Colonel Richard Cunningham and in line with prevailing practice, it was known as Cunningham's Regiment of Scots Dragoons. In February 1694, it was transferred onto the English military establishment and shipped to Flanders, where it took part in operations associated with the 1695 Siege of Namur.Cannon, p. 14-16 All participants in the Nine Years War were financially exhausted, and there was little military activity after the fall of Namur. On 1 October 1696, Cunningham was promoted to Brigadier-General; Lord Jedburgh succeeded him and the regiment became Jedburgh's Regiment of Dragoons. =Wars of the 18th Century= Uniform of the 7th Hussars, c.1815 The regiment spent most of the 1702-1714 War of the Spanish Succession based in Edinburgh; in 1707, Jedburgh transferred the Colonelcy to Lord Polwarth, who sold it to William Kerr in 1709.Cannon, p. 20 In 1711, Kerr's Dragoons joined the field army in Flanders but the war was winding down and the regiment disbanded in 1714, before being reconstituted in July 1715 by George I, as HRH the Princess of Wales's Own Royal Regiment of Dragoons, in honour of Princess Caroline. During the 1715 Jacobite rising, it fought at Sheriffmuir, but this was its only significant action until 1743. Renamed The Queen's Own Royal Regiment of Dragoons after the coronation of George II in 1727; William Kerr finally stepped down in 1741 and Sir John Cope took over as Colonel.Cannon, p. 32 The unit returned to Flanders in 1742 during the 1740-1748 War of the Austrian Succession, taking part in the battles of Dettingen, Fontenoy, Rocoux and finally Lauffeld in July 1747.Cannon, p. 35-37 The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle ended the war and the regiment returned to England.Cannon, p. 38 When the Seven Years' War began in 1756, the regiment took part in the June 1758 Raid on St Malo,Cannon, p. 42 at which 100 enemy vessels were burned, the Raid on Cherbourg in August 1758Cannon, p. 43 and the Battle of Warburg in July 1760.Cannon, p. 44 In 1783, it was classed as 'light dragoons,' light cavalry used for reconnaissance and retitled the 7th (The Queen's Own) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons. During the French Revolutionary Wars, it fought at Beaumont in April 1794 and Willems in May.Cannon, p. 35 =Wars of the 19th Century= British hussars at the Battle of Benavente, 29 December 1808, by William Barnes Wollen 7th Hussar private, ca 1810, from the Warrant Officers and Sergeants Mess of the Queen's Royal Hussars; note blue & white barrel sash around the waist, instead of the usual red & yellow for hussars. In 1807, the regiment was designated as Hussars and retitled 7th (The Queen's Own) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (Hussars). Sent to Corunna in October 1808 to support Sir John Moore's retreat, they fought at the Battle of Sahag√∫n on 21 December 1808 and Benavente on 29th.Cannon, p. 71 Part of the Queen's Own was shipped home in the Dispatch, which was wrecked just south of the Lizard on 22 January 1809; 104 men were lost from the regiment, only seven in total were saved.Gossett, p. 70 The unit returned to the Peninsula in August 1813 and made several charges at the February 1814 Battle of Orthes, Wellington reporting that the 7th Hussars distinguished themselves on this occasion and made many prisoners.Cannon, p. 77 In March 1814, the unit moved to Brighton, where it was used to put down rioting caused by the imposition of the Corn Laws.Cannon, p. 78 When Napoleon was restored in 1815, the regiment returned to the Netherlands; during the rearguard action at Genappe on 17 June, Lord Uxbridge ordered it to attack French lancers under Colonel Jean Baptiste Joseph Sourd.Wit, p. 2 The following day, at the Battle of Waterloo, the regiment was held in reserve until the evening, but then again undertook a series of charges. Standish O'Grady, then a lieutenant in the 7th Hussars, wrote to his father: > \\"We charged twelve or fourteen times, and once cut off a squadron of > cuirassiers, every man of whom we killed on the spot except the two officers > and one Marshal de Logis, whom I sent to the rear\\".Printed in ‚ÄòWaterloo > Letters,‚Äô edited by Major General H. T. Siborne (London, 1891, pp. 130‚Äì6) In May 1838 the regiment was deployed to Canada as part of the response to the Lower Canada Rebellion.Cannon, p. 86 =The Indian Mutiny= Privates of the 7th Hussars on patrol, c.1850 Uniform of the 7th Hussars, c. 1840 The regiment was deployed to India in late 1857 as part of the response to the Indian Rebellion. Cornet William Bankes, died fighting off his attackers in an incident at Musa Bagh in March 1858 and Major Charles Fraser saved three non- swimmers from the regiment stranded in the middle of a sandbank on the River Rapti in December 1858. The regiment's title was simplified in 1861 as the 7th (Queen's Own) Hussars. The regiment provided a contingent for the Nile Expedition in autumn 1884. The regiment was deployed to South Africa in November 1901 and was stationed at Leeuwkop during the Second Boer War. =First World War= Douglas Haig; commissioned into the 7th Queen's Own Hussars in 1885, commanded the BEF in France 1915-1918 The regiment, which had been stationed in Bangalore at the start of the First World War landed in Mesopotamia as part of the 11th Indian Cavalry Brigade in November 1917. The regiment took part in the action of Khan Baghdadi in March 1918 and the Battle of Sharqat in October 1918.Perry, p. 33 After service in the First World War, the regiment retitled as 7th Queen's Own Hussars in 1921. The regiment, which was re-equipped with Mark II tanks, transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps in 1939. =Second World War= The regiment had been converted to tanks in 1937 and subsequently been trained in Cairo giving them a reasonable advantage. Although they might have thought that they were misplaced in Egypt, when Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940, that thought quickly slipped their mind. They formed part of the 7th Armoured Brigade in the 7th Armoured Division and were joined by the 8th and the 11th Hussars. On 14 June 1940 the 7th Hussars, with a company of the King's Royal Rifle Corps and a battery of 4th Royal Horse artillery captured Fort Capuzzo, while the 11th Hussars captured La Maddalena. They took part in the Battle of Sidi Barrani in December 1940 and at the Battle of Bardia in January 1941. Hitler created the Afrika Korps under the command of General Erwin Rommel to re-inforce the Italians: in April 1941, the allied troops in Tobruk were cut off by the Germans and Italians but in June 1941 the 7th Armoured Division was again prepared for battle as part of Operation Battleaxe, having received new tanks and additional personnel.Playfair, Volume II, pp. 1‚Äì2, 32, 163‚Äì164 Rommel then started to push the Allies back into Egypt. The regiment helped delay Rommel's advance although the commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Freddie Byass and many others were killed at the Battle of Sidi Rezegh in November 1941. Crusader I tanks in Western Desert, 26 November 1941, with \\"old\\" gun mantlets and auxiliary Besa MG turret. These were the tanks predominantly used by the 7th Hussars in North Africa. In January 1942 the regiment was sent to Burma and engaged with the Japanese Army at Pegu. Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander spoke highly of the regiment when he said: > \\"Without them we should never have got the Army out of Burma; no praise can > be too high for them.\\" The regiment was ordered to destroy its tanks as it crossed the Chindwin River in May 1942. It then re-deployed to the Italian Front and, having been seconded to the Polish 2nd Corps, fought at the first Battle of Ancona in June 1944 and in the battles for the Gothic Line in autumn 1944. The Polish Army granted the regiment the privilege of wearing the \\"Maid of Warsaw\\" for their \\"Magnificent work ‚Äì fine examples of heroism and successful action\\". The regiment reached Bologna in October 1944 and then took part in the battle for the Po plains in the spring of 1945. =Post-war= The regiment was deployed to Bournemouth Barracks in Soltau, in Northern Germany in June 1946. It returned to the UK in December 1947 and then moved to Alma Barracks in L√ºneburg in 1949 and to Lumsden Barracks in Bad Fallingbostel in October 1951. The regiment was sent to Hong Kong in 1954 and returned home in 1957. It survived the immediate post-war reduction in forces, but was slated for reduction in the 1957 Defence White Paper, and was amalgamated with the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, to form the Queen's Own Hussars in 1958.

One, James Creamer, had been sentenced to death, and the others to life imprisonment. They had been convicted of the murder of Warren and Rosina Matthews, in May 1971 in Marietta, Georgia. The victims - two physicians - were shot to death in their home, apparently during an attempted robbery. The principal evidence against them at the trial was the evidence of Deborah Ann Kidd, who testified she was one of the group, and that Creamer was the shooter. In 1974, Georgia State Supreme Court unanimously upheld all the convictions and sentences. In 1975, it emerged from an investigation by the Atlanta Constitution newspaper that Kidd's testimony was probably false. She said she was under the influence of drugs when the crime had occurred and remembered little of it, and her full account was recovered with the aid of an hypnotist. Although the tapes of the hypnosis session showed that the hypnotist had suggested the incriminating material to which Kidd confessed, and one woman she named as participating in the crime was proven to be out of state at the time, the defense was not given transcripts of the sessions nor informed about her false identification. Kidd had also given many incompatible versions of events that transpired at the crime scene, which the defense team did not receive. It was later discovered that Kidd was romantically involved with one of the detectives assigned to the case. During the course of appeals, Kidd admitted she lied in her original testimony, and Billy Birt, a death-row inmate, confessed that he and two other men had committed the murder. In 1975, the convictions of the seven were reversed and the state dropped the charges.

Biography Born in Copenhagen, Byrval started playing football with Boldklubben Frem. In 1895, several players left Frem, and Byrval and Peter Mikkelsen went on to play for B 93. They returned to Frem in 1897, and were the first two players to represent Frem at an international level, when they were a part of the first Danish national selection, composed solely of players from the Copenhagen clubs. He participated in at least one international game for the Danish selection, against a German team in Hamburg. The match was won 5‚Äì0 by the Danish team and had 5,000 spectators. Lars Berendt, \\"Hurtig dribling gennem 5000 √•r \\", Danish Football Association, January 2002 Although it was a de facto international organized by the Danish Football Association (DBU), the game is not an official Danish national team match, as DBU did not register games as official until the 1908 Summer Olympics. Byrval coached both B 93 and Frem, before he was appointed Danish national team coach in May 1913. He managed the Danish team to victory in his first eight games until October 1915, including 8‚Äì0 and 10‚Äì0 defeats of Sweden. The Danish team played four games without an official coach appointed in 1916, before Byrval once again coached the team from June 1917 to October 1918, including a 12‚Äì0 defeat of Norway. In all, he coached 16 national team games, winning 14, drawing one and losing one. In his civil life, Byrval was a physical education schoolmaster with the municipal schools of Copenhagen, a voluntary Intendant with Korps Westenholz and a non-commissioned officer with the Royal Life Guards.

He was chief of state of El Salvador from February 16, 1830 to December 4, 1830, while it was a state within the Federal Republic of Central America. His parents were Esteban Gabriel de Villacorta and Mar√≠a Ignacia de Ca√±as. He married Francisca de la Cotera. He obtained the degree of licenciado in civil law from the Universidad de San Carlos in Guatemala. He was also a well-known canon lawyer. He is considered one of the most illustrious figures in Salvadoran history. He took part in the movement for independence from Spain, and was a deputy to the constituent congress of the State of El Salvador in 1824. He worked hard on the draft of the constitution, and for that is called the \\"Father of Salvadoran Institutions\\". He was secretary of the constituent congress, which on June 12, 1824 declared the first constitution of the Salvadoran state. Later Villacorta was named prosecutor before the state Supreme Court, councilor of state and vice-chief of state of El Salvador. He served as chief executive of the state for a few months in 1830, both succeeding and preceding Jos√© Mar√≠a Cornejo. During his administration a legislative decree was issued abolishing the religious orders within the State of El Salvador (March 1830). Although the members of the orders were allowed to continue living in the monasteries and convents, the buildings were declared property of the state. On December 4, 1830, he returned the executive authority to Jos√© Mar√≠a Cornejo. For his opposition to what he saw as the interference of General Francisco Moraz√°n in the internal affairs of El Salvador, he was arrested. Together with other Salvadoran authorities, he was taken in fetters to Guatemala in 1832. In 1835 he was a deputy and interim president of the Legislature in Guatemala. In 1840 he refused the position of president of the Republic. He returned to El Salvador three years later. For some time he served as law professor at the National University. Later he was elected vice-rector of the University and served as acting rector. He was president of the Court of Justice in 1851 and 1858, and one of the founders of the city of Nueva San Salvador, after the disastrous earthquake of 1854 devastated the old city. In accordance with law, Villacorta established the Supreme Court in the new city in December 1856. He died June 11, 1860 in New San Salvador.

He spent time with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings, and Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League. He was known for being involved with trades for over twenty players and was even traded for Bill Dineen on three separate occasions. He was inducted into the Dayton Hockey Hall of Fame on March 17, 1970 for his time with the Dayton Gems. Professional career =Minor league hockey= Bailey had his first taste of professional hockey at the age of 16 when he played 22 games with the Windsor Hettche Spitfires of the International Hockey League. He performed well, but many on the coaching staff felt he needed more time develop. He continued his play with the Stratford Kroehlers and didn't return to the IHL until the 1951‚Äì52 season, when he played in the final two games of the season for the Toledo Mercurys. However that was all it took. The Detroit Red Wings owned the rights to Bailey and decided to trade him to the Cleveland Barons along with his brother, John Bailey for the rights to Lou Jankowski and Bill Dineen in June 1951. In the American Hockey League Bailey flourished, playing in 54 games, amassing 46 points and a team-high 115 penalty minutes. That's all it took, as the Toronto Maple Leafs had had their eye on young Bailey and wanted to see what he could do. On May 30, 1953, Toronto traded Chuck Blair and 30,000 USD to Cleveland for Bailey and Gerry Foley. =Reaching the NHL= After spending a short amount of time in the Maple Leafs' farm system with the Ottawa Senators of the QHL and the Pittsburgh Hornets, Bailey made his debut with the Toronto Maple Leafs in the middle of the 1953‚Äì54 season. He played in 48 games and scored 9 points, but also joined the Leafs' short playoff run against the Detroit Red Wings. Maurice \\"Rocket\\" Richard had a short altercation with the young rookie when he butt-ended Bailey with his stick after Bailey slammed Richard into the boards. Throughout the game Richard repeatedly tried to renew his attack on Bailey and even refused to leave the ice after a slash when ordered by the referee. The following two seasons would be much less dramatic as they saw Bailey splitting time between the Maple Leafs and the Hornets, never really finding his scoring touch when brought up to the big leagues. While playing for the Hornets in 1956, Bailey was suspended from the remainder of the playoffs and fined 575 USD for assaulting referee Jerry Olinski on April 2. On May 28, 1956, Bailey was traded along with Bob Sabourin to the Springfield Indians for 11,000 USD. On September 22, 1956, Bailey was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for cash, but would remain in Springfield on loan. He played 40 games for the Indians before being called up to replace injured players for the Detroit Red Wings. He joined the Red Wings for their short playoff run against the Boston Bruins. The 1957‚Äì58 season saw Bailey playing for the Chicago Blackhawks after being acquired in an Inter- league draft on June 5, 1957. He would only play in 28 games before again being traded, this time with Jack McIntyre, Nick Mickoski and Hec Lalonde for Earl Reibel, Billy Dea, Lorne Ferguson and Bill Dineen on December 17, 1957. Bailey again joined Detroit for the playoffs and again had a post-season altercation. During the semi-finals against the Montreal Canadiens, there was a bench-clearing brawl that all started in the second period, precipitated by Bailey charging Montreal's goaltender, Jacques Plante. To settle the teams (and the crowd), referee Frank Udvari sent both teams to their dressing rooms and added the 5:22 remaining in that second period to the third stanza. The Canadiens ended up winning 2-1 and knocked Detroit out of the playoffs in four games. The 1957-58 season would be Bailey's last in the NHL. On July 31, 1958, Bailey was again traded to Cleveland from Detroit, this time for cash. However, Bailey picked up his scoring game for the 1958‚Äì59 season and finished third on the team in scoring and first again in penalty minutes. The following season saw Bailey playing only five more games for the Barons before being traded for Bill Dineen once again, this time to the Buffalo Bisons on October 20, 1959. He would finish out the season in Buffalo at almost a point-per-game pace. In 1960, Bailey was involved in another multiplayer trade on June 7. Bailey, Glen Skov, the rights to Danny Lewicki, Terry Gray and Lorne Ferguson went to the Montreal Canadiens for Cecil Hoekstra, Reggie Fleming, Ab McDonald and Bob Courcy. However, he wouldn't see ice time with Montreal as he would spend time with Montreal's minor leagues. Bailey spent the 1960‚Äì61 season with the Quebec Aces and the start of the 1961‚Äì62 season with the Pittsburgh Hornets before again being traded. This time Bailey would be switching leagues as Pittsburgh traded him to the San Francisco Seals of the Western Hockey League for Gord Redahl on February 27, 1962. On the Seals, Bailey failed to put up large numbers and was sent to the Philadelphia Ramblers of the Eastern Hockey League. He had his best offensive season to date with the Ramblers, scoring 26 goals for a total of 91 points during the 1962‚Äì63 season. He also helped head coach for a short time that season along with Hugh Currie and Doug Adam. In 1963 Bailey was let go, but found a home with the Fort Wayne Komets of the International Hockey League. =Ending on a high note= At the end of the 1963‚Äì64 season, Bailey was involved in his last professional trade when he was traded to the Dayton Gems for Roger Maisonneuve in November 1964. This turned out to be a great fit as Bailey put up his best numbers ever, scoring a career-high and team-leading 132 points in the 1965‚Äì66 season. In his final season, Bailey was suspended after slugging referee Billy Purcell in a game at Fort Wayne on December 9, 1967. This is what helped convince Bailey to retire in 1968. He had spent four years with the Gems in which he scored 319 points, almost half his total amassed career points. After hockey Bailey was honored on March 17, 1970 when he was inducted into the Dayton Hockey Hall of Fame. Long time Fort Wayne General Manager Ken Ullyot called him \\"the last of the great stick handlers.\\" Gems' goaltender Pat Rupp said Bailey was \\"the best to ever play hockey in Dayton.\\" Awards and achievements * Most assists in a season (87) -- Dayton Gems (1965‚Äì66 season) * Dayton Hockey Hall of Fame Inductee -- March 17, 1970 External links * *Bob's page on the Dayton Hockey Hall of Fame * References Category:1931 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Buffalo Bisons (AHL) players Category:Canadian ice hockey right wingers Category:Canadian people of British descent Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Cleveland Barons (1937‚Äì1973) players Category:Dayton Gems players Category:Detroit Auto Club players Category:Detroit Red Wings players Category:Eastern Hockey League players Category:Fort Wayne Komets players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:Ottawa Senators (QHL) players Category:Sportspeople from Kenora Category:Pittsburgh Hornets players Category:Quebec Aces (AHL) players Category:San Francisco Seals (ice hockey) players Category:Springfield Indians players Category:Toledo Mercurys players Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players ","title":"Bob Bailey (ice hockey)"},{"id":"10481658","text":"thumb Santiago Teyahualco is the second-largest town in the municipality of Tultepec in the state of M√©xico in Mexico.

In the interim Scott has changed his musical approach, abandoning the melange of honky-tonk tropes, rock rhythms, and jazz colorings on his early recordings for straight-ahead country-rock bombast.\\" Track listing Musicians *Darrell Scott ‚Äì Accordion (Track 12), Banjo (Track 5), Banjolin (Track 6), Bouzouki (Track 2, 4, 8), Dobro (Track 1), 12 String Acoustic Guitar (Track 9, 12), Acoustic Guitar (Track 1-3, 5-6, 10-11), Baritone Acoustic Guitar (Track 4), Electric Guitar (Track 1, 3-6, 8-9, 11-12), Electric Baritone Guitar (Track 2, 7), Mandolin (Track 1-2, 4, 6, 8-9), Pedal Steel (Track 3), Percussion (Track 8), Piano (Track 3, 11), Electric Piano (Track 7, 12), 2nd Solo (Track 6), Solo (Track 12), Lead Vocals (Track 1-2, 4-8, 10-11, 12), Background Vocals (Track 7-8, 12), Weissenborn Slide (Track 11) *Kathy Chiavola ‚Äì Voice (Track 4) *Jeff Coffin ‚Äì Flute (Track 4), Baritone Sax (Track 5), Soprano Sax (Track 10), Tenor Sax (Track 11) *Dan Dugmore ‚Äì Guitar, Electric Guitar (Track 2-3, 5, 7), Electric Rhythm Guitar (Track 8), Lap Steel Guitar (Track 5-6), Pedal Steel (Track 2, 9-11), Solo (Track 3, 5, 7, 10), 1st & 3rd Solo (Track 6) *Stuart Duncan ‚Äì Fiddle (Track 9) *Jim Hoke ‚Äì Horn (Track 7) *Kenny Malone ‚Äì Drums (Track 1-3, 5-8, 10-12), Percussion (Track 7, 9-11), Tambourine (Track 2), Spoken Word (Track 4), The Beast (Track 12) *Jane Salters ‚Äì Spoken Word (Track 4) *Jonell Mosser ‚Äì Voice of Sally (Track 7) *Steve Nathan ‚Äì Organ (Track 1, 4, 6-8, 10-12) *Dirk Powell ‚Äì Accordion (Track 8), Fiddle (Track 8), Yells (Track 8) *Suzy Ragsdale ‚Äì Voice (Track 3, 6-8, 10, 12), Voice of Myrrah (Track 11) *John Cowan ‚Äì Voice (Track 3, 7-8, 10, 12) *Rodney Crowell ‚Äì Voice (Track 2) *Wayne Scott ‚Äì Spoken Word Phone Message (Track 3) *Danny Thompson ‚Äì Double Bass (Track 1-5, 7, 9-12), Acoustic Bass (Track 6, 8), Vocal \\"Zock\\" (Track 5) *Kris Wilkinson ‚Äì Viola (Track 4, 11) *Andrea Zonn ‚Äì Violin (Track 4, 12) *John Catchings ‚Äì Cello (Track 4, 12) Production *Darrell Scott ‚Äì Producer, Audio Production, Engineer, Mixing, Liner Notes, Photography *Richard Dodd ‚Äì Mastering *Miles Wilkinson ‚Äì Audio Engineer, Engineer, Mixing *Stacy Zaferes ‚Äì Photography *Sherie Ren√© Scott ‚Äì Photography *Se√±or McGuire ‚Äì Photography *Maude Gilman Clapham ‚Äì Art Direction, Design *Phil Carroll ‚Äì Settings Track information and credits adapted from AllMusic. and verified from the album's liner notes.

As of December 2016, the city is under the control of pro-Turkish militias, as part of the Turkish buffer zone. Al-Bab is located northeast of Aleppo, south of the Turkish border, and has an area of . Al-Bab has an altitude of . According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), it had a population of 63,069 in 2004. The population has surged to about 100,000 during the Syrian Civil War. Prior to the Syrian Civil War, al-Bab's inhabitants were composed of Sunni Arabs and Arabized Kurds, thus being much more ethnically homogeneous than those of the neighbouring city of Manbij. Al-Bab is the administrative center of the Nahiya al-Bab and Al-Bab District. Name Al-BƒÅb in Arabic means the door. According to Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi in 1226, the name is a shortening of BƒÅb BizƒÅ ªah (the gate to BizƒÅ ªah). BizƒÅ ªah (also BuzƒÅ ªah and BzƒÅ ªƒÅ) is a town located about east of Al-BƒÅb. History During the Roman Empire, Al-Bab was a civitas of the Roman Province of Syria, known as Batnai.Barrington Atlas, 2000, pl. 67 F4. The ruins of that settlement lie on the banks of the wadi north of the modern town.Batnai (Tell Batnan) Syria (Syria). Roman Batnai should not be confused with the Roman town Batnae about northeast. Al-Bab was conquered by the Arab army of the Rashidun Caliphate under caliph Umar ibn al- Khattab in the 7th century. It received its name, meaning \\"the Gate\\", during Islamic rule as it served as \\"the gate\\" between Aleppo and the adjacent town of Buza'ah. The tomb and shrine of Aqil ibn Abi Talib (the brother of Ali) was located in al-BƒÅb. Until its rule by the Ayyubids in the 13th century, the town was populated mostly by Shias of the Ismaili sect. According to Yaqut al- Hamawi in 1226, it was a small town in the district of Aleppo. In the town were markets filled with cotton products called kirbas which were exported to Damascus and Egypt. The fourteenth-century historian Abu'l-Fida writes that al-Bab was a small town with a market, a bath, pleasant gardens, and a mosque (the Great Mosque of al-Bab).Le Strange, 1890, p.406. The fortunes of Al-Bab were shared with that of Aleppo when that city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1516, and was administered as part of the Eyalet of Aleppo until 1866 and the Vilayet of Aleppo until January 1919, when the district was occupied by French troops and attached to the State of Aleppo within the French mandate of Syria. =Syrian Civil War= Until April 2012, Al-Bab had been relatively unscathed by the Syrian civil war. Between mid-May and mid-July, some 15 rebel groups formed within the city. The fight for Al-Bab included a series of raids and assaults on government offices over the course of two months, finally culminating on 18 July when rebels seized the final government stronghold within the city limits. According to opposition activists, an army garrison remained outside al-Bab and shelled the insurgents' positions.McElroy, Damien. Syria dispatch: Rebels forced to share guns as Assad's tanks roll in to Aleppo. The Daily Telegraph. 2012-07-26. Rebel forces pushed the army from this garrison on the south edge of town on 29 July, With the seizure of al- Bab, the insurgents in northern Aleppo gained considerable momentum.Holliday, Joseph (17 September 2012), Campaign for North Syria, September 2012, Institute for the Study of WarAl Jazeera speaks to Syria secret police, Al Jazeera, 29 July 2012.Rebels claim victory in Syria's al-Bab.

In December 2016, al-Bab came under an attack by Syrian rebels backed by Turkey. Turkish air strikes on 21 December destroyed 67 Islamic State targets; 59 Turkish soldiers and over 200 rebels were reported killed. Al-Bab was a strategically important town for Turkey because it did not want the two SDF regions to link up. On 9 February 2017, a Russian air strike killed three Turkish soldiers by mistake. On 23 February 2017, al-Bab was captured by Turkish-backed rebels, \\"Turkey-backed rebels in 'near full control' of Al Bab\\", Al Jazeera, 23 January 2017. becoming a part of the Turkish buffer zone. On 15 July 2020, unknown aircraft, suspected to be Russian, carried out airstrikes on the city of al-Bab. An apartment complex was destroyed in the attack. One civilian was killed and at least 10 others were injured in the airstrikes. It was the first airstrike on the town since it was captured from ISIL.  Security  In February 2017, a Turkish trained police force of 2000 men was deployed in al-Bab. Since the Turkish armed forces invaded northern Syria in October 2019, the violence in al-Bab, including a number of car bombs, increased.  Education  in 2019 it was announced that the University of Gaziantep is opening a Faculty of Economics and administrative Sciences in al-Bab. Climate Al-Bab has a cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk) with influences of a continental climate during winter with hot dry summers and cool wet and occasionally snowy winters.

Xunlei sets up its own storage servers to backup the files which are not active or shared any longer. This feature is named as High-Speed Channel and allows Xunlei users retrieve data faster than others. But only paying users have access to these servers and download files.

Early life He was born at Grenoble in Dauphin√©, of a Protestant family. Later in life he converted to Catholicism, under the influence of his second wife. He was a nephew of General Jean- Gabriel, Count Marchand, the husband of an aunt. Revolutionary Antoine-Joseph Barnave was a first cousin of his mother. He enlisted in the French Army at sixteen, joined his uncle Marchand in Warsaw and was promoted to sergeant on 11 April 1812. He took part in the Russian Campaign, the taking of Moscow and the retreat back. He then fought in Napoleon's campaigns in Germany and France, notably at the battles of L√ºtzen, Bautzen and Leipzig. Middle life He was Minister of War from January to October 1851, after which he was appointed Governor-General of Algerie (11 December 1851 to 31 August 1858). Although initially not in favour of the coup of December 1851, he finally rallied the Second French Empire. He was made a Count in 1852 (by reversion of the title of his uncle General Marchand), and Marshal of France in 1856, at the same time as Canrobert and Bosquet. He served again as Minister of War from 1859 to 1867. Later life Arrival of Marshal Randon in Algiers in 1857 He received no command during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, because of his high age. He was nevertheless accused to have a part of responsibility in French defeat for having neglected to prepare for it during his second ministry and for having dissuaded Napoleon III of acting in favour of Austria at the time of the Battle of Sadova in 1866. Modern research has shown that the latter accusation is unfounded and that, quite contrarily, Randon had advocated an immediate action against Prussia. He died on 16 January 1871 in Geneva, leaving only one surviving daughter. The Marshal's first wife, Clotilde P√©rier, was a sister of Casimir P√©rier, who had been President of the Council during the July Monarchy and the grandfather of Jean Casimir-P√©rier, President of the French Republic.

Following the Russian occupation in the Russo- Swedish War (1741‚Äì1743) and vague promises of making the country independent, Finns elected the then Duke Peter of Holstein-Gottorp (who later became heir to the throne of Russia and Emperor as Peter III) as the King of Finland. However, the political situation had outgrown the idea of Finnish independence and it quickly evaporated.Most of the factual information in this article derives from Suomen historia, part IV. Weilin+G√∂√∂s 1986. . Background Duke Charles Peter, proclaimed King of Finland Duke Charles Peter of Holstein- Gottorp was the closest living relative (grand-nephew) and the natural heir of the recently deceased, childless Queen Ulrika Eleonora (died 1741), and similarly the grand-nephew of the childless King Charles XII of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora's only brother and predecessor on the throne. Even though he was just a 14-year-old Scandinavian German who had never even been to Sweden, he was very popular among the peasantry, in Finland especially for the fact that he was also the nephew of Empress Elizabeth of Russia and could thus ensure a more enduring peace. It has been described of Charles Peter of Gottorp that he identified himself with his Swedish heritage and that even afterwards, living in St. Petersburg, would have liked to make his own environment and lands to resemble Scandinavia. In the imperial court of St. Petersburg, he grew up in a specifically \\"Holsteinian\\" separate sub-culture. When the Russian counter- offensive started in March 1742, Chancellor Bestuzhev probably toyed with the idea of making a buffer state in between Sweden and Russia. Empress Elizabeth presented Finns ‚Äî then still a part of the Kingdom of Sweden ‚Äî with a declaration (Manifest of Empress Elisabeth to Finnish People) wherein she promised to make Finland independent if they did not resist her troops. By July 1742, Russia had occupied all of Finland, meeting almost no resistance at all due to ineffective Swedish military command and forces, and that month a group of Finnish peasants pleaded with the Russians to make the duke the King of Sweden. Diet Lantdag of Turku James Keith was a Scottish mercenary in the service of Russia and Prussia. General James Keith, a Scottish mercenary responsible for the occupying Russian forces in the south, called for the estates of southwestern Finland ‚Äî roughly today's Southwest Finland and Satakunta ‚Äî to meet at lantdag (Diet of Finland) in Turku (√Öbo) on 8 (or 18) October 1742. Each city and hundred was to send one from nobility and two from clergy, bourgeoisie and peasants to discuss matters important for the \\"cities and the whole country\\". Known representatives that showed up in the city were e.g. freiherrs i.e. barons Henrik Rehbinder and Johannes Gripenberg, vicars pastors from Loimaa, Halikko, P√∂yty√§ and Maaria and mayors of Rauma and Pori. Names of peasants have not survived, but they were probably best represented. On the official agenda presented by Keith were mostly daily proceedings, but Russians also assured to nominate only local officials and improve usage of the Finnish language in the domestic administration. Encouraged by Russians' earlier promises of independence, friendly occupation and their own apparent willingness to seize the moment, Finns presented the general with the decision to ask Duke Peter of Holstein-Gottorp to be the King of Finland. It is not known how the lantdag reached that decision as no official records of the meeting have survived, but from Russians' internal correspondence it seems evident that it was on the Finns' initiative. Preparations to form a delegation to present the Empress with the request started. According to Sj√∂str√∂m (pp 540‚Äì541) Keith summoned the Diet of Finland to convene in October 1742 at Turku, Finland. This Diet soon proclaimed duke Kaarle Petteri Ulrik as King of Finland. At the same time, the riksdag of Sweden had gathered in Stockholm, trying to find a way out of the military and political situation generated by the Hats' hasty and ill-advised war. As King Frederick I was without an heir apparent, the Swedish estates decided to use the future crown in negotiations, also selecting the same Duke as the next King of Sweden. The Empress Elizabeth of Russia on Horseback, Attended by a Page, circa 1740s, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Events were however developing at a fast pace. Russian troops had taken over Finland with much ease, and Elizabeth decided to make Duke Charles Peter her own heir to the Imperial throne, as she was without an heir apparent herself. The Swedish parliament was unaware of this, and when their envoy arrived in Saint Petersburg, it was too late. The underage Charles Peter's succession rights to Sweden were renounced on his behalf. New negotiations were thus opened, and Elizabeth agreed to restore the greater part of Finland if her cousin, Adolph Frederick of Holstein, was elected successor to the Swedish crown, thus concluding the war by the Treaty of √Öbo Turku on 7 August 1743. According to Sj√∂str√∂m (pp 540‚Äì541) the Swedes managed to repossess much of Finland in the Treaty of Turku. Elisabeth and Kaarle Petteri Ulrik kept the Finnish lands east of the River Kymi. Those lands were later known as ‚ÄúOld Finland‚Äù. Long unaware of the procedures elsewhere, the Finnish delegation was still only preparing for its trip to Saint Petersburg, when the word of Elizabeth's new mood reached them. Russians effectively stopped the process there, and the Diet lantdag representatives left for their homes. Most probably the duke never got to know about his election to the ephemeral throne of Finland. In late 1742, general Keith was succeeded in the leadership of civil administration of Finland (based at Turku) by the new Governor-General, Johannes Balthasar von Campenhausen. Aftermath Imperial High Chamberlain, Baron Johannes Balthasar von Campenhausen (1689-1758), 1742-1744 Governor- General of the Kingdom of Finland Disappointment in the results of the Turku Diet lantdag generated some plans to rebel against the Russian occupation, but no actions came of these sentiments. In general, the events of the Turku Diet lantdag in 1742 had no consequences after the Russian occupation ended the following year. Elizabeth's new candidate was elected as the next King of Sweden, and some Finnish territory was ceded to Russia. However, the events clearly resemble what happened seventy years later in the Finnish War, which ended up with the Finnish estates gathering in the Diet of Porvoo and swearing their oaths of loyalty to the Russian Emperor Alexander I as the Grand Duke of Finland. Alexander was the grandson of the Duke Charles Peter. Sj√∂str√∂m (pp 540‚Äì541) mentions that those lands of ‚ÄúOld Finland‚Äù were in a sense the surviving continuation of the Kingdom of Finland from 1742. H√§kkinen and Sippu (pages 84‚Äì85) mention that still in the 1790s, certain farmers of the villages of Liikkala, M√§mm√§l√§ and Ruotila in Old Finland, lodged a claim in court where they pleaded certain provisions of the 1742 Manifest of Empress Elisabeth among other points of law to support their position in that lawsuit. This implies that the 1742 manifest and the \\"statehood\\" of the ephemeral 1742 kingdom were still regarded as part of the fundamental rights in the Russian- held Old Finland. According to biographical account collected by Dr. Paaskoski (pages 101-102), Johannes Balthasar von Campenhausen (1689-1758) was between 1742 and 1744 the Governor-General of (the occupied) Finland and as successor of James Keith, held the position of leader of civil administration of Finland, firstly at Turku. As consequence of the Treaty of Turku of 1743, Governor-General Johannes Balthasar von Campenhausen transferred his seat to Lappeenranta, in the Old Finland. By the year 1744, Governor-General von Campenhausen organized the administration of Old Finland under himself. Swedish law and administrative practices were employed in the administration organized by von Campenhausen. According to Sj√∂str√∂m (pp 540‚Äì541), from 1743 to 1917, Old Finland (and other territories with which it merged), was governed as a separate territory with its own administration, law system, governance and constitution, in many aspects similar to the principalities of Germany. The hereditary monarchical ruler of these territories was always a member of the family of the dukes of Gottorp. The sovereigns apparently displayed their claim to the Kingdom in a heraldic way: Since 1788, the Arms of Old Finland (Governorate of Finland) included the royal crown under \\"the protection of\\" the imperial crown.

It is a story about a lonely man, Old Eguchi, who continuously visits the House of the Sleeping Beauties in hope of something more. Plot The titular house is an establishment where old men pay to sleep besides young girls that had been narcotized and happen to be naked, the sleeping beauties. The old men are expected to take sleeping pills and share the bed for a whole night with a girl without attempting anything of \\"bad taste\\" like \\"putting a finger inside their mouths\\". Eguchi is presented with a different girl each time he visits the house because of the short notice of his visits. He discovers that all girls are virgins which somehow compels him to comply with the house rules. Each girl is different and the descriptions of his actions are mixed with the dreams that he has sleeping besides the girls. Film adaptations The 2008 adaptation by Vadim Glowna, Das Haus der Schlafenden Sch√∂nen (House of the Sleeping Beauties), was not received well. Its Rotten Tomatoes rating is at 28%. Village Voice called it one of the worst releases of the year. The 2011 Australian film Sleeping Beauty, directed by Julia Leigh, uses the central premise of House of the Sleeping Beauties as part of its main plotline, but reverses the viewpoint. The film contains a scene in which a university lecturer is presenting on a game of Go, a reference to Kawabata's 1951 novel The Master of Go. The literary sources for the film Sleeping Beauty (2011) were acknowledged and discussed in the book Sleeping Beauty presented to the press at the Cannes Film Festival 2011 by Screen Australia and subsequently in many interviews. These sources included Kawabata, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Charles Perrault, and the Holy Bible. Influence The plot of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's novella Memories of My Melancholy Whores is ostensibly inspired by the House of the Sleeping Beauties.

Unlike the original, the game does not bear ESPN licensing. In it, the player races against others in various events around the world using Rollerblading, skateboarding, biking, and snowboarding. A sequel, 3Xtreme, was released in 1999. Gameplay Players compete on 12 courses with different vehicles. Points are awarded for performing tricks, passing through special gates, and knocking down opponents. Health dictates how easily a player can be knocked over by an obstacle or another racer, and decreases when a player accelerates. 2Xtreme has four different difficulty levels. A player can choose in the options to race without the other computer characters, and also turn off fighting. On 2Xtreme a player can either do a normal 'Exhibition' race or a season which involves all 12 tracks and creates standings based on the score the player achieves in each track. The score is calculated mainly by the time the player finishes in and place in the race. Points from gates, knockdowns and tricks are then added to this. On 2-player mode both for Exhibitions and Seasons the screen is split horizontally and both players start at the back of the race. This makes the game a little more difficult as it becomes harder to see and avoid the obstacles in your path. Reception 2Xtreme sharply divided critics. GamePros Dr. Zombie praised the game for its \\"high-speed action\\", tough opponent AI, split screen competitive mode, responsive controls, and graphics, particularly the rendered backgrounds. In contrast, Hugh Sterbakov of GameSpot said that though the graphics, sounds, and gameplay were all improved from ESPN Extreme Games, they were still so primitive that they could have been done on a last generation console. However, he felt the fun gameplay in two-player mode outweighed this, though he recommended that gamers with no one to play with buy a different racing game. Todd Mowatt of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it an 8 out of 10, citing the power-ups, selection of characters, and season competition, while his co-reviewer Joe Rybicki gave it a 5 out of 10, saying the graphics and animation do not exploit the PlayStation's capabilities, and the gameplay fails to improve upon the unexciting original. A reviewer for Next Generation somewhat similarly commented that 2Xtreme \\"seems to be a little more sedate than the frenzied original was.\\" He noted the absence of aggressive civilians, the lack of differentiation between the three tracks, and the over-similar control and feel of the different sports. He also criticized the two-player split screen as \\"barely adequate\\", and said the game should have supported the PlayStation Link Cable.

The community is named after a small mountain which contained two caves which used to be filled with thousands of bats. Zinacantepec is Nahuatl for Bat Mountain. Its Aztec glyph is a bat on a mountain. In the 18th century, the population of this mountain moved to settle alongside the Franciscan monastery established here in the 16th century. This monastery is the best preserved of a network of missionaries established in the Toluca Valley in the mid 16th century. Today, the complex functions as the parish church, with the cloister dedicated as the colonial era museum of the state of Mexico. History The history of the town and municipality begins about 1500 years ago at an elevation now named ‚ÄúCerro de Murci√©lago‚Äù or Bat Mountain. The hill contained two caves that used to be filled with thousands of bats. The presence of these animals was considered a sign of fertility. The hill remained populated until the 18th century, when a plague pushed the population toward the Franciscan monastery, which functioned as a hospital. A deity named Zinacan was associated with the mountain. Shortly after the Spanish Conquest, this deity would be believed to be an incarnation of the Devil. Today, the bat population of the area is limited to a few caves in the Nevado de Toluca National Park. The mountain is mined for gravel and alongside it is the Hacienda de Santa Cruz de los Patos, which is now part of the Mexiquense College, as a research center and library. The earliest known ethnicity in the area is the Otomi, who still are present, especially in smaller communities in the municipality such as San Luis Mextepec and Acahulaco. In the south of the municipality, there are Matlatzincas; however, there are very few. The area was conquered by the Aztecs in the latter 15th century by Axayacatl. Zinacantepec was then ruled from Tlacopan as a tributary province. Ex monastery During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Otomis sided with the Spanish and the Matlazincas against. Gonzalo de Sandoval came to the Toluca Valley with 18 cavalry and 100 infantry. They were joined by 60,000 Otomi and conquered the Matlatzincas. The area around what is now the city of Toluca, including Zinacantepec, came under the rule of Hern√°n Cort√©s administrated by his cousin Juan Guti√©rrez Altamirano in what would become the County of Santiago de Calimaya. The west part of the valleybecame part of the encomendero of Juan de S√°mano. This same family founded the Hacienda de laGavia which owned much of the arable land in the municipality. While no battles were fought here during the Mexican War of Independence, many here joined the army of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla against the colonial government, with many fighting at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces. After the war, Zinacantepec became a municipality in 1826. During the Reform War, vandalism and general lawlessness gripped the municipality as well as neighboring Toluca. This was finally put to an end by Felipe Berriozabal in the 1860s. During the Mexican Revolution, Zinacantepec was taken in 1912 by General Jos√© Lim√≥n and Alberto S√°mano in support of Francisco I. Madero. The Zapatistas camped in some of the smaller communities of the municipalities, confronting federal forces and sacking homes. The 2000s to the present are marked by political and economic problems for the municipality. Starting in 2005, the municipality has had serious financial difficulties, mostly due to its debt. These financial problems have caused inadequacies in the drainage, garbage collection and health services. In 2007, residents protested the lack of adequate garbage collection by bringing their garbage to the municipal palace and threatened to leave it there. They claim that in some areas, garbage had not been collected for months, requiring children to wear masks on their way to school. In 2008, councilman Leonardo Bravo Hernandez was sentenced to 18 months for the misappropriation of 100 million pesos during the city council session of 2003‚Äì2006. Jos√© Consuelo Gonz√°lez Xing√∫, a municipal delegate was shot and killed in January 2010 in San Antonio Acajhualco, a community in the municipality. Gonzalez Xing√∫ had presented a complaint to the Mexico State Commission of Human Rights for acts of intimidation and abuse among the municipal police force. Prior to this, Gonzalez Xingu had also made a formal complaint to the state about the municipal president for nepotism, which was ratified. The municipal president denies involvement. The municipal president, Gustavo Vargas Cruz, has been under investigation for the murder of Jesus Consuelo Xing√∫. One of the reported gunmen has been apprehended. Until 2008, Zinacantepec was the only municipality with roads with no right-of-way markers. In that year, the direction and signaling of all the roads was reworked in a systematic way. Zinacantepec will be the western terminus for the Toluca‚ÄìMexico City commuter rail when service commences in 2018. Town Municipal palace in town center Although just west of the city of Toluca, Zinacantepec remains mostly rural, preserving much of its traditions and customs from over 300 years ago. Major religious festivals include one in honor of the Virgin of Los Dolores (also called Del Rayo) from May 21 to 23 and one for the patron of the town, the Archangel Michael on December 3. One legend associated with the Virgin was that the image was left at the local monastery by a woman who had been cured of the plague. In 1762, a bolt of lightning struck and destroyed the church tower, but the Virgin, who was inside, was unharmed. Nave of the parish of San Miguel The town‚Äôs main church, the Parish of San Miguel, was the monastery church until the monastery church was closed during the Reform War. The church remained open but with non-monastic priests. The structure dates from the 17th century, and has typical features for constructions from that time such as a cruciform plan, a central dome and an ornate two tier bell tower. Since it was Franciscan, the facade is a sober Baroque with minimal ornamentation. Inside, on the south wall is a stone pulpit decorated with carved scales. It also contains an unusual ceramic baptismal font which dates from the early colonial period. The rest of the church is fairly modern but colonial paintings and church furnishings from earlier periods can be found in the sacristy. Market day is Sunday when the street fill with vendors and local specialties such as red and green mole, local produce, tamales and small tacos made with corn tortillas about 6 cm in diameter. Local drinks include pulque and fruit liquors. Universidad Polit√©cnica Del Valle de Toluca has its secondary campus in the town. It offers programs of study in engineering and business. Monastery complex View of cloister area with bell tower The Toluca Valley was evangelized by the Franciscans starting from the 1520s. During the 1550s and 1560s, a network of missions was built spreading out from Toluca, where missionaries would begin by studying the languages and customs of the native peoples of the valley. Of these missions, the monastery at Zinacantepec is the best preserved. The mission with its open chapel was begun in 1550, with the rest of the monastery built between 1560 and 1570. The modern town of Zinacantepec was built around it when the local populace abandoned the nearby hill and settled around the monastery in the 18th century. The monastery remained in operation from the early colonial period until the Reform War when it was closed by the government. It is said that it was occupied by Zapatista forces during the Mexican Revolution. Later in the 20th century, part of it was used to house priests who ran the still functioning Parish of San Miguel. It was declared a national monument in 1933. In 1976, the State of Mexico took over the cloister portion of the complex (leaving the church open for worship) and began to renovate it with the purpose of founding a museum, along with the Fondo Nacional para Actividades Sociales (FONAPAS). The museum was opened in 1980 as the Museo del Virrenato del Valle de Toluca (Museum of Viceregal Art of the Valley of Toluca. The collection is housed in the rooms of the cloister with the open chapel area serving as the main entrance. The oldest portion of the complex is the open chapel, which dates from the time when the structure began as a small mission. The chapel is integrated into a porteria (a porch like entrance or arcade) in the front of the building, which was added in the 1560s. The altarpiece of the chapel is recessed into the back wall which has a pediment and contains ten panels. The central figure is of the Archangel Michael, the original patron saint of the mission. Above him is a female saint, possibly Saint Clare, with archangels and luminaries of the Church on the surrounding panels. God, the Father looks down from the pediment with the Four Evangelists at the base. Mural of the genealogy of the Franciscan Order In a small room on the south end of the porteria is the original mission baptistery. Here is the first baptismal font, which is a huge monolithic basin cut from gray volcanic stone. The outside is carved with both Christian and indigenous symbols. Carved medallions illustrate episodes in Christ‚Äôs life, and there is a relief of the Archangel Michael casting Lucifer from heaven. The indigenous symbolism includes Aztec speech markers and pre-Hispanic water imagery. Encircling the cord rim is a Spanish and Nahuatl inscription which says, ‚ÄúThis baptismal font and the room in which it is found was mandated by the venerable guardian Fray Martin de Aguirre in the village of Zinacantepec in the year 1581.‚Äù This font is one of the most important pieces at the museum. Above the low main door into the cloister, there is a mural from the 16th century called the ‚ÄúTree of Life‚Äù which illustrates a genealogical tree of the Franciscan Order, growing from the chest of Francis of Assisi. Unlike many of the other frescos, this one contains various colors, including red and green accents, flesh tones and framed by bands of color. This murals as well as the font and the panels of the altarpieces were designed for the early evangelical efforts of the monastery. Inside the main entrance is a vestibule which leads to the main courtyard of the cloister. This area is plainer than the porteria, with only black and white 16th-century frescos adorning the walls and some gray gargoyles on the upper parts of the columns. Many of the frescos and gargoyles are now fragmentary. The cloister has two floors and courtyard surrounded by 20 arches supported by Tuscan columns. The ceilings are made from large wood beams and the floors are paved in local stone. On the north and south sides of the upper cloister there are two sundials. One is meant to be used in the summer and the other in winter. Antecoro or \\"Hall of the Viceroys\\" The cloister complex is now the Museo Virreinal de Zinacantepec (Viceregal Museum of Zinacantepec). It has twenty exhibition halls, with more than 275 works of art over the three centuries of the colonial period in Mexico. The collection also include more ordinary items such as cooking utensils, weapons, furniture and clay objects. The collection includes sixty paintings of viceroys and archbishops of New Spain, wood sculptures of religious figures, Spanish armour and a Christ figure made of ‚Äúpasta de cana‚Äù or meshed corn stalks. Most of the paintings have been classified an anonymous due to the lack of signatures. The museum is considered to have one of the most important colonial era collections in the state, along with the Ex Monastery of Acolman and the Museo Nacional del Virreinato in Tepotzotlan. More than 300 pieces of the collection were the subject of a major restoration project in 2003 at a cost of 500,000 pesos. Another important aspect of the museum is its library. This library contains 1,587 volumes about 43 subjects including theology, philosophy, law, history and others. The oldest book here is a copy of the Suma Teologia by Thomas of Aquinas. The books had been in the care of the Museum of Bellas Artes in Mexico City than the Municipal Library of Toluca before coming to Zinacantepec, The books have been available to academics since 2005. The bookshelves and some other furniture are original to the monastery. Municipality Nevado de Toluca and farmlands As municipal seat, the town of Zinacantepec is the local governing authority for more than 130 other named communities, which together form a territory of 308.68km2. About one third of the municipality‚Äôs population lives in the town proper. Despite its rural and traditional nature, very few speakers of indigenous languages are left. The municipality is bordered by the municipalities of Almoloya de Ju√°rez, Texcaltitl√°n, Toluca, Calimaya, Temascaltepec, Amanalco, Villa Guerrero and Coatepec Harinas. The dominating geographical feature here is the Nevado de Toluca volcano, with a significant part of the National Park being located in the municipality. Elevation here varies between 3,200 and 2750 meters above sea level and the soil is made of composites from past lava flows and ash deposits from the nearby volcano, which is now dormant. Some other smaller volcanoes exist here, such as the Molcajete, which were formed by the Nevado‚Äôs third stage of eruptions. Surface water is mostly in the form of the Tejalpa River, some small streams and some fresh water springs, all of which are fed by the runoff from the Nevado de Toluca. The area has a temperate, mildly wet climate with freezes common in the foothills of the volcano. Highs in the summer are around 28C with lows in the winter can get to ‚àí5C. Most rains falls between the months of June to October. Much of the wild vegetation is forest with pines, cedars and fir trees, which mostly exist in the national park, along with most of the wildlife, which includes squirrels, opossums, coyotes, eagles, crows and some snakes and other reptiles. Agriculture is still the main economic staple of the municipality, employing the vast majority of residents. Crops grown here include corn, potatoes, fava beans, carrots, spinach, onions, radishes and other vegetables, mostly grown on family farms. The raising of livestock is important here with cattle, pigs and sheep being the principle animals. A few haciendas still exist including the San Juan de la Huertas and the San Pedro Tajalpa, where Porfirio D√≠az and his wife spent time in its large mansion, which still exists. There is one small industrial zone which contains a number of industries with the largest being BIMBO, Coca-Cola and Gas CIMSA. Commerce is mostly limited to basic needs. There are sand and gravel mines such as San Juan de las Huertas and Loma Alta in the community of San Cristoba√± Tecolit.

It is commonly referred to as Foremarke Hall - the name given to the stately home (country house, manor house) of the manor of Foremark which is the main building of the school. It has a close relationship with its senior school, Repton School. Early history The prep school was founded in 1940 as a result of the drop of numbers and entries into Repton School- a result of travel inconvenience amidst uncertainties created in Britain during World War II which threatened the continuation of the Senior School. By establishing a junior section, it quickly guaranteed a secured number of students who were to enter Repton School for secondary education. The school appointed Mr. B.W. Thomas as its first Headmaster(1940‚Äì1947). The school used Repton premises- 'The Cross House' at first for convenience partly because there was insufficient time and funds to secure and set up a proper campus, but mostly because it was unnecessary - Repton School has a large campus. By the end of the war, there were more than a 100 boys attending the prep school. =Foremarke Hall= Following this expansion, a new campus was needed to offer the boys the accommodation they deserved, and such a site became available in 1947 - Foremarke Hall and surrounding buildings in the manor of Foremark. The country house was used as a Military Hospital during World War I and an Officer Cadet Training Unit during World War II. The army moved out in 1946 and Repton Prep settled in the new campus in 1947, leaving Mr. Thomas at Repton School, where he became Housemaster of Latham. Mr. Ken Jackson took over as the 2nd Headmaster(1947‚Äì1960), and the first to head the school in its new campus. The school rented the campus from the Church Commission, and purchased the free-hold of Foremarke Hall along with 40 acres of land (practically the entire manor-grounds) and 3 cottages in the Manor. Foremarke Hall (the Manor house) and its Annex do not house any academic departments; instead they contain two Boys' Boarding Houses, Heads of Boarding-Houses' accommodations, the Surgery & Sick Bay, the Headmaster & Secretaries' offices, the Staff Common Room and the School Library. The Annex holds a Flexible- Boarding house, a Games Room, the School Laundry as well as the Kitchen & Catering area. Departments The school's academic departments tend to have their own individual buildings like that of the faculties of Universities.

It is intended for improving reception where signals are weaker, including fringe reception areas, and on portable devices such as handheld televisions or mobile phones. It does not cause problems to older receivers, but they cannot take advantage of its features. E-VSB was approved by the ATSC committee in 2004. However, it has been implemented by few stations or manufacturers. For mobile applications, ATSC suffers significant signal degradation caused by the Doppler effect. Additionally, low-power handheld receivers are usually equipped with smaller antennas. These have a poor signal-to-noise ratio, which is disruptive to digital signals. The E-VSB standard provides for Reed-Solomon forward error correction to alleviate the data corruption caused by these issues. Additionally, the standard can use either the MPEG-4 AVC or VC-1 video codecs. As these codecs have higher video compression than the original MPEG-2, they require less bandwidth. As 8VSB lacks both link adaptation and hierarchical modulation of DVB, which would allow the SDTV part of an HDTV signal (or the LDTV part of SDTV) to be received even in fringe reception areas where signal strength is low, E-VSB yields a similar benefit. However, E-VSB places a significant processing overhead on the receiver, as well as a significant transmission overhead on the broadcaster's total bitrate. These are not a problem with DVB-H. A-VSB is a different and, , unapproved addition to ATSC, which is also designed to send programming to mobile devices, and to allow for single-frequency networks. It is one of several proposals for ATSC-M/H, the as-yet undecided standard for mobile broadcasting via ATSC.

It is the birthplace of the Vermont Republic and the Constitution of the State of Vermont. A mid-18th century building built in a simple Georgian architectural style, the Old Constitution House was originally called the Windsor Tavern, and belonged to Elijah West at the time of the signing of the constitution. The house is a Vermont State Historic Site, and is administered by the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation. It is also listed on National Register of Historic Places, separately since March 11, 1971 as well as a part of the Windsor Village Historic District since April 23, 1975. History The land presently identified as Vermont had multiple claims upon it in the 18th century. British Royal governors from New Hampshire and New York claimed portions of the area, and settlers from Connecticut and Massachusetts had claimed land and begun settlement. In 1764 British King George III ruled that New York had jurisdiction of the area, even though most of its settlement had taken place under New Hampshire-issued grants. Settlers faced continuing competing claims and demands for tax from both New Hampshire and New York, and exorbitant costs to transfer grants from New Hampshire to New York. The conflict continued and grew, and Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys formed a militia aligned primarily against the New York colony and its governor. In January 1777 representatives of the grants met in convention at Westminster. The convention declared its independence from all external forces, and adopted the name \\"New Connecticut.\\" The group reconvened on June 4, 1777 at Windsor, a letter by Dr. Thomas Young of Philadelphia, who supported the attempt of independence, was read. Young urged the adoption of the name \\"Vermont\\" and the creation of a constitution for Vermont. On July 2, 1777 a constitutional convention met in Windsor at Elijah West's tavern. A new constitution, taking inspiration from Benjamin Franklin's constitution for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, was drafted. This constitution went further than Pennsylvania's in establishing civil liberties. It became the first constitution in the new world to outlaw slavery and indentured servitude, it provided universal manhood suffrage without requirement of property ownership, and required the free education of its citizens, male and female, at public expense. The constitutional convention continued for several days, hammering out the distribution of powers, the rights of three co-equal branches of government, and the rights of the citizens. During this period the British, under Lieutenant General John Burgoyne captured Fort Ticonderoga, and Mount Independence. Settlers in Vermont's western towns were panicked and began to flee. The American forces in the form of the Continental Army slowed the British advance, giving the Green Mountain Boys time to respond in force. On the morning of July 8, 1777 news of the British advances had panicked the convention, several called for adjournment and suggested reconvening later. A violent thunderstorm with heavy downpour kept delegates in West's Tavern and the document was completed, and signed. The Vermont Republic was begun, and continued for fourteen years. In 1791 Vermont joined the federal union, becoming the first state admitted after the original thirteen. Preserving the Old Constitution House Elijah West's tavern was originally located near the center of town. It continued to function as a tavern until 1848 when it was converted to space for a store and light manufacturing. Around 1870 the house was moved to a side street and became a residential tenement. In 1890 the house was converted to a warehouse. In 1901 efforts to preserve the Old Constitution House began. In 1911 a group called the Old Constitution House Association was formed towards acquiring and restoring the house. Shortly after the house was donated by its owners, the Fay family, to the association, and property for the house's present location was given by William M. Evarts. By 1914 sufficient funds for the restoration had been raised, and work began under the direction of architect Sheldon Newton. The Old Constitution House Association continued to operate the house as a museum until 1961 when it transferred ownership to the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation. The house has been restored to approximate a tavern with period rooms showing a tavern room, dining room, tea parlor and guest rooms. Many of the historic items have been donated by descendants of the delegates and by the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The clips were usually video snippets that captured a crazy moment of ephemeral history, such as Ed McMahon drunk on The Tonight Show, an early live TV appearance by Frank Zappa playing the bicycle and other found instruments, or the famously disastrous Andy Kaufman appearance on Fridays. Often they were obscure cult favorites only circulated underground,\\"Film Listing: Found Footage Festival\\" The Austin Chronicle. Retrieved on 2008-11-18. such as Heavy Metal Parking Lot, the profane bloopers of an actor in a Winnebago sales video, or Corey Haim's Me, Myself, and I. Many other clips simply presented a zeitgeist gone by: a trailer for an Akira Kurosawa or Sam Peckinpah film, a Bill Hicks comedy set, or Bob Dylan appearing on the Johnny Cash show. Each clip was bracketed by skits and banter among hosts Charlie (always shown in a static headshot against a black background), Cinco (shown from the back at a sound console), and occasionally viewers who called in. Cinco, whose face is never shown on- air, had both a voice and a haircut similar to Howard Stern's -- this was never explained or commented on in the show, humorously creating the false impression that Cinco was Stern, slumming on local cable. \\"The 10-year-old kid\\" (Luke Adams) was a recurring caller who would tell a Bill Hicks joke every time he was on air. During a Christmas episode Adams went live on air with Charlie and took viewer calls. Later, Adams also performed live at the Alamo Drafthouse for a Show With No Name Clip Show. The show was enormously successful, given its small venue. It ran for 280 episodes over 8 years and won eight \\"Best of Austin\\" awards, as chosen by the editors and readers of The Austin Chronicle. It launched a series of popular live clip shows at the Alamo Drafthouse theater, including the memorable Raw, Uncensored and Totally Nude, which featured clips that the hosts deemed too controversial to air.Saito, Stephen. \\"Raw, Uncensored and Totally Nude\\" The Daily Texan, December 03, 2002.

Produced by Wolseley Motors Limited from 1930 to 1936, the Hornet was unveiled to the public at the end of April 1930. Wolseley had been bought from the receivers by William Morris in 1927. This car's tiny six-cylinder engine, Motor Sport magazine described it as a miniature six, reflected the brief vogue for less vibratory 6, 8, 12 and 16 cylinder engines soon superseded by greatly improved flexible engine mountings. Their overhead camshaft engines were so good that cars built on their Hornet Special chassis developed an outstanding reputation on the road and in club competition. The initial offering was something of a quart in a pint pot, tiny but powerful for its size. Furthermore, four passengers might be fitted into the very lightly constructed car. However the market soon required more room and more comfort and the car's nature changed. This was countered by making and selling the Special with a more highly tuned engine. The last Hornet was replaced, following acquisition of Wolseley by Morris Motors, with Morris's badge-engineered Wolseley 12/48, announced 24 April 1936. Bodies =1930= Initial offering Announced at the end of April 1930 ‚Äî though ownership was quite separate from Morris Motors ‚Äî the first Wolseley Hornet was in effect a 2-door 4-seater Morris Minor saloon fitted with an extended engine bay to make room for a small six-cylinder engine in place of the four-cylinder unit that was normal for this size of car. The new Hornet was supplied as an enclosed four-seater two-door saloon with coachbuilt body or, for ¬£10 less, fabric body; as an open two-seater or as a bare \\"rolling\\" chassis for the owner's choice of coachwork. Jarvis 1930, saloon's 5-stud wire wheels Revision In the autumn of 1930 the lack of body room and difficult access to the interior was recognised by Wolseley and new four-seater two-door coachwork was provided which was considerably longer and wider with wider doors. Sunshine roofs were now made available. Separate front bucket-type seats were adjustable and Wolseley claimed the back seat gave plenty of leg and headroom for two adults. The four windows slid open and had locking devices. Safety glass was fitted throughout.

One month before the Motor Show agents from all over the country were called to Birmingham to see the new Hornet four door saloon. A changed design for the engine's drive to the camshaft allowed a shorter engine which could now be placed further forward in the chassis and the bodywork could be more capacious. A silent third four-speed gearbox was added to the car's equipment. The Autocar published its road test on announcement day, 25 September 1931. Autocar's testers were pleased with the result of the engine being moved 8 inches (20 cm) forward, weight distribution was better and the ride more comfortable for all passengers, no tossing them about over appalling surfaces and no pitching at all. Weight and wind resistance were increased but at 64 miles per hour this car was faster than the last Hornet tested. The performance of the new third gear in the new four-speed gearbox was much admired. \\"Altogether the new Wolseley Hornet is a fascinating small car. It offers a very high degree of comfort and convenience, possesses an excellent performance, yet runs with complete refinement. It gives an extraordinary combination of economy and an ability to do all that the majority of owners can possibly require.\\" Page 537, The Autocar, 25 September 1931, Iliffe Press, London A 21st century reader might better understand the gear-changing difficulties of early motoring compounded by the lack of syncromesh gearboxes by reading this excerpt from that 1931 Autocar roadtest: \\"To obtain the best out of the car it is desirable to use the gearbox sensibly, and to change down early. . . . This is a matter of small consequence, for the reason that the gear change is extraordinarily easy to accomplish between top and third without paying much attention to the use of the accelerator pedal. All the same the gear change responds just as readily to the more orthodox style of handling, and a little practice with double-clutching and finding the right pauses soon gives a quiet mastery.\\" 1932 Occasional Four coup√© 1932 Occasional Four coup√© =1932= During 1932 Wolseley added two and four-seat coup√©s to the range. The display at Olympia was two four-door six-light saloons with soft leather upholstery and sliding roofs. Special chassis On 18 April 1932 a Special chassis with engine and other modifications was also made available but only as a chassis, at a cost of ¬£175 and it made for itself an enduring reputation. More information is provided below. =1933= New Hornets were shown at Olympia in the autumn beside the continuing 7 ft 6¬Ωins wheelbase four-door saloon and occasional four coup√© which were not fitted with freewheel but did have the quiet-third four-speed gearboxes with new syncromesh on all but first gear. Two new Hornets shown were: a four-door saloon and an occasional four on a new 7 ft 11ins wheelbase. The engines of the new cars had a single camshaft drive in place of the earlier two-stage chain drive. Propeller shaft universal joints were now metal in place of their fabric predecessors. On the freewheel cars the frame was now underslung at the rear. Automatic restarting of the engine was provided. Electric direction indicators were now built into the body pillars. =1934= A new form of gearbox was announced in the autumn of 1934, preselective with a finger- operated lever below the steering wheel. By the driver's left hand was a small additional lever which selected forward neutral or reverse. A standard type of clutch was operated by the first part of the pedal's travel. The rest of the travel changed the gears as preselected. A freewheel was provided on the indirect ratios though it could be locked out on second gear to provide engine-braking. New Hornet registered July 1935 =1935= New more powerful, roomy and pleasing in design Hornet (and Wasp) models with special easy clean wheels were shown to the motor trade at a Birmingham gathering on 29 April 1935. The range was rationalised to a standard saloon and coup√©. But six weeks later, in the middle of June, it was announced that W R Morris had sold Wolseley to Morris Motors and the transfer of ownership would take effect on 1 July 1935. So the 1935 Hornet saloon and coup√© were replaced just twelve months later by a badge-engineered Morris Twelve labelled Wolseley 12/48. Post mortem When launched in 1930 the Hornet came with a UK retail price of ¬£175 and could be seen as a competitively priced small saloon with unusually brisk performance but the saloon gained in overall weight and lost the well judged weight distribution that gave the early Hornets much of their market-place appeal. Wolseley engines At the beginning of the 1920s Wolseley had been UK's largest motor manufacturer, over-expansion had been the downfall of the owners of the business but Wolseley retained considerable technical expertise. One result was the very successful overhead camshaft six- cylinder engine sold in this car. Wolseley Aero Engines Limited was formed around 1931 specifically to separate out and capitalise on this expertise. When Wolseley Motors Limited was transferred to Morris Motors Limited on 1 July 1935 this part of its business was set aside by W. R. Morris (Lord Nuffield) and put in the ownership of a newly incorporated company, Wolseley Aero Engines Ltd, and remained his personal property. It later became Nuffield Mechanizations Limited. William Morris began to capitalise on Wolseley's products with the 847 cc Wolseley designed engine he put in his 1928 Morris Minor. The Hornet engine can be viewed as a 1928-design Morris Minor engine with two more cylinders. A re-design of both engines by Morris engines branch led to a less costly product for the Morris range, a side-valve replacement for the two-seater Morris Minor at first called the Morris Minor S.V. and announced at Christmas-time 1930. The Minor's OHC engine continued in production for the rest of the Minor range, lastly in the Morris Family Eight. The full Minor range was replaced by the side-valve 918cc Morris Eight range announced in late August 1934. A 1378cc side-valve version of the 6-cylinder was used in the Morris Ten Six announced in August 1933. =Hornet engines= =1930= The new car was given a small (1271cc) six-cylinder engine with a single overhead camshaft. The overhead camshaft followed the Wolseley custom begun by their 2-litre 16/45 6-cylinder engine announced in September 1926 ‚Äî just before the change of ownership. Initial offering's thermostatically controlled radiator shutters =1931= For the new four-door saloon announced in September 1931 the engine was modified to make it shorter and it was moved forwards on its chassis. The dynamo had been moved from in front to the side of the engine and the drive to the camshaft was now by two-stage chain instead of by the dynamo and spiral bevel gears. Meanwhile the same basic design, but with the original vertical dynamo, was supplied by Wolseley to MG (which was also at this time owned by William Morris but not as part of the Morris Motors empire). The nearest match to the 1932 Hornet Special was the MG F-type, although the chassis details were less similar, as the Hornet had hydraulic brakes while the MG had cable operation. =1934= To match the new body the engine grew to 1378 cc by lengthening its stroke from 83mm to 90mm yet it remained a 12 hp engine for tax purposes. Hornet Special chassis were made available with the same long stroke and with a larger bore ‚Äî increased from 57mm to 61.5mm ‚Äî and a swept area of 1604 cc. This enlarged engine was from Wolseley's New Fourteen. MG engines MG Magnette Airline Coup√© powered by a 1271cc Wolseley Hornet 6 This engine was also used in the MG F-type and MG L-type Magnas, and MG K-type and MG N-type Magnettes and a side- valve version in Morris cars. Brakes suspension steering Steering is by worm and wheel, both back and front springs are half elliptical controlled by Luvax hydraulic dampers, Lockheed hydraulic brakes are fitted on all four wheels. The standard specification includes twelve volt lighting, electrically operated dip and switch headlamps and combined stop and tail lamps, single wiper with provision for a second blade, chrome finish on all bright parts, petrol gauge, bumpers etc. There is a concealed spare wheel under a metal cover on the back panel and a fold-down luggage grid. Although from September 1931 the saloon was supplied with a four-speed gear box the two-door cars remained available but with three-speed gearboxes. Saloon road test =1933= The Times correspondents commented in early 1933: \\"the car has a large body space for its wheelbase with its engine well forward and body taken considerably behind the rear axle and good leg elbow and head room had been provided within it. . . . The large windscreen might open farther. . . . The scuttle can be ventilated, the front seat is adjustable. Below the temperature indicator on the radiator there is an illuminated name badge. The engine was fairly quiet, . . . though third is there to be used. Change-speed actions were normal though a little care was needed to avoid scrape, second gear could have been quieter. The suspension allows too much movement at the back. . . . This Wolseley Hornet is a smart-looking car.\\" =1935= new Hornet saloon May 1935 The car is now more powerful and roomier and its anatomically correct squabs and pneumatic cushions hold four comfortably. At the back the floor has no footwells, the wheels arches are wide, . . . \\"the car tested might well have had ventilators in the scuttle\\". On the road \\"gear changes are not difficult to make, . . . second might be rather quieter. . . . a little care should be taken to come out of a sharp turn at high speed . . . (possibly) . . . large extra low pressure tyres. . . . the front suspension would perhaps be better without any camber. A passenger behind with only two aboard is apt to feel some fore and aft motion not felt in front. Special easy-clean partly disc wheels are fitted.\\" Duke of Gloucester The Times reported the Duke of Gloucester had taken delivery of a 1934 saloon model Wolseley Hornet, earlier examples of which he had had for the past two years. The Duke specially commented on two features, the syncromesh gearbox and the enclosed spare wheel.

The first with Hornet's 1271cc engine, the last with a Wolseley Fourteen 1604cc engine. They were sometimes referred to as Special Speed chassis. Saloon and Tickford coup√© as well as sporting bodies were fitted. Later cars had a large S mounted on the radiator cap with a small H for hornet in its lower section, the S shaped to be like a striking snake or a preening swan. =1271cc engine= The new Special chassis was announced 18 April 1932. It had twin carburettors, higher compression (domed pistons) and numerous smaller modifications including a revised exhaust system (triple-piped manifold ‚Äî2 inch pipe to the straight-through silencer), duplex valve springs, metal universal joints in the propeller shaft, three inches wider front track and specially large 12-inch brake drums. The long flexible gear-lever was replaced by a remote control and a small short-travel lever. Special front (3 inches wider track at 3\\" 9\\") and rear axles were supplied with the saloon's large-hub stud-fixed Magna wire-wheels. Small knock-on hubs in Rudge-Whitworth wheels were optional and usually preferred. A particularly large speedometer (a quick-reading five inch dial), matching engine revolution counter, and ten inch headlights were supplied as part of the complete kit for the coachbuilder. The large headlights were supported by braced mountings included in the kit. In the autumn of 1933 to improve its breathing the engine was given a cross-flow head with inlet and exhaust manifolds on opposing sides. The block casting was redesigned to increase its stiffness and the Special received the long wheelbase underslung chassis and other modifications of the saloon including freewheel. The Special chassis was supplied to various specialist coachbuilders particularly Swallow, Whittingham & Mitchel, Jensen and, now also part of the Morris group, Cunard. 2307 were made.

They were the first 6-cylinder Swallows, production began in January 1931 with an open 2-seater. A 4-seater car followed in that autumn. In April 1932 the new Special chassis arrived and these cars were quite popular. They were the last of the special- bodied Swallows, replaced in the summer of 1933 by their SS1 tourer first announced in March 1933. :Production: * Special Hornets: 2-seaters ‚Äî 21; 4-seaters ‚Äî 185 * standard Hornets: 2-seaters ‚Äî 100+; 4-seaters ‚Äî 224 (the quantity of 2-seaters made in the first part of 1931 is unknown) Advertising slogan for the Wolseley Hornet-Swallow cars: \\"The Swallow touch that means so much\\". =Eustace Watkins= A late 1934 car, 1604cc centre-lock wire wheels London and suburbs sole Wolseley distributor, Eustace Watkins Limited, designed and sourced their own E W Specials probably from Abbey.

Sir Malcolm, holder of the World's Land Speed Record, reported that the Daytona, one of the latest Hornet Specials was fitted with a sporting two / four seater body. The car's 1271cc engine was fitted with twin S.U. carburetters and he wrote it was pleasing to see particular attention had been paid to cooling and cleaning the engine oil. The motor was designed to turn at speeds up to 5,000 rpm which could be very quickly achieved in third gear. The maximum speed in top was in the region of 75 mph. Extra large 12 inch brake drums were fitted. Either Rudge Whitworth or Magna wheels were supplied. The front seats were reported to be comfortable with ample leg room for the tallest driver though the back seat could not be recommended for two people on a long run it was ideal for luggage protected from rain by a tonneau cover. Mudguards were of the cycle type and added to the appearance of the car. \\"The engine is very near perfection . . . lively, vibrationless and exceedingly quiet, does its work without fuss or bother, quickly reaches 5,000 rpm and a road speed in third gear over 60 mph.\\" \\"Steering is light, brakes are powerful and work smoothly and the suspension is good . . . when the gears are judiciously used the acceleration is really amazing.\\" However, Sir Malcolm regarded the clutch and brake pedals to be much too small and smoothly surfaced. He also regretted there was no external adjustment to the hydraulic shock absorbers which he considered necessary when dealing with such a light and fast little car. Sir Malcolm summed up with: \\"This car is really a most attractive proposition. Its acceleration is so good that it would take a really powerful and well-tuned car to keep on its heels, and its upkeep is low.\\"page 13, The Western Morning News and Daily Gazette - Saturday 2 July 1932 References Notes External links * A wonderful collection of reliable information, brochures, images, road tests etc at Pre-war Minor * 1933 brochure * Wolseley Hornet Special Club * Video with Hornet sound * Conceptcarz shows a beautiful 1932 Hornet Special, many pictures Hornet Category:1930s cars Category:Cars introduced in 1930 ","title":"Wolseley Hornet six"},{"id":"10482158","text":"Samuel Kofi Woods (born January 5, 1964) is a Liberian human rights activist, journalist, politician and academic.

While on a visit to London in 1783‚Äì4, she approached Samuel Johnson to request his advice about publishing a manuscript collection of poems.

He put the station on air with the help of Olivet College professors, Robert C. Fisher and Willis \\"Bill\\" Seldon and the eventual second general manager and student, Michael Oyster. A new transmitter a few years later took WOCR up to 125 watts of power until October 2010, WOCR operated on 89.7 with 125 watts of power. In certain areas the station would interfere with the signal of 89.7 WLNZ in Lansing; the frequency shift to 89.1 has alleviated this issue.

Some ships were fitted with six- or three-pounder guns in lieu of the twelve-pounder. Construction and career Following commissioning, Abingdon served with the Aegean Squadron. She remained part of the Aegean Squadron in November 1919, but by January 1920 she was listed as being paid off, although still part of the Mediterranean Fleet. From 1920-1935 she was held in reserve at Malta, then joined the 2nd Minesweeping Flotilla in Malta and Hong Kong. Sweeping was routine until January 1941 when the German Junkers 87s and 88s arrived. Abingdons captain, Lieutenant Graham Simmers, explains: Abingdon was attacked while sweeping, but the ship's slow sweeping speed and steady course seemed to throw the Junkers 87 pilots, as they only scored near-misses; but the Fermoy, bombed while in the dockyard, was a complete write-off. Graham Simmers describes the end of the ship's career: This continued until 5 April 1942 when Abingdon, while in Kalkara Creek for repairs, was near-missed by two bombs which broke her back. Lieutenant Simmers had her towed out to Bighi Bay, where she was beached and abandoned. The ship was broken up in 1950.

The prototype had the R-2800 engine, but it could take the intended R-4360 powerplant. After a dismal set of test results, the XA-32 did not enter production. Design and development Brewster Aeronautical Corporation's F2A Buffalo won the first Navy monoplane fighter competition over Grumman's entry. The company continued to design and produce lackluster aircraft, and the XA-32, despite a sound layout, became a compendium of management-induced faults. Missing production deadline dates and constant changes to the design jeopardized a promising design (at least on paper). Initially designed in 1941, the XA-32 was grossly overweight, at almost , similar to the Douglas A-20 Havoc. The drag induced by its bulbous shape was amplified by careless detail design, which left it festooned with bumps and lumps. One disastrous characteristic was that the exhaust scoops that ringed the cowling nearly blinded the test pilots during night flying; the backfiring at low power settings resulted in flames engulfing the nose of the aircraft. Even with the Pratt & Whitney R-2800, the XA-32 was underpowered and an attempt to re-engine the aircraft with the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major was unsuccessful. Testing The first flight of the XA-32 prototype was not until May 22, 1943, two years after the design was proposed; and almost every aspect of performance fell short of the specifications. Devoid of weapons load, the XA-32 could only reach and although handling was adequate, as soon as armament and external stores were added, the performance dropped drastically and more seriously, the disturbed airflow \\"set up severe buffeting at its top speed.\\"McCullough 1995, p. 18. The firm was in such management shambles that it drew the wrath of Congress and actually went out of the aircraft manufacturing business following the debacle of the XA-32. Only two examples were built, the XA-32 (S/N 42-13568) and XA-32A ( S/N 42-13569), both of which were scrapped at the conclusion of flight testing.

The last test flown was to certify the plane's takeoff capability with a single engine failure. It was the first fatal accident involving an Airbus A330 as well as the first hull loss of the type. It remained the only fatal accident involving an A330 until the crash of Air France Flight 447 on .  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was an Airbus A330-321, registration F-WWKH, c/n 42. Equipped with twin Pratt & Whitney PW4164 powerplants, it first flew on . The aircraft was days old at the time of the accident. The aircraft belonged to Thai Airways International and was being flight-tested under agreement with the owner. Airbus Industrie already owed Thai Airways compensation for the hull loss of another plane it had damaged during testing in December 1993.  Test objectives  The objective of the flight was to test the performance of the aircraft in simulated engine failures after takeoff, which meant throttling down one of the aircraft's engines to idle and switching off a hydraulic circuit. During most of the tests, the aircraft's autopilot would be set to fly the plane to an altitude of . The particular test that led to the crash flew in a configuration with the plane's center of gravity near its aft limit, achieved by carrying tons of water in bladders in the rear of the aircraft's cabin. The captain was Airbus chief test pilot Nick Warner. The co-pilot was Michel Cais, an Air Inter training captain who had been working with the Airbus training organization Aeroformation. A flight test engineer, Jean-Pierre Petit, was on board as the third member of the crew. Airbus management was interested in promoting the plane to potential customers, and did not perceive the test to be hazardous, so they invited four passengers on the plane: two Airbus executives (Philippe Tournoux and Keith Hulse), and two Alitalia pilots, and , who were in Toulouse for a commercial training programme at the Airbus headquarters.  Crash  The aircraft had just successfully completed a landing, after the captain had performed two simulated engine loss go-arounds, taking a total of 55 minutes. The second takeoff would be made with the aircraft's center of gravity located in an extreme aft position. This time the aircraft was flown by the co-pilot, while the actions to shut off the engine and hydraulic circuit, and engage the autopilot, were carried out by the captain. The takeoff was completed successfully and the captain shut off the engine and hydraulic circuit. Three attempts were needed to engage the autopilot and the aircraft started to ascend to 2000 ft. The aircraft climbed too steeply, decreasing airspeed to , below the minimum 118 knots required to maintain control. The aircraft started to roll, so the crew reduced power on the operating engine to counter the thrust asymmetry. This exacerbated the problem and the aircraft pitched down 15 degrees and soon after crashed into the ground. All seven people on board were killed, and the aircraft was destroyed.  Investigation  The crash was investigated by a commission of enquiry within the Direction G√©n√©rale de l'Armement (DGA), the French Government Defense procurement and technology agency responsible for investigating flight test accidents. The commission found the crash was due to \\"a combination of several factors, no one of which, in isolation, would have caused the crash.\\" These included: * Captain Warner's fatigue after a \\"punishingly busy day\\" which had included an A321 demonstration flight, supervision of a simulator session, and two meetings, including a press briefing; * Lack of a complete pre-flight briefing, caused by Warner's schedule, and possible complacency caused by success of the testing through the previous takeoff; * Choice of maximum takeoff/go-around (TOGA) thrust rather than the slightly lower \\"Flex 49\\" setting, which caused higher than planned thrust asymmetry during the simulated left engine failure; * Choice of trim setting at 2.2¬∞ nose-up; although within acceptable limits, this was inappropriate for the extreme aft CG configuration flown. * Autopilot inadvertently left set at altitude capture from the previous test; * Absence of attitude protection in the autopilot's altitude capture mode; * Uncertainty in allocation of tasks between the captain and co-pilot; the co-pilot rotated the aircraft \\"firmly and very fast\\" to a takeoff attitude of more than 25¬∞, compared with the usual 14.5¬∞ used for the first, successful takeoff; * The captain carried out test procedures immediately after takeoff: autopilot engage, throttling back the left engine, and tripping the hydraulic circuit breaker; this took him temporarily \\"out of the piloting loop.\\" * Lack of visual indication of autopilot mode, obscured by the extreme pitch attitude; * Crew overconfidence in expected aircraft response; * Delayed reaction of the test engineer to changes in flight parameters, particularly airspeed; * Captain's slowness in reacting to the development of an abnormal situation.

It was located in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia), while the first federal armory was the Springfield Armory located in Springfield, Massachusetts. In many books, the town is called \\"Harper's Ferry\\" with an apostrophe.For example, Horace Greeley, The American Conflict: A History of the Great Rebellion in the United States of America, 1860‚Äì64. Volume: 1. (1866), p. 279; French Ensor Chadwick, Causes of the Civil War, 1859‚Äì1861 (1906) p. 74; James M. McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (1988), p. 201; Stephen W.

Harpers Ferry National Armory was both an armory and an arsenal. Both Harpers Ferry and Springfield armories were instrumental in the development of machining techniques to make interchangeable parts. History =Harpers Ferry= Robert Harper founded the community of Harpers Ferry in the mid-18th century. Robert Harper was born in 1718 in Oxford Township near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Since he was a builder, Harper was asked by a group of Quakers in 1747 to build a meeting house in the Shenandoah Valley near the present site of Winchester, Virginia.Photo of the Week: Natural Beauty and National History Converge in Harpers Ferry.

Attracted and amazed by the ample latent waterpower that resided in the rivers and by the strategic location for travel and transport, Harper obtained a patent for of the land in 1751. He built a ferry to cross the Shenandoah River to help pioneers reach their destination in the new western lands. After the creation of the ferry, more people were attracted to the area and it became a destination with flourishing businesses. =The national armory= In 1794, the United States Congress passed a bill calling \\"for the erecting and repairing of Arsenals and Magazines\\". President George Washington, given wide latitude in carrying out this order, selected Harpers Ferry, then a part of Virginia, for the location of the Harpers Ferry National Armory. In 1796, the United States government purchased a parcel of land from the heirs of Robert Harper. Subsequently, in 1799, construction began on the national armory. Three years later, mass production of military arms commenced. Firearms and cannons are heavy and needed ready access to river and then railroad transportation. The fuel needs of the foundery meant additional heavy shipments. The Armory was located in Harpers Ferry because it was geographically central and during the Antebellum period, at the center of the country's rail network. The only bridge across the Potomac River that could carry a heavy load‚Äîfor part of this perood, the only rail link between eastern cities and Ohio and the \\"west\\"‚Äîwas the Baltimore and Ohio railroad bridge at Harpers Ferry. The national armory at Harpers Ferry was actually the second national armory. The first was the Springfield Armory, constructed in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1794 after Congress approved the bill to create the nation's first national armory. Upon its grand opening, the armory's size seemed inadequate for a work force. It consisted of only one room, and the workers numbered a mere twenty-five. Nevertheless, the armory produced many muskets, rifles, and later pistols for the United States. Between 1821‚Äì1830 the armory produced 11,855 arms. Each decade after that, production declined.Bellesiles, Michael A. \\"The Origins of Gun Culture in the United States, 1760‚Äì1865\\". The Journal of American History, vol. 83, no. 2, 1996, pp. 425‚Äì455. has, . The building relied on river power to drive the armory's machinery. Expansion and upgrades Gun smithing equipment on display at Harpers Ferry National Historical Park In 1844, the deficient state of the armory was taken into account and demand for military equipment increased, and so the renovation and expansion of the armory was undertaken. The upgrades of the arsenal began in 1845‚Äì1854 with the construction of seven brand new workshops and the installation of 121 new machines. The new workshops had a brick superstructure with iron framing and slanted sheet metal roofing. These reconstructed arsenal buildings became collectively known as the \\"U.S. Musket Factory\\". The armory canal was enlarged so that more water could get to the armory, which meant it would receive more power. Along with the enlargement of the canal, seven new water turbines were installed. The upgrades formed a well-integrated functional unit that improved the flow of work from one stage of production to the next.Smith, Merrit Roe Harpers Ferry Armory and the New Technology: The Challenge of Change. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York, 1977. All the expansions of the armory were done on heavy stone foundations and included cast-iron framing in the general style of \\"factory Gothic\\" architecture. In addition, more people were employed to work at the armory than before: the labor force increased from a minuscule twenty-five in 1802 to about four hundred workers in 1859. Furthermore, the working conditions improved, but only slightly. John Brown's raid In 1859, the armory became the site of the famous seizure by abolitionist John Brown, which, while unsuccessful in inciting a slave revolt, helped precipitate the American Civil War and the eventual emancipation of slaves in the United States. During the Civil War D. H. Strother. Harpers Ferry in 1865, looking east (downstream); the ruins of the musket factory can be seen in the center While Virginia was still in the union, the armory regularly shipped manufactured weapons and material throughout the United States. However, once the Civil War began, the national armory became a vital control point for both the Confederates and the Union. Close to the beginning of the war on April 18, 1861, just a day after Virginia's conventional ratification of secession, Union soldiers, outnumbered and deprived of reinforcements, set fire to their own armory in an attempt to thwart the usage of it by an advancing Virginian Confederate militia numbering 360 men in all. Harpers Ferry residents (many of whom made their living off the armory) were able to put out the fires swiftly enough to save most of the armory's weapon-making machinery. After rescuing the equipment, the Confederates shipped it south by rail to Winchester, Virginia. The South had virtually no small-arms production and an inadequate supply of raw materials. The machinery taken from Harpers Ferry became the foundation of the Confederate arms manufacturing. Two weeks later, the Confederates abandoned Harpers Ferry. The Southern forces confiscated what was left in the armory and burned the rest of the remaining armory buildings. They also blew up the railroad bridge of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, but returned in two weeks to destroy the Rifle Works and a bridge that crossed the Shenandoah river. =The armory's strategic location= During the Civil War, the armory became a site of great strategic importance because it was located very close to the Mason-Dixon line, or the border between the free and the slave-holding states. Consequently, the Union used it as an effective means to supply troops with weapons quickly as they marched into battle. The downside to being on the border was that the armory could easily change hands and fall into Confederate control ‚Äì the town of Harpers Ferry changed hands at least eleven times during the Civil War. Aftermath of the Civil War Overlooking the U.S. Armory (Musket Factory) archaeology site (NPS Photo/Hammer) After the Civil War, John Brown's Fort was the only building to survive the destruction wrought upon it by the Confederates and the Union. The building was named after John Brown for his notorious raid on the Harpers Ferry Armory in 1859. The building was the armory's fire engine and guard house. Due to the degree of damage to the armory during the Civil War, the U.S. government decided not to re-establish the armory at Harpers Ferry, instead focusing the quickly developing areas west of the Mississippi River. Today the site is mostly covered by railroad track embankments.  See also  * Harpers Ferry Model 1803 Rifle * M1819 Hall rifle * M1841 Mississippi rifle * John H.

One of the constraints of conventional ATSC transmission is that reliable reception is difficult or impossible when the receiver is moving at speeds associated with normal vehicular traffic. The technology was jointly developed by Samsung and Rohde & Schwarz. A-VSB builds on the existing ATSC transmission standard to enhance DTV receivers‚Äô ability to receive the main MPEG transport stream in dynamic environments. The system enables broadcasters to include multiple streams with additional error correction and time diversity encoding for enhanced reception. In addition, A-VSB facilitates synchronization of multiple transmission towers, which should improve coverage with higher uniform signal strength throughout a service area, even in locations that normally would be shielded by obstacles such as hills or buildings. A-VSB incorporates three new elements: a Supplementary Reference Signal (SRS), a Scalable Turbo Stream (STS), and support for Single Frequency Networks (SFN).  Supplementary Reference Signal  A-VSB receivers utilize the SRS in order to remain synchronized with the transmission. This helps maintain reception of the main stream and any turbo streams even with rapidly changing multipath interference, such as when the signal is reflected from moving objects near the receiver or when the receiver itself is moving. The SRS adds an additional equalizer training sequence to the Transport Stream Adaptation Field, which should be ignored by existing transport decoders. The added signal shortens the existing 24ms equalizer update time by a selectable factor, from 120x to 312x. A receiver equipped with this new equalizer can track rapid multipath fading, and thus supports mobile reception. SRS can be used alone, without the STS, offering a slight improvement in portable (stationary‚Äînot true mobile) service.  Scalable Turbo Stream  The addition of a new turbo-coded stream enables broadcasters to increase the error-correction capability of a secondary stream transmission. Two options are proposed for the turbo stream: ¬Ω and ¬º rate codes, i.e., the new video stream requires 2x or 4x the video rate in final transport payload. The new Threshold of Visibility (TOV) SNRs are 9.6 and 4.5 dB, respectively; 1.6dB is claimed with diversity reception. Conventional 8VSB has a TOV SNR of 15.1 dB. The turbo codec uses single-input single-output (SISO) iterative decoding and time interleaving.  Single Frequency Networks  The last option‚ÄîSFN‚Äîis made possible by adding a VSB Frame Initialization Packet (VFIP) that synchronizes the transport frame sequences to a GPS reference.

Expulsion of Muslims On November 25, 1525 Charles I of Spain issued an edict ordering the expulsions or conversions of remaining Muslims in the Crown of Aragon. Though the option of exile was available on paper, in practice it was almost impossible. In order to leave the realm, a Muslim would have had to obtain documentation from Siete Aguas on Aragon's western border, then travelled inland across the entire breadth of Castile and embark by sea in A Coru√±a in the northwest coast.
