Biography His father, Charles, was a New York optician who sold optical devices and stereopticons. George joined the family firm, and in 1893 moved to Chicago. There he set up the Kleine Optical Company. Later, in 1896, the company started selling film-making equipment. In 1899, the company obtained an exclusive arrangement with Thomas Edison to sell his film and equipment in the Chicago area. In 1903, Kleine started distributing Biograph films as well as European films and was one of the first to start renting films out to theatres. He became involved in patent disputes with Thomas Edison in 1908, causing members of the industry to establish the Motion Picture Patents Company. He founded Kalem Company, an American film studio in New York City in 1907 with Samuel Long, and Frank J. Marion. The company was named for their initials, K, L, and M. Kleine was involved in the company for only a short period of time; however, it was a profitable investment for him, as his partners were soon successful enough to buy out his shares at a considerable premium. Kleine was a national distributor of silent movies in the 1910s, a notable example being Essanay Studios 1918 film, “Men Who Have Made Love to Me” starring Mary MacLane. Kleine retired in 1928 and died in Los Angeles, California, in 1931. His papers are retained by the Library of Congress.

Geneviève inherited the majority of unsold paintings of Gustave Caillebotte.

Based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the magazine ran from November/December 1984 to March/April 1988, publishing 21 issues. James R. Oestreich was its editor-in-chief. Historical Times, Inc., of Harrisburg was its owner. Warren Bertram Syer (1923–2007), who had published High Fidelity for 30 years, was then the president of Historical Times.Enjoy a Tuesday Musical Bonus, Seattle Daily Times, pg. D 13, November 1, 1984  History  Music critics depart from High Fidelity In 1983, most of the senior music critics at High Fidelity and Musical America -- including Harris Goldsmith (1935-2014), (Stanley) Dale Harris (1928–1996), Andrew Porter, Will Crutchfield, Paul Henry Lang, Allan Kozinn, Peter G. Davis (born 1936), Kenneth (A.) Furie (born 1949), David Peter Hamilton (born 1935), Robert P. Morgan (born 1934), and Conrad L. Osborne (born 1934) -- resigned in protest over a reduction of autonomy for their music editor, James Oestreich, who had been informed by the parent that the classical music section was going to be reduced to eight pages by January 1984, and further reduced to one or two pages by December 1984. In 1983, the average issue devoted 18 pages to classical music. On behalf of the parent company, ABC Leisure Magazines of ABC Publishing, William (Bill) Tynan explained that they were going to \\"blend lengthy classical features into its highly acclaimed Musical America,\\" a slim magazine sewn into the centerfold of selected issues of High Fidelity and available only by subscription. Musical America, at the time, had a circulation of about 20,000 subscribers. High Fidelity had a circulation of nearly 400,000. Tynan said that High Fidelity's average reader \\"no longer prefers the lengthy classical music articles that have appeared as part of the previous format.\\"Music Editor Dismissed, The New York Times, October 5, 1984 Founding of Opus A year later (1984), many of those critics became the core review staff for a start-up classical record magazine Opus, with Jim Oestreich as editor. Historical Times, Inc., of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the parent. Success of Opus During the planning stage, Warren Bertram Syer, its publisher, designed a five-year business strategy, projecting non- profitability in years one through three, breakeven in year four, and profit in year five. It turned out that Opus became profitable in its fourth year.Allan Kozinn, Critic's Notebook; Classical Music Magazine As Endangered Species, The New York Times, April 15, 1991 Opus is acquired by Cowles Media In December 1987, Historical Times - the company that published Opus - was acquired by larger firm, Cowles Media Company. Cowles Media sells Opus to ABC Publishing -- critical staff resigns, again Despite being marginally profitable, Cowles regarded Opus as too marginal to maintain. James Gordon Keough (born 1946), who was appointed president of Cowles Media in 1987, made the decision to put Opus up for sale. He said that, while Opus was probably the best-written of the company's magazines, it \\"didn't fit strategically with the rest of our publications.\\" Historical Times had been printing mostly history and outdoor magazines. In December 1987, Opus had a circulation of 25,000, one-fourth of corporation's next smallest magazine, British Heritage.Michael Kimmelman, The Tempo Is Changing for Music Magazines, The New York Times, December 20, 1987 In June 1988, Cowles Media sold Opus to Capital Cities/ABC -- which was still the parent of High Fidelity as well as Musical America. The critics and editors of Opus, including James Oestreich, all of whom had broken away from High Fidelity in 1983, resigned again. Cessation as a free-standing publication The 21st issue (March/April 1988) was the final free-standing publication of Opus. Following the acquisition, Opus was absorbed by Musical America, debuting in its July 1988 issue. Theodore (Ted) W. Libbey, Jr. (born 1951), then the classical music editor of High Fidelity, became senior editor of the new Opus section. Patricia Reilly, who formerly edited Musical America's Recordings in Review, became the associate editor of the new Opus section. Shirley Fleming (1929–2005) continued as editor-in-chief of Musical America.Howard Reich , Musical Chairs in Publishing, Chicago Tribune, June 12, 1988 The words \\"incorporating Opus\\" added to Musical America's masthead was, according to Allan Kozinn, somewhat misleading, given the resignation of its core staff and editors.  Purpose: classical music advocacy  Because Opus was founded by classical music journalists, it was a cause as much as it was a magazine. Besides shorter reviews, Richard Taruskin freely wrote as many as 60 pages on Beethoven symphony recordings, and Allan Kozinn wrote 82 pages on the state of the classical record business. Will Crutchfield and Conrad Osborne published a running debate about vocal style.

In 2003, he was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists. Background Aboubakr Jamai is the son of Khalid Jamaï, was a well-known journalist who often clashed with King Hassan II and was imprisoned and tortured in 1973. His mother, Badia Berraoui, is a French Linguistic who worked at the ISESCO, Islamic World Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization and was chief of staff of Abdelhadi Boutaleb, King's Hassan II advisor. He is also the grand son of Abouchitaa Jamai, a Moroccan resistant, a founder of the Istiqlal (Independence) party and signatory of Morocco's Independence Manifesto. After he graduated at the ISCAE, He co-founded Upline Securities, in 1993, Morocco's first independent investment bank conducting the first privatization IPO in Morocco. In 1993, he co-founded Upline Securities, Morocco's first independent investment bank. He also joined the Executive Secretariat of the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit as a financial adviser in 1996. At age 29, he moved into financial journalism, co-founding the Casablanca-based Le Journal Hebdomadaire, a French-language news weekly magazine, in 1997. As a model, Jamaï used the Spanish paper El País because of the way it had started as a weekly paper under Francisco Franco's rule before growing into a media conglomerate. The journal's circulation was initially small, with the first issue selling only 3,000 copies, primarily to a business audience. However, the journal soon grew by word-of-mouth, attracting a non-business audience and attracting more advertisers. In 1998, Jamaï co-founded its Arabic-language sister publication, Assahifa al-Ousbouiya, designed to appeal to a broader audience. In 1999, Aboubakr Jamaï received an MBA from Said Business School at the University of Oxford. In 2007 Jamai was forced into exile and had to resign as the publisher of both \\"Le Journal Hebdomadaire\\" and \\"Assahifa al- Ousbouiya\\". In May 2008, he earned a Master in Public Administration at Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University. He taught Contemporary Politics in the Middle East at the University of San Diego for a year and then move to Spain where he worked as an independent consultant. He is currently living in south of France since 2014 where he is Dean of the Business School and International Relations at the IAU College. Conflict with Mohammed VI government On 23 July 1999, Hassan II died, and his son Mohammed VI succeeded him to the throne, raising hopes for democratic reform. Jamaï's papers were critical of Mohamed VI's reign, particularly of his slowness in transforming Morocco into a constitutional democracy. As a result of the critical editorials printed by the papers, Moroccan printers soon refused to do business with them, forcing Jamaï to print in France and pay enormous transportation costs. In April 2000, Le Journal carried an interview with Muhammad Abdelaziz, leader of the Saharawi separatist movement Polisario Front that was fighting for the independence of Western Sahara from Morocco. The Moroccan Ministry of Communications responded by banning both Le Journal and Assahifa Al Ousbouia, though the latter had not run the interview in question. A Ministry spokesperson stated that the reasons for the papers' banning were \\"excesses in [their] editorial line concerning the question of Morocco's territorial integrity\\" and \\"collusion with foreign interests\\". Following an outcry from foreign governments and NGOs the papers were allowed to re-open. The conflict with the government won Jamaï's papers publicity and popular credibility. Which made advertising revenues increase substantially during the following months. In November, however, the paper reprinted a letter implicating a number of socialist politicians, including then-Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi, in a 1972 assassination plot against Hassan II. The papers were once again banned. At the January 2001 Congress of the International Federation for Human Rights in Casablanca, Jamaï took the podium to announce to the applause of the delegates that he would go on a hunger strike until his papers were unbanned. Following another round of international protest—including a question about the banning from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on the occasion of Youssoufi's state visit to Germany—the government relented, and the papers were once more allowed to print. In 2006, in its reporting on the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy—in which a Danish newspaper published several cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad, triggering widespread anger in the Muslim world --Le Journal published a blacked-out version of one of the cartoons. The newspaper's offices were then the target of a series of protests, which Jamaï alleges were orchestrated by the national government. Binaissa defamation suit At the time of the papers' first banning in April 2000, Foreign Minister Mohamed Benaissa filed a defamation lawsuit against Jamaï and another editor of his papers, Ali Amar, for a 1999 series of articles alleging that he had profited from the sale of an official residence during his tenure as Ambassador to the United States. Jamaï later speculated that Benaissa \\"was waiting for a signal\\" to attack the papers and that he saw his opportunity following the announcement of the ban. In 2001, the pair were found guilty, and sentenced to pay damages of 2 million dirhams (US$200,000). In addition, Jamaï was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and Amar to two months. Reporters Without Borders immediately called for the Moroccan Justice Minister to overturn the verdict, asserting that \\"Fines should not be used by the authorities with the aim of halting the appearance or publication of a media\\". Other lawsuits followed, and by 2006, Jamaï's debts amounted to more than US$1.5 million in fines, damages, and back taxes. In 2002, Jamaï was told by a number of companies that had formerly advertised in his papers that they had been pressured by the government no longer to do so. Jamaï speculated to an interviewer that having realized that they could not shut him down directly without international pressure, the government was now seeking to bankrupt him. In 2006, Jamaï lost another libel suit, this time to Claude Moniquet, director of the Brussels think-tank, the European strategic intelligence and security center; Jamaï had described a report of his on the Polisario Front as \\"tele-guided by the royal palace\\", and was ordered to pay a US$360,000 fine. The press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) described the trial as \\"politically motivated and unfair\\", and said that it could prove a \\"fatal blow\\" to the weekly magazine.Mise à mort du Journal Hebdomadaire : une semaine pour payer trois millions de dirhams de dommages et intérêts, Reporters sans frontières, 23 December 2006 A cousin of Mohammad's, Prince Moulay Hicham Ben Abdallah, offered to settle Jamaï's legal debts, but Jamaï refused, saying that he would \\"prefer to force the regime to let the press alone or be exposed for silencing it\\". Jamaï then resigned from his papers and traveled to the US, where he was accepted at the Neiman Fellowship [LA1] at Harvard University. He returned to Morocco in 2009. Faced with growing debts and an advertising boycott, Le Journal went out of business in 2010. On 16 February 2010, bailiffs arrived with a court order that the paper must cease publication. Jamaï announced to a crowd outside the office that he was leaving journalism, because \\"serious journalism has become impossible in Morocco today\\". Lakome.com When the Arab Spring-inspired 2011 protests broke out in Morocco Jamaï began a web-based news service, Lakome.com. The site has a small staff and focuses on reporting political events throughout Morocco. By April 2011, it was the fourth-most-visited website in Morocco. Personal life Aboubakr Jamaï is married to Leïla Aït Hmitti. Though a \\"fierce proponent\\" of the separation of church and state, he is a devout Muslim. Awards and recognition In 2003, The Committee to Protect Journalists presented Jamaï its International Press Freedom Award, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". The following year, he spent a year at Yale University in the US as a Yale World Fellow. In 2005 he was named Young Global Leader at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He was named a Nieman Fellow of Harvard University in 2007, and in 2008 he was awarded the Tully Center Free Speech Award, of the Newhouse School of Public Communication at Syracuse University. In 2010, the World Association of Newspapers awarded him its Gebran Tueni Prize, established in honor of the assassinated Lebanese editor and press freedom advocate of the same name. He was Richard von Weizsäcker Fellow, Robert Bosch Stiftung in 2013. In 2016, he was awarded the Leaders for Democracy Award, Project on Middle East Democracy (POMED).

They inhabited a house on the hill called \\"Locust Grove\\" which dates to 1792, according to county records.https://www.oldhousedreams.com/2014/07/10/1792-mount-jackson-va/ As of July 2014 when the property was for sale, \\"Locust Grove\\" was in severely neglected condition with several ungainly exterior modifications over the years, but was still standing. Memorial markers on Rude's Hill, which was featured in significant strategic events during the Civil War. Rude's Hill was an important site in the American Civil War, occupying a commanding high point overlooking the key Valley Turnpike where is passes through a point between Smith Creek on the east and the North Fork of the Shenandoah River on the western side. Rude's Hill is the first elevation on that route beyond the flat Meems bottomland on the south end of the town of Mt. Jackson. It was a particularly defensible high ground because the only practical enemy approach to Rude's Hill was from the north was via single bridges spanning Mill Creek and the Shenandoah's north fork, after which an enemy would need to cross the broad, flat Meems Bottom, commanded by Rude's Hill beyond. And also because if required to retreat, a force could withdraw from Rude's Hill through mountain passes of the Massanutten Range. Because of its strategic placement and high ground location on the Valley Pike and the fact the area had so much action between 1862 and 1865, Rude's Hill figured prominently in the Civil War history of the Shenandoah Valley.  1862  During Shenandoah Valley campaign, following his rare tactical defeat at the First Battle Of Kernstown on March 23, 1862, Confederate General Stonewall Jackson withdrew down the valley to Rude's Hill and made Locust Grove one of his headquarters from April 2-17, 1862.http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/visit/signature-sites/shenandoah- page-counties-sites/jackson-at-rudes-hill/ There he rallied his troops and reorganized his command, with his forces swelling to 6,000 men on Rude's Hill. On April 16-17, 1862 there was a skirmish at Rude's Hill,http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/a-chronology-of-armed-conflict-in-the- shenandoah-valley/ With Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks approaching with 20,000 troops, Jackson was planning to make a stand on Rude's Hill but his cavalry, under pressure of the Union's skirmishing advance on the 16th, had failed to destroy the gateway bridge over the river. So Jackson withdrew south on April 17, but ultimately defeated Union generals in a series of moves and battles up and down the Shenandoah Valley from May to June, 1862.https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/defiance-valley During the war, pastor Rude's wife and daughter were unintended victims and the property suffered heavy damage, so Rev. Rude left in the autumn of 1862. In Texas he became a minister and Professor, but this hill continued to reflect his family name. Jackson's dispatches from this headquarters bore the dateline, “Rude’s Hill,\\" a name that stuck due to its continuting role in the war.https://stonesentinels.com/less-known/mt-jackson/jackson-rudes-hill-wm/ After 1862, the house was evidently occupied by Reverend Addison Weller and his wife, both Methodists.http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh12-1.html Rude's Hill, seen from the flatlands of Meems Bottom. This is the viewpoint which Union forces would have had in various points during the war, approaching Confederate positions defending the hill. The Valley Turnipike (now Rt.11) is on the far right. The Massantten mountains are in the distance.  1863  On November 16-18, 1863 Col. William H. Boyd's Union cavalry reconnoitered from West Virginia to the area of the Valley Pike. The Federal troopers skirmished at Woodstock, Edinburg and Mt. Jackson.https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/digicolls/henkel/CivilWarShenandoah.pdf North of Mt. Jackson the Federals encountered Confederate cavalry under command of Maj. Robert White. The rebel troopers retreated through Mt. Jackson fighting, crossing the bridges through Meems Bottom and to the defensible position on Rude's Hill. Realizing that White's horse artillery could sweep the bridge from the hill, Boyd withdrew from the skirmish at Rude's Hill and then to Woodstock, pursued by Confederate cavalry. Boyd's reconnaissance-in- force then returned to West Virginia. Losses from the cavalry engagement were light on both sides.https://stonesentinels.com/less-known/mt-jackson/cavalry- engagement-a26/  1864  Rude's Hill figured promintently in the action of the Battle of New Market. On May 14, a delaying action was fought at Rude's Hill by elements of the Confederate 18th Virginia Cavalry, under the overall command of Col. John Imboden and Federal forces under Col. August Moor, who took the hill.https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/digicolls/henkel/CivilWarShenandoah.pdf The Confederate cavalry slowed the Union advance, enabling Gen. John Breckinridge to gather the main body of his Confederate forces at New Market, about 4 miles away. After losing the battle on May 15, Union General Franz Sigel managed to organize a rearguard on Rude's Hill, with infantry east of the turnpike, some cavalry west of the road and the artillery behind the line. Due to the exhaustion of the men and low ammunition, Sigel decided to retreat across the Shenandoah River to Mount Jackson. Breckinridge at the same time, concerned the Federals might decide to use Rude's Hill to make a defensive stand, advanced his cavalry and artillery to the crest of Rude's Hill, where they shelled and harassed Sigel’s retreating Federals. The Union army managed to cross Mill Creek at Mt. Jackson and burned the bridge that spanned the creek to Mt. Jackson before the Confederates could catch up. Breckinridge took his main force to Staunton and then east to join with Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Imboden took command in the valley and camped at Rude's Hill.https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/digicolls/henkel/CivilWarShenandoah.pdf On May 21 Maj. Gen David Hunter took over Sigel's Union command and proceeded again south, through Woodstock and Mt. Jackson and encamped on the high ground at Rude's Hill on May 29. Hunter then proceeded south taking large towns and destroying anything of perceived military value.https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/digicolls/henkel/CivilWarShenandoah.pdf The view from Rude's Hill looking down the Valley Pike (now Rt. 11) to the approach from Mt. Jackson In a predawn raid on 3 Oct. 1864, Confederate Captain John McNeill led approximately 50 Confederate rangers against roughly 100 Union troopers of the 8th Ohio Cavalry Regiment guarding a Meems Bottom bridge, a strategic crossing of the Valley Turnpike at Mt. Jackson over the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. The attack lasted just fifteen minutes with most of the Union cavalry captured but McNeill, one the best-known and feared Confederate partisan raiders as leader of McNeill's Rangers, was mortally wounded. He was taken to Rev. Weller's nearby Locust Grove house on Rude's Hill, where he was left for a period of time until his identity was subsequently discovered by Union General Sheridan's troops. He was secreted away from Rude's Hill by a small band of Confederates when the Federals had temporarily left, thinking he was too incapacitated to move and thus did not need a guard. McNeill was moved to Harrisonburg in Confederate hands, where he died on November 10.http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh12-1.html Later in November 1864 the hill overlooking the North Branch of the Shenandoah River and the Valley Turnpike again became a battlefield, as divisions of Philip Sheridan's Union cavalry engaged the confederate General Jubal A. Early.A guidebook to Virginia's historical markers. John S. Salmon, Margaret T. Peters, Virginia. Dept. of Historic Resources. University of Virginia Press. 1994 Having routed Early at the Battle of Fisher's Hill on September 22, 1864, and again at the Battle of Cedar Creek, north of Strasburg, on October 19, Sheridan employed scorched earth tactics and destroyed the economic infrastructure of the Shenandoah Valley as part of his 1864 Valley Campaign. Early retreated roughly 33 miles to the highly defensible Rude's Hill, occupying the hill from October 21-31. Early moved his troops north to Woodstock and skirmished, but then fell back again to Rude's Hill by November 12.https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/digicolls/henkel/CivilWarShenandoah.pdf Two of Sheridan's Union cavalry divisions pursued Early, who rallied and deployed his remaining Confederate infantry in line across the top of the hill on November 22, 1864. The Union cavalry pursued the Confederates but were repulsed in a sharp action. Early then reteated from Rude's Hill to Harrisonburg, eventually retreating to the entrance of the Shenandoah Valley at Browns Gap in the Blue Ridge. Locust Grove manor was looted by Union troops.  1865  Towards the end of the war, Rude's Hill was also the scene of a cavalry skirmish when Confederate Brigadier General Thomas Rosser's troopers attacked Union troops guarding Confederate prisoners on March 7, 1865.https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3881sm.gcwh0008/?sp=43 http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/a-chronology-of-armed-conflict-in-the- shenandoah-valley/ At the end of the war Union troops encamped on the strategically placed Rude's Hill as the Federal occupying force for the region, erecting several buildings, including a hospital, using the lumber from the Confederate hospital they demolished on the north side of Mt. Jackson, about 3 miles away. This post was removed in 1875 when Reconstruction occupation ended.https://shenandoahcivilwarhistory.blog/2018/11/25/confederate-e-r-and-r- i-p-at-mount-jackson/ In a notable local occurrence during the early days of Reconstruction, Confederate Capt. George Summers and Sgt. Isaac Newton Koontz were executed on Rude’s Hill on June 27, 1865. They were members of the Massanutten Rangers, which disbanded with the Confederate surrender. On May 22 they were in a group travelling to Woodstock to take the oath of allegiance to the Union and obtain parole. Along the way they encountered a Union cavalry guard and for reasons unknown revolvers were drawn and the Confederates robbed the Federal’s of their horses and property. The men, fearful of retribution, went to the Union camp on Rude’s Hill to explain the situation and return the horses and property, and were forgiven. But a month later on June 27 they were seized by a different Union commander, brought to Rude’s Hill, tied to the stake and shot.https://www.shenandoahatwar.org/the-execution-of-summers-and- koontz-a-post-war-tragedy/  Rude's Hill Today  Several historical markers at the crest of Rude's Hill now mark the spot, on the west side of Rt. 11 overlooking farmland.

They begin their life cycle as a series of free-swimming planktonic larvae. The females metamorphose into a parasitic stage when they attach to a host and enter into its skin. The males are free swimming. Due to their large size and mesoparasitic life history there have been a number of studies of Pennella, the members of which are among the largest of the parasitic Copepoda. All species are found as adults buried into the flesh of marine bony fish, except for a single species, Pennella balaenopterae which can be found in the muscles and blubber of cetaceans and occasionally other marine mammals, and is the largest species of copepod. Biology Like most parasitic copepods it is the female which is parasitic in Pennella while the males are free swimming. The female has a two host life cycle and egg production commences when an inseminated female settles on its ultimate host, usually a large marine fish such as a member of the cod family Gadidae or tuna. The intermediate host is usually a flatfish or a cephalopod. Before the parasite settles on the intermediate host there are two free swimming or copepodid larval stages, after which it settles on the gill tips of the intermediate host as a sessile chalimus larva. After four chalimus stages on the intermediate host the parasite becomes sexually mature and the free swimming males begin to copulate with the females while they are still sessile, a week after attaining maturity the females leave the intermediate host. Whether or not the females have copulated they become free swimming and the males will inseminate free swimming females as well. After a brief period as a free swimming animal the female infects its ultimate host and begins its main period of adult growth and begins to release eggs into the water.

It is a highly metafictional novel which follows the adventures of a young (sixteen-year-old) female protagonist named Poison as she attempts to rescue her sister from the Phaerie Realm. It contains many intertextual references particularly to mythology, fairy tales and secondary world fantasy (i.e. a story about a world in which magic works without any connection to the \\"real\\" world) characteristics. Wooding credits his travels through Europe as the inspiration for Poison, which he began 22 December 2014. He says of the novel: \\"It can be read one level as a weird, gruesome kind of fairy tale, but there's a lot more to it than that. I spent most of my time writing this novel worrying about whether anyone would 'get' it, or whether it would sound like some degenerate A-Level student's philosophical rant when it was all finished instead of the story it was supposed to be, but I think it all worked out fine in the end. I'm very happy with it, anyways. And at least I got to put all the folklore I studied at University to good use.\\"  Plot  Poison is the story of a rebellious human teenager living in the swamp town of Gull with her father, stepmother, and her baby sister Azalea. She struggles against the oppression in her life, particularly with her strained relationship with her Stepmother, Snapdragon. Her only friend in Gull is the old traveler, Fleet, who tells her tales of the old wars and phaeries and maintains that Poison has some of the “Old Blood” in her. On Soulswatch Eve, Azalea is replaced with a Changeling. After consulting with Fleet, Poison sets out from Gull to rescue her from the Phaerie Lord. She pays the Wraith-Catcher Bram to take her to Shieldtown to seek out the creature Lamprey, to whom Fleet has referred her. Once in Shieldtown, Poison encounters a young woman heading back to Gull and asks her to relay a message to her parents. After proving herself to Lamprey, Poison is sent to the home of the Bone Witch. In chapters fairly reminiscent of Hansel and Gretel, Poison enters the house of the Bone Witch. She meets another young woman named Peppercorn, who keeps house for the blind, old witch. Peppercorn is unwilling to help Poison (aside from hiding her one night), and so it is with Bram’s help that Poison defeats the witch. Bram and Poison escape the house with Peppercorn and her highly intelligent cat Andersen. The quartet meet a fisherman named Myrrk, who hints that all is not what it seems in the phaerie realm. He sends them on their way to the phaerie Lord’s castle. Once there, Poison strikes a deal with Aelthar the phaerie Lord that he will return Azalea to her if she obtains a dagger for him. This deal sends her and her companions into the castle of the spider woman Asinastra. She obtains the dagger and returns to Aelthar, where she learns that he has no intention of returning her sister. Angered by Aelthar’s deception, Poison and her companions journey to the meeting of the lords at the Hierophant’s castle. There, they reunite with Fleet. Fleet, we learn, is an Antiquarian: a human who seeks out stories of interest and value for the Hierophant to transcribe. Upon learning that the Hierophant has created all that the world is and every person in it, Poison tries to fight her role in the story by doing nothing and stagnating the plot line. As Poison tries to fight her own destiny by refusing to live it, everyone around her begins to weaken and deteriorate. After Bram reasons with her that the story she is in is actually about her, since her malaise seems to be what is causing everyone to deteriorate around her, Poison's realization that she can fight against the Hierophant by doing nothing is enough for her to get well enough to continue her story. As she recovers she begins thinking of ways to get back at the Hierophant and stop his control over her. As Poison recovered from her illness, it is revealed that the Hierophant has been murdered with the dagger Poison acquired for Aelthar. The lords of the varying realms are in an uproar, as the death of the Hierophant means that a successor must take his place; each realm wants the new Hierophant to be of their own realm. Aelthar is particularly determined. Poison discovers that he, by way of the Scarecrow, the phaerie creature who replaces children with changelings, has been breeding phaerie-human hybrids, as humans are the only species with imaginations and therefore best suited to become Hierophant. Aelthar shows Poison her own sister, Azaelea, now a teenager, whom he had sent home after deeming her unsuitable. Poison realizes that the girl she sent back to Gull with word of her journey was, in fact, her rapidly aged sister. Deprived of her quest, Poison is furious and determined to get revenge. Aelthar sets the Scarecrow after her among the Hierophant's archives, and she kills it. Scriddle, Aelthar's assistant, stabs her. The world starts to rapidly dissolve around Poison, and she grins through the blood, announcing that she has realized that she is the new Hierophant. Scriddle does not believe her and continues to stab her trying to take her throne, as he does, the world becomes less real. In a panic and desperate for survival, the Hierophant's widow Lady Pariasa kills Scriddle by stabbing him through the neck, screaming that she wants to live. Poison blacks out from blood loss, but is saved by her companions and revived. She embraces her new role as Hierophant as her companions disperse. Just as the last Hierophant wrote his own story, she begins to write hers. Main characters Poison: The 16-year-old, violet eyed protagonist who is \\"a willful, contrary girl, prone to being argumentative and stubborn.\\" Poison's original name was Foxglove, but she renamed herself in her coming-of-age ceremony to spite her step-mother Snapdragon, who once called her such. She embarks on an adventure to save her sister, Azalea, who has been stolen by the phaeries. Fleet: Poison's mentor in Gull, who tells her stories about the world outside of the Black Marshes and the Phaerie World from his own experiences. He is secretly an Antiquarian, who has been following Poison's story. Azalea: Poison's three-year-old sister, who is taken at the beginning of the novel by the Phaerie called the Scarecrow. Bram: A wraith-catcher, who comes to Gull to collect their marsh wraiths for a profit. He reluctantly takes Poison to Shieldtown, but ends up being Poison's companion throughout the novel. Peppercorn: A naive girl who lives under the tyranny of Maeb, the Bone-Witch, with her cat, Andersen. Poison and Bram take Peppercorn from the Bone-Witch's house. She and Andersen join Poison and Bram in the adventure to find Azalea. Andersen: Peppercorn's cat, who is often called unnatural by Bram because of his ability to communicate with everyone and navigate through both the human realm and the Phaerie realm. Maeb, The Bone-Witch: Her house sits on the gateway between the Phaerie and human realm and, though she is blind and deaf, uses her sense of smell and her two dogs to capture those who use her house to move between realms. Lady Asinastra: The lady of cobwebs, ruler of the realm of spiders, half woman, half spider, possess spider-like powers. Aelthar: The Phaerie King, who views humans as amusing animals with an extreme sense of self-importance, sets Poison on a quest to the Spider Queen, Lady Asinastra. Scriddle: Aelthar's assistant, who is half-human, half-Phaerie, and who later tries to put himself in the role of Hierophant. Melcheron, the Hierophant: A human and the lead Antiquarian, who controls the rules and destiny of most peoples in all of the realms. Pariasa: The Hierophant's beautiful wife and Mistress of the Aeriads. She later betrays Melcheron and becomes Scriddle's lover as he attempts to take the role of Hierophant.  Settings  The 'Poison' universe is divided into different realms based on the ruling species of that particular realm. The novel begins in the Realm of Man and proceeds through the various locations. =Realm of Man= Gull Deep in the heart of the Black Marshes was the village of Gull, which was built on stilts, with a multitude of interlinked wooden platforms that sprawled over a murky and weed choked lake, dodging between enormous corkscrew trees and grassy landbars that bulked out of browny-grey water. Sometimes the water would engulf the landbars and rise to the high level of the stilted houses and at times the water level became so low you could almost see the dangerous monsters that lurked in the water below, waiting to jump and snatch the unwary. In the Black Marshes, life was a precarious thing, and misfortune viewed by its inhabitants and inevitable. Shieldtown Shieldtown is a bustling hub-city home to all sorts of people from the elites to the slum lords. It is the home of Lamprey. =Portal= House of the Bone Witch The House of the Bone Witch, Maeb, is an area of liminality. it appears differently on the outside from the inside, and as its name suggests, it is the home of the blind and deaf guardian of the portal between the Realm of Man and Phaerie. Here, the evenings are long and drawn out while daylight ends within the hour. =Realm of Phaeries= The Realm of Phaeries is a beautiful realm that is very pleasing to the human eye, everything is perfect and nothing looks out of place. Thought it is beautiful, everything has a taste of evil within it. The Phaerie folk treat humans as vermin. The Palace of the Phaerie Lord, Aelthar, is a castle pristine beauty. Rolling green hills and breathtaking landscapes fill the land. =Realm of Spiders= Asinastra rules, The Lady of Cobwebs rules over the Realm of Spiders. The realm consists of a castle surrounded by a vast jungle covered with giant cobwebs. =Hierophant's Castle= The Hierophant's Castle is overcast with a perpetual storm. Beyond its walls lies an extensive library that houses all the stories in the world, at least all the ones worth reading.

History  The team was founded in 1945 as SV Eintracht Garstedt, which joined 1. SC Norderstedt in 1972. 1. SC was established just two years earlier on 7 January 1970 as Tanzportverein Norderstedt. The football department split from the club in 2003 to create FC Eintracht Norderstedt 03. Playing as 1. SC, the footballers were part of the Amateuroberliga Nord (III) for seven seasons from 1987–1994. They finished second there in 1993 and took part in the promotion round for the 2. Bundesliga where they performed poorly. The following season they crashed out of Amateuroberliga play after a 15th-place result. The team rebounded, earning a second-place result in the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig- Holstein (IV), and the following year joined the new Regionalliga Nord (III). 1. SC faced relegation after ending the 1997–98 season in 16th, but escaped demotion due to the withdrawal of VfL Hamburg 93. They played two more seasons as a mid-table side in the Regionalliga, before again becoming part of the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein (IV) following league reorganization. Despite a strong 3rd-place finish in 2002, they withdrew from the Oberliga the next year. The team has made two appearances in play for the DFB-Pokal (German Cup), going out in the opening rounds in 1996 and 2000. Following their departure from the club in 2003, the footballers – now playing as FC Eintracht – restarted in the Kreisliga (VIII) competition and climbed back to fifth tier competition after three consecutive promotions.

He was suspected of Roman Catholic sympathies and was threatened with removal from the bench as a result, but he succeeded in retaining office until his death, due to his influential family connections. Background He was the eldest son of Sir Paul Davys (died 1672), Clerk to the Privy Council of Ireland, and later Principal Secretary for Ireland by his first wife Margaret Ussher (died 1633), daughter of Arthur Ussher, and granddaughter of Sir William Ussher of Donnybrook. Sir John Davys was his half-brother and, like their father, John held office as Principal Secretary for Ireland. The father has been described as a remarkable man who during his long career was able to work amicably with Viceroys as different in character as Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, Henry Cromwell, and James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde. It was his father's long friendship with Ormonde which gave William his own start in life, since Ormonde prided himself on being loyal to his friends. William entered Lincoln's Inn in 1649, was called to the English bar in 1657, and entered King's Inn in 1661. Early career William obtained a reversion of his father's office as Clerk to the Privy Council in 1660. In 1661 he was made Recorder of Dublin; in the same year he was elected to the Irish House of Commons as member for Dublin City. On Ormonde's formal entry into Dublin as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1662, William organised the civic reception in his honour and was knighted. Ormonde always showed William great kindness, obtaining for him sinecures such as Clerk of the Tholsel and Chief Justice (or Seneschal) of the Duke's own private Court, the Palatine Court of Tipperary. His marriage to Martha Boyle, daughter of Michael Boyle, Archbishop of Armagh and his second wife Lady Mary O'Brien in 1664 also assisted his career, especially as his father-in-law became Lord Chancellor of Ireland the following year. His career suffered a check when Ormonde was replaced as Lord Lieutenant by Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex. Whether for supporting the wrong political faction, or because of his alleged Catholic leanings, he was suspended from office in 1672. However he was quickly restored to favour, and on his father-in-law's urging he was made Prime Serjeant in 1675. He was recommended for a seat on the Bench in 1673, and again in 1679, but by then his career had been damaged in the turmoil caused by the Popish Plot. =Popish Plot= On the outbreak of the Popish Plot, William and his brother John were both accused of Roman Catholic sympathies and summoned to London to give an account of themselves. What basis there was for the accusation is hard to say: the son-in-law of an Anglican Archbishop in the 1670s was most unlikely to be a Roman Catholic, nor could any Irish Catholic at a time of extreme anti-Catholic hysteria have hoped to hold or retain Government office. Although William later remarried the widow of one of the premier Catholic noblemen, the 3rd Earl of Clancarty, his wife Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald was herself described as a \\"fierce Protestant isolated in a Catholic family.\\" In the event, with his father-in-law and Ormonde vouching for his Protestantism, he was cleared of any suspicion of being a Catholic sympathiser. Lord Chief Justice Sir John Povey, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, died in 1679, and his successor Sir Robert Booth died only a year later. Despite Ormonde's influence, Davys was passed over for this important office the first time, presumably due to continuing doubts about his true religious beliefs, but he was able to obtain the office on the second occasion. Having now reached the pinnacle of his career, Davys seriously damaged his standing by his second marriage to the widowed Lady Clancarty, Elizabeth FitzGerald, who was the daughter of George FitzGerald, 16th Earl of Kildare and Lady Joan Boyle. Whether it was made for love or for social advancement, the marriage offended both his father-in-law Archbishop Boyle and the FitzGeralds, who were engaged in a lawsuit with the Ormonde family, which came before Davys as Chief Justice. The FitzGeralds accused Davys of bias and threatened to have him removed from the Bench: Davys replied that he feared to do wrong, but did not fear the consequences of doing justice. Possibly Davys was attracted by the great wealth of his teenage stepson Donough MacCarthy, 4th Earl of Clancarty, while Donough's uncle Justin MacCarthy, later Viscount Mountcashel, was very close to the future James II. Unfortunately Justin quarrelled irrevocably with Lady Davys when, in an episode that caused a notable scandal, he virtually kidnapped the young earl and forced him into an underage marriage with Elizabeth Spencer, daughter of Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland. The marriage, which turned out badly, caused Davys' wife much grief in her last years, and suggests that the couple had little influence at Court. On the accession of James II, it was widely rumoured that Davys would be removed from office; he was ageing, and \\"much impaired by the gout\\" and had quarrelled with many of his influential connections. In the event James seems to have approved of Davys, perhaps because of his alleged Catholic sympathies, and he duly kissed the King's hand. Despite further rumours of his impending removal he remained in office until his death in 1687. He was buried at St. Audoen's Church, Dublin. His widow Elizabeth survived until 1698, much troubled in her last years by her son's turbulent career. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London as a traitor, escaped to find his long estranged wife Lady Elizabeth Spencer, and at last consummated their marriage, only to be arrested by her outraged family. The affair caused a furore, but fortunately King William III took the matter lightly, and granted Lady Davys' request that her son and daughter-in-law be allowed to go into exile in Germany. Will Davys's only child, a daughter by his first wife Martha Boyle, died young; having no surviving children, he wished to provide for his step-daughter, Lady Catherine MacCarthy. At the same time he wished his house, St. Catherine's Park, Leixlip, which he had bought and improved, to remain in the Davys family. His will contained the curious condition that whichever son of his brother John married Catherine should inherit. His nephew Paul married her, duly inherited St. Catherine's, and after Justin MacCarthy's death had the title Viscount Mount Cashell revived in his own favour. Reputation Elrington Ball believed that whatever Davys' good qualities may have been, he owed his advancement largely to his father's high reputation as a public servant and to the friendship of Ormonde. On the other hand, his refusal to give in to threats from the FitzGerald family as regards the judgment he should give in their lawsuit against Ormonde suggests that he was a man of integrity, and, whatever his personal beliefs, he seems to have been genuinely in favour of religious tolerance.

The exoplanet was found by using the radial velocity method, from radial-velocity measurements via observation of Doppler shifts in the spectrum of the planet's parent star.  Characteristics  =Mass, radius and temperature= Gliese 667 Cc is a super-Earth, an exoplanet with a mass and radius greater than that of Earth, but smaller than that of the giant planets Uranus and Neptune. It is heavier than Earth with a minimum mass of about 3.7 Earth masses. The equilibrium temperature of Gliese 667 Cc is estimated to be . It is expected to have a radius of around 1.5 , dependent upon its composition. = Host star = The planet orbits a red dwarf (M-type) star named Gliese 667 C, orbited by a total of two planets. The star is part of a trinary star system, with Gliese 667 A and B both being more massive than the smaller companion. Gliese 667 C has a mass of 0.31 and a radius of 0.42 . It has a temperature of 3700 K, but its age is poorly constrained, estimates place it greater than 2 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. This star is radiating only 1.4% of the Sun's luminosity from its outer atmosphere. It is known to have a system of two planets: claims have been made for up to seven, but these may be in error due to failure to account for correlated noise in the radial velocity data. Since red dwarfs emit little ultraviolet light, the planets likely receive minimal amounts of ultraviolet radiation. Gliese 667 Cc is the second confirmed planet out from Gliese 667 C, orbiting along the middle of the habitable zone. From its surface, the star would have an angular diameter of 1.24 degrees and would appear to be 2.3 times\\\\begin{smallmatrix}\\\\frac {h} {{h}_{\\\\odot}}={\\\\left( \\\\frac{{{T}_{\\\\odot}}_{\\\\rm eff}} {{T}_{\\\\rm eff}} \\\\right)^2} *\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{L}} {a}\\\\end{smallmatrix}. where \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{h}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the apparent diameter of the star from the surface of the planet in orbit (GJ667Cc in this case), \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{{h}_{\\\\odot}}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the apparent diameter of the Sun (sol) from the surface of Earth, \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{{T}_{\\\\odot}}_{\\\\rm eff}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the effective temperature of the Sun (sol), \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{{T}_{\\\\rm eff}}\\\\end{smallmatrix} the effective temperature of the star, \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{L}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the luminosity of the star as a fraction of the sun's luminosity and \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{a}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the distance of the planet from the star in AU. the visual diameter of our Sun as it appears from the surface of the Earth. Gliese 667 C would have a visual area 5.4 times greater than that of the Sun but would still only occupy 0.003 percent of Gliese 667 Cc's sky sphere or 0.006 percent of the visible sky when directly overhead. The apparent magnitude of the star is 10.25, giving it an absolute magnitude of about 11.03. It is too dim to be seen from Earth with the naked eye, and even smaller telescopes cannot resolve it against the brighter light from Gliese 667 A and B. = Orbit = The orbit of Gliese 667Cc has a semi-major axis of 0.1251 astronomical units, making its year 28.155 Earth-days long. Based on its host star's bolometric luminosity, GJ 667 Cc would receive 90% of the light Earth does; however, a good part of that electromagnetic radiation would be in the invisible infrared part of the spectrum.  Habitability  An artist's impression of Gliese 667 Cc Based on black body temperature calculation, GJ 667 Cc should absorb similar but slightly more overall electromagnetic radiation than Earth, making it a little bit warmer () and consequently placing it slightly closer to the \\"hot\\" inner edge of the habitable zone than Earth (). According to PHL, Gliese 667 Cc is (as of July 2018) the fourth most Earth-like exoplanet located in the conservative habitable zone of its parent star. Its host star is a red dwarf, with about a third as much mass as the Sun. As a result, stars like Gliese 667 C have the ability to live up to 100–150 billion years, 10–15 times longer than the Sun will live. The planet is likely tidally locked, with one side of its hemisphere permanently facing towards the star, while the opposite side is shrouded in eternal darkness. However, between these two intense areas, there would be a sliver of habitability – called the terminator line, where the temperatures may be suitable (about ) for liquid water to exist. Additionally, a much larger portion of the planet may be habitable if it supports a thick enough atmosphere to transfer heat to the side facing away from the star. However, in a 2013 paper, it was revealed that Gliese 667 Cc is subject to tidal heating 300 times that of Earth. This in part is due to its small eccentric orbit around the host star. Because of this, the chances of habitability may be lower than originally estimated.http://www.centauri- dreams.org/?p=32470 See the GJ 667 Cc section.

Historians date the remains of human settlement in the area back to the 9th century, revealing evidence of the Chernyakhov culture and ancient Kievan Rus' civilizations, as well as the Roman Empire. Historic documents first mentioned the settlement in 1414 as the village of Tolste (). In the 15th century, the settlement came under control of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and was renamed to the Polish variant Tłuste (). In 1548, Tłuste was granted Magdeburg rights, which it kept until 1944 when its status was downgraded to that of an urban-type settlement. The settlement was renamed two years later from its Polish name to its current Ukrainian equivalent Tovste. On December 4, 1996, Tovste was admitted into the League of Historic Cities of Ukraine. In the town there are numerous architectural monuments: the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Saint Anne, built in late 19th-early 20th century, whose reconstruction is being funded by former Polish residents of Tovste; the Greek Catholic Church of Saint Michael the Archangel, built from 1913-1939; as well as a modern Ukrainian Orthodox Church, built from 1991-1995.

Dominic, Serene. Blind Ambition The Phoenix New Times, Oct. 3, 2002 retrieved 02-17-12 Bob Hoag offered to remix any of the material, but the label refused and decided that it wanted to hire Karl Richardson of Saturday Night Fever-era Beegees fame, in Miami. The new mixes from Miami did not please anyone either. Eventually, when it came time to master the record, it was sent to Jason Livermore, one of Bob Hoag's close acquaintances, at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado. Bob was enlisted to help in the mastering, and perhaps fix all of the problems with the mixes. Jason Livermore ended up liking the original mixes more than those done in Florida, and eventually included all of them on the new master copy, which, although it was rejected by the label just four months earlier, ended up getting the go ahead when compared to the Miami mixes. The band originally wanted to record an album with twenty songs. Aezra only wanted ten songs to be on the record, so the band met them halfway and included 15 tracks on the album.Hendrickson, Derik.

The NEHGR has diligently tried to warn its readers about this false lineage disseminated by such as the Register's 1902 book notice of the Reverend Hiram Fairbanks' The Ancestry of Henry Adams of Braintree, New England.Fairbanks, H. F. The ancestry of Henry Adams of Braintree, New England, by Hiram Francis Fairbanks. Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 1901. Retrieved June 24, 2018. It is widely believed that claims Henry Adams (thus, President Adams) is descended from the Welsh political family also called Adams are false. The Welsh prefix Ap (meaning \\"son of\\") often appears in the Welsh Adams family but not in the name of the Somerset family. These mistakes and false assumptions are frequent in early attempts at genealogy. See the book \\"Henry Adams of Somerset, England and Braintree, Mass\\" by J. Gardner BartlettThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which is referenced in a well- researched genealogy. https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Adams-277 which cites the book \\"Ancestors and Descendants of Jeremiah Adams, 1794–1883, of Salisbury, Connecticut, Sullivan County, New York, Harbor Creek, Pennsylvania and Vermilion, Ohio\\" by Enid Eleanor Adams (1974)\\" as well as several other references. Legacy John Adams, the second president of the United States of America, erected a monument to his memory in the old church yard at Quincy with the following inscription: \\"In memory of Henry Adams who took his flight from the Dragon persecution in Devonshire, England and alighted with eight sons, near Mount Wollaston. One of the sons returned to England, and after taking time to explore the country, four removed to Medfield and the neighboring towns; two to Chelmsford. One only, Joseph, who lies here at his left hand, remained here, who was an original proprietor in the township of Braintree, incorporated in 1639. This stone and several others have been placed in this yard, by a great-great grandson, from a veneration of the Piety, humility, simplicity, prudence, patience, temperance, frugality, industry and perseverance, of his Ancestors, in hopes of Recommending an imitation of their virtures to their posterity. ... Erected December, 1823.\\" However, President John Quincy Adams dissented from the opinion of his father that Henry Adams came from Devonshire. He believed that: \\"After giving the matter particular and thorough investigation... my conviction is that Henry Adams was from Braintree in the county of Essex, on the east coast of England.\\"\\"The statement in the Alden Collection\\" Henry may have been in the company of Thomas Hooker, who arrived in September 1633. The Hooker company was mostly made up from immigrants of Chelmsford, perhaps from Braintree and other neighboring villages of Essex county, who had arrived just to the new colony the year before. Winthrop's Journal, I. 37, says, \\"1632: 14 Aug; The Braintree Company which had begun to settle down at Mt. Wollaston by order of Court, removed to Newtown. These were Mr. Hooker's Company.\\"Winthrop's Journal, I. 37 See Family Memorial by Elisha Thayer; Note p. 38. Hence it appears highly probable that Henry Adams from Braintree in Essex joined Hooker's Company and arrived in Boston in 1632.

Plot summary Stephanie's friend Lula witnesses the murder (by decapitation) of celebrity chef Stanley Chipotle. When Chipotle's sponsors offer a $1 million reward for the capture of the killers, Lula decides to enter an upcoming BBQ cook-off contest, deciding that the most likely suspect is a rival chef. Despite her complete lack of culinary skills, she is joined by Stephanie's Grandma Mazur, their friend Connie Rosoli, and a reluctant Stephanie. Several of Ranger's clients' homes have been burglarized, leading him to suspect one of his men. He asks Stephanie to resume her job at Rangeman, as a pretext for snooping around. He also offers to lend his considerable skills as a bounty hunter to helping her do her regular job. While Lula attempts to perfect her \\"skills\\" as a chef, she is attacked several times by Chipotle's (extremely inept) killers, but manages to escape each time, though she is forced to move in with Stephanie, and later with the Plum family, and her prized Pontiac Firebird is destroyed by a poorly-constructed car bomb. On the day of the cook-off, one of the killers, \\"Marco the Maniac\\" is caught trying to flee to the airport. He identifies his accomplice as the cook-off's emcee, a vice president of the sauce company that employed Chipotle. The emcee holds Lula hostage at gunpoint and confesses: Chipotle was having an affair with the company president's wife, who planned to divorce her husband and carry half his assets to a new company founded with Chipotle. The killing and the reward were intended to be a publicity stunt that would both rid them of Chipotle and generate media attention to the company. Lula manages to disarm and subdue the emcee, though she has to accept that she won't be getting the reward. After patient investigation, Stephanie identifies Ranger's thieves as two teenagers who were turned down for jobs at his company, then decided to finance their own company by robbing Ranger's clients, with hidden cameras planted over the clients' security keypads. When Ranger and his men burst into the rival \\"company\\"'s office, they find all of the stolen jewelry and valuables stored there; the teenagers were so inept that they used the cash they stole to rent the office space, but had no idea how to fence the stolen property.

Her commissioned work, \\"Evening at the Opera\\" hangs in the Detroit Opera House and the artist's fourteen-painting contemporary interpretation of the Passion of Christ is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese collection installed in the church of Corpus Domini in Bolzano, Italy. Mazzucato was recognized as a leading contemporary artist by the SoHo Fine Arts Institute in New York City in 2000. Early life Carla Carli Mazzucato was born in Appiano, a small town nestled in the Alps of northern Italy on November 2, 1935. She was the second of three children born to Anna Bella and Vigilio Carli, a local landowner who oversaw an expanse of orchards. He grew a successful business exporting apples and other fruits to Austria and Yugoslavia. Consequently, Carla spent much of her early youth surrounded by nature, accompanying her father on walks through the countryside and along the wooded timber trails of the mountains that rimmed the fertile Adige River Valley. World War II The tranquility of Carla’s childhood was interrupted by the onset of World War II. Situated along the Adige River which flows through the Brenner Pass in the Alps, Appiano was squarely on the primary route into Italy from Austria and Germany. Allied bombing runs frequently targeted the railroad through the pass to disrupt Nazi Germany supply lines. At seven years of age, Carla’s days were often spent in the darkness of the bomb shelters built into the mountain sides. Although Italy signed the armistice with the Allied Forces in 1943, Germany responded by annexing the Alto Adige region, prolonging the fighting there through 1945. With the end of the war, came a period of rebuilding, but for young Carla, it marked the end of her childhood. Her father died in 1947; her mother soon after. Carla went to work to help support her family. She continued her studies independently and eventually went on to attend the Ca' Foscari Academy in Venice and the Università Cattolica in Milan. In 1962, she was introduced to the brother of a classmate, and shortly thereafter traveled to America to make a new home with her husband, Giuseppe Mazzucato. New Horizons Carla began her life in the United States in Chicago Heights, Illinois. There, she learned English, started a family and she began to paint. Though her early work relied more on her classical training, she was greatly influenced by the paintings of French expressionist Georges Rouault. Her own personal style evolved, and by the time she moved to the Detroit, Michigan, area in 1966, her art embraced qualities of both expressionism and impressionism. Mazzucato’s work was first exhibited in 1969. In 1977, she opened an art gallery in Grosse Ile, Michigan, where she taught and helped to promote and exhibit the work of other artists as well as her own. New York and Beyond By 1982, Mazzucato’s work began appearing regularly in New York City. Her paintings were well received by both the public and critics alike who noted that “...this serious and talented artist has quite a range of expression in an art that is a complex of powerful forces.”E.C. Lipton, “Art Speak - New York Gallery Review” 1986 Mazzucato and her art began to travel the country. Exhibits in Dallas, Chicago and Palm Springs introduced her work to enthusiastic patrons, as she gained recognition as a leading contemporary artist. “Her art conveys an ultimate optimism in the nature of man, and her figures seem to walk towards an indefinite horizon in the hope of finding that moment of truth and peace.”Les Krantz, editor “American Artists - An Illustrated Survey of Leading Contemporaries” pub. 1989 In 1990, Mazzucato’s first large-scale commission, a series of fourteen oil paintings depicting the passion of Christ, was completed for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese and installed in the Church of Corpus Domini in Bolzano, Italy. Mazzucato traveled extensively as part of her method of artistic immersion. She journeyed through Spain and France, Poland and re-emergent Russia, painting the images and impressions that she, herself witnessed first hand. “In all of Mazzucato’s paintings, the spirit of wonder, silence and mystery permeate the landscapes, in an eloquent symphony of sensuous forms and color. Past, present and future are wed and captured in a moment.”Alexandra Shaw, “Carla Mazzucato’s Internal Rhythms of Nature” Manhattan Arts Magazine 1990 Mazzucato exhibited works, born from her travels, in Bologna and Prato, Italy, in 1993 and 1996, and accepted invitations for shows in the SoHo district of New York City in 1996 and 1998. “Carla Carli Mazzucato is, first and foremost, honest with herself. Her paintings are drawn from her own perceptions of life—her impressions, uninfluenced by any socially imposed manner of thinking. She does not follow the current; hers is a truly free art, light-years from any set tradition. She paints a contemporary world rich with intense colors and hues that radiate optimism. Landscapes, compositions, flowers, all born from a truth interpreted by Mazzucato’s innate talent.”Andrea Revi, University of Rome, Exhibit Review, 1996 In 1999, Mazzucato’s commissioned painting, “Evening at the Opera” was unveiled in a gala event at the Opera House in Detroit, Michigan, where it remains on display. Later life Showings of Mazzucato’s work continued into the new millennium. The Regional Society for the Arts in Appiano, Italy orchestrated a 61-painting “homecoming exhibit” attended by the artist in 2001. The Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California, presented her works in 2005, and the Prisma Galerie in Bolzano, Italy, hosted an exhibit of new paintings by the artist in 2006.

The building is Grade II* listed, as is its 18th- and 19th-century parkland. The mansion is of ashlar, originally with two matching, three-bay elevations. At a diagonal, was a \\"remarkable\\" Greek Doric portico, with pediment. This was removed in the early 20th century. The main elliptical staircase remains within a rotunda and lit by a small lantern dome. The original parkland \\"survives in its entirety\\". The Coed Coch estate came to the Wynne family when the Rev. Richard Wynne married Gaynor, daughter and heiress of John Wynne of Coed Coch, in the parish of Betws yn Rhos. Their grandson, John Lloyd Wynne (1776–1887) undertook the enlargement of the house and estate in the early 19th century. The estate then descended in the male line until the death in World War I of Edward Henry John Wynne (1893–1916). The estate was inherited by Margaret Broderick, his half- sister, who ran a famous Welsh Mountain Pony stud there that continued under her descendants until its sale in 1978. From the 1940s until the 1970s, the house was a boys' preparatory school, Heronwater School, under the headmastership of Keith Gaskell. The estate is now a private home and is not open to the public. In 1996 the furniture from the library, commissioned by John Lloyd Wynne from Gillows of Lancaster in 1806–1807, was bought by the Museum of Welsh Life in Cardiff; it can now be seen in the library of St Fagans Castle.

Its assembly was constituted on the same day while its government and senate were established on 4 December 1912. The delegation of Albania submitted a memorandum to the London Conference of 1913 requesting international recognition of independent Albania. At the beginning of the conference it was decided that the region of Albania would be under Ottoman suzerainty but with an autonomous government. The requests by the delegation for recognition based on the ethnic rights of Albanians were rejected and the treaty signed on 30 May 1913 partitioned a major part of the claimed lands between Serbia, Greece and Montenegro, leaving as independent territory only a central region, which was put under the protection of the Great Powers. The ambassadors of six Great Powers met again on 29 July 1913 and decided to constitute a new state, the Principality of Albania, as a constitutional monarchy. Finally, with the Treaty of Bucharest being signed in August 1913, this new independent state was established, leaving about 30–40% of the ethnic Albanian population outside its borders.  Name  The name of the state used in the text of declaration of independence of Albania is Shqipëria (). It is also referred to as the \\"independent Albania\\" (), the \\"Albanian State\\" () or the \\"independent state of Albania\\" ().  Political system  The independent Albania established on 28 November 1912 is the first Albanian state in modern history. It was a parliamentary state, not a monarchy. Some sources refer to it as the Republic of Albania or the Albanian Republic. Albania became an independent state through four constitutional decisions of the Assembly of Vlorë made on 28 November 1912: # Albania, as of today, should be on her own, free and independent # under a provisional government # that a council of elders (senate) be elected to assist and supervise the government # a commission is to be sent to Europe to defend Albanian interests among the Great Powers  Territory  The authority of the state was limited to the regions of Vlore, Berat and Lushnje. The claimed territory was much larger than the territory of contemporary Albania and than the territory over which the Provisional Government exercised its power. It comprised the territories of Kosovo Vilayet, Monastir Vilayet, Shkoder Vilayet and Janina Vilayet. The Treaty of London, signed on 30 May 1913, reduced the territory of Albanian state to its central regions after partitioning a significant part of territory claimed by Albania between the Balkan allies (a major part of the northern and western area was given to the Serbia and Montenegro while the southern region of Chameria became part of Greece). Kosovo was given to Serbia at the London treaty at the insistence of Russia. During the First Balkan War the kingdoms of Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria and Montenegro aspired to incorporate the entire region into their states (completely denying the Albania's independence), so most of the captured territory was occupied by their armies. Independent Albania did however exercise control over one pocket of land which included Vlore, Berat, Fier and Lushnje.  History  = Albanian Vilayet = Albanian rebels capturing Skopje in August 1912 Until September 1912, the Ottoman government intentionally kept Albanians divided within four ethnically heterogeneous vilayets to prevent Albanian national unification. The reforms introduced by the Young Turks provoked the Albanian Revolt of 1912 which lasted from January to August 1912. In January 1912, Hasan Prishtina, Albanian deputy in the Ottoman parliament, publicly warned members of the parliament that the policy of the Young Turks' government would lead to a revolution in Albania. The Albanian revolt was successful and until August 1912 rebels managed to gain control over whole Kosovo vilayet (including Novi Pazar, Sjenica, Pristina and even Skopje), a part of the Scutari Vilayet (including Elbasan, Përmet and Leskovik), Konitsa in Janina Vilayet and Debar in Monastir Vilayet. The Ottoman government ended the Albanian revolt on 4 September 1912 by accepting all demands related to establishing an unified autonomous system of administration and justice for Albanians within one vilayet—the Albanian vilayet. = First Balkan War = Territory of Albania, under the control of the provisional government of Albania seated in Vlorë (marked as Valona, its Italian name). Areas occupied by the Balkan Alliance are shown in color (Serbia in Green, Montenegro in Yellow, and Greece in Blue). The territory of the Albanian provisional government is outlined. The success of the Albanian revolt sent a strong signal to the neighbouring countries that the Ottoman Empire was weak. Besides, the Kingdom of Serbia opposed the plan for an Albanian vilayet, preferring a partition of the European territory of the Ottoman Empire among the four Balkan allies. In the meantime it was agreed that the conquered territory was to have the status of a Condominium. Albanian leaders, including Faik Konitza and Fan Noli, organized a large meeting on 7 October 1913 in Boston. They decided that Albanians should \\"unite fully with the Ottoman government against the enemies of the Empire\\" because \\"if Turkey is defeated, the Balkan states would shred Albania.\\" That decision was risky, because if the Ottomans were defeated, Albanian participation in the Balkan war on the Ottoman side would serve as justification for the Balkan allies to partition Albania as an Ottoman province. Albanians who were mobilized in the Ottoman army fought for their country rather than for the Ottoman Empire. During the First Balkan War the combined armies of the Balkan allies overcame the numerically inferior and strategically disadvantaged Ottoman armies and achieved rapid success. They occupied almost all the remaining European territories of the Ottoman Empire including the territory of the Albanian Vilayet. At the beginning of November 1912, Albanian leaders appealed to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary, explaining the difficult situation in their country because parts of the four vilayets were also claimed by the Balkan League who were present on the disputed lands. Austria-Hungary and Italy strongly opposed the arrival of Serbian army on the Adriatic Sea because they perceived it as a threat to their domination of the Adriatic and feared that a Serbian Adriatic port could become a Russian base. Ismail Qemali, who had been an Albanian deputy in the Ottoman parliament, secured the support of Austria-Hungary for the autonomy of Albania within the Ottoman Empire, but not for its independence. = All-Albanian Congress = Ismail Qemali invited the representatives of all parts of Albanian Vilayet to attend the All-Albanian Congress held in Vlorë on November 28, 1912. At the beginning of the session, Ismail Qemali referred to the threatened Albanian rights gained during the Albanian revolts in the previous four years, and explained to the participants of the congress that they should do whatever was necessary to save Albania. After his speech they began by checking the documents because it was decided that each kaza of Albanian Vilayet would be counted as one vote, regardless of the number of its delegates. Participants of this congress are regarded as Founding Fathers of Albania. = After the declaration of independence = Caricature published in February 1913 shows Albania defending itself from neighboring countries. Montenegro is represented as a monkey, Greece as a leopard attacking Ioannina and Serbia as a snake. Text in Albanian: \\"Flee from me! Bloodsucking beasts!\\" The first notification about the proclaimed independence was sent to the command of Serbian Army in Ohrid. On 29 November 1912, the army of the Kingdom of Serbia captured Durrës without any resistance and established Durrës County with four districts (): Durrës, Lezha, Elbasan and Tirana. New Serbian authorities were faced with big difficulties in governing a new county because all secluded army garrisons with small number of soldiers were destroyed in a couple of days. Although some tribal chieftains proposed to organize an armed resistance against troops of Serbia in the occupied parts of Albania, the provisional government of the Independent Albania decided to avoid unnecessary casualties and concluded agreement (besa) to maintain harmony in occupied territory. The international relations of Albania began to function on a state level after it was proclaimed independent and the first diplomatic efforts of its government were requests for the international recognition of the Albanian state. In December 1912, a delegation of Albania submitted a memorandum to the London Conference of 1913 insisting on the ethnic rights of Albanians and requested an international recognition of the independent Albania composed of Kosovo, western Macedonia including Skopje and Bitola and the whole territory of Epirus up to Arta. Participants of the congress in Trieste About 120 notable politicians and intellectuals from Albania attended the Albanian Congress of Trieste from 27 February to 6 March 1913 and requested from the Great Powers a recognition of the political and economical independence of Albania. Isa Boletini and Ismail Qemali travelled to London in March 1913 to obtain Britain's support for their new country. On March 6 Ioannina was captured by forces of the Kingdom of Greece. In March 1913 a group of 130 (or 200) soldiers of the Kingdom of Serbia were killed near Prizren by Albanian irregulars in act of revenge for repression of Serbian army. In April 1913 the army of the Kingdom of Serbia retreated from Durrës but remained in other parts of Albania. On the other hand, Kingdom of Montenegro managed to capture Shkodër on 23 April 1913 after six months of siege. However, when the war was over, the Great Powers did not award the city to the Kingdom of Montenegro, which was compelled to evacuate it in May 1913. In May 1913, delegates of Albania in London requested a British sovereign and considered offering the Albanian throne to Aubrey Herbert. = London Treaty = Various borders for Albania proposed during the London Conference of 1912–13 The Great Powers did not fulfil the requests for recognition of Albania. At the beginning of the London conference in December 1912 the ambassadors of all six Great Powers rejected the plan for establishing an independent Albania. Instead, they decided that Albania would be under Ottoman suzerainty but with an autonomous government. After it became obvious that Ottoman Empire would lose all of Macedonia and its territorial connection with Albania, the Great Powers realized they had to change their decision. The Treaty of London, signed on 30 May 1913, partitioned significant part of territory claimed by Albania, regardless its ethnic composition, between the Balkan allies reducing the territory of Albania to its central regions. = After the London treaty = In September 1913 independent Albania secretly supported and helped Ohrid–Debar Uprising because Ismail Qemali thought that independent Albania was too weak to openly confront the Kingdom of Serbia. Qemali ordered simultaneous attack of the Albanian forces led by Isa Boletini and Bajram Curri to the region of Prizren. Peshkopi has been captured on 20 September 1913. Local Albanians and Bulgarians expelled the Serbian army and officials, creating a front line 15 km east of Ohrid. A local administration was set up in Ohrid.Гоцев, Димитър. Национално-освободителната борба в Македония 1912–1915, София 1981, с. 48 (Gotsev, Dimitar. The National Liberation Struggle in Macedonia, Sofia 1981, p. 124, Огнянов, Михаил. Македония- преживяна съдба, София 2002, с. 43 The Serbian Army of 100,000 regulars suppressed the uprising in several days. Thousands were killed, and tens of thousands of local inhabitants fled for Bulgaria and Albania to save their lives. According to the Report by the International Commission of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace the number of Albanians who took refuge was 25,000.Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars, published by the Endowment Washington, D.C. 1914, p. 182 On 16 October 1913, Essad Pasha Toptani—who also had been an Albanian deputy in the Ottoman parliament—established the Republic of Central Albania with its administrative centre in Durrës. Toptani's state was also short-lived and unrecognised, with its territory bounded by rivers Mat in the North and Shkumbin in the South. It further partitioned already truncated territory of Albania. Toptani contested the status of the provisional government and denied that Qemali's government was legitimate, emphasizing that it was \\"the personal creation of a number of men.\\" In July 1913 Ismail Qemali attempted to calm Toptani by appointing him Minister of Interior, but with no avail. Toptani was also, like Qemali little earlier, forced by Great Powers to step away on 1 February 1914.  Politics  Ismail Qemali and his cabinet during the celebration of the first anniversary of independence in Vlorë on 28 November 1913 = Declaration of Independence = At the beginning of the session Ismail Qemali emphasized that the only way to prevent division of the territory of Albania between the Balkan allies was to establish it as independent state, separated from Ottoman Empire. Qemali's proposal was unanimously accepted and it was decided to sign the declaration of independence of Albania in the name of the constituted Assembly of Vlorë (Albanian: Kuvendi i Vlorës) which members were representatives of all the regions of Albania. By the declaration of Albanian independence the Assembly of Vlorë rejected the autonomy granted by the Ottoman Empire to the Albanian Vilayet, projected a couple of months earlier. The consensus was made for the complete independence. The sitting was then suspended and members of newly constituted National Assembly went to the house of Ismail Qemali who raised the flag of Skanderbeg on the balcony of his house, in front of the gathered people. = Government and Senate = The establishment of the government was postponed for the fourth session of the Assembly of Vlorë, held on 4 December 1912, until representatives of all regions of Albania arrived to Vlore. During that session members of the assembly established the Provisional Government of Albania. It was a government that consisted of ten members, led by Ismail Qemali, until his resignation on 22 January 1914. Assembly established the Senate () with advisory role to the government, consisted of 18 members of Assembly. Ismail Qemali was appointed as the first prime minister of independent Albania. On the same session held on 4 December 1912 the assembly appointed the other members of the government: *Prime Minister (and de facto head of the state): Ismail Qemali *Deputy Prime Minister: Dom Nikollë Kaçorri *Minister of Foreign Affairs (provisionally): Ismail Qemali *Minister of Internal Affairs: Myfit Bej Libohova (in July 1913 Essad Pasha Toptani) *Minister of War: General Mehmet Pashë Derralla (from Tetovo in Macedonia) *Minister of Finance: Abdi Toptani *Minister of Justice: Petro Poga *Minister of Education: Luigj Gurakuqi *Minister of Public Services: Mit’hat Frashëri (from Ioannina in Greece) *Minister of Agriculture: Pandeli Cale *Minister of Posts and Telegraphs: Lef Nosi = Public services = Post stamp of the independent Albania, 16 June 1913. A week after the independent Albania was proclaimed, its first Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs was established with Lef Nosi as its minister. Independent Albania took over the Ottoman post offices and placed significant efforts to make the Albanian postal service identifiable. Post offices of the independent Albania used the Ottoman postal seals until the end of April and the beginning of May 1913, when they were replaced by the postal seals of Albania with the name of the place in the upper part of the seal and the name of the state, Albania (Shqipenie), in the bottom part. On 5 May 1913 the first postage stamps of Albania were put into circulation. On 7 July 1913 Albania submitted an official request to the Universal Postal Union (UPU) for membership. The request was rejected, and Albania would become a member of UPU only in 1922. After Albania achieved its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, its legal system continued to function under the Ottoman Civil Code (Mejelle) for some time. Since 28 November 1912 until 1926 the Albanian government did not mint any currency. Transactions occurred in gold and silver coins of other countries, whereas the official unit of account was the franc of the Latin Monetary Union. Until 1912, the education system in Albania depended on religious institutions. Muslims attended Ottoman schools, the Orthodox population attended Greek or Armenian schools, Catholics attended Italian or Austrian schools, whereas in the districts near Slavic states, the population attended Serbian or Bulgarian schools. When Albania was declared independent in 1912 its government took measures to close foreign schools and to open Albanian ones. From 1912 to 1914, there was not much opportunity and time for progress of national education, because of the political instability and the breakout of World War I. The first laic school was opened in Shkoder in 1913. Isa Boletini with men from Kosovo in the streets of Vlorë in 1912 A group of fighters from Kosovo led by Isa Boletini were the first nucleus of the armed forces of Albania established on 4 December 1912. The Ottoman forces backed the government of Independent Albania until the beginning of 1913, although the Ottomans did not recognize its independence. Law enforcement forces (gendarmerie and Albanian Police) of the independent Albania were established on 13 January 1913. About 70 former Ottoman officers were engaged as officers of the law enforcement units of the independent Albania. The first director of the Albanian Police was Halim Gostivari, whereas the first commanders of the gendarmerie were Alem Tragjasi, Hysni Toska, Sali Vranishti, and Hajredin Hekali. The Albanian Police uniforms was colored in gray and green, and the collars were red and black.  Economy  The economy of Albania after it became independent state in 1912 was based on primitive agriculture and livestock, with no significant industry, and little international trade. Starting in 1912, Albania began activities aimed at implementing an agrarian reform, which would transfer ownership of the arable land from the big landowners to the peasants.  Aftermath  Borders of the Principality of Albania, recognized by the Treaty of Bucharest. The Treaties of London and Bucharest dealt with the final territorial adjustments arising out of the conclusion of the Balkan Wars. After the London treaty has been signed the ambassadors of six Great Powers decided to constitute a new state, Albania, as hereditary principality. The Great Powers refused to recognize the Provisional Government of Albania and, instead, organized the International Commission of Control (ICC) to take care of the administration of the newly established principality until the arrival of the new monarch. The first law enforcement agency of the new principality was the International Gendarmerie. The treaty of Bucharest, signed on 10 August 1913, established internationally recognized Albania as an independent state. The creation of Albanian state in 1913 after the Balkan Wars was their only political result. A plot by the Young Turk government and led by Bekir Fikri to restore Ottoman control over Albania through the installment of an Ottoman-Albanian officer Ahmed Izzet Pasha as monarch was uncovered by the Serbs and reported to the ICC. Ismail Qemali supported the plot for military assistance against Serbia and Greece. The ICC allowed their Dutch officers serving as the Albanian Gendarmerie to declare a state of emergency and stop the plot. They raided Vlorë on 7–8 January 1914, discovering more than 200 Ottoman troops and arrested Fikri. During Fikri's trial the plot emerged and an ICC military court under Colonel Willem de Veer condemned him to death and later commuted to life imprisonment, while Qemali and his cabinet resigned. After Qemali left the country, turmoil ensured throughout Albania. After a display of independence of Qemali's government, the Great Powers were angered and the International Commission of Control forced Qemali to step aside and leave Albania. William, Prince of Albania and his wife Princess Sophie of Albania arriving in Durrës, Albania on 7 March 1914. In 1914, after a gradual assumption of the administration of the country, the International Commission of Control prepared a draft of the constitution (Albanian: Statuti Organik) with 216 articles. It was a basis for establishment of the National Assembly with power of legislation in Albania, which was designed as a hereditary constitutional monarchy. According to the constitution, the new principality would have, with few exceptions, the same administrative organization as during the Ottoman Empire suzerainty. It would be partitioned on seven administrative districts, each of which would choose three representatives for the national assembly by direct suffrage. The prince would nominate ten representatives and the heads of the all three religions (Islam, Orthodox and Catholic) would be also representatives in the national assembly, which would have four-year terms. The Council of Ministres, with executive powers, would be appointed by the prince. After monarchical form of government has been installed by the International Commission of Control in 1914 the political system of Albania became a monarchy. The biggest group of Albanians who were left outside of the new state were Albanians from Kosovo, the cradle of the 19th century Albanian nationalism. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy exploited the discontent of the Albanians about the inaccurate ethnic borders.  Commemorations  100 Vjet Shtet Shqiptar () Since Albania was declared independent on November 28, 1912, every 28 November is commemorated by all Albanians (wherever they live in the world) as their National Day (Albanian Independence Day or Flag Day). In the Republic of Albania, the day is celebrated as a public holiday. In the Republic of Kosovo, the day has been an official public holiday since a 2011 decision of Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi's cabinet. The proceedings of the conference dedicated to the 70th anniversary of Albania's independence organized in November 1982 by the Academy of Sciences of Albania were entitled \\"National forces against imperialist dictate in the organization of the Albanian State, 1912-1914: Report\\". In 1992 the Academy of Sciences of Albania organized a conference dedicated to 80th anniversary of independent Albania and published a document titled: \\"The organization of government, judicial system and military of Albania (1912-1914)\\". Year 2012 is a year of the centennial of the Independence of Albania. The opening day of the year-long celebration was on 17 January 2012 during a solemn ceremony held at the Parliament of Albania and attended by Albanian representatives from the Republic of Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Preševo and Bujanovac, who were joined together that day like they were 100 years ago. The Ministry of Tourism, Cultural Affairs, Youth and Sports announced on 22 December 2011 the \\"International Competition for the accomplishment in sculpture of the monumental work dedicated to the “100 anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of the Albanian State: 28 November 1912 – 28 November 2012”\\".

Little is known of his early life, but he was a loyal royal official in Cumberland and Westmorland for all his adult life, serving as Member of Parliament, Escheator and Justice of the Peace on multiple occasions. A man of social and political significance in the area, he eventually became involved in the struggle for local supremacy in the 1450s between the Neville and Percy families. This led to him and his men being beaten and threatened by Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, over which he petitioned the royal council in 1455. De la More played no active part in the Wars of the Roses which broke out the same year. He is known to have married twice. His first wife, called either Idione or Maud, died first, but his second, Margaret, survived him. Early life and marriage Little is known of de la More's early life; according to his own testimony, he was born in 1395. The Parliamentary historian J. C. Wedgwood suggests that he may have been the son of a namesake who attended the 1420 parliament. According to the medievalist Carole Rawcliffe, however, Wedgwood is in error, \\"mistakenly assum[ing] that two different men, father and son, must have sat for Cumberland in 1420 and 1450, whereas they were one and the same\\". In 1415 de la More was arrested by officers of the Warden of the East March for breaking the truce with Scotland after he was discovered leading raiding parties across the border. At some point de la More inherited a patrimony, based around Cumcatch, from his parents. He later augmented his estates by purchasing other properties in Branthwaite and took out a 20-year lease on the manors of West Farlam and Sebergham, then owned by the Crown. By July 1419 de la More had married a woman named either Idione or Maud, who was the widow of William Sandford. She brought de la More the manor of Little Asby by jointure. Rawcliffe suggests that the marriage brought de la More \\"powerful connections\\", as her feoffees included Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland and Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland. De la More's armorial was A cross flory, with a scallop in dexter chief. Offices and royal service in Cumberland King Henry VI was six-months old when his father, Henry V, died in 1422. Henry VI began his personal rule in 1437 aged 16. To celebrate the occasion, which the medievalist John Watts called \\"a sign to political society that the King had come of age\\", Henry issued a royal pardon to whoever sued for one. Of this, de la More availed himself. De la More's career was to be a full one. He held royal offices in both Cumberland and Westmorland almost from the point he had entered his majority. He was the King's Escheator from 1431 to 1432 for both counties and was appointed Sheriff of Cumberland in 1443–1444, 1447–1448 and 1452–1453. He was also appointed elector of the county—one who stewarded shire elections to parliament, often in the face of pressure from either the crown or local nobility—in 1437, 1442, 1447 and 1449. He was elected to parliament as the county candidate four times, in 1420, 1429, 1450 and 1455. His second election involved de la More in some political skullduggery. His co-candidate, Sir William Leigh, was not favoured by the then-sheriff Christopher Moresby, who replaced Leigh with his own choice of candidate, Sir Thomas Parr, and without consulting the county court as was required. Moresby found himself able to appoint a new candidate after the original writs of summons were superseded by another that arrived after the election had taken place. He had only to write Parr's and de la More's names on the new writ prior to returning it. The subsequent investigation into Moresby extended into de la More's own first term as Sheriff. De la More took the 1434 oath not to harbour criminals and disturbers of the King's Peace. This indicates, argues the prosopographer Gilbert Bogner, that de la More was a man whom the crown considered capable of summoning men on its behalf. The historian R. A. Griffiths suggests that men such as de la More were \\"socially prominent or politically powerful\\" in their regions. De la More performed a number of legal services for his neighbours also. For example, he was executor of his friend, Sir Robert Lowther's will, and sat on an assize assessing William Stapleton's claim to an estate in Black Hall. He also presented oral evidence to his cousin William de la More's Inquisition post mortem or and acted as a mainpernor to colleagues. De la More gravitated into the service of Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury by 1452, and perhaps as early as the previous decade. Within a few years, Salisbury's sons became engaged in a bitter feud with those of the Earl of Northumberland, led by Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont. At the same time, the King was mentally incapacitated and unable to govern. The House of Lords had appointed the Duke of York protector during the King's illness, and York, in turn, made Salisbury his Lord Chancellor. Following the Yorkist victory at the First Battle of St Albans, York held another parliament towards the end of the year, and another general pardon was issued which de la More again took advantage of on 10 October 1455. Both of de la More's pardons, suggests Rawcliffe, were \\"no doubt to cover himself from charges of malpractice in office\\". In the latter document, he is listed as \\"of Comberkath, Cumberland, esq., alias gent., alias late of London\\". Wedgwood speculates that the latter designation may have been the result of de la More's attendance at the York's parliament between 1455 and 1456. =Relations with Lord Egremont= alt=scan of de la More's original petition in a 15th-century hand In July 1454 de la More petitioned the royal council that during his last period as sheriff, Lord Egremont had prevented him from carrying out his official duties. Egremont, complained de la More, had assaulted his deputy sheriffs and servants and had threatened to behead de la More. As a result of Egremont's violence, argues the medievalist R. L. Storey, \\"the one half of the shire was divided from the other\\" and de la More's tenure as sheriff was punctuated with \\"great dissensions, riots and debates\\". De la More, a protegé of Salisbury's, petitioned the council while his lord was Chancellor, probably in the knowledge that Salisbury would take the opportunity to demonstrate his good lordship to de la More. Although de la More blamed Egremont for his inability to collect £94 of shrieval dues, it seems as likely that it was the result of Scottish border raids having \\"lyth wast and destroyed\\" the Cumberland countryside. In any case, de la More was keen that he be respited the amount he had been unable to raise; this was granted on condition that de la More realise it would not set a precedent and that he swear to his losses under oath. The medievalist Peter Booth argues that de la More's preferential treatment at the Exchequer was the direct consequence of his feudal relationship with Salisbury. Later career and death De la More continued in royal service almost up to his death. The 1450s, says Rawcliffe, was a \\"were a particularly strenuous time\\" for him, as he went on multiple embassies to Scotland, sat on the local Bench as a Justice and attended parliament twice. Wedgwood suggests that his appointment as a keeper of the truce with Scotland in 1457 was one of his last appearances in public office; \\"he probably died soon after, as he is not on the 1458 or 1462 Pardon Rolls\\". Rawcliffe does not date de la More's death, merely noting that it must have been \\"well before\\" April 1463 due to references in subsequent shrieval writs. He outlived his wife Maud (or Idione), and had remarried a woman known only as Margaret; it was she who acted as executrix for de la More's will. He left no children. De la More's enemy in Cumberland, Lord Egremont, died around the same time. During the civil wars of the late 1450s, he remained loyal to Henry VI, and, acting as the King's personal bodyguard, was slain at the Battle of Northampton in June 1460.

Biography He was the son of a New Jersey weaver, went to Cincinnati when a boy, and found occupation as a stone cutter. Having developed artistic ability, as was shown by some very creditable tombstone work, he was induced by David Guid to carve busts in freestone. His first effort in this direction was the likeness of E. S. Thomas, then editor of the Cincinnati Evening Post, which was executed directly in the stone, without the intervention of plaster. Profile relief of painter Miner Kilbourne Kellogg by Clevenger, 1839, in the Smithsonian American Art Museum He subsequently devoted himself to art, and transferred his studio to New York City. Among his sitters were William Henry Harrison, Henry Clay, Martin Van Buren, Daniel Webster, Edward Everett, and Washington Allston. Specimens of his work are now preserved in the art galleries of the Boston Athenaeum, the New York and Philadelphia historical societies, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia. His bust of Daniel Webster was selected by the United States Post Office as best adapted for representation on the fifteen cent U.S. postage stamp. In 1840, he went to reside in Rome, where he executed the \\"North American Indian,\\" which was the first distinctive American piece of sculpture made in Rome, and attracted a large number of Italians to his studio. While in Italy, he contracted pulmonary phthsis by inhalation of stone dust. He died when one day's sail from Gibraltar, and his body was consigned to the ocean. Family His son, Shobal Vail Clevenger, Jr., was a noted physician.

King Haakon subsequently died in early 1204. His reign had been marked by competition between the Bagler and Birkebeiner factions for control of Norway during a period of civil war. King Haakon was succeeded as King of Norway, first by his grandson Guttorm Sigurdsson and later by the appointment of Inge Bardsson.Inga Fra Varteig (Norsk biografisk leksikon) Shortly after the death of King Haakon, Inga gave birth to a son whom she claimed was the child of the recently deceased king. Inga's claim was supported by several of King Haakon's Birkebeiner followers. However, her claim placed both her and her son in a dangerous position. Consequently, a group of Birkebeiner loyalists fled with Inga and her son from Lillehammer in eastern Norway over the mountains during the mid-winter 1205-06.

For her return to England she reached Saugor on 31 December, St Helena on 28 April 1784, and Deptford on 2 August. =Voyage 2 (1785-86)= Captain Robert Carr sailed Barwell for China, leaving the Downs on 12 March 1785. She reached Whampoa on 21 September. For her return leg she crossed the Second Bar on 14 January 1786. She reached St Helena on 6 May and Deptford on 10 August.

He would be her captain for this and her subsequent three voyages for the EIC. She left Portsmouth on 21 December 1787 and reached Madras on 5 May 1788. From there she sailed to Benkulen, which she reached on 15 July, and 15 September Whampoa, which she reached on 15 September. For her return to England she crossed the Second Bar on 29 November. She reached the Cape on 5 February 1789, and St Helena on 14 February. Barwell arrived at Long Reach on 4 April. It was during this homeward voyage that Welladvice narrowly avoided the disaster of wrecking on the Isles of Scilly as Admiral Cloudesley Shovell had in the Scilly naval disaster of 1707. Welladvice had with him a naval chronometer made by John Arnold. One night, when Welladvice calculated Barwells position, he determined that she had to be near the Isles and moored her at midnight. Daybreak revealed the rocks in front of her.Deutsches Uhrenmuseum: \\"The Development of the Marine Chronometer\\", - accessed 10 November 2014. =Voyage 4 (1790-91)= Welladvice left the Downs on 18 January 1790.

This gave him the right to act offensively vis-a-vis the French, not just defensively, should the opportunity arise. He sailed from Portsmouth on 22 May 1793, bound for Bombay. Barwell was part of a convoy that also included the East Indiamen Prince William, Lord Thurlow, William Pitt, , , Earl of Oxford, , Fort William, London, , Marquis of Landsdown, , , and Earl of Abergavenny, amongst numerous other vessels, merchant and military, most of the non-Indiamen travelling to the Mediterranean.Gentleman's magazine (May 1793), Vol 63, part. 1, p. 474.

She then visited a number of ports in area, arriving on 26 October at Tellicherry, on 12 November at Anjengo, three days later at Quilon, on 27 November at Cochin, and on 1 December at Calicut. She returned to Tellicherry on 4 December and Bombay on 14 December. On 27 February 1794 Barwell reached the Cape. She arrived at St Helena on 18 March, Galway on 20 July, and Long Reach on 31 August. =Voyage 6 (1795-96)= For her last voyage for the EIC, Welladvice left Portsmouth on 24 May 1795. Barwell reached Bombay on 3 September, Calicut on 6 November, Anjengo on 16 November, Quilon on 22 November, Calicut on 7 December, Tellicherry on 12 December, and Bombay on 28 December. On her return voyage Barwell arrived at St Helena on 22 March 1796, and Long Reach on 8 August. Barwell then left the EIC's service. However, she made one more trip for the company, but this time on contract. Convict transport Under the command of John Cameron, Barwell sailed from Portsmouth on 7 November 1797,British Library:Barwell (2). She arrived at the Cape on 21 February 1798. While sailing to Australia, Cameron suppressed a mutiny on board the Barwell. She arrived at Port Jackson on 18 May 1798. She embarked 296 male convicts; nine convicts died on the voyage. When Barwell reached Port Jackson Cameron charged Ensign George Bond, of the New South Wales Corps, with mutiny. Bond counter-sued, charging Cameron with false imprisonment, assault, defamation, deprivation of rations, false testimony, and loss of employment. Bond sought £10,000 in damages. Unfortunately, there is no record of the outcome of either case. Barwell left Port Jackson on 17 August bound for China. Between 17 September and 2 December she was at Whampoa. For her return to England she crossed the Second Bar on 20 January 1799. She reached Malacca on 22 February, the Cape on 3 May, and St Helena on 18 June. She left St Helena on 6 July in the company of the Indiamen Tellicherry, Triton, and Armenian, and under escort by the 18-gun Cornwallis. Barwell left the convoy on 24 July off the Western Islands. She arrived at Plymouth on 11 September. There she discharged her passengers, one of whom was carrying dispatches for the British government from Governor Hunter in Australia. She left Plymouth on 13 September with the 18-gun ship-sloop as escort. Barwell reached Long Reach on 17 September. Later career Lloyd's Register for 1799 has Scott & Co. as her owner, E. Redman as her master, and her trade as London and Botany Bay. In 1800 her ownership transferred to Fletcher & Co., and her master was listed as John Toole.Lloyd's Register, 1800. Her trade was given as Lisbon. On 3 February 1800, Toole received a letter of marque for Barwell. In 1805 Barwell, J.

The privately held company was founded in 1984 in Atlanta, GA by its current management, a small group of airline pilots. ATP’s initial focus was providing flight training to U.S. military pilots who were seeking their Airline Transport Pilot Certificates to transition over to commercial air carrier operations. Maintaining a focus on professional flight training, ATP later expanded its course offerings to include ab-initio training programs for domestic students seeking a career in commercial aviation. Today, ATP is the leading supplier of professionally trained pilots to the nation's regional airlines. Schools ATP Flight School has 49 (as of September, 2020) locations throughout the United States, opening several in the last year. Training ATP Flight School solely focuses on airline-oriented flight training, operating their programs with a fixed-cost, fixed timeframe training model. ATP's primary product offering is an ab-initio airline pilot training program, which provides pilot certification from zero experience through commercial multi-engine pilot, with certificated flight instructor certificates. Graduates of this program are then guaranteed a flight instructor job with the school to gain experience and build flight time to meet airline hiring minimums. Other programs offered by ATP include type ratings, aircraft dispatcher certification, and the Airline Transport Pilot Certification Training Program (ATP CTP). These programs are only offered at one of the school's locations, with all others being dedicated to flight operations. Over 1% of all general aviation flight operations in the United States is conducted by ATP, who flies over 27,400 hours per month resulting in students' earning 8,848 certificates annually (as of September, 2020). ATP is partnered with Arizona State University, and is the flight provider for its Professional Flight bachelor's degree program, based out of the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport facility. Aircraft used for the contract are painted in a special livery featuring the ASU logo and pitchfork. An ATP Piper PA-44 Seminole in ASU livery. Fleet ATP Flight School has the largest multi-engine training fleet in the world, consisting exclusively of Piper Seminoles, with the exception of one Cessna CE-525 CitationJet. A mix of Piper Archers and Cessna CE-172 Skyhawks make up their single-engine fleet, the majority going to the latter. Piper Aircraft Inc. and ATP jointly made an announcement at the 2011 National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) Annual Meeting and Convention for the sale of 30 new Piper Seminoles – a total retail value of $18 million. All of the new airplanes under the agreement are to be equipped with Garmin’s G500 glass cockpit avionics suite. In April, 2013, ATP and Piper Aircraft reached an agreement for the purchase of up to 100 Piper Archers. Initial deliveries began in late 2013, and under the agreement, all aircraft are standardized with the Garmin G500 avionics suite. A second order for an additional 100 Piper Archers was announced at the 2018 Sun 'n Fun International Fly-In and Expo and on September 19, 2018, ATP accepted delivery of its 100th Archer under the first order. As of September 2020, ATP Flight School maintained a fleet of 414 aircraft distributed among 49 locations, consisting of the following: * 171 Cessna CE-172 Skyhawks * 150 Piper Archer TXs * 92 Piper Seminoles Airline Relationships ATP Flight School has hiring relationships with 21 U.S. based regional airlines, including ExpressJet, SkyWest Airlines, Mesa Airlines, and PSA Airlines. These relationships and alliances are based on letters of understanding, or letters of agreement. While these letters vary between air carriers, in general they bestow either reduced hiring minimums for graduates of ATP or airline tuition reimbursement. In 2018, ATP and Envoy Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group, established a partnership through the Envoy Cadet Program. Under the program, flight instructors at the school are provided a path to a pilot career with American Airlines, as well as financial assistance and health benefits. As of March, 2019, the flight school reported having over 520 airline placements annually. Accidents and Incidents On December 6, 2008, a twin-engine Piper PA-44 owned by ATP Flight School experienced a mid- air collision in the Everglades. The plane was flown by an ATP instructor and student pilot. The other plane involved was a Cessna 172R owned by Pelican Flight Training, also with two passengers, an instructor and student. There were no survivors. On March 24, 2014, the flight school lost another Piper PA-44, this one in Brunswick, Georgia and also with two fatalities. The National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation reported that the wreckage was consistent with an in-flight breakup of the airframe. On June 9, 2018, a twin-engine Piper PA-44 was on an approach to landing when it experienced a microburst and hit the tops of two homes then crashed into a retention pond in Daytona Beach, Florida. The plane was flown by an ATP instructor and student pilot, both pilots experienced minor injuries.

Architecture and description The architectural historian John Newman considers Treowen the \\"most important 17th century gentry house\\" in Monmouthshire. It is constructed to a double-pile plan and built of Old Red Sandstone, with caramel-coloured ashlar blocks and green Bridgend sandstone dressings. The house was very large by local standards of the time, and commanded extensive views. Newman wrote that \\"as originally built, the height of the house must have been as daunting as the sheer repetitiveness of its design\\". The originally austere façade was altered early in its history by the addition of a porch, with a \\"classical frontispiece of distressing crudity\\", and the Jones shield. Inside the house, the ground floor rooms rise to a height of . There is an oak panelled room with plaster ceiling and Jacobean fireplace, and a great staircase of 72 stairs, the earliest datable open-well staircase in Monmouthshire. This great, or banqueting, hall originally held \\"a handsomely-carved screen\\" but the Monmouthshire antiquarian Joseph Bradney, in his multi-volume A History of Monmouthshire from the Coming of the Normans into Wales down to the Present Time, records that the screen was moved to Llanarth Court, another Herbert property, in 1898. Newman, writing in 2000, stated that the screen \\"is likely to be returned\\", a view which echoed that of Fred Hando who, writing 30 years earlier, stated; \\"the oak screen dated 1627 was transferred from Treowen where, in my opinion, it would be more happily housed\\". In his study, Houses of the Welsh Countryside, (published 1975, second edition 1988), Peter Smith concludes Treowen \\"is indeed a very magnificent building\\". Tyerman and Warner, in Arthur Mee's multi-volume study The King's England, describe it as \\"one of the finest houses in all Monmouthshire\\". Treowen is a Grade I listed building.

The park is the largest in Spain, covering including of sea area. The park attracts relatively few visitors due to its remoteness. There is no permanent population, but there might be at any given time just under 100 National Park staff members and other personnel on the islands. The archipelago has great natural value. Due to its isolation throughout history, it has remained relatively unchanged. The coastal landscape of Cabrera is often considered one of the best preserved on the Spanish coast, and indeed in all of the Mediterranean, as a result. The islands are blanketed by important colonies of seabirds and other endemic species. Due to its biotic wealth and abundance and variety of birds, the park has also been declared a Special Protection Area (SPA) for birds. It is also a Site of Community Importance (SIC), and as such is integrated into the Natura 2000 network. The park is likewise among the ranks of the Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMI) under the protocols for protected marine areas established by the Barcelona Convention. Administratively, the islands belong to the municipality of Palma de Mallorca despite their distance. History The Cabrera Castle dates from the 14th century Extension in 2019. Use of the islands by the Spanish Armed Forces from 1973 to 1986 served as an obstacle to achieving protection for the archipelago. In 1988, the Parliament of the Balearic Islands unanimously passed a resolution then sent to the Spanish Parliament \\"for the creation of the Cabrera Archipelago Maritime-Terrestrial National Park,\\" which was later enacted into law on April 29, 1991.Act 14/1991 for the Creation of the Cabrera Archipelago Maritime- Terrestrial National Park The park, in addition to the law, is governed by the \\"Master Plan for Use and Management of the Cabrera Archipelago Maritime- Terrestrial National Park\\"Pla d'ús i gestió del Parc Nacional Maritimoterrestre de l'Arxipèlag de Cabrera approved by means of Order 58/2006 on July 1, 2006 by the Government of the Balearic Islands for a six- year period. Limited military use of the area continues all the same. Visiting Cabrera Archipelago National Park is a restricted cruising destination, and boats may anchor only in the island's natural harbour or during the day in one other specified area.

The papier-mâché works are also called \\"carton piedra\\" (rock cardboard) for the rigidness of the final product. These sculptures today are generally made for certain yearly celebrations, especially for the Burning of Judas during Holy Week and various decorative items for Day of the Dead. However, they also include piñatas, mojigangas, masks, dolls and more made for various other occasions. There is also a significant market for collectors as well. Papier- mâché was introduced into Mexico during the colonial period, originally to make items for church. Since then, the craft has developed, especially in central Mexico. In the 20th century, the creation of works by Mexico City artisans Pedro Linares and Carmen Caballo Sevilla were recognized as works of art with patrons such as Diego Rivera. The craft has become less popular with more recent generations, but various government and cultural institutions work to preserve it. History Burning of Judas early 20th century Cartonería, the making of three-dimensional sculptures with papier-mâché, is part of Mexico's tradition of paper based handcrafts. Paper was developed in the region during the Mesoamerican period using the bark of a type of fig tree called amate or the fibers of the maguey plant. The Spanish banned its production after the Conquest, because of its use in religious rites, forcing the conversion to European and Asian produced paper. However, the ban never was complete and the production of amate paper still continues especially in parts of Puebla and Veracruz states. A kind of \\"proto-cartonería\\" was done in the early colonial period. At this time, layers of paper were affixed using animal glue to make versions of religious icons to be used in processions. Modern papier-mâché was introduced into Mexico around the 17th century as a way to make objects for churches with its use most developed in central Mexico. In Celaya, the creation of these figures became a trade much the way metalwork and pottery did, with the work dominated by certain families. Since this time, the technique has been used to make a wide variety of objects for both ritual, festival and decorative use, mostly by poorer indigenous and mestizo communities. The paper and cardboard used is mostly waste paper, such as old newspapers and boxes, with decorative elements, such as crepe paper being new. Most shapes are created with molds, then painted with acrylics. Most of the production since colonial times has followed the annual calendar of religious and civic events. Today, this includes figures of horses with wheels for Epiphany, figures of Judas Iscariot to burn for Holy Saturday, parrots for May and clowns for June. For the feast of John the Evangelist, traditional figures include ponies, clowns and dolls with movable legs and arms. For Independence Day in September, objects include play helmets and swords, along with images of eagles and Father Hidalgo. Day of the Dead produces figures such as skeletons which \\"dance\\" when dangled on the end of a string, skulls and coffins, with Christmas producing nativity scenes and traditional piñatas with points. Year round production includes piñatas for birthday parties, which usually represent figures from popular culture as well as mojigangas, masks, alebrijes and dolls. There is also a significant market for items created for collectors. Cartonería doll from second half of 20th century Cartonería doll and decorated cartonería skull Giant alebrije being painted at the Fábrica de Artes y Oficios Oriente center in Mexico City Mexico City has the best known production of cartonería, with markets such as La Merced, Jamaica and Sonora centers for its sale. Celaya is known for its production of cardboard and papier-mâché toys and masks, which begins in January and February in time for Carnival. Toys include \\"Prussian\\" helmets and swords and dolls whose arms and legs are movable which often have the name of the child painted on the chest. The masks represent clowns, devils, goats, witches, old people, sultans, monkeys and beautiful women. They are formed using clay, wood or plaster molds, and then decorated with paint and other materials for create details such as mustaches. The Cora indigenous population in Jesús María, El Nayar and Santa Teresa communities in Nayarit create papier-mâché maks for Holy Week, often to depict the Pharisees. These are generally placed in the river on Holy Saturday to dissolve as an act of purification. Cartonería work received a boost from the work of 20th century artisans such as Pedro Linares and Carmen Caballero Sevilla, who created more artistic works, reinventing traditional forms and creating new ones. These caught the attention of artists such as Diego Rivera and academics, creating a new market related to collectors. The Linares family remains internationally known for its creations, and has trained other artists such as Ruben Guzman in Oakland, CA . Despite its historic importance, fewer of the younger generations are dedicating themselves to the crafts as many of the areas known for it, such as Mexico City and Celaya, continue to urbanize. To counter this, cultural centers and institutions such as CONACULTA give workshops and sponsor events such as contests to keep the craft viable. The parish of San Pedro Apostol in Tepotzotlan has an annual event dedicated to promoting cartonería among youth in preparation for Day of the Dead. Creaturas de Papel, headed by Nancy Chávez and Gabriel Granados, is a workshop for cartonería in Tepotzotlan. Its work has been presented in venues such as the Popular Culture Museum of Toluca and at the Festival de las Almas in Valle de Bravo . While cartonería figures such as piñatas, alebrijes and skeletons are well-known, one type of figure, dolls has not maintained it popularity as much. The Miss Lupita project was founded by artista Carolina Esparragoza of Mexico City to rescue and promote the making of dolls of cartonería as well as other figures such as lucha libre figures, mermaids, and even Godzillas. The project involves a number of artisans in Mexico which make, promote and give workshops on the making of these doll figures. In 2011, Esparragoza traveled to Japan to give workshops and exhibit figures made in relation to the project at the Sokei Academy and the Sagio Plaza Gallery in Tokyo. Piñatas Piñatas hanging in a traditional Mexican market While piñatas are found at parties year round, they are most traditional for the Christmas season, especially during the weeks prior when \\"posadas\\" are celebrated. These posadas reenact the search of Joseph and Mary for a place to stay before giving birth to Jesus. The piñata came to Mexico from Europe during the colonial period, although the practice of breaking a container with treats inside originated in Asia. In Mexico, the tradition is that of an old pot with decorations with seasonal fruit, candy and other prizes for children, with these children taking turns to try and break the piñatas while blindfolded. Today, most piñatas are made with cartonería and decorated with crepe paper and other items. The most traditional shape is that of a star with five to nine points. However, for other occasions, such as birthdays, piñatas often are the shape of animals, clowns and figures from popular culture. Burning of Judas Judas figure in progress One of the more important traditions associated with cartonería in Mexico is that of the Burning of Judas on Holy Saturday. This began in the colonial period, with two possible origins. The first says it came with the Spanish, more specifically by the Franciscan friars for evangelization purposes. The second says it began as a parody of the executions held by the Inquisition, with cartonería dolls given to children as representing heretics. The Judas are hollow figures of cardboard and papier- mâché which are usually larger than life size and can be as large as three to four meters tall. They generally have a wicker frame, painted in bright colors with fireworks attached to various parts of the body. These are set off to burn the figure and to express anger towards Judas Iscariot for his betrayal of Jesus over two thousand years ago. However, these figures are not meant to be historically accurate as they are meant to depict Judas after the betrayal. They often take the same of a deformed human/devil but other images from the culture have also appears. From early in the colonial period, they have taken on political themes, starting with images of Spanish soldiers and viceroys, and later leaders such as Antonio López de Santa Anna and Maximiliano I . However, not all Judas figures represent hated people but also those who are loved such as mythological figures, those from history and artists. They can also be found in forms from popular culture such as charros, clowns, Catrinas and even famous people such as Cantinflas . Originally, Judas figures, like ones in Europe, were made relatively small and from various materials. Over time, they came to be done almost exclusively from cartonería with sizes as large as eleven meters tall. There is one notable artisan of Judas figures, Carmen Caballero Sevillas in Mexico City. She originally created and sold her work at the Abelardo Rodriguez market when Rivera discovered her and invited her to work at his studio. Her work not only found in paintings by Rivera but by Rufino Tamayo as well. Her work today can be found displayed at the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo in Mexico City, with temporary exhibits such as the 2009 exhibition of her work at the Museo Nacional de Culturas Populares . Judas figures are still produced and burned in places such as Mexico City, Celaya, Toluca, Atlacomulco and Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl . However, the tradition of burning these effigies, along with the many firecrackers that are on them has diminished since the mid 20th century, due to restriction on explosives. This had the effect of putting many cartonería craftsmen out of business as this and works for Day of the Dead are the two main seasons for the craft. Mojigangas Mojigangas at a parade in San Juan de los Lagos, Jalisco Similar to those used in traditional festivals in some parts of Europe and Asia, mojigangas are giant papier-mâché figures worn by dancers which can be found in Mexico. Like the Judas figures, these are hollow with wicker frames covered in papier-mâché then painted and decorated. The figures have oversized heads and small bodies which are often of devils, angels or male/female figures. One of the best known mojigangas in Mexico are those that are in the opening parade of the Guelaguetza festival in Oaxaca . Toritos Toritos (little bulls) are wood or wicker frames with papier-mâché built in the form of a bull with a tall towers on its back. This tower then holds a quantity of fireworks. During festivals, this bull figure is carried by one or more persons and the fireworks are set off. Areas where this tradition is strong includes Cuetzalan in the north of Puebla state and San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato. Day of the Dead Skulls and skeletons for Day of the Dead in a market in Guanajuato Day of the Dead creates a large demand for various paper crafts, mostly to adorn altars to family members and others who have died. Traditional markets fill with various kinds of decorations for the holiday, especially candies, papel picado and cartonería figures. One major figure done in cartonería for Day of the Dead is the \\"Catrina\\" a skeletal woman dressed in the finery of the late 19th century. She is the creation of Jose Guadalupe Posada . In Aguascalientes, a group of youth called Juventud Tultepec created a giant Catrina figure of cartonería fifteen meters tall. It was created for the XVII Festival de Calaveras (Festival of Skulls) in honor of Posada. In Oaxaca and the State of Mexico, \\"entierritos\\" (little buried ones) are small figures often of monks, made of paper with chickpea heads. These are placed in small coffins of cardboard. Other similar figures include cardboard coffins with a skull that rises when a string is pulled. In Celaya, skull masks of different shapes and sizes are popular as well as skeletal figures which move similar to that of a marionette, often with a guitar or riding a skeletal horse. Cartonería made by Mexico City's Linares family plays a large part in the large altar for Day of the Dead at the Dolores Olmedo Museum, which is set up to honor the museum's namesake along with Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo . The restaurant chain El Bajio sponsors a giant Day of the Dead altar in its flagship restaurant in Azcapotzalco which features cartonería with representations of the various regions of the country. The Linares family and alebrijes Alebrije bird sculpture by Pedro Linares Entry in the annual Mexico City monumental alebrije parade dedicated to Pedro Linares The best known cartonería enterprise is that of the Linares family in Mexico City, with an international reputation for forms such as skeletons, skulls, Judas figures and fantastical creatures called \\"alebrijes.\\" The family's fame began with Pedro Linares who created cartonería figures as a seasonal occupation. Sometime prior to the 1950s, Pedro began to create more inventive figures including the alebrijes. The inventiveness of the work allowed them to not only sell their wares in traditional markets but they also began to sell them at the Angel de la Independencia monument in the fashionable Zona Rosa neighborhood, gaining them patronage with artists and scholars. This allowed the family business to survive the near ban on Judas figures which occurred in the city after a 1957 explosion at a warehouse. The fame of the Linares work went international as a result of the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, when they were contracted by Dolores Olmedo to create life sized skeletal figures of Olympic athletes. While such animated figures have been common for Day of the Dead, it was the first time such was done on a large scale. This led to their work being sought out by museums and others in the United States and Europe. In 1990 Pedro Linares received the distinguished National Award for Science and Art from the Mexican government. Despite questions as to whether the tradition would make it into the succeeding generation, not only do Pedro Linares' three sons dedicate themselves to the craft full-time, three grandsons are also involved in the family business and have made their own innovations such as skeletons depicting prostitutes, drug addicts and sports participants. For Day of the Dead in 1986, Felipe Linares was commissioned to commemorate the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. This resulted in called \\"La Muerte Tembloroso\\" (Death in Tremors) with over fifty life sized skeletons to represent key incidents with figures such as firemen, victims under rubble, injured people, soldiers and even a looter with a television set. One figure commemorates a person known as \\"El Pulga\\" (the flea) a skinny rescuer known for going into small spaces under collapsed buildings. The work was controversial at the time, but it was also used to raise money for the victims in Europe. The family continues to work in various spaces all located a few blocks behind the Sonora Market in Mexico City. The business relies heavily on an apprenticeship system to allow for a \\"common visual language.\\" This allows the various family members to work on parts of a large scale order but for all the pieces to fit together as a whole at the end. The family works collectively to produce not only individual orders, but also major works for institutions such as \\"The Atomic Apocalypse\\" piece created for the British Museum. Works by the family have also been exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the British Museum, the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles and the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow . The two most common themes in the Linares' work are the animated skeleton and the alebrije. Both are based on the forms and techniques used to make Judas figures and there are early works by the families of human Judas figures with animal heads and wings. According to the family, Pedro Linares came up with the concept of alebrijes as a young man sick in bed with a high fever, dreaming of them and the name. After he became well again, he began to create the monsters he saw in his dreams. Despite the story, Pedro Linares himself admitted that the creatures evolved over his lifetime. These creatures are often a composite of various real and imaginary animals painted in bright colors and wild designs. The creating of these creatures soon spread to Celaya and then into the state of Oaxaca, where there are carved from wood rather than shaped from paper products. Examples of these creatures can be found in various museums in Mexico including the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo as well as the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City. The grand scale of imitation has had its benefits and drawbacks. Since their invention, alebrijes have morphed into more contemporary forms with images from rock stars, superheroes and more. Daniel Barrera is a known cartonería artist from Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl. His alebrije works tend to be based on popular culture, especially rock bands such as Judas Priest as well as the alebrije tradition. However, the family notes that there is a serious problem with other artists passing off their wares as from the Linares family. The Day of the Dead season is the busiest for the Linares Family, with interest in the holiday in the United States and Europe translating to even more business for the enterprise. Their animated skeletons are known for their variety with those that dance, ride skateboards and do any number of common occupations past and present such as streetcar driver. They produce multicolored cardboard and paper skulls in various sizes although the most common is about 75 cm tall. These skulls have various themes such as Don Quixote, street vendors of various types, bullfighters and figures from popular culture. They also make a version to imitate the sugar skulls created for Day of the Dead, which are profusely decorated with flowers, birds and other items. Their work has stood out for its ability to reinvent classic themes of Mexican cartonería.

Originally authorized as USS Dumaran (ARG-14), an internal combustion engine repair ship, she was renamed and reclassified as an aircraft repair ship 22 February 1944; launched 22 May 1944 by Bethlehem Fairfield Shipyard, Inc., Baltimore, MD, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. E. A. Forde, Jr., and commissioned 7 December 1944, Captain A. H. Bergeson in command. Sailing from Norfolk 2 March 1945 Chourre arrived at Pearl Harbor 12 April to embark aviation personnel for Espiritu Santo, where she arrived 29 April. She transferred an aviation repair unit to Saipan, then sailed to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, for duty as station supply ship replenishing carriers from 26 May to 17 July. Except for one trip to Guam to replenish stores (17 July-7 August) she remained at San Pedro Bay until 24 October when she sailed for Tokyo Bay to serve ships taking part in the occupation. On 1 January 1946 Chourre sailed from Yokosuka for San Francisco, arriving 4 May. She was placed out of commission 28 November 1948 at Stockton, CA. Recommissioned 21 February 1952 during the Korean war, Chourre cleared San Francisco 1 September for the Western Pacific. She operated out of Japan supplying ships off Korea until 28 February 1953, returning to San Francisco 26 March. Local operations off San Diego were followed by another tour in the Far East between 17 August 1953 and 11 April 1954. After her third tour to the western Pacific from 30 August 1954 to 1 March 1955, Chourre returned to San Diego where she remained until placed out of commission in reserve again 13 September 1955. She was struck from the Naval Register in 1961 and transferred to the Maritime Commission. After 10 years laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Chourre was sold to Union Minerals & Alloys for scrapping on 5 February 1971. The ship was named for my grandfather Commander Emile Chourre, a distinguished naval aviator who was killed in service. Chourre received 3 battle stars for service in the Korean war.

The novel follows the love triangle between a doctor, his wife, and his childhood friend, which eventually causes each of the three characters to lose the ones they love. Originally published by the literary magazine Poedjangga Baroe in three instalments from April to June 1940, it was the magazine's only published novel. It was also the first Indonesian psychological novel. Belenggu was based on themes present in two of Pane's early short stories: \\"Barang Tiada Berharga\\" (\\"Worthless Thing\\"; 1935) and \\"Lupa\\" (\\"Forget\\"; 1936). The resulting novel, written to represent a stream of consciousness and using ellipses and monologues to show internal struggle, was very different from earlier Indonesian novels. Unlike said works, which kept to traditional themes such as good versus evil, Belenggu mainly focused on its characters' psychological conflict. It also showed modernity and traditionalism as a binary system, unable to reach a compromise. After completion, Belenggu was offered to the Dutch colonial government's state publisher, Balai Pustaka, in 1938, but rejected as \\"immoral\\". It was then picked up by Poedjangga Baroe. Initial critical reception to the novel was mixed. Proponents argued that it served as an honest representation of the internal conflicts faced by Indonesian intellectuals, while opponents dismissed the novel as \\"pornographic\\" because of its inclusion of prostitution and adultery as normal facets of life. Later reviews have been more positive: in 1976, the writer Muhammad Balfas called Belenggu \\"in every respect the best novel of pre-war Indonesian literature\\". The novel has been translated into several languages, including into English in 1989. Background The author, Armijn Pane, in 1953 The first modern Indonesian novels published by the state-owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies Balai Pustaka were often written to show intergenerational conflict and conflict between traditional (adat) and modern culture. These novels, published beginning in the 1920s, spearheaded the use of Indonesian as a national language. This national awakening, which was also realised through political actions, was followed in July 1933 with the establishment of the literary magazine Poedjangga Baroe (New Writer). The literary magazine, which Belenggu's author Armijn Pane helped establish, was the first written mainly in Indonesian and with exclusively Indonesian editors. Of the staff and contributors to Poedjangga Baroe, Pane was one of the biggest proponents for Westernisation. While others, such as his elder brother Sanusi, stressed the need for \\"Asian\\" values, the younger Pane disregarded conventional Indonesian morality. The literary historian Heather Sutherland writes that this may have been a result of Pane's education at a school for Dutch children; the others received Dutch- language education for Indonesians. Plot The novel begins as Sukartono (Tono), a Dutch-trained doctor, and his wife Sumartini (Tini), residents of Batavia (modern day Jakarta), are suffering a marital breakdown. Tono is busy treating his patients, leaving no time for him to be with Tini. In response, Tini has become active in numerous social organisations and women's groups, leaving her little time to deal with household work. This further distances Tono from her, as he expects her to behave like a traditional wife and be waiting for him at home, with dinner ready, when he returns from work. One day, Tono receives a call from a Miss Eni, who asks him to treat her at a hotel. After Tono arrives at the hotel where Eni is staying, he discovers that she is actually his childhood friend Rohayah (Yah). Yah, who has had romantic feelings for Tono since childhood, begins seducing him, and after a while, he accepts her advances. The two begin furtively meeting, often taking long walks at the port Tanjung Priok. When Tini goes to Surakarta to attend a women's congress, Tono decides to stay at Yah's house for a week. While at Yah's, Tono and Yah discuss their pasts. Tono reveals that after he graduated from elementary school in Bandung, where he studied with Yah, he attended medical school in Surabaya and married Tini for her beauty. Meanwhile, Yah was forced to marry an older man and move to Palembang. After deciding that life as a wife was not for her, she moved to Batavia and became a prostitute, before serving as a Dutchman's mistress for three years. Tono falls further in love with Yah, as he feels that she is more likely to be a proper wife for him; Yah, however, does not consider herself ready for marriage. Tono, a fan of traditional kroncong music, is asked to judge a singing competition at Gambir Market. While there, he discovers that Yah is also his favourite singer, who sings under the pseudonym Siti Hayati. At Gambir, he also meets with his old friend Hartono, a political activist with the political party Partindo, who enquires about Tini. On a later date, Hartono visits Tono's home and meets Tini. It is revealed that Tini was romantically involved with Hartono while the two of them were in university, where Tini surrendered her virginity to him; this action, unacceptable in traditional culture, made her disgusted with herself and unable to love. Hartono had made the situation worse by breaking off their relationship through a letter. When Hartono asks her to take him back, Tini refuses. Tini discovers that Tono has been having an affair, and is furious. She then goes to meet Yah. However, after a long talk she decides that Yah is better for Tono and tells the former prostitute to marry him; Tini then moves back to Surabaya, leaving Tono in Batavia. However, Yah feels that she would only ruin Tono's respected status as a doctor because of her history. She decides to move to New Caledonia, leaving a note for Tono as well as a record with a song recorded especially for him as a way of saying goodbye. On the way to New Caledonia, Yah pines for Tono and hears his voice calling from afar, giving a speech on the radio. Tono, now alone, dedicates himself to his work in an attempt to fill the void left in his heart. Characters ;Sukartono :Sukartono (abbreviated as Tono) is a doctor, Tini's husband and Yah's lover. He treats poor patients for free and thus is well- liked by the general populace. He is also a big fan of traditional kroncong music: in medical school he preferred to sing rather than study, and as a doctor he keeps a radio in his treatment room. Suffering from loneliness in his loveless marriage with the modern-minded Tini, he becomes involved with Yah, whom he perceives as being more willing to play the traditional wife. However, when Tini and Yah leave him, he is left alone. :The Australian scholar of Indonesian literature A. Johns writes that Tono's inner turmoil is caused by his inability to understand Tini, Yah, or the bacteria which he must kill to cure his patients. ;Sumartini :Sumartini (abbreviated as Tini) is Tono's ultra-modern wife. While in university, she was very popular and enjoyed partying. During this time she lost her virginity to Hartono, an act which is viewed as unacceptable in traditional Indonesian culture; when Hartono left her, Tini became increasingly aloof and distant from men. After marrying Tono, she felt increasingly lonely and became involved in social work as an effort to give her life meaning. After learning of Tono's infidelity and seeing that Yah could take better care of him, Tini leaves her husband and moves to Surabaya. :Yoseph Yapi Taum, a lecturer at Sanata Dharma University in Yogyakarta, views Tini's aloof nature as a major force driving Tono to Yah; her lifestyle, of which Tono is not a part, alienates him and drives him to find a more traditional woman. Tham Seong Chee, a political scientist from Singapore, views her as a weak-willed character, unwilling to act before meeting Hartono again and even then unable to solve her marital difficulties with Tono. He also sees her as being fettered by her own values, which are incompatible with those held by the general Indonesian populace. The Indonesian writer and literary critic Goenawan Mohamad views her as driven in part by the stress placed on her by her husband's expectations. ;Rohayah :Rohayah (also known by the pseudonyms Nyonya Eni and Siti Hayati; abbreviated Yah) is Tono's childhood friend and later lover, as well as a popular kroncong singer. After Tono, who is three years her elder, graduated from elementary school, Yah was forcibly married to a man twenty years her senior and brought from Bandung to Palembang. After escaping him and returning to Bandung, where she found that her parents had died, she moved to Batavia and became a prostitute; she also became a popular kroncong singer under the pseudonym Siti Hayati. When she discovers that Tono has become a doctor in Batavia, she pretends to be a patient and seduces him. Although the two fall deeply in love, Yah decides to leave Tono and move to New Caledonia because she feels that society would view the doctor poorly if he married a former prostitute. :Tham sees Yah as being a good match for Tono in personality, as she shows a willingness to serve as the traditional wife. The American scholar of Indonesian literature Harry Aveling writes that Yah's employment as a prostitute was likely a capitulation by Pane to cultural constraints; Indonesian readers at the time would not have accepted Tono having an affair with someone of the same socio-economic status. Mohamad describes her as being fatalistic and notes that she downplays her past by saying that any of a thousand girls in Tanjung Priok could tell the same story; he found her touching without being melodramatic, and notes that Yah was the first prostitute featured portrayed sympathetically in an Indonesian work. ;Hartono :Hartono is Tini's lover from university; he was also Tono's friend. After hearing that Tini enjoys partying, he approaches her and they begin dating. After they have sex, he breaks off their relationship through a letter. He then drops out of university and becomes involved with the nascent nationalist movement, following future-president Sukarno; these acts cause his family to disown him. He later comes to Batavia to search for Tono and is surprised to find that Tini has married the doctor. Hartono asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He then goes to Surabaya. :Clive Christie, a lecturer on Southeast Asian Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, describes Hartono as the only overtly political character in the novel. ;Women's group :The various members of Tini's women's group, including Mrs. Sutatmo, Mrs. Padma, Mrs. Rusdio, and Aminah, aid her in planning different social events. Mrs. Rusdio is Tini's friend from university. Aminah was one of Tini's competitors for Tono and enjoys interfering in the couple's lives. The other two disapprove of Tini's modernness and her lack of attention to Tono. ;Servants :Tono and Tini are served by two men, Karno and Abdul. Karno, Tono's loyal manservant, dislikes Tini and considers her overly emotional. Abdul is their driver, who usually drives Tono to meet his patients. Influences Bakri Siregar, an Indonesian literary critic associated with the socialist literary organisation Lekra, notes that Pane was influenced in part by Sigmund Freud's theories on psychoanalysis; he writes that it is most evident in the dialogue, especially that of Tini. Taum, while noting psychoanalysis' influence, notes that the novel follows the individual characters stream of consciousness, which gives the reader a greater understanding of the characters and their conflicts. The novel was written in the middle of the writer's career, and two of Pane's earlier short stories, \\"Barang Tiada Berharga\\" (\\"Worthless Thing\\"; 1935) and \\"Lupa\\" (\\"Forget\\"; 1936), contained plot points used in Belenggu. \\"Barang Tiada Berharga\\" also dealt with a doctor and his wife, named Pardi and Haereni, who were characterised in a similar manner as Sukartono and Sumartini, while \\"Lupa\\" introduced the main character Sukartono. As the reigning Dutch colonial government forbade the involvement of politics in literature, Pane minimised the explicit effects of colonialism in the novel. Taum writes that Belenggu theme of contrasting modernity and traditionalism may have been influenced by, or even written as a response to, Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana's 1936 novel Layar Terkembang (With Sails Unfurled), which dealt with a similar theme but fully supported modernisation. Style Belenggu uses ellipses and internal monologues heavily to represent the main characters' turmoil; the Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw calls it a \\"three-pronged interior monologue\\", noting that the novel has minimal use of descriptive passages and dialogue. Unlike works published by Balai Pustaka, Belenggu does not provide full exposition; instead, it only explicitly states key points and leaves the rest for the reader to interpret, thus inviting more active participation. Siregar notes that the characters are introduced one at a time, almost as if the novel were a film; he writes that, as a result, at times the transition between characters is unclear. Unlike authors of earlier works published by Balai Pustaka, Pane does not use old Malay proverbs; he instead uses similes. Another way in which he writes differently from earlier writers is by limiting his use of the Dutch language; earlier writers such as Abdul Muis and Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana had used Dutch words – representative of the dominant colonial power – to illustrate the intellectualism of the main characters. Instead, in Belenggu Pane relies on the Indonesianised loanwords, with a glossary of difficult or uncommon words provided with early editions of the novel. Siregar wrote that Pane's language reflected the actual use of Indonesian well. Symbolism According to Taum, the title Belenggu reflects the inner conflicts the main characters face that limit their actions. Taum points to the climax of the novel – in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past – as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past. Uncommonly for Indonesian literature during this time period, Belenggu chapters were labelled with only a number – other works, such as Abdul Muis' 1928 novel Salah Asuhan (Wrong Upbringing), gave both a number and subtitle to the chapters. According to Taum, this change in style represents a stream of consciousness, as opposed to the earlier style which kept chapters separate. Themes =General= Teeuw notes that, unlike most Indonesian novels at the time, Belenggu did not feature a good and pure protagonist in a struggle against an evil antagonist, or present conflict and differences between generations. It also eliminated the common themes of forced marriage and the youth's nonacceptance of adat (traditional culture). Instead, it showed a love triangle – common in Western literature but then unheard of in Indonesian literature – without an indication of whether any characters were good, evil, right, or wrong. Teeuw writes that the novel portrayed the interior struggle of a \\"new kind of human\\", one who is the result of a mixture of Eastern and Western cultures. According to Christie, earlier themes in Indonesian literature such as feudalism and forced marriage are not intrinsically significant to the character's lives in Belenggu. =Living in the past= A main theme found in Belenggu, reflected in the title, is if one is \\"shackled\\" to the past, then one cannot flourish; Taum notes that this is reflected in Hartono's dialogue to Tini, as follows: > \\"Mengapa tidak? Mengapa bergantung kepada zaman dahulu? ... Jangan dibesar- > besarkan, jangan persusah perkara mudah, nanti pikiran sebagai dibelenggu. > ... Lupakanlah, matikanlah angan-angan. Lepaskanlah belenggu ini. Buat apa > tergantung pada zaman dulu?\\" > \\"Why not? Why be hung up on the past? ... Don't blow it out of proportion, > don't complicate simple things, your thoughts will be as if they are > shackled. ... Forget it, kill those reveries. Release these shackles. Why be > hung up on the past? Several further instances have been expounded by critics. Taum notes that Yah's guilt over her past as a prostitute leads her to the (unfounded) fear that Tono would leave her if their relationship were known; her guilt ultimately causes their separation, while Tono feels nostalgic for the past, in which he felt happier. Balfas notes that a factor driving Tono from Tini is the latter's former relationship with Hartono; due to her guilt over the affair, she is unable to express her love for the doctor. Siregar writes that such a theme is reflected in dialogue between Tono and Hartono, from which he suggests the novel derives its title. Balfas writes that there is no solution to the human problems presented in the novel. =Modernity and traditionalism= Taum indicates that Belenggu presents modernity and traditionalism as a binary system, contrasting the new with the old. For example, Sukartono, a doctor (a position considered a symbol of modernity), is obsessed with the past, including his schoolmate Rohayah, and prefers traditional kroncong music over modern genres. Through the contrast of Sukartono and his ultra-modern, emancipatory wife Sumartini, Pane emphasises that modernity does not necessarily bring happiness. Aveling agrees, writing that the conflict arises over Tini's refusal to \\"mother\\" her husband as expected from a traditional wife. According to Taum, Tono wishes for Tini to perform traditional duties, such as removing his shoes. However, Tini, refuses to do so and instead keeps herself busy with social activities. This need for a wife who behaves as he wishes ultimately becomes a factor in his falling for Yah, who does everything expected from a traditional wife. However, in the end neither modern nor traditional values alone are enough to guarantee happiness. =Intellectuals in society= Christie notes that Belenggu contains a strong sense of alienation. He writes that the characters seem to be part of a \\"society suspended in a vacuum\\", without an explicit connection to colonialism but also unable to come to terms with traditional mores. Christie describes Sukartono's relationship with Rohayah as symbolic of attempts by intellectual to engage with the masses through a shared popular culture, but ultimately failing; Taum notes such a thing occurring in a scene where Tini plays a sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven on her violin in front of a group of regular citizens who prefer local music. Teeuw agrees, writing that the novel shows a psychological burden borne by native intellectuals who found themselves physically fit for a modern existence, but mentally unprepared for the transition from a traditional lifestyle to a more modern one. He notes that the sceptical, modern intellectual, a category in which he includes Tono and Tini, was uncommon in local literature at the time. Tham sees the underlying message of Yah's refusal to marry Tono as that \\"morals and ethical standards are frequently beyond the ken of intellect, reason, or rationality\\", indicating that intellectuals may not be able to collaborate effectively with the masses. Johns notes that, although the Tono and Tini are thought to be decisive persons by society, they are actually confused and unsure. Release Belenggu was submitted to Balai Pustaka for publication in 1938, but was accepted because of its perceived dissonance with public morality, particularly its portrayal of adultery and prostitution – key components of the plot – as acceptable. Eventually Belenggu was picked up by Poedjangga Baroe and published in a serial format in three editions between April and June 1940. Belenggu was the only novel published by the magazine and the first Indonesian psychological novel. In 1969, Belenggu received the first annual Literary Prize from the government of Indonesia, along with Marah Rusli's Sitti Nurbaya (1922), Salah Asuhan, and Achdiat Karta Mihardja's Atheis (Atheist; 1949). Belenggu has been translated into multiple languages: in 1962, Mandarin as 桎梏 (Zhìgù); in 1964, Russian as Okovy; in 1965, Malay under the original title; in 1989, English as Shackles; and in 1993, German as In Fesseln. The Russian translation was done by A Pavlenko. The English translation, published by the Lontar Foundation, was done by John H. McGlynn. The German translation was done by Renate Lödel. the Indonesian-language edition has seen twenty-one printings. Reception Belenggu received a mixed reception upon its release. Proponents of the novel stated that it was daring, as it dealt with themes based on societal realities. For example, journalist S. K. Trimurti wrote that the novel clearly reflected issues faced by highly educated Indonesians in dealing with traditional culture. However, opponents of the novel dismissed it as \\"pornographic\\", emphasising traditionally taboo acts like prostitution and adultery. The December 1940 issue of Poedjangga Baroe included comments from several other writers and literary critics, including Alisjahbana, HB Jassin, Karim Halim, and S. Djojopoespito. Alisjahbana wrote that the novel was fatalistic and defeatist, as he felt it did not portray the freedom of spirit necessary for people to choose their own destiny; he decried the plot as lacking causality. Jassin found the characters to resemble caricatures, as their emotions were overly melodramatic, but considered the novel representative of works yet to come. Halim wrote that Belenggu represented a new school in Indonesian literature, with new language and new stories. Djojopoespito decried the book's language, which he did not consider smooth, and plotlines, which he found uninteresting. According to Teeuw, the initial mixed reception was due in part to Indonesian readers – accustomed to idealised literature – being shocked by the realistic portrayals in Belenggu. Later reviews have generally been more positive. In 1955 Johns wrote that Belenggu was a \\"great advance on any previous work\\", with which the Indonesian novel came to maturity; he praises the structure, plot, and presentation. Siregar, writing in 1964, praised the novel's diction, noting that Pane handled technical discussions especially well. Jassin wrote in 1967 that, although he found the characters still came across as caricatures, the novel was capable of making readers stop and think about modern conditions. In 1969, Indonesian writer and literary critic Ajip Rosidi wrote that the novel was more interesting than earlier works because of its multi-interpretable ending. The Indonesian writer and literary critic Muhammad Balfas wrote in 1976 that Belenggu was \\"in every respect the best novel of pre-war Indonesian literature\\". In his 1980 book on Indonesian literature, Teeuw wrote that despite several flaws in the psychological portrayal of the main characters, Belenggu was the only novel from before the Indonesian National Revolution in which a Western reader would feel truly involved; he also called the novel Pane's greatest contribution to Indonesia literature. Tham, writing in 1981, described the novel as the best reflection of the then-growing consciousness that Western values, such as individualism and intellectualism, contradicted traditional values.

He was bred in the kennels of Kathleen, Duchess of Newcastle, and became the constant companion of the King. After the King's death in 1910, the dog attended the funeral and walked in the procession in prominence ahead of nine kings and other heads of state. Caesar has been the subject of paintings, and a hand crafted hardstone model created by the House of Fabergé. Early life Caesar was born Caesar of Notts in 1898, and was sired by Cackler of Notts. He came from the kennels of Kathleen, Duchess of Newcastle, and was given to King Edward VII by Lord Dudley in 1902 to replace the King's dog Jack who had died after choking on food. Royal life During his life with the King, he had a footman assigned to him to clean him and was allowed to sleep on an easy chair next to the King's bed. He wore a collar that read \\"I am Caesar. I belong to the King\\". Caesar would always greet the King excitedly, and the King would often say \\"Do you like your old master, then?\\" while the dog was jumping up and down in excitement. Edward would never hit Caesar, but instead tell him off by shaking his walking stick at him while calling him a \\"naughty dog\\". Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst, reminisced about spending time with the dog whilst on the royal yacht, \\"Whenever I went into the King's cabin, this dog always went for my trousers and worried them, much to the King's delight. I used not to take the slightest notice and went on talking all the time to the King which I think amused His Majesty still more.\\" Caesar frequently caused problems for the King, escaping in Marienbad whilst chasing white peafowl and on another occasion killing rabbits owned by Lord Redesdale's daughters. The King even considered Caesar to be an obstacle to the Entente Cordiale. He asked his personal attendant, Lawrence Wrightson, to look after Caesar should he die before the dog. Caesar, accompanied by a highlander, at the King's funeral procession The King ordered hardstone models of his favourite dogs and racehorses from the House of Fabergé. Caesar was at the King's side on the Norfolk estate when the initial wax models were revealed by the company. The model of Caesar was made of chalcedony, rubies, enamel and gold, and included Caesar's collar in the design. The finished model did not arrive until after the King's death, and was purchased by Dame Margaret Greville, who gave the figure to Queen Alexandra. A painting of the dog was also created by Reuben Ward Binks for the King. After the death of the King on 6 May 1910, Caesar refused to eat, and would spend time whining outside the King's bedroom. At one point, he managed to sneak into the King's bedroom and was found hiding under his bed by Queen Alexandra. The Queen encouraged him to eat once more and restored him to his normal self. Caesar attended the funeral of Edward VII, and led the funeral procession with a highlander walking behind the carriage that carried the King's coffin. He was placed ahead of the heads of state in the procession, including King George V and eight other Kings, an act of which Kaiser Wilhelm II of the German Empire disapproved. Later life Caesar's grave at Marlborough House Within a month of the funeral an unofficial book was published, Where's Master?, giving a first person account of Caesar from the king's death up to the funeral, something which made Queen Mary furious. The book was successful, running to nine reprints in the first year. After the King's death, a portrait of the dog was painted once more, this time by Maud Earl. The painting entitled Silent Sorrow, features Caesar resting his head on the King's favourite chair. The Steiff company produced stuffed toys based on Caesar around 1910. He remained in the Royal household after the death of the king, although Alice Keppel, long-time mistress to the King, had enquired of Queen Alexandra about what was to happen to Caesar. Despite her previous dislike of the dog, the Queen took interest in the terrier's care and tended to spoil him with treats, confessing to a friend that she was making up for the King being so strict towards him. Caesar died following an operation in April 1914. The Fabergé figurine now forms part of the Royal Collection, while Caesar was included in the sculpture of the King and Queen atop their tomb in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. In the sculpture, Caesar lies at the feet of the king.

High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) flight technologies for use in future military unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. Design and development Designed by Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs, known informally as the Skunk Works, the aircraft was first revealed by Aviation Week, and is intended to research active flutter suppression and gust-load alleviation technologies. The X-56A is based on Lockheed's earlier UAV work, showing influence from the Polecat, Sentinel and DarkStar UAVs. The program calls for the construction of two -long fuselages and a wingspan of 27.5 ft, with four sets of wings being constructed for flight testing.X-56A Testbed Arrives At NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center 17 April 2014. Operational history The X-56A first flew on 26 July 2013, flying from Edwards Air Force Base; twenty flights were to be flown on behalf of the Air Force Research Laboratory before the aircraft would be handed over to NASA for further testing. The first X-56A unmanned aircraft was severely damaged in a crash shortly after takeoff from the dry lakebed at Edwards AFB, California, on 19 November 2015, on its first flexible-wing flight to test active flutter suppression. The aircraft had previously made 16 flights with stiff wings to prove its operating envelope.The Week In Technology 23-27 November, Aviation Week & Space Technology The second X-56A unmanned aircraft flew for the first time on 9 April 2015 while under operation by NASA. The aircraft flew eight flights with the stiff wings to clear its operating envelope. The vehicle then completed its first flight with the highly flexible wings on 31 August 2017. One instability mode, body freedom flutter, was shown to be actively suppressed by the digital flight control at , within its normal flight envelope. Slender, flexible and lighter low-drag wings would be enabled by flutter suppression.

The Last Bison originally dubbed their sound \\"mountain- top chamber music\\" combining elements of alternative indie-folk with classical sensibilities. Their first album Quill was released independently in September 2011 and received critical praise noting the bands complex arrangements, refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. History The band initially received airplay on WROX-FM in Norfolk, Virginia. James Steele, the station's program director, stated that \\"Switzerland\\", the first single from their debut album, prompted the biggest audience response of any tune in his five years at the station. The band was signed to Universal Republic records in 2012, and released 3 projects with the label: the Inheritance EP, the Inheritance album, and the Sleigh Ride EP. The option to continue for another album cycle with Republic was not renewed, and in February 2014 the band became independent. In April 2014 The Last Bison began recording their third full-length album, VA, which was released independently in September 2014. They released an EP, Dorado, in 2015. Ben Hardesty's (vocals and guitar) songwriting bears sonic resemblance to groups such as Fleet Foxes, Mumford and Sons and The Decemberists. Folkhive stated \\"Dare I say that [The Last] Bison is to folk what Arcade Fire is to indie rock? Boasting 7 members and a sound seemingly born on the tree covered mountain tops of Virginia [The Last] Bison lays down expansive and yet imminently listenable folk with an original feel I've not experienced in quite some time\\". The band incorporates traditional folk instruments with a reed organ, percussion and classical strings. Independent Clauses stated \\"[The Last] Bison's debut album Quill uses the seriousness of Fleet Foxes' grounded sound as a framework, layering strings, bells and more on top. \\"Iscariot\\" and \\"The Woodcutter's Son\\" have a darkly pastoral bent that recalls pre-The King Is Dead Decemberists.\\" The Last Bison has headlined the Norva Theatre in Norfolk as well as performed with the Virginia Symphony Orchestra. The Daily Press said of Bison's live performance, \\"The stars of [the] show did not disappoint. Bison skillfully performed complex arrangements and delivered songs with passion and sensitivity [...] [The Last] Bison is a unique musical outfit that creates an unusual energy on stage.\\" Name change According to an e-mail sent out by the band on July 20, 2012, they officially changed their name from Bison to The Last Bison to avoid confusion with an identically named band.

During the 17th century, records show that the church was in need of replacement. A new church was built in 1725. It was a low-rise wooden church. It had a cruciform design and later a tower was constructed on the roof. In 1885, a new church was constructed a short distance to the south of the old church on the present church site. This new church was built in an octagonal design. After construction was complete, the old church was torn down. The church had a fire in 2009 after a lightning strike.

As Paul knocks on his neighbors' door, he finds out that the woman is an old flame, Georgette Lalle. They reunite happily, and Georgette even attempts to kiss Paul, despite being married to her jealous husband Maurice.

Somewhat later, Paul is on his way for a secret meeting with Georgette, when he is suddenly stopped by a police officer for speeding. After insulting the officer, Paul is charged with three days in prison. Suzanna, under the impression that Paul was speeding due to a patient crisis, does not understand why Paul does not gather witnesses to prove that he was speeding because of an emergency. She decides to call up the patient on the phone herself, only to find out that he is dead. Paul goes out to celebrate his death at the Artists Ball with Georgette. As he dresses up for a night out, he convinces Suzanna that he is heading to jail to serve his three-day sentence.

Born in Laroche-près-Feyt, department of Corrèze, he studied in Angoulême and at the seminary in Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris, where in 1830 he was ordained into the priesthood. Universal cyclopædia and atlas, Volume 8 In the 1830s, he first was introduced to the idea that a person's character could be ascertained via their handwriting from Abbé Flandrin (1804–1864), a priest who taught classes in philosophy. In 1842, he resigned his position as a priest, though still remaining a preacher. He focused his energy towards scientific pursuits, in particular historical and archaeological research, publishing a number of works on the religious history of Charente. In 1844, he published a treatise on Gallo-Roman monuments of Charente titled Statistique Monumentale de la Charente. In 1850 he participated in an archaeological mission to the Middle East as an archaeologist and botanist. In 1860 he published La Rénovation de l'Eglise (On the Renewal of the Church), in which he espoused his progressive thoughts on religion. This work was denounced by the Catholic Church and added to the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Afterwards (1862–69) he published, under a pseudonym, a series of anti-clerical novels. In 1868 he made the acquaintanceship of chirologist Adolphe Desbarrolles (1801–1886), who along with Michon, had an interest in handwriting analysis. The two men decided to combine efforts towards writing a book on the subject, and despite Michon's opposition to Desbarrolles' occultistic view of handwriting analysis, the work was finally released in 1872 as Les mystères de l'écriture. On 18 November 1871, Michon published the first issue of Le Journal de l'Autographe, a journal in which the term \\"graphology\\" is first used to describe handwriting analysis. Subsequently, he traveled throughout France and to other European cities, giving lectures and promoting his theories of scientific graphology. In the 1870s, he published Système de graphologie (1875), a book introducing Michon's system of handwriting signs, and Méthode pratique de graphologie (1878), in which he explains the principles of graphological analysis.

Millsap III, Candice Nelson and Curtis Mayfield and originally performed by Victoria Beckham. It is an emotive ballad whose lyrics detail a situation where a woman feels hurt and anger that her man lied and cheated on her. \\"Resentment\\" along with several other songs were meant to be on Beckham's solo-album, Come Together (2004), which was later shelved, leading the song to be included on the documentary DVD titled The Real Beckhams (2004). As the album release was shelved, the song went up for sale. American singer Jazmine Sullivan re-recorded the song for her unreleased original debut Break My Little Heart (2004), but her album was shelved too and the song went for sale again. Eventually, American singer Beyoncé was given the song and recorded it in 2006. Beyoncé's version of the song was included on her second studio album B'Day (2006) and featured additional lyrics and an arrangement composed by the singer herself. Background and development Victoria Beckham worked with Walter M. Millsap III and Candice Nelson on \\"Resentment\\" in 2003. In 2002, Telstar Records signed Beckham in a deal made with 19 Management worth £1.5 million. Beckham spent much of that year recording her second, and more pop-influenced album called Open Your Eyes, which yielded the single \\"Let Your Head Go\\", but instead of pop, Beckham wanted a more urban sound for her album, Come Together, which lead her to working with urban producer Damon Dash for a more rhythm and blues and hip hop influence. She then worked with Walter M. Millsap III and Candice Nelson on a soul track titled \\"Resentment\\"; recording sessions occurred in 2003.Beckham, Victoria; Beckham, David. The Real Beckhams. Telstar Records (2004) The track used Curtis Mayfield's 1972 \\"Think (Instrumental)\\", from the Super Fly soundtrack. \\"Resentment\\" was first included on a documentary of Victoria and David Beckham, titled The Real Beckhams (2004). The DVD captures the family as they move to Spain, and features Victoria Beckham launching her newest singles to date. The Sun, noted Victoria Beckham's multiple songs about a possible affair and read into the \\"poignant lyrics\\" as a stab at her husband David Beckham. \\"Resentment\\" along with \\"Valentine\\", \\"Me And You This Time\\", and \\"That Dude\\" were meant to be on Beckham's solo-album Come Together, which was later shelved, forcing the song to be included exclusively on the documentary DVD. Beyoncé version American singer and songwriter Beyoncé recorded \\"Resentment\\" for her second studio album, B'Day (2006). Original version was composed by Walter W. Millsap III and Candice Nelson and contained the instrumental of Curtis Mayfield's \\"Think\\" from the film Superfly in 1972. Beyonce re-arranged the structure of the song by changing the order of lyrics, adding a chorus and writing new lyrics. The song is four minutes and forty-two seconds in length, a major difference from the original version's length of three minutes and twenty seconds. The cover was well received by music critics who praised Beyoncé's powerful vocal performance and vulnerability. It charted at number 11 on the Billboard Bubbling Under R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles based on downloads alone. She performed the song during her revue shows I Am...

I feel like vocally I've grown, I feel like all the chord changes and the beautiful harmonies and the lyrics is something that I really am proud of\\". \\"Resentment\\" is a passionate ballad about a gritty, agitated goodbye which adds a \\"different kind of overwrought drama\\". The track is written in the key of E major. \\"Resentment\\" features a slow groove of 70 beats per minute, with Beyoncé's vocals range spanning from the note of F3 to E5. It is built around a honeyed sample of Curtis Mayfield's Think. In \\"Resentment\\" Beyoncé sings about infidelity and a boyfriend who cheats and lies to her, seen in the lines \\"I've been crying for too long/ What did you do to me?/ You lied, you lied, you lied.\\" In the song, Beyoncé presents a more vulnerable side of herself, because she shows that she doesn't want her boyfriend to leave her for another woman. =Reception= Critics praised Beyoncé's vocals and emotions in \\"Resentment\\".

A writer of Billboard magazine stated that Beyoncé \\"shifts into emotive mode\\" on this song from \\"rockier, edgier\\" sound of album and noted that the track \\"calls to mind the subtle fervor and passion of the best girl groups of the '60s and '70s\\". Brian Hiatt from Rolling Stone marked the track as \\"one of the most arresting moments\\" on the album and described it as an \\"anguished, sixties-tinged ballad\\". Spence Abbott of IGN also noted track as a stand out alongside \\"Irreplaceable\\" and observed that \\"[the] track goes straight for Aretha Franklin-inspired territory, with Beyoncé actually getting gritty and dropping her high octave range down a few pegs to get guttural and downright Old School soulful\\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the \\"agitated goodbye\\" builds a different kind of overwrought drama. Steve Jones of USA Today the song showcases Beyoncé's \\"maturing vocal chops,\\" describing the song as spare and gritty. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song would have been better if performed by a trio of \\"talented\\" vocalists, such as Destiny's Child, rather than Beyoncé by herself. Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt that \\"Doubters of Beyoncé's immense talent need only give one listen to this track ['Resentment'] from 2006's B'Day. It's a stunner — a visceral, emotional showcase that casts Beyoncé as a scorned, sorrowful woman. You can almost feel the pain in her delivery.\\" According to a writer of Irish Independent, the song gives a more soulful feel to B'Day. Jim Farber of Daily News called \\"Resentment\\" an \\"old-school soul shouter\\". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker described the song as a \\"fierce ballad\\". \\"Resentment\\" peaked at number 11 on the US Bubbling Under R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs. =Live performances= During Beyoncé's 2009 Las Vegas revue show, I Am... Yours, she performed the song live for the first time. Before performing the song, the singer described its meaning depth, stating: \\"How many of you have ever been lied to? I'm sure everyone has —we all have. But this next song is from my last album, B'Day. And I never performed this song before, this is especially for Encore[...] It talks about a relationship after you've been lied to. And you're trying your best to forgive. But it's difficult because you never forget. It's called 'Resentment'.\\" She additionally included the song on the 2009 I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas as the ninth track of the DVD/CD's first disc. During a Thanksgiving TV Special, Beyoncé aired I Am... Yours in its entirety which also featured her performance of \\"Resentment\\". Nate Chinen of The New York Times said, \\"There's exactly one human-scale moment in the concert, when she sits at the lip of the stage to sing an acoustic treatment of 'Resentment,' from her album 'B'Day.' And even then she makes it a showstopper.\\" In May, 2012, Beyoncé performed \\"Resentment\\" as a part of her revue show Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States' entertainment resort, hotel, casino and spa, Revel. She announced it as her \\"favorite song\\" and according to Georgette Cline of The Boombox, \\"fans could feel the pangs of her once-broken heart on 'Resentment,' as she cooed of a lying lover who deceived her\\". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times mentioned \\"Resentment\\" in the \\"almost continuous high point\\" of the concert. A writer of the Associated Press, noted that Beyoncé \\"held back tears during a rousing rendition\\" of the song. According to Chuck Darrow of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the acoustic performance of the ballad, \\"proved a nice respite from the relentless thump-thump-thump of the many dance-pop numbers\\". Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger wrote that Beyoncé brought the song to life further describing the performance as a \\"full-scale psychological portrait in three and a half minutes\\". The live performance of the song during the concerts at Revel was used in Beyoncé's HBO documentary film, Life Is But a Dream (2013). Only one shot was used to film it for five minutes. Aaron Parsley from People magazine commented that the rendition of \\"Resentment\\" was \\"grittier and angrier\\" than the previous performances of the song. The song was also included on the set list of Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013), during several opening shows of the first leg where she performed it on a B-stage. \\"Resentment\\" was performed during Beyoncé and Jay-Z's co-headlining On the Run Tour (2014). During the concert, Beyoncé moved to an island stage in the middle of the stadium, dressed as a bride in white with a floor-length bridal veil and performed the song seated. Video projections of the pair shooting at each other in an abandoned church, dressed in wedding attire followed as images of guns flashed across the screen with the words \\"this is not real\\". The footage ended with Beyoncé shooting Jay-Z dead. Kat Bein from the Miami New Times thought that the performance of the song was a \\"high note\\" during the concert. She also performed this song on Beyonce and Jay Z's second co-headlining On the Run II (2018). =Credits and personnel= Credits are taken from B'Day liner notes. *Written by: Beyoncé Knowles, Walter W.

Azrieli performs classical, operatic, and musical theater works, playing parts such as Juliet in Charles Gounod's Roméo et Juliette, Mimi in La Bohème and Susanna in Le Nozze di Figaro. She attended Juilliard and has performed with the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Chamber Orchestra and the Canadian Opera Company. Early life and education Azrieli was born in Montreal, Quebec to Canadian architect, philanthropist and Holocaust survivor, David Azrieli. Azrieli moved to New York City after attending Vassar College, where she graduated with a degree in Art History, and an Associate Degree in Illustration from the Parsons School of Design. While studying illustration she got a Diploma in Vocal Performance under Ellen Faull at the Juilliard School, where her mentors included Joan Dornemann, Principal Prompter at the Metropolitan Opera and the late Herbert Breslin. Joan Dornemann invited her to attend her Vocal Arts Institute in Israel over three successive summers where she performed several leading roles, including Norina in Don Pasquale and Musetta in La Boheme. In 2006, Azrieli obtained a Master of Music degree in Vocal Performance from the Université de Montréal, and then in 2011 a Doctorate in Music from the same university. Early career The Canadian Opera Company's artistic director, the late Richard Bradshaw, scouted Azrieli, starting her career as a professional opera singer. Barshaw hired her as an understudy for the part of Juliet in a production of Gounod's Roméo et Juliette and as Mimi in a small-stage production of Puccini's La Bohème. Artist manager Matthew Laifer spotted Azrieli's performance and invited her to his roster. Under Lafier's management, she performed with the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Chamber Orchestra, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and the Haifa Symphony Orchestra in their production of Rossini's Stabat Mater and Beethoven's Mass in C Minor. Other works included a concert of Puccini arias and Leonard Bernstein's Songfest. She also worked with Alexander Brott of McGill Chamber Orchestra, and understudied for Mirella Freni as Adrienne Lecouvreur with l’Opéra de Paris. A significant event in Azrieli's career came when she played the part of Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro at the Sarasota opera. Cantorial work Azrieli put her opera career on hold after the birth of her two sons. To support her family, she enrolled at the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York and began her first job as a Cantor for Temple Adas Israel in Sag Harbor. Azrieli and her sons moved back to Montreal in 2000, where she became a full-time cantor at Temple Emanu-El-Beth Sholom from 2001 until 2003.\\"The Times of Israel.\\" Retrieved February 16, 2013. While completing her D. Mus. at the Université de Montréal in 2011, she wrote her thesis on ethnomusicological links between the music of Giuseppe Verdi and ancient Jewish scales/modes. Return to the stage After her sons had grown up, Azrieli returned to opera. She became a student of Bill Schuman, a vocal coach who had previously worked with Celine Dion, Aprile Millo, and teaches at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia. With Schuman's help, Azrieli primed her voice for Verdian soprano roles. Azrieli performed Leonora in Il trovatore and Aida. She performed the roles of the prioress in Dialogues des carmélites and Leonora in La forza del destino with One World Symphony Orchestra. She sang the role of Mimi in \\"La Boheme” with the New Jersey Association of Verismo opera company and La Gioconda in La Gioconda.

He marries again, but his new wife is unsympathetic towards his daughter Stella (Dempster) because of the father's great great love for and comradeship with his daughter. Matthew Crane (Randolf) of the Secret Service, who sent Bevan to prison, comes to the town where Bevan is now living. Bevan's wife is unfaithful, and a loyal servant (Lestina) goes after Bevan, who had been leaving on a business trip, and tells him of the treachery. Bevan goes back to verify the statement, and in a fight the man (Kent) is accidentally killed. Crane hears of the murder and intercepts Stella, who had been on her way to the motorboat Bevan had purchased for his getaway. Bevan comes up from the rear and makes a captive of Crane until he and his daughter leave. They eventually land on a South Sea island and happily live there with one servant. Visiting a nearby island to trade with a native, Stella meets Bruce Sanders (Barthelmess), a wealthy plantation owner out for excitement. She wants to be friends with him, but fears he may be a federal officer looking for her father. Sanders is puzzled by her cold manner. Sanders returns to the mainland where he meets Crane who is hot on the trail. Crane persuades Sanders to take him to the island where Stella and Bevan live, which he, unsuspecting, gladly does. On their arrival Crane arrests Bevan and Stella, believing Sanders deliberately brought Crane there, will have nothing to do with him. Stella sinks Sanders boat, marooning all four on the island. When the boat is washed ashore, Sanders to show his good faith sinks it again, and Stella confesses that she loves him. Crane's comrades send help to him on the island, and Bevan refuses to get on the boat. After a dramatic fight, Crane believes Bevan has drowned.

It originated as an arboretum and occupies a tract of the university's campus at Edwardsville, Illinois. It serves as a twofold function as a living laboratory dedicated in support of the educational and research missions of the University and as a place of beauty for the university community to share with the general public. In light of this duality, The Gardens' master plan calls for the creation of a \\"public garden featuring spectacular horticulture, event spaces, areas for social gatherings and contemplative gardens\\" to be continuously enhanced over the coming years. The Gardens at SIUE was recognized by the Missouri Botanical Gardens as a \\"Signature Garden\\" until the MOBOT program was discontinued. History In April 1990, Donal Myer, dean of the former SIUE School of Sciences announced that planning had begun for the creation of a campus arboretum, to be sited north of the parking area for the Tower Lake (now Cougar Lake) recreation area. The arboretum had been a part of the plans for the university from its beginnings but nothing had been done until Frank Kulfinski, professor of Environmental Sciences, suggested that it was time to start. Following Dr. Myers' death that August, the SIU Board of Trustees named the arboretum in his honor, and Dr. Kulfinski became its first director. In the ensuing years, the tree collection was broadened and diversified, and the arboretum saw much use as both an educational tool and as a recreational destination for the SIUE community. The bridge over Turtle Pond in The Gardens at SIUE. Fall 2005. In the late Nineties, funds were raised to further develop the site. Among the improvements, a permanent sign was erected and a bridge was built across Turtle Pond. In 1998, the Donal G. Myer Arboretum was rededicated. In 2003, the Missouri Botanical Gardens' president Dr. Peter Raven created the Metro-east Outreach Advisory Committee, chaired by SIUE alumnus Ralph Korte and directed with discovering ways to amplify the Missouri Botanical Gardens' image in the Metro East region. This committee created the concept of \\"Signature Gardens\\", and the Donal Myer Arboretum was chosen as one of three Signature Gardens in the Metro East. In 2004, Terra Design Studios of Pittsburgh was hired to assist a planning team, consisting of SIUE Foundation staff; SIUE faculty, staff, and administration; and Metro East community members in developing a master plan for the arboretum. This process established a plan for the site which more resembled a public botanical garden than a conventional arboretum, resulting in the conclusion that the Myer Arboretum would become a part of a larger entity--- The Gardens at SIUE. In 2005, SIUE hired Doug Conley as the first full-time director of The Gardens. Doug served as Director until July 2011 when he became Director of the Edsel Ford House Gardens and later Garden Coordinator for the University of Michigan Matthaei Gardens. In April 2006 the 1st Annual Arbor Day event hosted 30 volunteers. In May of the same year, Rita Hardy donated a set of wind sculptures to The Gardens, and in September, The Hardy Family Wind Forest was dedicated at a \\"Garden Party\\" attended by more than 200 guests and featuring comments by Dr. Raven and SIUE Chancellor Vaughn Vandergrift. With the completion of The Gardens Master Plan, The Friends of The Gardens at SIUE was formed in 2007. The 2nd Annual Arbor Day event was attended by 59 volunteers and 30 visitors; the event was a combination work and educational event, as volunteers removed weeds and planted trees, while visitors were instructed on the value of trees. Through the efforts of Doug Conley, the University, the Friends of The Gardens, and generous benefactors, development and enhancement has continued, turning The Gardens at SIUE into a welcoming destination for all visitors. In January 2012, Jane Drake was appointed as The Gardens second director and served in that post until March 2014. On September 1, 2014, the directorship of The Gardens was added to the duties of James Pennekamp, special assistant to the chancellor for Regional Economic Development and executive director of University Park at SIUE.http://www.siue.edu/news/archives/ArchivesJULY2014.shtml#PennekamptoOverseeTheGardensatSIUE In 2016, the Illinois state budget crisis brought about severely reduced funding for The Gardens. Because of The Gardens' increasing popularity, the mayor of Edwardsville proposed that the city take over the site's care and a survey was done of the Edwardsville citizens. An initial City Council vote regarding leasing of The Gardens appeared to be approved but was later reversed.The university never leased The Gardens to the City. Instead, with major hands-on help from a group of community Master Gardeners and Master Naturalists, the university has continued to manage The Gardens. Features Among the features of The Gardens at SIUE are: * The Butterfly Garden--- A gift from Julie Ruth as a remembrance to her daughter Maria who died while attending SIUE initiated the first area of the Butterfly Garden in 2014. Further development, including an iron sculpture of a butterfly has occurred during 2017-2019. The area is designed with plants that attract local butterfly species. * The Garden Path wanders for half a mile through The Gardens, leading visitors to its many features. * The Donal Myer Arboretum--- Established in 1990 and named in honor of the late Donal G. Myer, a biologist and dean of the former SIUE School of Sciences, the Arboretum is a collection of labeled trees and shrubs native to the region in a natural setting. * The Donal Myer Arboretum Plaza --- A plaza surrounded with bench seating at the south entrance to The Gardens. * The Prairie Portal --- A garden created by the Edwardsville Rotary Club in 2012 that will function as a portal from the Garden Path to a not yet constructed path, the Prairie Loop. * The Hardy Family Wind Forest--- A set of kinetic sculptures by Lyman Whitaker are set in motion by the wind, creating ever-changing images. The set includes The Double Spinner, The Fleur-de-Lis, the Double Helix, The Desert Flame, and the Double Dancer. The sculptures were donated by Rita Hardy of Highland. An example of some of the Art For The Earth at The Gardens at SIUE * The Lantern--- A path over the bridge and through the pines leads to a plaza where a small amphitheater faces the oriental influenced pergola sited on the edge of Turtle Pond. A place for small gatherings or quiet contemplation, the Lantern was conceived by students in SIUE's nationally recognized Senior Capstone project of the School of Engineering and designed by Jamie Henderson of Henderson Associates Architects. Constructed of stone and cedar, the Lantern looks out upon the fountain in Turtle Pond and has a set of LEDs that light it at night, providing the image that gives it its name. * Art For The Earth--- Artworks installed in honor of Earth Day and using \\"green\\" approaches to art. Some works are installed for a specified period, others are biodegradable and return to the earth over time. New works are installed each April. * The Prairie House--- (Originally scheduled 2012-13 but on hold as of 2020.) will serve as a permanent venue for special events and classes, featuring indoor and outdoor classroom and meeting spaces, restrooms, a green room for event preparation, an outdoor kitchen, and patio and lawn areas. * The Presidents' Way --- A series of benches along a section of the Garden Path which commemorates former presidents of the SIUE Foundation. * Oak Savannah --- A restored piece of natural Illinois prairie planted in 2000 by the SIUE Department of Biological Sciences. More than 40 native plants were included in the initial planting. * The Council Ring --- Based upon Native American council circles, this is a stone landscaped meeting area constructed in 2011 with a donation from the Inman Family. * Frog Marsh --- A marshy arm of Cougar (Tower) Lake preserved as natural habitat for indigenous amphibians and reptiles.

While the cause of his death was an explosive device, the agency behind his death is suspicious and still disputed.  Personal  David Niño de Guzmán was born on 30 December 1969 in Uncía, Potosí, Bolivia. He studied communications at the University of San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca. He was a resident of La Paz, Bolivia. He married Sandra Flores. The couple had two children and were separated at the time of his death.  Career  David Niño de Guzmán had spent 16 years in journalism. He had previously worked as a journalist for the newspapers La Razón, El Diario, Última Hora, and the widely circulated Presencia. He also once worked in television for Cadena A-Canal 36. He assumed the position of chief editor in March 2010 after working for Fides News Agency (ANF) for 4 years.  Death  Witnesses say David Niño de Guzmán either had an argument with his ex-girlfriend, with whom he had a child, or that he received a threatening phone call. In either case, he left work after a phone call. Afterward, Guzmán was not seen for two days until authorities were notified of a discovery of a body in a ravine near the Orkojahuira River by Avenida Zavaleta (René Zavaleta Avenue) and near Miraflores neighborhood. His body was identified at the morgue by his family. An autopsy showed Guzmán died on 19 April 2011 due to stomach damage caused by the detonation of a bomb. Investigation Press freedom NGOs and the five Bolivian press associations were quick to call for an investigation into his death. The Office of the Special Rapporteur urged an investigation to determine whether his murder may have had a possible connection to his work as a journalist. President Evo Morales ordered the investigation of Guzmán's death, as many believed it to be a murder. While authorities ruled his death a suicide, his colleagues, family, and friends, believe it was a homicide. A full investigation led to the Public Prosecutor's Office ruled Guzmán's death a suicide. Their findings showed Guzmán had held the bomb to his chest before detonation and his hands had to injuries from resistance. There was also no evidence of his arms or hands being tied. Blasting caps and dynamite were found in his apartment. Psychological assessments had shown Guzmán to be emotionally disturbed leading up to the incident. He also was found to have suffered from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The Miraflores neighborhood of La Paz, Bolivia.His wife, however, holds the opinion that he was murdered. The couple had been separated for five years. She argues that Guzmán didn't like explosive weapons. She also noted that he had become anxious leading up to the day of his death and there was no suicide note. She believes he received threats over the phone. She suggested that information he published had something to do with his death. His girlfriend, with whom he had a child, was also of the opinion that he was murdered. She said he was indecisive and would have been unable to carry through such an act. Her lawyer also said that the distance he would have had to travel to the scene of his death was too far. His colleagues said he was not robbed. They believed he had been dragged some distance. His body showed signs of torture and his shirt torn. His stomach had damage, as well as his left arm. The case remained closed for over one year with no new evidence. His colleagues also believe his case was closed under pressure by someone in justice.  Context  In 2011, David Niño de Guzmán's death was the only instance of a fatality associated with journalism in Bolivia. Long after his case was closed, journalists continued to raise his name as a victim of violence against journalists in Bolivia. While the Committee to Protect Journalists still have not confirmed Guzmán as a work-related death, it has confirmed two other Bolivian journalists, Carlos Quispe Quispe of Radio Municipal killed 29 March 2008 in Pucarani and Juan Carlos Encinas, a freelance journalist, killed 29 July 2001 in Catavi.  Impact  A march was held in honour of David Niño de Guzmán on 27 April 2011. Demonstrators urged authorities to hold a full investigation into his death and for life insurance for media workers. Additionally, the government was looking into low salaries, the long working days of journalists, arbitrary layoffs, medical insurance, and mistreatment of media workers by their employers. Reactions Reporters Without Borders insisted those responsible be punished. Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \\"I urge the Bolivian authorities to thoroughly investigate the brutal death of David Niño de Guzmán. Bringing to light the circumstances, and punishing those responsible, sends an important signal that freedom of expression is an inviolable right, and that the existence of a diverse and independent media is vital for informed public debate.\\" Media workers urged the government for a full investigation, life insurance, and other improvements to their working conditions. While authorities ruled David Niño de Guzmán's death a suicide, however, many still believe it was a homicide, José Luis Columba, head of the Asociación Nacional de la Prensa (National Press Association) in Bolivia, pointed to the violent nature of his death as an indicator of murder.

It was first broadcast on USA Network in the United States on February 7, 2012. The episode was directed by Anton Cropper and written by Channing Powell. In the episode, Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) assigns Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) to work with his former girlfriend, Sara Ellis (Hilarie Burton), to track down a missing Stradivarius violin. Meanwhile, Peter must deal with the arrival of Elizabeth's (Tiffani Thiessen) parents (Tom Skerritt and Debra Monk), who are in New York for their daughter's birthday. According to the Nielsen ratings system, an estimated 2.469 million household viewers watched the original broadcast of the episode, with 0.8 million in the 18–49 demographic. \\"Pulling Strings\\" received mostly mixed to positive reviews from critics, with many praising individual elements of the episode. Plot After taking vacation from work to be with his wife–and her parents–on her birthday, Peter turns Neal over to Sara in order to retrieve a missing Stradivarius that she believes was stolen by her former fiancé and current boss, Bryan McKenzie (Bailey Chase). Before beginning work on the case, Neal is approached by Agent Kramer (Beau Bridges), who is in New York to look into Neal's upcoming commutation hearing. Searching McKenzie's apartment, Neal discovers a hidden security tape. Meanwhile, Sara convinces him to attend the symphony with her. With help from June (Diahann Carroll), Neal and Diana Berrigan (Marsha Thomason) are able to go to the symphony as well. While they quickly discover that the second-chair violinist is the woman on the security video, McKenzie realizes that Neal is not exactly who he claims to be. While searching backstage, Neal and Diana find a body; they quickly recognize him as the symphony's instrument expert. Upon questioning the violinist from the security tape, Diana discovers that she had damaged the violin and had given it to the instrument expert for repairs. Sara approaches McKenzie with the information she has, pretending to want to join him. Diana and Neal soon arrive to arrest McKenzie, and Sara tells Neal to “call [her] sometime.” Meanwhile, Peter suffers through the arrival of his in-laws. Everything goes wrong at Elizabeth's birthday: her parents give her a much-despised doll from her childhood, Peter's gift to Elizabeth does not turn out the way he had planned, and Elizabeth's father continues to disapprove of Peter. Peter eventually calls upon Mozzie (Willie Garson) for assistance, and together they right all of the wrongs. Agent Kramer returns to the FBI to speak with Diana, who has recently announced her engagement to Christie. Kramer intimidates Diana, learning that she, Peter, and Jones (Sharif Atkins) have been covering up Neal's recent crimes. Production Beau Bridges made his second appearance as Agent Kramer. On June 20, 2011, it was announced that Beau Bridges had been cast as Peter's mentor; his first appearance was in \\"Countdown\\", and he returned for \\"Pulling Strings\\". The next month, the casting of Tom Skerritt was announced; he was reported to play Alan Mitchell, the father of Elizabeth Burke. Bailey Chase's casting as Bryan McKenzie, a Sterling-Bosch vice president, was announced simultaneously. Debra Monk's appearance in the series was confirmed simultaneously with the announcement of the fourth season renewal; while it was not stated which episode she would appear in, it was revealed that she would appear in one of the season's last six episodes. With this announcement also came news that Diahann Carroll would return to the series in her recurring role as June. \\"Pulling Strings\\" was directed by Anton Cropper, his first directing credit for the series. The episode was written by Channing Powell; it was his fifth writing contribution. Powell has stated that Peter's reduced role in the episode was due to actor Tim DeKay's preparation for directing the next episode. Reception Tom Skerritt's performance as Alan Mitchell was particularly praised by critics. =Ratings= Upon its premiere, \\"Pulling Strings\\" drew 2.469 million viewers, which, at the time, was the lowest of the series. The episode drew 0.8 million viewers in the 18–49 demographic, which was down 0.3 and 0.2 million from the previous two episodes, \\"Upper West Side Story\\" and \\"Neighborhood Watch\\", respectively. The episode ranked 28th in the 18–49 demographic for the night, down seventeen places from the previous week. =Reviews= \\"Pulling Strings\\" received mostly mixed to positive reviews, with many critics praising Tom Skerritt's performance, but with many criticizing the use of Hilarie Burton's character. Kenny Herzog of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating, praising Channing Powell's writing in a mostly standalone episode. While he complimented Bomer and Garson's rapport and Garson's scenes at the Burke home, he stated that Burton's character \\"continues to feel just off.\\" He went on to say that the episode is \\"once again an example of ... just how good they've gotten at making White Collar tick.\\" Hilary Rothing of CraveOnline wrote that she enjoyed the performances of Bridges and Skerritt and that the Burkes' storyline was \\"fun\\" but \\"still schmaltzy.\\" She also praised the episode's use of Burton's character. Rothing later complimented both the episodic case and Bridges's story arc; she ultimately gave the episode a rating of 8.5 out of 10. C. Charles of TV Fanatic called the episode \\"intriguing\\" and praised many aspects of \\"Pulling Strings\\", including Bridges and Burton's reintroductions and the use of Elizabeth's parents; Charles rated the episode 4.8 out of 5. Reviewer Gregg Wright gave the episode an 8 out of 10, elaborating that while the episode \\"could have easily been an average or sub-par procedural,\\" it became above-average when all of the elements were combined. He also complimented Carroll's appearance and Bridges's performance as a strong antagonist. Brittany Frederick of Starpulse.com gave the episode a more mediocre review, calling it \\"lackluster\\" and mentioning that she has \\"never felt Hilarie Burton's chemistry with Matt Bomer.\\" She did, however, praise the heightened roles of Thomason and Atkins and the introduction of Elizabeth's parents.

Along with the Argentinian film El Satario (c. 1907–1915) and the American film A Free Ride or A Grass Sandwich (c. 1915–1917), it is one of the earliest hardcore pornographic films, produced between the years 1907 and 1915, that have been collected at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. Description Like the other two films, Am Abend begins with a primitive narrative frame sequence, then it shows signs of a more conventional cinema for a short period of time, and it finally shows hard-core scenes in a fragmented manner. Film studies scholar Linda Williams, suggested that early pornographic films, such as Am Abend, like modern-day pornographic videos, showed close ups of genitals and medium shots of sex. Thus, there were structural similarities between early stag films and modern-day pornographic videos. The duration of Am Abend is 10 minutes. The film starts with an act of voyeurism, depicting a man peeping through a keyway into a woman's bedroom. In the room, the woman lies alone on a bed and masturbates for some minutes. Then, the man enters the woman's bedroom, undresses himself, the woman gives him a bath and the two partners engage in different sexual activities in multiple sex positions. The sexual activities includes the man penetrating from top, fellatio, further masturbation by the woman, and sex in the doggy style position. The sex, however, is stopped prematurely when the man suffers from erectile dysfunction. The hard-core scene in this film is shown in a master shot of the man and woman in their bed with inserted close-ups of the genitals, penetration, etc. References External links * * 7 Important Historical Breakthroughs (In Masturbation), Cracked.com Category:1910 films Category:German films Category:Films of the German Empire Category:1910s pornographic films Category:German silent short films Category:German black- and-white films ","title":"Am Abend"},{"id":"34585133","text":"Hillsborough was a three-decker merchant ship launched in 1782. She made six voyages to India and China as an East Indiaman for the British East India Company. In 1798 she transported convicts from England to New South Wales. After delivering her convicts in 1799, she became a whaler in the South Seas fisheries for several years. She was broken up in 1804. East Indiaman =Voyage #1 (1784-85)= Captain William Hardcastle left the Downs on 27 January 1784 for Madras and Bengal. Hillsborough reached Simon's Bay on 24 April and arrived at Madras on 11 July. She then arrived at Kedgeree on 8 August. For her return voyage she passed Saugor on 8 February 1785, reached the Cape on 5 May and St Helena on 5 June, and arrived at the Downs on 17 August. =Voyage #2 (1786-89)= Captain William Hardcastle left the Downs on 13 March 1786, bound for Bengal, Bombay, and China. Hillsborough was part of a convoy that also included the East Indiamen Prince William, Lord Thurlow, William Pitt, Barwell, Earl of Oxford, Fort William, London, Glatton, Houghton, Marquis of Landsdown, Pigot, , and Earl of Abergavenny, amongst numerous other vessels, merchant and military, most of the non-Indiamen travelling to the Mediterranean.Gentleman's magazine (May 1793), Vol 63, part. 1, p. 474.The news account states that Osterley was in the convoy, but in March 1786 she was still returning from an earlier trip to China. Hillsborough reached Simon's Bay on 10 June and Diamond Point on 14 August. From there she sailed to Batavia, which she reached on 30 December. On 23 May 1787 she was at Bombay. She reached Malacca on 24 August and Whampoa on 11 October. For her homeward voyage she crossed the Second Bar, some 20 miles down the river from Whampoa, on 19 February 1788. She reached Benkulen on 23 May and St Helena on 2 October, and arrived at the Downs on 7 February 1789. =Voyage #3 (1790-91)= Captain Edward Coxwell left the Downs on 17 April 1790 for China, and arrived at Whampoa on 27 August. Hillsborough crossed the Second Bar on 19 December, reached the Cape on 9 April 1791 and St Helena on 28 April, and arrived at the Downs on 27 June. =Voyage #4 (1793-94)= The French Revolutionary Wars having broken out, Captain Edward Brown received a letter of marque on 17 April 1793. He left Portsmouth on 22 May 1793 for Madras and Bengal. Hillsborough arrived at Madras on 13 September, and Diamond Harbour on 3 November. On her return voyage she passed Saugor on 27 December, and reached Madras on 31 January 1794. By 1 May she was at St Helena. On 20 July she reached Galway, and on 27 August she arrived at the Downs. =Voyage #5 (1795-96)= Captain Richard Hutt left Portsmouth on 24 May 1795, bound for Madras and Bengal. Hillsborough arrived at Madras on 2 September and Diamond Harbour on 6 October. On 4 December she passed Saugor, reaching Madras on 7 Feb 1796 and St Helena on 7 May, and arriving at the Downs on 3 August. =Voyage #6 (1797-98)= Hutt left Portsmouth on 18 March 1797, bound for Madras. Hillsborough reached the Cape on 4 June and arrived at Madras on 7 August. By 24 December she was back at the Cape. She reached St Helena on 3 February 1798 and Cork on 24 June. She arrived at the Downs on 7 July. Convict transport and whaler Robert Preston and the other owners sold Hillsborough and she disappeared from the list of the EIC's ships. Her new owner was Daniel Bennett.British Southern Whale Fishery Database – voyages: Hillsborough. Under the command of William Hingston (or Kingston), Hillsborough sailed from Gravesend via Portland Roads, England, on 23 December 1798, and arrived at Port Jackson on 26 July 1799. She had left with 300 male convicts, but 95 died of yellow fever and dysentery on the voyage, and six more shortly after landing. This high death toll gave rise to Hillsborough becoming known as the \\"fever ship\\". Governor Hunter wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Colonies: While at Port Jackson Hillsborough received a new master, Captain Robert Rhodes, who had come out to New South Wales as mate on Hillsborough. As Hillsborough was preparing to sail from Sydney Cove in October, a strict search found 30 stowaways aboard her. They were removed and punished. Two sailors who had aided the stowaways were also brought on shore and punished before being returned to Hillsborough. Rhodes then sailed for the south seas fisheries to engage in whaling. Hillsborough spent eight months sealing and whaling around the Desolation Islands. During this period Rhodes prepared a chart of the islands, and named a bay \\"Hillsborough Bay\\". Forty years later, James Clark Ross spent some months in the islands during his expedition to the Antarctic in and . Ross found Rhodes's charts useful and so named a bay after Rhodes in tribute to him. Hillsborough then returned from South Georgia. She reached Gravesend on 15 April 1801 with 450 tuns of oil. Hillsborough again sailed for the South Seas on 11 August 1801. Daniel Bennett now shared her ownership with Charles Price, and her master was Captain Thomas Pittman (or Pitman). Pittman received a letter of marque on 17 July 1801, shortly before Hillsborough left England. Hillsborough was also listed on the Protection List, which exempted her crew from impressment. In 1802 she was valued at £11,000. Hillsborough returned from the South Seas on 20 March 1803. Hillsborough apparently made one more voyage for Bennett and Price, this time to Peru. Cyrus reported that in October 1805 Hillsborough was near the Galapagos Islands with 60 barrels of oil and on her way to New Zealand. Fate The Register of Shipping for 1804 carries the notation that Hillsborough was broken up.Register of shipping (1804), Seq. №H486.

Varieties Mang was classified as a branch of Western Hmongic in Wang (1985), who listed four varieties.王辅世主编，《苗语简志》，民族出版社，1985年。 Matisoff (2001) gave these four varieties the status of separate languages, and, conservatively, did not retain them as a single group within West Hmongic.

Compared to the eight tone categories of other Western Hmongic languages, the odd-numbered tones are each split into two. The tones of at least three villages of Central Mang have been documented: Dadiba (Wu & Yang 2010), Jiaotuozhai (Wang & Mao 1995; Li 2000), and Jingshuiping (Xian 1990; Mortensen 2006Mortensen (2006), Diachronic Universals and Synchronic Parochialisms: Explaining Tone-Vowel Interactions.), all in the Zongdi township of Ziyun County.

It is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. The system has been designed for the medical domain. It currently covers the doctor-patient diagnosis dialogues for the domains of headache, chest and abdominal pain in English, French, Japanese, Spanish, Catalan and Arabic. The vocabulary used ranges from 350 to 1000 words depending on the domain and language pair.  Motivation for creating MedSLT  With more than 6000 languages worldwide, language barriers become an increasing problem for healthcare. The lack of medical interpreters can lead to disastrous consequences. These range from prolonged hospital stays to wrong diagnosis and medication. A study found that only about half of the 23 million people with limited proficiency in English in the United States had been provided with a medical interpreter. Millions of refugees and immigrants worldwide face similar problems, although not always as severe. The gap between need and availability of language services might be closed with speech translation systems.\\"Many-to-Many Multilingual Medical Speech Translation on a PDA\\" by P. Bouillon, G. Flores, M. Georgescul, S. Halimi, B. A. Hockey, H. Isahara, K. Kanzaki, Y. Nakao, M. Rayner, M. Santaholma, M. Starlander, N. Tsourakis in The Eighth Conference of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas. Waikiki, Hawaii. 2008  Challenges  The biggest challenge is and was to develop an ideal system, though it is not possible to do so at this moment. This system would fit the needs of doctors and the patients alike, and would provide accurate and flexible translation. A realisation of an ideal translation tool is impossible without the use of unrestricted language and a large vocabulary. Medical professionals demand high reliability from translation. This favours rule-based architectures over data-driven. The latter are more suitable for inexperienced users. Rule-based architectures achieve higher accuracy especially if used by experts. Though it is highly desirable to build a bidirectional system supporting a two-way dialogue, which concentrates on patient-centered communication, the patients will have difficult access to the system. Most patients have no experience with such systems. Less reliable results for translation from the patient-to-doctor direction are the outcome. To overcome this the system needs to provide either easy access or an integrated help tool to guide the users through the process. Although controlled rule-based systems achieve good results, they are brittle. To receive good translations the user needs to be familiar with the system and has to know what is covered by the grammar. Covering different sub-domains (headache, chest and abdominal pain) and language pairs presents additional problems. A shared structure and grammar for all subdomains and language pairs minimises development and maintenance costs. The integration of new doctor and patient languages is also a key challenge. Adding new languages should be quick and rather simple, because he system has to be used in many countries to cover multiple language pairs. Direct translation from source to target language proves to be rather difficult. Using interlingua for unidirectional translation instead of a bidirectional approach helps to simplify the translation process. On top of this, the system has to run on different platforms, because mobility is a key issue for many attending physicians. A portable version addresses these issues, but has to deal with the heavy load of the translation process.\\"Multilingual Grammar Resources in Multilingual Application Development\\" by M.

Rayner, P. Bouillon, B. A. Hockey and Y. Nakao in Proceedings of Coling 2008, Manchester, UK. 2008  The MedSLT system  The system's speech recognition is based on the Nuance 8.5 platform that supports grammar-based language models. All grammars used for recognition, analysis and generation are compiled from a small set of unification grammars. These core grammars are created by the open-source Regulus Grammar Compiler and are automatically specialised using corpus-driven methods. The specialisation considers both the task (recognition, analysis and generation) and the sub- domain (headache, chest and abdominal pain). The specialisation uses the explanation-based learning algorithm to create a treebank from the training corpus. These examples are divided into sets of subtrees by using domain- and grammar-specific rules (also known as \\"operationality criteria\\" in machine translation). The subtree rules are combined into a single rule, creating a specialised unification grammar. The grammar is compiled to an executable form, for analysis and generation by a parser or generator, and for recognition of a CFG grammar. A CFG grammar is required for the Nuance engine. Compilation by Nuance-specific criteria turns the grammar into speech recognition packages. The final step uses the training corpus again for statistical tuning of the language model. MedSLT translation processes are based on a rule-based interlingua. The interlingua is treated as an actual language (it is a very simple version of English) and is specified by a Regulus grammar. This grammar does not take account of complex surface syntax phenomena of real languages like movement or agreement. A set of rules is the base for translating the source language semantic representation to interlingua. Another set of rules covers the translation from interlingua to the target language. The semantic representations are converted to surface words using a target language grammar. Defining semantics for a specific domain enables the developers to specify interlingua with a small, tightly constraint semantic grammar. The translations based on interlingua match direct translations almost perfectly, because the development shifts to a decoupled monolingual architecture. A set of combined interlingua corpora, with one corpus per sub-domain, is the core of this architecture. All source language development corpora are translated to interlingua. These are sorted and grouped together with the corresponding source language examples. The interlingua forms are then translated into each target language, and the results are attached together. This organisation improves the translation process. There is no duplicated effort for multilingual regression testing, because each parsing and generation step is performed once. This allows more frequent testing. The representation language used for all forms is Almost Flat Functional semantics. AFF is derived from the Spoken Language Translator, the precursor of MEdSLT. SLT uses Quasi Logical Form, a logical based representation language. QLF is an expressive yet very complex language, causing high development and maintenance costs. A minimal solution was planned for the medical translator. Early versions of the system utilised a language using simple feature-value lists. These lists were supplemented with an optional level of nesting to represent subordinate clauses (i.e. embedded clauses). Determiners were not included, because they are hard to translate and it is difficult to reliably distinguish and recognise them. This way, translation rules became a lot simpler, because only a list of feature-value pairs had to be mapped to another list of pairs. The language turned out to be underconstrained. Adding natural sortal constraints to the grammar solved this problem, but also returned the language to a more expressive formalism. The newly created AFF combines elements of QLF and the feature-value list semantics. This version of flat semantics is enhanced with additional functional markings. This together with a relatively small vocabulary solved the ambiguity problem of the original flat representation language without creating overly complex rules. In addition, the syntactic structures are treated carefully by a compromise of linguistic and engineering traditions. The grammars are in fact retrieved from linguistically motivated resource, using corpus-based methods. They are driven by small sets of examples. This results in simpler and flatter domain-specific grammars. The semantics are less sophisticated and represent a minimal approach in the engineering tradition. Each lexical item contributes a set of feature-value pairs. This leads to simple-to-write translation rules. There are only lists of features- value pairs to map to other feature-value pairs. However, as a result the machine translation channel model becomes underspecified and is weakened, whereas the target language model is strengthened. An intelligent help module is integrated into the system to support users in utilising the full coverage of the grammars. This tool provides the user with examples as close as possible to the users original utterance. The output is based on a library. Each sub-domain and language pair has its own library. The contents are extracted from the combined interlingua corpora. The help module scans the corpus for the tagged source language form mapped with the corresponding target language form. Additionally a second statistical recogniser is used as backup. The results are used to select similar examples from the library. According to the generation preferences, one of the derived strings is picked and the target language string is realised as spoken language. Some statistical corpus based methods are used to tune the system further.  MedSLT on a PDA  As a response to demands from healthcare professionals, a mobile version of MedSLT was developed. The hand-held platform uses the same architecture as the normal one. The heavy processing necessary for translation is done on a remote machine. Apart from a wireless connection, a good microphone is needed to reach the same results as the original version.

The younger son, Federico was able to hide during the evasion, 2 buses in Piddig, Ilocos Norte, a remote town at the eastern part of the province. In March 1945, during the liberation, Federico brought out the 2 buses he had kept clandestinely in Piddig and the master mechanic, Federico who never had any formal education in automotive repairing or the like, was able to assemble one bus out of the 2 dilapidated buses into good running condition which he himself drove along its franchises routes from Laoag to Manila and back. These two buses became the nucleus of the biggest transportation business plying between Laoag and Manila today. Meanwhile, Constante, the older brother, chose to pursue his studies in Manila. Thus, it was Federico who continued the transportation business. The meteoric rise of the business was due to Federico’s uncanny business acumen and management. Despite the risk encountered in the early days of the business, when insurances were not available then to pay costs of damages incurred during vehicular accidents, through basic work, personal discipline and determination, Federico together with his wife, Remedios Dreyer Castro, forged on to improve the business. Being the master mechanic that he was, he augmented his income by putting up the Fariñas Motor Shop. He bought condemned government equipment like bulldozers, pay loaders, and dump trucks, repaired them, and sold them at handsome prices. From here, the number of buses grew by leaps and bounds. At present, the company is maintaining 60 good working conditioned buses. Federico was the first to introduce air-conditioned buses in the province, the first to introduce comfort room in the air-conditioned buses and now the Fariñas Transportation business is the biggest transportation business in Ilocos Norte. The bus company, which is owned by the late Federico Luna Fariñas Sr, is operated by his sons and daughters which are the Fariñas family of Ilocos Norte, a political family that has served as governors, mayors and councilmen over the course of several generations: most notably from recent news, Ilocos Norte Governor Rodolfo Fariñas and Laoag City mayors Roger and Michael V. Fariñas. Two of its rival transportation companies in the Ilocos Region are owned and operated by other political families: the Singsons of Ilocos Sur and the Marcos family of Ilocos Norte. Rival transportation companies include Partas, GV Florida Transport, Dominion Bus Lines (formerly Times Transit, of the late millionaire Santiago Rondaris but now owned by MENCORP), Maria De Leon Transportation Inc. and Viron Transit (owned by the daughter of late millionaire Santiago Rondaris), even a resurgent Inocencio Aniceto Transportation (owned by the Aniceto family).

Although juggling in its western form involving props such as balls, rings, and clubs is rarely performed in modern China, at certain periods in Chinese history it was much more popular. In fact, some of the world's earliest known jugglers were Chinese warriors and entertainers who lived during the time of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. References to these artists in ancient Chinese literature have preserved records of their incredible achievements. From such references, it appears that juggling was a well-regarded and highly developed form of ancient Chinese art.  Xiong Yiliao  Xiong Yiliao (), was a famous Chu warrior who fought under King Zhuang of Chu (ruled 613-591 BC) during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. Ancient Chinese annals state that he practiced nongwan (, \\"throwing multiple objects up and down without dropping\\" Zdic.net: 弄丸), and he is often cited as one of the world’s earliest known jugglers. During a battle in about 603 BC between the states of Chu () and Song (), Xiong Yiliao stepped out between the armies and juggled nine balls, captivating the Song troops. The Chu army took this opportunity to launch a surprise attack and routed the Song army.

In the other direction, the trail rises over steep wooded hillsides, winds through deep ravines and crosses numerous streams and flood plains and becomes fairly level west of Route 28. Much of the trail is mixed-use with equestrians and mountain bikes (which are restricted to the segments nearer the Potomac River, east of the Bull Run Marina). Hiking may be considered moderately strenuous, and trail users are encouraged to carry ample water and wear appropriate foot and ankle support. Many parks along the trail are open seasonally and should not be regarded as reliable sources of food, water or emergency care. During the early years of the American Civil War, the Bull Run/Occoquan River formed the boundary of the \\"Alexandria Line\\", which Confederate forces established to protect their capitol from Union advances before the First Battle of Bull Run. A skirmish occurred near Blackburn's Ford along the upper part of this trail on July 18, 1861. Between Blackburn's Ford and Union Mills, the former Southern Railway trestle over Pope's Head Creek is visible; the upper structure was burned several times during the multi-year conflict. An earthen fort constructed to protect another ford can still be seen at Little Rocky Run. Lands surrounding the trail are now subject to 5-acre zoning, so the roads to the five major trailheads (Bull Run Regional Park, Route 28, Hemlock Overlook Regional Park, Bull Run Marina and Fountainhead Regional Park) retain a semi-rural character. This blue-blazed trail is one of many trails maintained by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. Bluebell Trail The middle of April is when the bluebell flowers are in bloom, along with over 25 varieties of wildflowers found on this part of the trail. The 1.5-mile loop within Bull Run Regional Park has the highest concentration of Bluebells; however, the Bull Run- Occoquan Trail has these and other flowers throughout. Bull Run Run The first Bull Run Run was held by the Virginia Happy Trails Running Club in April 1993. It is a 50-mile footrace following the course of the Bull Run-Occoquan Trail in an out-and-back format. From the year 2006 through 2011, there were 310 to 340 runners annually who started the race and 80% to 95% of them finished before the 13-hour cutoff. The overall course record is 6 hours, 8 minutes and 14 seconds, set by Matt Woods (31) in 2011.

Oxford Art Online, (accessed February 3, 2012; subscription required). Binns was the first director of the New York State School of Clayworking and Ceramics, currently called the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University. He began his position in 1900 and retired in 1931. His work included authorship of several books on the history and practice of pottery. Some of his more notable students included Arthur Eugene Baggs, William Victor Bragdon, R. Guy Cowan, Maija Grotell and Elizabeth Overbeck. This has led Binns to be called \\"the father of American studio ceramics\\".Carney, Margaret. (1998) Charles Fergus Binns: The Father of American Studio Ceramics. Hudson Hills Press.  Ceramic technique Binns's ceramic technique focused on the vessel as a utilitarian object. His work include vases, urns, and bowls. Binns threw each piece in three forms on a wheel, turning them on a lathe and piecing them together afterwards. One of the concepts Binns taught was 'dead ground', in which aspects of making that could not be precisely controlled, such as firing temperature or glaze calculations, were mitigated by control over glaze placement - e.g., glaze was to run to a certain point but not to encroach on the foot. Binns wrote of the artistic limitations of china-painting, which many amateur artists, mainly women, practiced at the time. He argued that “no-one with a spark of artistic fire can be content to copy the design of another or to merely add the finishing touches to work begun in a factory”, and that this feeling has caused china-painting to give place to pottery-making, in which, from “the consciousness of honest effort”, the artist experiences liberation.Binns, Charles F., \\"The craft of the potter\\", in Gustav Stickley (ed.), The craftsman, Vol. IX, Number 6 (March 1906), pp. 854-856 His book The Craft of the Potter (1910) may have given rise to the first use of the phrase “studio pottery”. In it Binns referred to \\"studio work\\" and the \\"artist potter\\", and a review of it in Adelaide Alsop Robineau's magazine Keramic Studio referred to “studio pottery”.Keramic Studio (Syracuse, New York), Vol. XII, No.2, June 1910, p.23 As a critic and influential educator in the ceramic field, his praise of utilitarian wares with artistic quality led the Arts and Craft Movement in American studio pottery.

Relationships table Family association The Jared Pratt Family Association is a family association that conducts primary genealogical research and preserves genealogical and other historical information on the Pratt family surname, especially the descendants of Mormon Pioneer Orson Pratt or of his brothers. The association takes its name from its founder, Orson Pratt's, father, Jared Pratt. Orson Pratt was an apostle in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a professor at University of Nauvoo in Illinois. After Orson trekked to what is now Utah, he served, among other offices, as the LDS Church Historian and Recorder 1874-1881 and also established the basis for the LDS Church's genealogical endeavors. Pratt had begun in the early-1850s an extensive work on the descendants and family of William Pratt, the earliest ancestor of the Pratts to come to what is now the United States, in cooperation with Frederick W. Chapman, a Congregationalist minister. Chapman's book was published in 1864, and Orson Pratt and his family members used it to perform temple work on many family members, continuing the focus and leading to them organizing the family association 17 years later.Given and Grow, Parley P. Pratt, p. 319-320 The association was chartered by its founder, Orson Pratt (in statement appended to the meticulous family genealogical data he had collected) \\"to collect and register therein, from generation to generation, the dates of births, marriages, places of residence and deaths of all the descendants of my four brothers and myself. ... It is to be hoped that all our posterity of whatever branch or name will be sufficiently interested to preserve their genealogy to the latest generation.\\" The association's president is Robert Grow, Ph.D. and one of the association's historians is Robert Grow's son, University of Southern Indiana professor Matthew Grow, now with the Joseph Smith Papers Project. According to the association, as of 2011 it possessed a computer database with 32,000 descendants of Jared Pratt and Charity Dickinson, believed to be half- complete. The association has published a newsletter since 1965.

After a series of ruinous libel suits and alleged government pressure on advertisers, however, the papers went bankrupt, with Le Journal shut down by court order in 2010. When the Arab Spring-inspired 2011 protests broke out in Morocco, however, Jamaï began an web-based news service, Lakome.com.

Jack and his adopted \\"family\\" soon took residence in an unused rusted-out boxcar. Together they dined on fish from the river, rat meat, and the occasional rabbit. After a while, Jack befriended an old railroad brakeman called \\"Stewbone.\\" Stewbone taught Jack the rhythmic style of guitar that he'd developed as a young man listening to the clickety-clack of the trains rolling to the next stop. One day, Stewbone told Jack, \\"Boy, I done taught ya everythang... the rest is in ya. Go on an' find it!\\" Stewbone disappeared soon after this, but suddenly Jack was writing these incredible songs. Now folks come from far and wide to hear Jack play his songs, or to talk about life, or just to taste the \\"best damn rat burgers west of the Mississippi\\"! ..Halfway to Nowhere CD.. The real Jack McTamney was born to Joseph McTamney and Mary McTamney (née Shields), the youngest of six children (Joseph, Mary Ellen, Francis, Gerard, and Bernadette).

Additionally, he wrote and directed over two hundred teaching films and documentaries. Cohen was born in Washington, D.C. and raised in New York City. Medical documentaries Prior to becoming a filmmaker, William Cohen studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology but left to begin a career in television news and filmmaking, first at KPTV in Portland, Oregon from 1961-1963. After a four-year stint in the U.S. Air Force, stationed in Japan and Hawaii, Cohen resumed his television news career in San Francisco at KTVU, KRON (NBC), and KGO (ABC) as an editor and documentary producer. In 1970 Cohen began to produce, direct, and edit medical films for corporate clients and hospitals including the UCSF Medical Center, 3M, and Brooks Shoes. In 1975, at the urging of Darryl Inaba, PharmD, Director of the Haight Ashbury Detoxification, Rehabilitation, and Aftercare Project, he co-produced and directed his first drug-education film, \\"Psychoactive\\" with Paul Steinbroner.\\"Psychoactive\\", William E.

Uppers, Downers, All Arounders was Dr. Inaba's and William Cohen's way of explaining the physiological and pharmacological responses that the body has to psychoactive drugs, those chemicals that can pass through the blood brain barrier and produce a mental effect in the central nervous system.

The film won a special jury award for cinematography at the 2013 Oxford Film Festival and the Best of Fest Award at the Charles B.

Plot  Arkansas, November 1973 - Frank (Michael Ray Davis) and his grandson, D (Thor Wahlestedt) go on an afternoon hunt. Just before dusk, the two hunters wander into the darkening woods to track down their kill and, to their horror, find that instead of a deer, they’ve shot their trespassing neighbor, Marion Mitchell (Thomas Moore). With a history of land disputes with the Mitchells fresh on Frank’s mind, he assures the boy that the only option is to hide the body deep in the woods. As the night draws on, Frank and the boy find themselves only deeper in darkness. Soon the lines between good and evil are no longer clear, and D begins to question if all will really be okay, come morning. According to an article in @Urban Magazine, the story of Come Morning is completely fictional but was partially inspired by Sims' boyhood hunting trips with his grandfather.http://www.aturbanmagazine.com/people/tabid/65/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/255/come- morning.aspx  Cast  * Michael Ray Davis as Frank * Thor Wahlestedt as D * Elise Rovinsky as Morigan * Thomas Moore as Marion Mitchell * Blake Logan as Wes Mitchell * Maurice Mejia as Jack * Dean Denton as Jim * Richard Ledbetter as Charlie  Production  Come Morning was shot over 12 days in mid October 2011. Filming took place just outside the small town of Kingsland, Arkansas, the boyhood home of director, Derrick Sims. Sims chose 1970s Kingsland, because he said “It captures the atmosphere and the hunting culture of southern Arkansas.” When asked why he set the film in 1973, Sims said hunting was different back then. \\"I didn't want the characters to bait the deer or have motion cameras to photograph them. I also didn't want them to have cellphones. There's just something unromantic about [them].http://www.fabledmotionpictures.com/Cleveland_County_Herald.html\\" According to the film's production diaries, during the final days of shooting it was 33 degrees. \\"We were standing in three feet of water...we had been shooting for 16 straight hours, and we were more like the walking dead than filmmakers. We had done the unthinkable; we had shot a feature-length film in just 12 days. That kind of thing doesn’t happen, and we fully understood why. Most films don’t call for heavy effects makeup, 75% night shoots, remote locations, living animals, bitter cold, shooting in water, gunshots, driving stunts...and child actors. Add an extremely low budget and 12 days of shooting on top of all of that. It’s pure madness\\".http://www.fabledmotionpictures.com/Production_Diary/Entries/2011/11/11_The_Walking_Dead.html Though the events of the film are completely fictional, Sims loosely based the characters of \\"D\\" and \\"Frank\\" off of himself and his grandfather who took him hunting as a child, and while the film takes place in a distinct cultural part of Arkansas, five of the more prominent roles (including Frank and D) went to actors from all around the U.S. However, there were still many roles filled by local actors and non-actors. Due to tight budget constraints, the crew consisted of just ten people.http://www.ustream.tv/channel/thehellashow Many cast and crew members served in multiple roles behind the camera including Sims, who served as the film's writer, director, cinematographer and editor. The film was shot on the RED MX with Cooke S4 Lenses. Critical response At the 2012 Austin Film Festival, Come Morning received generally good reviews. Austin Fusion Magazine said the film was \\"a subtle yet profound emotional roller coaster that will pull on your heart strings and unsettle your reasonings.\\"http://austinfusionmagazine.com/2012/10/19/austin-film-festival- reviews-and-previews-day-3/ KUT, Austin's NPR member station, said, \\"It’s an intense trip through the darkness of the woods and the soul, with phenomenal performances from a cast of unknowns and breathtaking cinematography.\\" http://kutnews.org/post/three-writerdirector-movies-austin-film-festival After screenings at the Oxford Film Festival in February 2013, WeGotThisCovered.com called it \\"a film that is far more than entertainment – it’s a piece of art itself\\".http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/morning-review/ Come Morning went on to win a special jury award for cinematography at the festival that year. Since then, the film has been praised by FilmThreat, Blu-Ray.com, Film School Rejects, Rogue Cinema, The Arkansas Democrat Gazette and many more. The film won Best of Fest award at the 2014 Charles B. Pierce Film Festival.

President and co-director of New Threads, a publication and website that promotes Chinese culture to the general public, Fang's aggressive campaign against allegations of academic fraud has been hotly debated; while Fang's works have appeared in many Chinese publications, various Chinese scholars have accused him of vigilantism and of using populist rhetoric in academic research. In 2019, due to the security fund incident, Fang Zhouzi’s fraud associate Peng Jian lost both cases in the domestic finals. The verdict has been inquired, and the court ruled that Peng Jian will refund 3.1 million donations and interest. Biography Fang Zhouzi (real name Fang Shimin) was born in Yunxiao County, Fujian, China in September 1967. Fang stated that his pen name, \\"Fang Zhouzi\\", is derived from a classical Chinese expression for \\"two ships sailing together\\"; in his case, the two ships stand for science and literature. Fang graduated from University of Science and Technology of China in 1990 and enrolled in Michigan State University, where he obtained a Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1995. Fang then worked at various institutions as a postdoctoral researcher in molecular genetics. In the summer of 2010, after Fang questioned the efficacy of his surgical procedure and the accuracy of his curriculum vitae, urologist Xiao Chuanguo hired thugs to assault Fang in Beijing. Fang escaped with only minor cuts and bruises, but believed it was an attempt to kill him. Xiao had sued Fang for libel five times in the past five years, winning one case, losing two and two further being undecided. The dispute between Fang and Xiao dated to the founding of the New Threads website, when Fang had used the website to question the accuracy of Xiao's application to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Fang is married to Liu Juhua, a senior reporter at the state- controlled Xinhua News Agency. Fang is a permanent resident of the United States. When in the United States, he lives in San Diego.  Campaign against fraud Fang is an active campaigner against what he perceives as fraud in the Chinese society. His anti-fraud efforts initially targeted academics, but later expanded to public figures in general. =Academia = Fang is famous for his website, New Threads (established in 2001), that discusses poor- quality science in China and his efforts to expose poor scientific work, fraud and increase the profile of research ethics in China have received wide coverage. Within the country there is no official body or procedure to handle complaints or examine allegations of fraud, and Fang started the website as an unofficial platform to expose instances. In 2006, a series of accusations and counter-accusations on Fang's website lead to significant media attention, criticisms of the self-conducted investigations by Chinese universities, and greater involvement by independent investigative bodies such as the Ministry of Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences or the National Natural Science Foundation of China in investigating allegations; though these institutions already have a role in investigating academic misconduct though their involvement is seen as ineffective. In 2012 Fang shared the inaugural John Maddox Prize, given out by Nature and Sense About Science to \\"individuals who have promoted sound science and evidence on a matter of public interest, with an emphasis on those who have faced difficulty or opposition in doing so.\\" The announcement of Fang's presentation summarized his contributions, saying: In a 2010 New York Times article, Fang ascribed the problems with Chinese scientific integrity to the university system being run by state bureaucrats with little or no knowledge of the fields they administer, who base their decisions regarding research grants and career advancements on the number of scientific publications found, rather than their quality, where or if they were published. According to Fang, other problems include fellow researchers who protect their peers, sometimes due to personal connections and sometimes due to a fear of being exposed themselves. As of 2010 Fang's website had listed over 900 examples of academic fraud, which included presidents of universities and nationally known researchers. =Nonscientists= Fang has also accused nonscientists of fraud and plagiarism. Fang questioned the qualifications and degrees of high-profile Chinese businessman Tang Jun, the former president of MSN China, who acquired his PhD degree from a diploma mill rather than the claimed California Institute of Technology. He also questioned former Google China president Kai-Fu Lee's intention for stating he was an associate professor at CMU in the Chinese version of his autobiography, while being actually an assistant professor. Lee responded by attributing the error to \\"nuances lost in translation\\".Spat with Fang Zhouzi leads Kaifu Lee to post his English biography free on Amazon Fang has accused Li Qun, a local Chinese official responsible for enforcing China's one-child policy, of falsely claiming to have worked for New Haven, Connecticut mayor John DeStefano Jr., and blogger, author and race-car driver Han Han of having his father ghost- writing for him, though Han denied the accusations. In Jan 2012, Fang accused Ping Fu, the Chinese-born American CEO of Geomagic, of fabricating stories in her memoir Bend, Not Break. In response, Fu posted a series of corrections and clarifications. Fang continued to make personal attacks on Fu,Fang's Sohu Weibo and later expanded his criticism to American media, calling the Daily Beast \\"the shame of American journalism\\" by making what he considered as a biased report.Fang's Hexun Blog: The Fu Affair: American Media's Pride, Prejudice and Falsehood (ending sentence) =Criticism= Despite the intent to scrutinize and improve the honesty of scientific research in China, Fang's actions have been criticized for lacking transparency that would allow proper investigations. Many of the roughly 100 allegations posted on Fang's website each year are anonymous and lack details, and those accused have been unable to respond as a result. On 8 May 2006, Fu Xinyuan, an Indiana University professor of immunology, published an open letter, signed by 120 overseas Chinese scholars, that called for due process and presumption of innocence in Chinese academic corruption cases. Furthermore, the letter criticized the practice of using populist rhetoric and personal attacks to affect institutional investigations. Although the letter did not explicitly mention Fang Zhouzi or his New Threads website, it was widely received as a rebuttal to Fang's campaigns. Fang denied Fu Xinyuan's claims, calling Fu's letter \\"contrary to the spirit of free speech\\". On 25 May 2006, Nature published a discussion of Fang's work, stating that while Fang's website had started a debate regarding academic integrity and scientific misconduct in China, areas where the country has admitted to \\"serious problems\\", the anonymous nature of the accusations posted on Fang's website reminded some of the similarly anonymous accusations that led to persecution of \\"government enemies\\" during the Cultural Revolution. Fang replied the Nature article, claiming that it is \\"absurd to compare Internet freedom of speech to the Cultural Revolution\\". Controversies =Libel conviction= In 2006, Fang was convicted of libel by an Intermediate Court.(Guangming Daily) Wuhan Intermediate Court Case No. 817 =Plagiarism allegation= On March 30, 2011, Beijing-based newspaper Legal Weekly published an investigative report on Fang's alleged plagiarism. It found an article authored by Fang, published in the newspaper Economic Observer and included in two of Fang's books, plagiarized an online article posted in 2001 by Ying He.Legal Weekly, 2011-03-30 On a separate issue, Michigan State University professor Robert Root-Bernstein accused that Fang, in an online post in 1995, plagiarized one of his essays published by Oxford University Press. \\"Investigation\\", Legal Weekly, 2011-03-30 In response, Fang apologized for not crediting Prof. Root-Bernstein in the post, but denied he committed plagiarism or copyright infringement. Soon after, Fang accused Dr. Root-Bernstein of being a former member of a pseudo-science group. =Shenzhen TV investigation= The television station of Shenzhen, China began airing an investigative report titled Fang Zhouzi Revealed on February 23, 2012.Fang Zhouzi Revealed: Episode 1 The program examined various controversies surrounding Fang, notably his conflict with Dr. Xiao Chuanguo.Episode 2 Among others, it found that Fang's claim that \\"Xiao's surgery procedure had a zero success rate\\" was false, by interviewing patients who successfully underwent the surgery.Fang Zhouzi Revealed: Episode 3 Episode 5 Episode 6 Fang declined to be interviewed by the station, calling it \\"shameless\\".Episode 4 On his Weibo, Fang asked his audience to identify the program's presenter, suggesting she needs to \\"pay a price\\".Fang Zhouzi's Sina Weibo (Verified) Fang also posted the photo, name and CV of the director of the TV station, calling him to be investigated by authorities.Fang Zhouzi's Sina Weibo (Verified) The series was abruptly pulled off air on Feb 27.Shenzhen TV Feb 27 2012 =Embezzlement allegation= On December 22, 2015, Wang Zhian, a China Central Television journalist, embarked upon a series of investigative reports, exposing a suspected fundraising scam that involved Fang Shimin and his lawyer, Peng Jian. Back to September 2, 2010, a ‘Security Fund’ dedicated to Fang's personal safety was launched. Peng Jian initiated the fundraising project and has been in charge since then. Wang’s investigation revealed that the alleged supervisory committee did not fulfill its primary responsibility; the internal auditing was almost in non-existence, and consequently, up to 179,392 yuan was embezzled from the fund to purchase a vehicle for Peng’s law firm. Views and essays =Scientific research in China= Commenting on the 2012 Nobel Prizes, Fang has stated that while China has made significant advances in technology, but has not caught up to Japan, Europe and the United States in science and research. He stated that he does not expect China to produce a Nobel Prize-winning scientist for the next ten or more years. = Religion= Fang has strongly criticized Christianity, dedicating a section of his New Threads website to its criticism. In an interview, Fang described the religion as barbaric, violent, and a threat to Western and Chinese culture and Jehovah a “murderous demon”.New Threads：Jehovah the Murderous Demon In an essay, he questioned the gospel accounts of the life of Jesus Christ, saying \\"there is no reliable historical record providing evidence that Jesus of Nazareth ever existed\\". Upon learning two teenage students died in an plane crash were heading for a summer camp organized by a Christian school, Fang commented: \\"why didn't (their) God protect them?\\"Fang Zhouzi's Sohu Weibo: \\"飞机失事的江山市城北中学的学生去美国参加“英语文化夏令营”，其实是洛杉矶一所以传教为目的的基督教学校搞的。上帝也不保佑保佑他们。\\" Fang has also criticized Li Yi, a Taoist monk known for allegedly magical feats, for taking advantage of the poor public health infrastructure in China by claiming he could improve people's health. Fang was the earliest critic of Falungong, a spiritual practice that was later banned in China. = Environmental Issues = Fang is an ardent supporter of the use of genetically modified food, writing articles and producing a series of lectures debunking the perceived risks and misinformation surrounding GMF. Fang vehemently denounces Greenpeace as an \\"anti-scientific organization\\", \\"a pseudo-environmental group\\". = Traditional Chinese medicine = Fang asserts Traditional Chinese medicine is superstitious pseudoscience and referred to its practitioners as \\"charlatans\\". He is one of the most vocal contemporary critics of TCM in China. Fang published a book systematically debunking TCM's theory and practice.  Awards  In November 2012, Fang was joint winner, with Simon Wessely, of the combined Nature and Sense About Science inaugural John Maddox Prize for standing up for science.

It is a Saturn-like planet orbiting at Earth-like distance, though slightly inwards of its star's habitable zone. Its eccentricity is 0.41, much higher than the Earth's eccentricity of 0.017. The planet's distance ranges from about 0.60 AU (closer to its star than Venus is to the Sun) and 1.44 AU (nearly as distant from its star as Mars is to the Sun). This planet takes 363.2 days to orbit the star, just two days less compared to the Earth's orbital period of 365.256366 days. Its mass is one- third that of Jupiter but its size and density are not known. Since inclination is not known, its actual mass is unknown, either slightly greater or much greater than its lower limit. This planet could have Earth-like moons with bodies of water and possible life due to the planet's similar distance from its parent star as Earth. But, given the planet's high eccentricity, and the star being more than twice as luminous as our Sun, hypothetical life on the moons may be a bit unlikely. Yanyan was discovered on 11 April 2011 using the radial velocity technique using the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT), and assigned the name HD 38283 b. This method uses to look for planets by watching the star periodically wobble caused by the gravitational tug of the orbiting planets. The planet was officially named Yanyan by representatives of Australia in the 2019 NameExoWorlds contest held by the IAU. The word \\"YanYan\\" is the Boonwurrung word for \\"boy\\".

He was educated in the public schools of Dane County, and graduated from Edgerton High School. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1924, and went into law practice with George Washington Blanchard in Edgerton, Wisconsin. He was appointed an assistant district attorney in Dane County in 1926 by Philip La Follette.  Elective office  Slagg won the Republican primary election for the first Rock County Assembly district (Blanchard's former seat) in 1928, receiving 3,683 votes to 2,836 for Thomas S. Nolan.

The culture medium used to grow Raji cells is RPMI supplemented with serum. Some characteristics of Raji cells include a lack of differentiation, illustrated by the formation of large aggregations of hundreds of individual cells. The cells are relatively large in diameter (5-8 μm), have irregular indented nuclei, and almost extensive cytoplasm with free ribosomes which tend to clump. Raji cells grow as single, non-motile, free- floating (non-adhesion) individuals or doublets to glass. Some cells look elongated, pear-shaped with larger, multinucleate, round cells. The Raji cell line produces an unusual strain of Epstein-Barr virus, which both transforms cord blood lymphocytes and induces early antigens in the cells. Translocations between chromosomes 8 and 22 have occurred in all three variations of the Raji cell line, but some cells synthesize immunoglobulin M with light chains of the kappa type, in contrast to the usual concordance between a translocation involving chromosome 22 and lambda chain synthesis. Both kappa genes and one lambda gene are rearranged. These findings indicate either that translocation may occur as a separate event from immunoglobulin gene rearrangement or that the proposed hierarchical sequence of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements is not always adhered to. The data also imply that in cells containing a translocation between the long arm of chromosome 8 and a chromosome bearing an immunoglobulin gene, alteration of cellular myc expression may occur regardless of the immunoglobulin gene that is expressed.http://www.sciencemag.org/gca?sendit.y=9&gca;=sci%3B222%2F4628%2F1094&sendit;=Get%20all%20checked%20abstract%28s%29 The cells grow in a suspension, are diploid, and are lymphoblastoid in morphology.

Considered to be a Philadelphia \\"Landmark,\\" it was originally built from 1927-1928 by Hoffman-Henon Co. for the Stanley Company of America (later Stanley Warner Theaters). The theater was named for Thomas Wynne, the attending physician of William Penn. It showed second run films and double features and could seat 1,663 people. In 1955 the theater closed and was taken over by the Uhr family of South Philadelphia. The building was renovated and renamed the Wynne Cateres where it became a popular place for parties and hosting. The last owner of the property died in 1993 and with no one left to claim the space, the building has remained unoccupied. In 2008 the Community Design Collaborative awarded a service grant to the Wynnefield Overbrook Revitalization Corporation (WORC) to be put towards the creation of plans for the redevelopment of the Wynne Theater complex. A report completed in 2010 presented several options, with community members favoring the property's conversion into a community center. This would see the unsafe and damaged areas of theater replaced, as well as the restoration of the historic headhouse, to create a large community hall above ground level parking. The project's total cost was estimated at $6.7 million but as of January 2012 no work has been initiated and a developer has yet to be found to carry out the proposal. In December 2011, the Provenance Architectural Salvage in Philadelphia removed and sold the building's neon art deco letters, and lighting fixtures from the outside of the building, owing to concern by the Department of License and Inspections that these were a safety hazard. The marquee letters were made from enameled steel and produced locally in nearby Lansdale.

He became a member of the Society of Writers to the Signet on 19 October 1609. He was a public notary in Edinburgh and he seems to have enjoyed the confidence of the Covenanters. However he maintained a link Glasgow becoming a burgess of the city in 1615, before becoming a burgess of Edinburgh in 1619. Not improbably he was the John Nicoll who was nominated as clerk to the general assembly at Glasgow in November 1638, when Sir Archibald Johnstone of Warriston was elected. Nicoll composed his chronicle partly from notes of what happened within his immediate experience, and partly from accounts in the newspapers and public intelligencers of the time. His political bias varies with the changes of the government, the proceedings and conduct of those in power being always placed in the best light. He probably died not long after 1667. Works Wodrow, who in his Sufferings of the Kirk makes large use of the manuscript of Nicoll, described it in the list of his papers as The Journals of John Nicol, writer to the signet, containing some account of our Scots Kings, with some Extracts as to China and the West Indies, and a Chronicle from Fergus the first to 1562.

Early life Lysaght was born in Mokoia, Taranaki, New Zealand on 14 April 1905 to Emily Muriel Lysaght née Stowe and Brian Cuthbert Lysaght. When she was 15 she discovered on Mount Taranaki an owlet moth previously unknown to science. That species was described in 1921 by entomologist G. V. Hudson and named Graphania averilla in her honour. Education Lysaght was initially educated at home by a governess but was sent to Chilton House Private Girls Boarding School in Wellington when she was 12. In 1923 Lysaght began studying for a degree at Victoria University College, Wellington. While attending University, Lysaght joined the Victoria University tramping club and went on tramps with John Beaglehole, with whom she later collaborated on scholarly works. While studying for her bachelor's degree Lysaght published her first papers on entomology. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1928 and obtained a Masters in Science in 1929. Her thesis was on the biology of Eucolaspis, a genus of beetle. From 1927 to 1929 she was on the staff of the Cawthron Institute's department of entomology and from 1931 to 1932 she was employed by Victoria University College as a temporary assistant in zoology. Subsequent to this Lysaght moved to England to live and continued her education. Lysagh spent three years undertaking postgraduate research at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in London, after which she was awarded a Doctorate from the University of London in 1935. Her doctorate thesis was on the nematode parasites of thrips. During this time Lysaght undertook artistic training first at Nottingham School of Art and later at St Martins School of Art in London. Work From 1935 to 1938 Lysaght was employed at the Plymouth laboratory of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. She also worked at the Imperial Institute of Entomology. Between 1936 and 1943 she published five papers in parasitology, including two papers on trematode parasites of gastropods. Lysaght subsequently obtained employment as an assistant editor of the zoology section of Chambers Encyclopaedia. During her time there, either in 1947 or 1948 she met Norman Kinnear, Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum of Natural History. It was Kinnear who suggested she research the birds of Cook's voyages. He assisted her in this endeavour by providing space for her to work at the British Museum of Natural History. Lysaght proceeded to catalogue all the bird paintings executed on all Cook's voyages. She also did in depth research on the museums' collection of Sydney Parkinson's paintings and drawings and continued to work at this project for over twenty years. As a result of her research she did much to help identify drawings by Herman Spöring, Bank's assistant. This culminated in her publishing in 1975 The book of birds: five centuries of bird illustration.

In 1990 she was posthumously awarded the Governor General Art Award in recognition of her artistic career and contributions. Early life Lusk was born in Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand on 5 May 1916. She was the daughter of Alice Mary (née Coats), and Thomas Younger Lusk, a draughtsman and architect, and had two older siblings, Marion and Paxton. The family moved to Hamilton where she went to primary school. A woman who had an art studio near to the Lusks, encouraged her to paint. In 1928 the family returned to Dunedin when her father joined the architectural firm, Mandeno and Frazer. Lusk had one more year at Arthur Street primary school before attending Otago Girl's High School in 1930. In 1933 she left high school, before she matriculated, and enrolled in the King Edward Technical College, the formal name for the Dunedin School of Art. Lusk enrolled against her father's wishes and later noted there had been 'one hell of a row' about her decision. Lusk attended the art school from 1934 to 1939. The school was a member of the La Trobe programme which involved the importation of practising artists from England to staff New Zealand schools. These artists included W. H. Allen and R. N Field, who arrived in 1925 and had a major impact on the Dunedin art scene. Lusk was taught by Charlton Edgar and took life classes under Russell Clark in his studio. Through a fellow student, Anne Hamblett, she met Colin McCahon and Toss Woollaston. Career In 1939 Lusk and a small group of her artist peers in Dunedin rented a studio in the central city, on the corner of Moray Place and Princes Street. It was here that her first solo show was held in 1940. In December 1942 Lusk married Dermot Holland, and in 1943 the couple moved to Christchurch. In Christchurch Lusk quickly became affiliated with The Group, an association of artists based in that city but with ties to artists throughout New Zealand. Although Lusk's painting output was restricted due to the obligations of caring for her young children, she quickly became established with special reference to her landscape painting. The combined exhibitions held by The Group members suited her better than striving to make enough work for solo exhibitions at this point in her career; as she later recalled \\"I did not paint in a continual professional manner. I painted when I could, and I would produce about six paintings a year, which was pretty good going in the circumstances.\\" In the 1940s Lusk completed a series of paintings, including Landscape, Overlooking Kaitawa, Waikaremoana (1948), which documented the massive engineering projects underlying the development of the Lake Waikaremoana hydroelectric scheme in the central North Island. She had a close friendship with Adelaide and Ian McCubbin - Ian was a construction engineer on the Lake Waikaremoana project. Through the McCubbins Lusk was introduced to Onekaka in Golden Bay, and especially the long wharf built for the exporting of pig iron from the nearby ironworks. Lusk took this landscape as her subject for the next 25 years. In 1979, two years before she ceased teaching at the art school, Lusk began a series of works based on buildings in Christchurch's central city that were being demolished in order to build office buildings and apartment blocks. She worked from photographs that she took and collaged with images culled from newspapers, and translated these into paintings made with watercolour, acrylic and coloured pencil. In a 1983 interview Lusk denied that the subject carried any psychological charge, saying that \\"My work is really very practical, and it would be quite dishonest if I tried to put in psychological meanings […] The Demolition works were a little misunderstood. [People thought] that I became very fascinated with the factual destruction of buildings as a sort of sociological thing. But that was not true […] It was a visual image to hang my media painting on, that’s all.\\" Lusk's late series of watercolours, The Arcade Awnings, based on the famous tourist scene at St Mark's Square in Venice, is held in the collection of the Auckland Art Gallery. In Gordon H Brown and Hamish Keith's 1969 book An introduction to New Zealand painting 1839–1967 (the first modern overview of painting in New Zealand) Lusk's work was contextualised with that of artists such as Rita Angus, McCahon and Toss Woollaston. The authors wrote: > In a number of ways the unpretentious, well-considered and solid qualities > of her work summed-up a good deal that was thought to be the best tendencies > of the Canterbury painters during this decade. In essence it was > straightforward, uncomplicated and while not denying detail when necessary, > remained uncluttered. Doris Lusk continued to develop this style through the > 1940s and fifties with paintings like Tahananui, Power House at Tuai and > Botanical Gardens, Hāwera. In a 1996 publication accompanying Landmarks: The Landscape Paintings of Doris Lusk, an exhibition of Lusk's work she co-curated, art historian Lisa Beaven disputed this assessment, writing: > An analysis of her art throughout her career reveals a deep fascination with > particular motifs, centring around industrial imagery in landscape settings. > For more than five decades, Lusk consistently pursued this preoccupation, > using different techniques and employing different media. From being the > result of random excursions, Lusk's paintings were directed explorations, > not just of the relationship between the structures and the land around > them, but also of the buildings themselves, and aspects of the > juxtapositions of interior and exterior, exposure and concealment, surface > and depth. The manifold layers of meaning embedded in the buildings and > their role in projecting a certain mood, suggest her painting may profit > from being read as expressions of moods, metaphors and symbols. Art historian Julie King, in a review of Landmarks, noted that the exhibition gave the opportunity to assess Lusk's later paintings, and 'how she was positioned in relation to the new artistic models, values, and professionalism of the art institutional world which emerged in New Zealand in the late 1950s and '60s.' King argued that the negative reception of Lusk's previous 1973 survey exhibition (organised by the Dowse Art Museum and toured to Auckland City Art Gallery) by Auckland critics reflected the 'exclusivity of the canon created in Auckland by critics and curators in the early '70s' and the way art history in New Zealand had been written, 'with its focus on Colin McCahon and modernism, on internationalism and abstraction, so that placed within this context, her career appears peripheral.' In the same article, King examined how being a woman artist may have inflected Lusk's career and opportunities: > Despite her reluctance to acknowledge the political issues surrounding > women's art practice, Lusk's significance also lies within the history of > women's artistic culture during the post-war period. At a time when social > assumptions emphasised women's domestic role, she challenged these > expectations by retaining her firm commitment to painting, and gained > recognition as one of New Zealand's leading painters. Yet her painting was > always fitted within the constraints of domestic life. After her marriage > and birth of three children in the '40s, she dealt with the practicalities > of looking after her family by painting in the kitchen,and it was not until > the late '60s that she even had a studio of her own. Lusk was unable to > study overseas until 1974, and her art was fitted into her personal life, so > that visits to friends at Tuai and family holidays became her opportunity > for painting. In a 1996 article, art historian Grant Banbury noted that while Lusk was usually discussed in terms of her landscape painting, she also produced a number of portraits and self-portraits, and championed life drawing as both an artist and a teacher. Lusk mainly painted close friends, family and colleagues, along with a small number of commissions and several works painted in the 1970s based on images from newspapers. In 1939, while at art school, Lusk painted a portrait of Colin McCahon; nearly 50 years later, in 1987, Lusk painted Return to Otago, a portrait of Anne McCahon and their son William - Colin McCahon had died earlier that year. Career as a potter In addition to her painting career, Lusk was also a pioneer potter in New Zealand. She was introduced to modelling with clay by Field while at art school, which ignited her interest in the medium. She made her ceramics largely under her married name, Doris Holland, most of it in earthenware. In 1947 she began teaching pottery at Risingholme Community Centre with Margaret Frankel, and continued there until 1967. She was president of the Canterbury Potters' Association from 1970 to 1972. In 1970 she was awarded a travel scholarship by the Canterbury Society of Arts and used this to research contemporary Australian ceramics in Canberra, Adelaide, Alice Springs and Melbourne. Teaching career Lusk was appointed a tutor at the University of Canterbury School of Fine Arts in 1966 and was made a permanent staff member within the following 18 months. She continued to teach at the School until 1981. Exhibiting career and retrospective exhibitions Lusk exhibited mainly with The Group in Christchurch in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s and 1960s her work was regularly included in the Auckland City Art Gallery's annual surveys of recent New Zealand painting. The first retrospective exhibition of Lusk's work was held at the Dunedin Public Art Gallery in 1966. A second retrospective was held at the Dowse Art Museum in 1973. A major exhibition of her landscape works, Landmarks: The Landscape Paintings of Doris Lusk, was held at the Christchurch Art Gallery in 1996, accompanied by a publication with contributions by Lisa Beaven and Grant Banbury. To mark the centenary of Lusk's birth in 1916, in 2016 exhibitions were held at the Dunedin Public Art Gallery (Doris Lusk 1916-1990) and Christchurch Art Gallery (Doris Lusk: Practical Visionary). Collections Examples of Lusk's work are held by most New Zealand public art galleries. Significant works include Tahunanui in the Hocken Collections; Tobacco Fields, Pangatotara, Nelson (1943) and The Pumping Station (1958) at the Auckland Art Gallery; Power House, Tuai (1948), Landscape, Overlooking Kaitawa, Waikaremoana (1948) and Canterbury Plains from Cashmere Hills (1952) at the Christchurch Art Gallery; Akaroa Harbour, Banks Peninsula (1949) in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

Manitou was originally commissioned and privately owned by race car driver James Lowe. She was launched in 1937 and promptly won the 1938 Chicago- Mackinac Race in the cruising division (on corrected time), beating all previous records. She came a close second the next year. In 1940 and 1941, Manitou won the Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race. After these successes, Lowe sold her, and in 1955 she was donated to the US Coast Guard to be used as a training vessel at the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. President Kennedy used Manitou while he was in office. Manitou was returned to private ownership in 1968 when she became a training vessel for the Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship in Maryland. The boat took on the nickname: \\"Floating White House\\". In 1999 Manitou was sold to Laura Kilbourne, granddaughter of James R. Lowe, the original owner. Manitou was then given a comprehensive refit at Deagle's Marine Railway in Deltaville, Virginia. In late 2010 she was sold to four joint owners and underwent an extensive refit in early 2011. She was then shipped to the Mediterranean where she was raced extensively and made available for charter out of ports on the French Riviera.

Early life Stürtz was born in Wieps, a village outside of Allenstein, East Prussia. He grew up in Königsberg, and after attending the Friedrich Bessel High School, he joined the High Seas Fleet as a sailor. He served aboard the SMS Seydlitz and participated in the Battle of Jutland of 1916 during World War I. In 1918, he lost his commission and became a war pensioner after a serious illness. He then worked in various jobs as an automobile driver and repairman. Rise to Power In 1925, Stürtz joined the National Socialist German Worker's Party, and then became the NSDAP district leader in the city of Dortmund in 1926. By 1929 he became Party District Manager of Siegerland and also a democratically elected Member of the Westphalian Provincial Parliament. Stürtz became Party District Manager of Gau Westfalen in June 1930 and by September was elected to the national Reichstag for Weimar Republic Electoral District 18 (Westfalen-Süd). On 1 October of the same year, the party appointed him Deputy Gauleiter of Gau Westfalen. Upon the Machtergreifung (Nazi seizure of power) in 1933, Stürtz became a member of the Prussian State Council. In 1935, the powers of Germany's constituent states were diminished and their responsibilities replaced by the NSDAP Gaue. On 7 August 1936, Stürtz succeeded Wilhelm Kube in the powerful role of Gauleiter of Gau Kurmark, and was appointed to the position of Oberpräsident of the Prussian Provinces of Brandenburg and Posen-West Prussia, thus uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in these provinces. After restructuring of the Gau, Gau Kurmark became Gau Mark Brandenburg on 31 January 1939 and Stürtz remained its leader. World War II At the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, Stürtz was appointed Reich Defense Commissar (RVK) for Military District III, which encompassed Brandenburg and other areas surrounding Berlin. Important sectors of military and civilian administration were now directly or at least de facto subject to his control. On 21 April 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, Stürtz went missing. After his widow searched for him unsuccessfully for ten years – even amongst the late repatriates () – he was officially declared dead in 1957 by the District Court of Düsseldorf, the city of his residence. The court fixed his date of death to 31 December 1945. It was assumed that he was captured by Soviet troops and died in detention.

This is the union's component structure: * COMPONENT 1 - Corrections and Sheriff Services * COMPONENT 3 - Community Social Services * COMPONENT 4 - Health Services * COMPONENT 5 - Retail, Stores and Warehouse * COMPONENT 6 - Social, Information and Health * COMPONENT 7 - Education, Scientific, Technical and Administrative * COMPONENT 8 - Community Health Services * COMPONENT 10 - Operational Services * COMPONENT 12 - Administrative Services * COMPONENT 17 - General Services * COMPONENT 20 - Environmental, Technical and Operational Most members of BCGEU Components 1, 5, 6, 12 & 20 are covered by B.C.'s Public Service Pension Plan. This pension plan currently has equity of over $23 billion. Most members of the other components are covered by the Municipal Pension Plan (MPP), the College Pension Plan (CPP) or the union's own targeted benefit pension plan. As the nature of public sector employment has changed in recent decades in British Columbia, the number of BCGEU members who work directly for the government has declined while the number of BCGEU members doing work that has been devolved from the provincial government or contracted to the private sector has increased. The BCGEU is now the leading union organizing casino workers in the province, negotiating strong collective agreements. Political involvement Although the Union's constitution commits the union to not affiliating with any political party, the BCGEU has been a significant and long-term supporter of the BC New Democratic Party, contributing $157,770.64 in the year following the 2009 provincial election. Staff BCGEU staff are themselves unionized, being represented by the Union Workers' Union (UWU) and MoveUP, the Movement of Union Professionals. Bargaining between the BCGEU and its servicing staff (then members of -CEP) employees broke down in 2005, resulting in a multi-week strike.

Some several attempts have been made to formalize and define the terminology of comics by authors such as Will Eisner, Scott McCloud, R. C. Harvey and Dylan Horrocks. Much of the terminology in English is under dispute, so this page will list and describe the most common terms used in comics. Comics \\"Comics\\" is used as a non-count noun, and thus is used with the singular form of a verb, in the way the words \\"politics\\" or \\"economics\\" are, to refer to the medium, so that one refers to the \\"comics industry\\" rather than the \\"comic industry\\". \\"Comic\\" as an adjective also has the meaning of \\"funny\\", or as pertaining to comedians, which can cause confusion and is usually avoided in most cases (\\"comic strip\\" being a well- entrenched exception). \\"Comic\\" as a singular noun is sometimes used to refer to individual comics periodicals, what are known in North America as \\"comic books\\". \\"Underground comix\\" is a term first popularized by cartoonists in the underground comix movement of the 1960s and 1970s in an attempt to move the word away from its etymological origins. Art Spiegelman in particular has been a proponent of its usage, hoping to highlight the fact that the medium is capable of mature, non-comedic content, as well as to emphasize the hybrid nature of the medium (\\"co-mix\\"). \\"Alternative comics\\" is a term covering a range of American comics that have appeared since the 1980s, following the comix movement of the late 1960s/early 1970s. Other terms used as synonyms for \\"comics\\" are \\"sequential art\\", a term coined and popularized by Will Eisner, and graphic novel, which is normally used to denote book-form comics—although this usage is not consistent. Layout A typical comics page layout. =Panel= A panel (alternatively known as frame or box) is one drawing on a page, and contains a segment of action. A page may have one or many panels, and panels are frequently, but not always, surrounded by a border or outline, whose shape can be altered to indicate emotion, tension or flashback sequences. The size, shape and style of a panel, as well as the placement of figures and speech balloons inside it, affect the timing or pacing of a story. Panels are used to break up and encapsulate sequences of events in a narrative. What occurs in a panel may be asynchronous, meaning that not everything that occurs in a single panel necessarily occurs at one time. =Gutter= The gutter is the space between panels. Vertical gutters can be made thinner than horizontal gutters in order to encourage the reader to group each row of panels for easier reading. =Tier= A tier is a singular row of panels. =Splash= A splash or splash page is a large, often full-page illustration which opens and introduces a story. Often designed as a decorative unit, its purpose is to capture the reader's attention, and can be used to establish time, place and mood. =Spread= A spread is an image that spans more than one page. The two-page spread or double-page spread is the most common, but there are spreads that span more pages, often by making use of a foldout (or gatefold). Elements A caption (the yellow box) gives the narrator a voice. The characters' dialogue is given through speech balloons. The character speaking is indicated by the tail of the balloon. =Speech bubble= A speech/word/dialogue balloon or speech/word/dialogue bubble is a speech indicator, containing the characters' dialogue. The indicator from the balloon that points at the speaker is called a tailpointer or tail. The speech balloon bridges the gap between word and image—\\"the word made image\\", as expressed by Pierre Fresnault-Druelle. In early renderings, speech balloons were no more than ribbons emanating from their speakers' mouths, but as it evolved and became more sophisticated, it became a more expressive device. Its shape came to convey meaning as well. A thought balloon contains copy expressing a character's unvoiced thoughts, usually shaped like a cloud, with bubbles as a pointer. Emotions can be expressed by the shape of the balloon—spiked balloons can indicate shouting, and \\"dripping\\" balloons can indicate sarcasm. =Caption= In a caption, words appear in a box separated from the rest of the panel or page, usually to give voice to a narrator, but sometimes used for the characters' thoughts or dialogue. In some comics, where speech balloons are not used, the caption provide the reader with text about what is happening in the images. This genre is called text comics. =Sound effects= Sound effects or onomatopoeia are words without bubbles that mimic sounds. They are non-vocal sound images, from the subtle to the forceful, such as 'ding-ding' for a bell, to \\"WHAM\\" for an impact. Concepts =Closure= The reader performs closure by using background knowledge and an understanding of panel relations to combine panels mentally into events. =Encapsulation= Encapsulation is the capturing of prime moments in a story. Not every moment of a story is presented in comics. For the artist, encapsulation involves choosing what will be presented in which panels, how many panels will be used to present the action, and the size and layout of the panels. The layouts of the panels can influence the way the panels interact with each other to the reader. This interaction can lend more meaning to the panels than what they have individually. Encapsulation is distinctive to comics, and an essential consideration in the creation of a work of comics. Division of labour Sometimes all aspects of a comics production down to the editing, publishing and distribution are done by a single person; in such cases the term \\"comic book creator\\" (also \\"comics creator\\") is employed (occasionally the term \\"graphic novelist\\" is also employed,M. Keith Booker (ed.), Encyclopedia of Comic Books and Graphic Novels, Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2010, p. 172: \\"William Erwin Eisner was a comic book creator, graphic novelist, teacher, entrepreneur, and advocate of comics.\\" but ambiguity may arise because the same term is also used to refer to the person who only writes the scriptContemporary Literary Criticism, Volume 195, Gale, 2005, p. 167: \\"(Full name Neil Richard Gaiman) English graphic novelist\\".). The sophisticated term \\"graphic narrator\\" is also found in the academic literature on art education.Elliot W. Eisner and Michael D. Day (eds.), Handbook of Research and Policy in Art Education, Routledge, 2004, p. 305. At the other extreme, the labour behind the comics creation is sometimes divided up into different specialties. =Cartoonist= A cartoonist (also comic strip creator) may refer to a person who does most or all of the art duties, and frequently, but not always, implies that the artist is also the writer. =Writer= Also sometimes called scripter, plotter or author,Booker, M. Keith (ed.), Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas, Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2014, pp. 174 and 867. the writer scripts the work—scripting may include plot, dialogue and action—in a way that the artist (or artists) can interpret the story into visuals for the reader. Writers can communicate their stories in varying amounts of detail to the artist(s) and in a number of ways, including verbally, by script or by thumbnail layout. =Artist= The artist is the person who handles the visuals. This job may be broken down further into: Penciller The penciller or penciler lays down the basic artwork for a page, deciding on panel placement and the placement of figures and settings in the panels, the backgrounds and the characters' facial expressions and poses. Inker An inker or finisher \\"finishes\\" and sometimes enhances, the pencilled artwork using ink (traditionally India ink) and a pen or brush to create a high-contrast image for photographing and printing. The extent of the inker's job varies depending on how tight the penciller's work is, but nonetheless requires the skill of an artist, and is more or less active depending on the completeness of the pencils provided. Colourist The colourist or colorist adds colours to the finished artwork, which can have an effect on mood and meaning. Colourists can work with a variety of media, such as rubylith, paints, and computers. Digital colorists may employ a Flatter to assist them. =Letterer= Normally separate from the writer, the letterer is the person who fills (and possibly places) speech balloons and captions with the dialogue and other words meant to be read. Letterers may also provide the lettering for sound, although this is often done by the artist even when a letterer is present. In the West, comics have traditionally been hand-lettered, although computer typesetting has become increasingly common. The manner in which the letterer letters the text influences how the message is interpreted by the reader, and the letterer can suggest the paralanguage of dialogue by varying the weight, size and shape of the lettering. Formats =Comic strip= A comic strip is a short work of comics which has its origins in the world of newspapers, but may also appear in magazines or other periodicals, as well as in books and elsewhere. In comic strips, generally the only unit of encapsulation is the panel. Mutt and Jeff daily comic strip (1913) Dailies As the name implies, a daily comic strip is a comic strip that is normally run six days a week in a newspaper, historically in black and white, although colour examples have become common. They normally run every day in a week but one (usually Sunday), in which the strip appears larger and usually in colour. The Sunday strips are often outside the ongoing story in the case of strips that have continuity. Usually, daily strips are short and limited to one tier. Full-page Krazy Kat Sunday comic strip (1922) Sundays Sunday comics are comic strips that traditionally run in newspapers on Sundays (Saturdays in some papers), frequently in full colour. Before World War II, cartoonists normally were given an entire page to themselves, and often would devote the page to a single comic strip, although many would divide the page between a main strip and a \\"topper\\" (which would sometimes run on the bottom). Wartime paper shortages brought down the size of strips, and to this day Sunday pages normally are made up of a multitude of strips. =Gag and editorial cartoons= Gag cartoons and editorial cartoons are usually single-panel comics, although sequential examples are not rare. A gag cartoon (a.k.a. panel cartoon or gag panel) is most often a single-panel cartoon, usually including a hand-lettered or typeset caption beneath the drawing. A pantomime cartoon carries no caption. In some cases, dialogue may appear in speech balloons, following the common convention of comic strips. As the name implies—\\"gag\\" being a show business term for a comedic idea—these cartoons are most often intended to provoke laughter. An editorial cartoon or political cartoon is most often a single-panel comic that contain some level of political or social commentary. Such cartoons are used to convey and question an aspect of daily news or current affairs in a national or international context. Political cartoons generally feature a caricaturist style of drawing, to capture the likeness of a politician or subject. Political cartoonists may also employ humor or satire to ridicule an individual or group, emphasize their point of view, or comment on a particular event. The traditional and most common outlet for political cartoons is the editorial page of a newspaper, or in a pocket cartoon, in the front news section of a newspaper. Editorial cartoons are not usually found in the dedicated comic section, although certain cartoons or comic strips have achieved crossover status. =Comic book= A comic book, also known as a comic or floppy, is a periodical, normally thin in size and stapled together. Comic books have a greater variety of units of encapsulation than comic strips, including the panel, the page, the spread, and inset panels. They are also capable of more sophisticated layouts and compositions. A floppy comic is also known as an American comic book. Graphic novel Graphic novel is a term whose definition is hard to pin down, but usually refers to self-contained, book-length form. Some would have its use restricted only to long-form narratives, while at the other extreme are people who use it as a synonym for \\"comics\\" or \\"comic book\\". Others again define it as a book with a square-bound spine, even if it is a collection of short strips. Still others have used the term to distance their work from the negative connotations the terms \\"comic\\" or \\"comic book\\" have for the public, or to give their work an elevated air. Other than in presentation and intent, they hardly differ from comic books. Some prefer not use the term \\"graphic novel\\" at all. Amongst the criticisms are that the use of the word \\"novel\\" excludes non- novelistic genres, such as journalism, biography or history. Others believe the term has become too general, a catch-all for all kinds of content, and thus meaningless. Towards the close of the 20th century, the three major comics-producing traditions—American, western European (especially the Franco- Belgian), and Japanese—converged in a trend towards book-length comics: the comic album in Europe, the in Japan, and the graphic novel in the English- speaking countries. =Webcomics= Webcomics, comics published via the Internet on the World Wide Web, have emerged since the beginning of the 21st century. As they are not limited by the size and shape of a physical page, they can make use of what Scott McCloud calls the infinite canvas, where the individual comics can make use of different sizes and dimensions. Webcomics are also capable of incorporated multimedia elements, such as sound, animation and bigger panels (scrolling panels). In South Korea, an infinite canvas format caught on called the webtoon. A slide show-like format for webcomics was described by French cartoonists Balak in 2010, which he dubbed Turbomedia. International comics Comics of non-English origin are often referred to by the terms used in those comics' language of origin. The most widespread example is when fans of Japanese comics use the term manga, which is also applied to non-Japanese comics done in a Japanese style. One also sees BD or bandes dessinées used to refer to Franco-Belgian comics, manhwa and manhua to refer to Korean and Chinese comics respectively, and fumetti to refer to Italian comics, although this term is also used in English to refer to comics whose graphics are made using photographs rather than illustrations.

He viewed the organisation as being part of a world government which would guide and direct the Kingdom of God (Zion) on earth during the end times as a theodemocracy. Vision Smith envisioned this council as serving in an advisory capacity to both the Priesthood authorities of his church and a Council of Fifty. This group of three organizations was expected to rule as a world government just prior to the Millennium. As advisers, the Council of Friends would serve as the base of the governing body, but possessed no real political power. Although claims to priesthood authority preceded the official organization of Smith's church in 1830, and a Council of Fifty was organized on March 11, 1844, no Council of Friends was ever organized by Smith. Mormon fundamentalism The concept of a Council of Friends or Priesthood Council is central to the Mormon fundamentalist theology developed by Lorin C. Woolley and others in the late 1920s, wherein it was said to consist of seven \\"High Priest Apostles\\" holding higher authority than the Quorum of the Twelve of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).Musser, Joseph W. (1948), A Priesthood Issue. Early fundamentalists believed that the council had been restored in secret by Joseph Smith before the LDS Church itself, and dated back to the time of Adam.Musser, Joseph W. (1939) Michael, Our Father and Our God, Truth Publications, 122–23. Various Mormon fundamentalist leaders were said to have been members of the Council at one time. When fully organized, Woolley taught that the Council would function as the presidency of a larger, seventy-one member Sanhedrin.Zitting, Laura Tree. (1988) Charles F. Zitting: One of God's Noble Men. The authority of the Council of Friends pertained to the Priesthood and not to the church, early Mormon fundamentalists. Most members of the original members of the Council of Friends had been excommunicated from the LDS Church. They felt that its existence gave them the right to continue solemnizing plural marriages even after LDS Church President Wilford Woodruff's 1890 Manifesto discountenancing the practice.

Campus buildings are categorized by the major street or vicinity on which they are located on campus. In 2011, Slate magazine and Travel+Leisure described the Seattle campus as one of the most beautiful university campuses in the United States.\\"America's most beautiful college campuses\\", Travel+Leisure (September 2011) History The University of Washington, Seattle campus is situated on the shores of Union and Portage Bays, with views of the Cascade Range to the east and the Olympic Mountains to the west. The main campus is bounded on the west by 15th Avenue N.E., on the north by N.E. 45th Street, on the east by Montlake Boulevard N.E., and on the south by N.E. Pacific Street. East Campus stretches east of Montlake Boulevard to Laurelhurst and is largely taken up by wetlands and sports fields. South Campus occupies the land between Pacific Street and the Lake Washington Ship Canal which used to be a golf course and is given over to the health sciences, oceanography, fisheries, and the University of Washington Medical Center. West Campus is less of a separate entity than the others, many of its facilities being on city streets, and stretches between 15th Avenue and Interstate 5 from the Ship Canal to N.E. 41st Street. University Way, known locally as \\"The Ave\\", lies nearby and is a focus for much student life at the university. Cherry trees in bloom in the Quad. The oldest building on campus is Denny Hall. Built of Tenino sandstone in 1895 and named in honor of Seattle pioneers Arthur A. and Mary Denny. It served as the core of the University for many years. The Theodor Jacobsen Observatory, the on campus observatory situated just north of Denny Hall, was built from the left over sandstone used in the construction of Denny Hall. Although it is rarely used today, the observatory is the second oldest building on campus. After other structures were erected near Denny Hall with apparently little overall planning, the Board of Regents determined that a master plan was needed. Early plans, including a preliminary proposal by John Charles Olmsted, stepson of renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, had little impact. Instead, it was the Alaska-Yukon- Pacific Exposition that defined much of the campus's future layout. The exposition plan, also designed by John C. Olmsted, defined the University's major axis on the lower campus. Oriented to the southeast, it follows the East Asian concept of shakkei or borrowed scenery, providing the University with its primary vista of Mount Rainier on clear days. Most of the University's science and engineering buildings line this axis. thumb221x221px Denny Hall After the exposition, the Board of Regents sought a master plan that would unite the newly developed lower campus with the original buildings of the upper campus including Denny Hall. Rejecting a further proposal from Olmsted, the regents instead turned to local architects Carl F. Gould and Charles H. Bebb. Their proposal was accepted, and came to be called the Regents' Plan. It specified a northeast-southwest axis on upper campus around which would be centered the University's liberal arts departments. This axis joins the lower campus axis laid down during the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition at an open space left behind after a large temporary structure built for the fair was torn down. This space was later paved with a distinctive red brick and has come to be known as Red Square. Some of the buildings from the exposition were kept by the university and have been retrofitted over the years since. One of these is Architecture Hall. Suzzallo Library Reading Room Bebb and Gould's plan also called for all future construction to adhere to a Collegiate Gothic style. This style is best exemplified on the University campus by the early wings of Suzzallo Library, the University's central library. Drumheller Fountain and Mount Rainier New construction in the 1960s saw a deviation from the Collegiate Gothic style as specified in the Regents' Plan. Business facilities on the upper campus, science and engineering structures on lower campus, and a new wing of Suzzallo Library, were all built in a modernist style, as was a unique, glass-walled building housing an experimental nuclear reactor. The reactor opened in 1961; a small radioactivity leak in 1972 resulted only in a temporary shutdown, but security concerns eventually led to it being decommissioned. It was deactivated in 1988, dismantled in 2006, and the building was demolished in 2016. An apparent attempt to harmonize future development with the Regents' Plan can be seen in the University's most recent construction, including the 1990 Kenneth Allen wing of the central library and a new generation of medical, science and engineering buildings. Significant funding came from Microsoft co-founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates, who have strong family connections to the university but did not attend UW. Mary Gates Hall opened in May 2000, and in September 2003, the UW law school relocated to the $74 million William H. Gates Hall on the northwest corner of campus, and the $90 million UW Medical Center surgery pavilion opened for operation. The $72 million Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering opened in October 2003. In March 2006, the $150 million William H. Foege bioengineering and genome sciences building was dedicated by Bill Gates and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter. In September 2006, then President Mark Emmert announced that the University had finalized the purchase of the neighboring 22-story Safeco Plaza (a University District landmark) as well as several adjacent buildings for the sum of $130 million. At present, plans are being finalized to relocate UW administration and support services to the complex, leaving the main campus (two blocks away) for teaching and research. Most of the streets and major walkways on campus are named after the state's counties. Major exceptions are Memorial Way and George Washington Lane. Memorial Way is named in honor of members of the UW community who died in World War I and also features a flagpole engraved at its base with the members of the UW community who died in World War II. Other attractions on campus include the Henry Art Gallery and the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. The Washington Park Arboretum, south of main campus across Union Bay, is run by the university, though owned by the city of Seattle. The Warren G.

Visitors can also visit the historic Chickasaw Nation Capitol building located next door.Chickasaw Council House and Museum, Travel Oklahoma Profile  History  The Chickasaw settled on Choctaw lands in the Indian Territory following the Trail of Tears. The Nation became independent in 1856 when a treaty was signed in Washington giving the Chickasaw Nation full ownership of 4,707,903 acres of land and the right of independent government. The Chickasaw modeled their government after the United States, moving from a tribal council to a three-branch system consisting of legislative, executive and judicial branches. It created its first constitution in 1848, and elected officers in 1857. Tishomingo became the Nation's capital at this time, having received its name from the Chickasaw warrior of the same name, Chief Tishomingo, who had died en route to Oklahoma.  The Council House  The Council House is a 14 by 24 foot log building that was originally located at Good Spring on Pennington Creek. A tree trunk attached to its outside wall was once used as a whipping post. This structure served as the location of government meetings until the brick Capitol was constructed in 1858. The Council House was moved and used as a smoke house by Cyrus Harris, the first Chickasaw tribal governor. The brick building was demolished following a fire. In 1898 it was replaced by the structure that remains today, a large granite building, which also served as the Johnston County Courthouse.Green, Richard, \\"Chickasaw Council House Museum and Chickasaw Nation Capitol, OK\\", American Indian places: a historical guidebook, 2008, p 127-128 In the 1930s, the Council House was placed on the west side of the Capitol building, and in the 1960s it was restored and covered by a tile block building that became the Museum.  Capitol building  The red granite building was the third Capitol building for the Chickasaw Nation. It was preceded by an 1853 one-room log Council House and 1858 brick building that was destroyed by fire. The building was constructed in 1898 at a cost of $15,000 Fitzgerald, David and Jayroe, Jane Oklahoma 3 p 71 in the Victorian Gothic styles, utilizing granite from the nearby, then tribally-owned quarry. It served as the seat of the Nation's tribal government until Oklahoma Statehood. It consists of three stories, an arched doorway on the south side, and a dome on top. The building was sold in 1908 to Johnston County for $7,500 for use as the county courthouse.Green, Richard, Te Ata: Chickasaw Storyteller, American Treasure, 2006, p 142 and 294 In 1989, the Chickasaw Nation repurchased the Capitol from Johnston County, and today the first two floors house exhibits that preserve the history of this early period of Chickasaw tribal government.

Life Ida Mary Withers was born in Wellington, the daughter of Elizabeth Robins and her husband John Talbot Withers, a decorator. She grew up in Duvachelle, Banks Peninsula and attended Christchurch Girls’ High School. Lough’s early aspiration was to be a writer; one of her poems was included in the 1930 anthology of New Zealand poetry Kowhai Gold. In the early 1930s Lough spent three years in France working as a governess in order to learn French. She returned to Christchurch in the mid 1930s, where she spent the remainder of her life. On 30 August 1947 Lough married John Harold Welsh Lough, who died later that year in the Ballantyne’s department store fire. Weaving career Lough did not take up weaving until she was in her forties, when a visit to Scandinavia in 1953 triggered her interest in learning weaving. On her return to Christchurch she set about finding tuition and materials: at this time there was little access to supplies or tuition. Lough was working as a librarian at Burwood Hospital and Judith Hay, the occupational therapist at the hospital, taught her the basics of weaving. Using coloured cotton and linen thread, Lough built up her skills largely on hundreds of sets of table- mats, which sold well. She also learned to spin and dye her own wool. In 1959 her work was shown at the Auckland City Art Gallery in an exhibition of New Zealand craft, along with other weavers such as Ilse van Randow and Zena Abbott. The introduction to the catalogue noted a ‘healthy trend shown by this exhibition, particularly in the pottery and weaving sections, is an experimentation with local materials’. Brief biographies of the exhibiting artists were included in the catalogue: > Ida Lough. Weaver. Specially interested in weaving home-spun New Zealand > wool and in plant dyeing. Doing plant-dye research in collaboration with Dr > Elsa Kidson of Cawthorne Institute, Nelson. Lough’s work was also shown at New Vision Gallery, the Dowse Art Museum and the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, and included in the 1965 Commonwealth Festival in London and Expo ‘70 in Osaka. She was the only weaver to be a member of The Group, a Christchurch-based group of prominent artists that organised annual exhibitions for 25 years, showing with them for ten years. In the late 1970s and early 1970s Lough moved away from domestic pieces and focused on tapestries, which were more time-consuming. She took inspiration from her Christchurch surrounding, such as the series of 30 tapestries inspired by Hagley Park. The design of Water Grasses, an abstract tapestry held in the collection of the Christchurch Art Gallery, was inspired by the rushes and grasses in Hagley Park and Christchurch’s Botanical Gardens. In 1975 Lough was commissioned to weave a large tapestry for the interior of Christchurch’s Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. The tapestry was completed in close collaboration sculptor Ria Bancroft. Titled Earth with Heaven United, the work measures 274 by 244 centimetres and took a year to complete. In a 1985 profile capturing the history of Lough’s practice, produced in collaboration with Lough, Holly Blair wrote > Ida never makes cartoons, but designs straight onto the loom. Nor does she > make preliminary sketches, because she says she is no artist, and anyway ‘no > crayons or chalks could ever match the subtlety and warmth of wool’. Contributions to the craft sector In the early 1960s Lough helped set up a weaving room at the Canterbury Sheltered Workshop for intellectually disabled people, and taught there for eleven years. She was a founding member of the New Zealand chapter of the World Crafts Council and Patron of the Christchurch Guild of Spinners and Weavers.

During World War II, he led the United States Army Air Forces Orchestra in New York.Obituary - Variety - 4 March 1991. In the 1950s, Capitol Records represented several musical libraries. Capitol decided to assemble its own library in 1955, and when Nelson Riddle turned down the job of composer of their musical cues, they hired Loose and John Seely. By 1957, Loose’s music was played on no less than 24 different television shows a week; and as of the 1960s, some cues of his music were later used in theaters and drive-in theaters. Filmack Studios later placed some of William's cues onto its soundtrack during intermission under its local events and merchants reels. Loose’s accomplishments led to invitations to compose scores for American television series such as The Sheriff of Cochise and The Texan. Loose also was in demand as an arranger for various artists on Decca Records and Reprise Records. In 1968-69, Loose was music director for The Doris Day Show. For several decades starting in the 1950s, Loose’s composed music for films and television, including such diverse works as the themes to television series Trackdown (1957-1959) and Wanted: Dead or Alive (1959-1961), the 1966-1981 game show The Hollywood Squares (1969-1979 version of theme music), and films Tarzan and the Great River (1967) and Tarzan and the Jungle Boy (1968) starring Mike Henry, many short pieces for NFL Films, and music for Russ Meyer movies including Cherry, Harry & Raquel! (1970), Black Snake (1973), Supervixens (1975) and Up! (1976). He also scored many cult 1970s films such as The Rebel Rousers (1970), The Big Bird Cage (1972), The Wrestler (1974), The Swinging Cheerleaders (1974), Devil Times Five (1974), The Grizzly and the Treasure (1975) and Mako: The Jaws of Death (1976). His later scores included The Man Who Saw Tomorrow (1981) and Mystery Mansion (1983). Death and legacy Loose died of a heart attack at the age of 80. The reuse of Loose's cues for the 1990s cartoon series The Ren & Stimpy Show brought him a new generation of fans.

After finishing his grammar school studies, he moved to Bonn, where he worked at several trades that included locksmith, plumber, carpenter, watchmaker and bookkeeper. In Bonn he made the acquaintanceship of a publisher named Schorer, through whom he became an editor of Schorer's Familienblatt. During his time in Bonn, he developed an interest in handwriting analysis, being influenced by the work of pioneer graphologist Jean-Hippolyte Michon (1806-1881). At the insistence of Schorer, he relocated to Berlin in 1891, where he opened a photographic art institute, and with Schorer founded the Graphologisches Bureau. In Berlin he developed a reputation as a handwriting expert, eventually performing important graphological work for the municipal judicial system. In 1895 he published Graphologischen Studien, followed by Praktische Menschenkenntnis auf Grund der Handschrift (Practical knowledge of human nature learned from handwriting) in 1911, and Autographen-Album bedeutender und interessanter Persönlichkeiten (Autograph album of important and interesting personalities). In April 1895, with physiologist William Thierry Preyer (1841-1897) and psychiatrist Friedrich Albrecht Erlenmeyer (1849–1926), he founded a journal of palaeography and graphology titled Die Handschrift, Blatter fur wissenschaftliche Schriftkunde und Graphologie.

Born in 1863 in Scotland, Logan migrated to New Zealand in 1881 and took up farming. Also involved in the militia, he became a professional soldier in 1912 when he joined the New Zealand Military Forces. He was commanding the Auckland Military District at the time of the outbreak of the First World War and was appointed the commander of the Samoa Expeditionary Force, dispatched from New Zealand to occupy the island of Samoa, a territory of the German Empire at the time. Samoa was easily occupied on 29 August 1914 and Logan became its Military Administrator; he remained in this capacity for the duration of the war. Although he was decorated for his services, his administration of Samoa was later criticised, particularly in relation to the handling of the influenza outbreak of November 1918, which led to 7,500 deaths. Logan retired from military service in 1919 and settled in Devon, England, where he died in 1935. Early life Robert Logan was born in Langton, Berwickshire, Scotland, on 2 April 1863 to Thomas Logan, a tenant farmer, and his wife, Euphemia Helen Logan. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy. In 1881, when he was 19, Logan migrated to New Zealand. Life in New Zealand Logan settled in Southland and found work as a farmhand. After a couple of years, he became a runholder, buying a sheep farm at Maniototo, in the Otago district, which he ran for several years. He married Elizabeth Catherine Preston at Fortrose, Southland, on 16 April 1890. The couple would go on to have four sons, although one died in infancy. He became involved in local politics, joining the Maniototo County Council in 1888 and from 1901 to 1902, was its chairman. Logan's wife Elizabeth died in 1910, leaving him to raise his three surviving sons on his own, until he remarried in 1914. Logan and his second wife, Eleanor Mary Preston, had two daughters. Military career In 1912, Logan joined the New Zealand Military Forces and was posted to the New Zealand Staff Corps as a temporary colonel. He was already an experienced soldier of the New Zealand militia, known as the Volunteer Force, having raised the Maniototo Mounted Rifle Volunteers in 1900. He had then served with the 1st Otago Mounted Rifle Volunteers four years later with the rank of major, and was then promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1908. Now, as a professional soldier with the New Zealand Staff Corps, he was appointed commander of the Auckland Military District. Consequently, he sold the sheep farm at Maniototo and moved his family north to Auckland. =First World War= Upon the outbreak of the First World War on 5 August 1914, the New Zealand Government authorised the raising of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for service in the war. Mobilisation had already begun, preparations discreetly beginning a few days prior. The day after the declaration of war, the British Government requested New Zealand seize the wireless station on the island of Samoa, a territory of Imperial Germany. The occupation of Samoa was actually in accordance with plans laid down prior to the war by the commander of the New Zealand Military Forces, Major General Alexander Godley. Samoa Logan was appointed commander of what was designated the Samoa Expeditionary Force (SEF). By 11 August 1914, the SEF consisted of over 1,400 personnel including three companies of infantry and a company of field engineers. It departed New Zealand on 15 August in a convoy of troopships escorted by the cruisers Philomel, Pyramus and Psyche. After stopping at Nouméa in New Caledonia, where the convoy was joined by the battlecruiser HMAS Australia, the cruiser HMAS Melbourne and the French cruiser Montcalm, the SEF went on to Fiji. Here several Legion-of-Frontiersmen and Samoan chiefs joined the SEF and it then sailed for Samoa on 27 August. Despite concerns that Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee's Pacific Squadron of two armoured cruisers would interfere with proceedings, the SEF arrived at the capital of Samoa, Apia, on 29 August. It made an unopposed landing, covered by the guns of the accompanying escorts, and secured the Government offices in the town as well as the wireless station several miles away. Logan, now the Military Administrator of Samoa with the island's governor a prisoner of war, oversaw the official raising of the Union Jack flag the following day, formally declaring the occupation of Samoa. Logan remained the Military Administrator and British representative to Samoa until the end of the war. At the time of its seizure, Samoa was politically stable and its economy was based on its plantations which were mainly German owned. Apart from replacing most of the key officials, who were Germans, with New Zealanders, he largely followed existing policies but over time made a series of misjudgements. The German-owned plantations were allowed to continue to operate but only to trade with neutral or Allied countries. By 1916, most of the larger plantations were seized and placed into receivership when it was discovered that they were still trading with German companies. This placed considerable financial stress on the economy. Not long into Logan's administration, an uprising of Chinese labourers, who complained about their rations, had to be suppressed. He continued to restrict their civil liberties and over time most were repatriated back to China. By not implementing quarantine procedures for the arrival of the SS Talune from Auckland on 7 November 1918, which was allowed to berth by Logan without quarantine precautions; he significantly mishandled the arrival of the influenza pandemic in November 1918. The Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Epidemic concluded that there had been no epidemic of pneumonic influenza in Western Samoa before her arrival. The epidemic resulted in over 7,500 deaths, or over 20% of Samoa's population at the time. In the meantime, neighbouring American Samoa was quarantined by its Governor, John Martin Poyer, and consequently had no influenza deaths. Logan declined medical help from American Samoa and was critical of the Samoans on account of believing them to not being willing to help themselves. Decorated by the British and French governments for his war services, Logan was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1917 New Year Honours. He was later awarded the Croix de Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur in December 1919 \\"in recognition of valuable services in Samoa during the first year of the military occupation of that territory.\\" Logan returned to New Zealand in January 1919. Although his temporary rank of colonel had been made substantive in 1915, he received no further promotions. He was condemned for negligence in handling of the influenza outbreak by a New Zealand commission of inquiry. His relatively harsh administration, and the errors he made, greatly affected Samoan relations with New Zealand. Later life Discharged from the NZEF in September 1919, Logan returned to his duties with the New Zealand Staff Corps but after a few months he was posted to the retired list. He chose to retire to England, settling on an estate he purchased in Devon. Beginning to develop a tendency to exaggerate his contributions to the war effort, he wrote a foreword to a history of the Samoa Expeditionary Force, which was published in 1924. In 1928, Logan moved to Scotland, taking up a family estate in Lanarkshire upon the death of his cousin. He died in Seaton, in the county of Devon, on 4 February 1935, but was buried in the family crypt in Lanarkshire.

The Arch Logan Memorial Trophy named in his honour is the premier trophy of the New Zealand M class centreboard racing dinghy sailing completions. Early life Archibald Logan was born on 28 November 1865 at Greenock, Renfrewshire, Scotland, the third of eight children of Robert Logan and Margaret McLay. Robert, who was a boat builder, and his family emigrated to New Zealand, arriving in Auckland on the Zealandia on 15 October 1874.Wilkins. Page 14. In 1878 Robert set up in business as a boat builder in Devonport. After attending school at Devonport Archibald Logan, together with four of his five brothers, was employed in his father's business. Logan brothers In approximately 1890 Archibald and his brother Robert set up in business as R. & A. Logan on land reclaimed for the freezing works on the city side of Waitemata Harbour. In 1892 they were joined by their brother John, and the firm became known as Logan Brothers. Their business became very successful, and from 1898 they began exporting yachts to Australia, South Africa and the Pacific region. Their keel yachts were especially sought after but they also built a large number of centreboard craft, pleasure launches and commercial craft. By 1900 Archibald Logan was not only the principal designer for Logan Brothers, but also the pre-eminent yacht designer in the southern hemisphere. Among his designs during this period were: *Gloriana (1892), a keel cutter which was the first project by the firm of Logan Brothers.Wilkins.

Page 96. Archibald Logan, who was then living in Stanley Point Road, Devonport, with a boatshed on Ngataringa Bay continued to build boats, but at a slower pace and increasingly began concentrating on the design side. He designed and built the champion shallow-drafted mullet boats, and after the First World War designed many keel yachts, centreboard craft (in particular the 18-foot Patiki M class) and power craft. By 1930 Logan was mostly occupied in yacht designing. Among his designs during this period were: *Ngaio (1921), a motor launch. One of her owners in the 1960s was Sir Keith Park. *Valeria (1913), a 22 ft mullet boat built by Logan for A. Nelson. *Omatere (1913), a 26 ft mullet boat designed and built by Logan for the Oxenham brothers. *Lily (1920), a 20 ft mullet boat built by Peter Ballantine for himself. *Huia (1924), a 22 ft mullet boat built by Joe Slattery for Reuben Conley. *Rakoa (1924), a 22 ft mullet boat built by Joe Slattery for G.F.

Death Logan died on 27 March 1940. 12 months after his death the Arch Memorial Trophy was established in his honour. Personal life Logan married Emma Sarah Shortt at Mangere on 24 May 1905. They had four children, Margaret, Sadie (Doreen), Douglas and Marmion (Jack). Douglas was killed in Italy in 1944 while serving in World War II. After 1945 Jack became a prominent designer, builder and helmsman of 18-foot yachts in New Zealand. Jack had a successful yacht racing career from 1946 to 1955.

The earliest known version is an unattributed drawing from the 23 October 1892 issue of ', a German humour magazine. It was captioned \\"\\" (\\"Which animals are most like each other?\\"), with \\"\\" (\\"Rabbit and Duck\\") written underneath. After being used by psychologist Joseph Jastrow, the image was made famous by Ludwig Wittgenstein, who included it in his Philosophical Investigations as a means of describing two different ways of seeing: \\"seeing that\\" versus \\"seeing as\\".  Correlations  Whether one sees a rabbit or a duck, and how often, may correlate with sociological, biological and psychological factors. For example, Americans, both young and old, tend to see a bunny during Easter, and a bird/duck in October. It may also indicate creativity. A standard test of creativity is to list as many novel uses as you can for an everyday object (e.g. a paper clip) in a limited time. Wiseman et al. found was that participants who easily flipped between rabbit and duck came up with an average of almost 5 novel uses for their everyday item. Those who couldn't flip between rabbit and duck at all came up with less than 2 novel uses.  Philosophical and political implications  Several scholars suggest that the illusion resonates philosophically, and politically. Wittgenstein, as Le Penne explains, employs the rabbit-duck illusion to distinguish perception from interpretation. If you only see a rabbit, you would say \\"this is a rabbit,\\" but once you become aware of the duality you would say \\"now I see it as a rabbit.\\" You may also say \\"it's a rabbit-duck,\\" which, for Wittgenstein, is a perceptual report. Le Penne, however, suggests that this too may be interpretation, illustrating the point through the Marxist criticism of bourgeoisie's \\"natural inclination for synthesis – meaning, living outside of the unsettling struggle between thesis and anti-thesis forces,\\" seeing both the duck and the rabbit at the same time. Abulof develops the point to explain how the illusion crystallizes the interplay between freedom (choice) and facticity (forced reality). If you see just a duck, you may need to actively choose to work on seeing the rabbit too, and once you do, to then choose which you see at any given point. While submitting that \\"once you see the duck you cannot unsee it,\\" Abulof claims that \\"trying to unsee what we already did might be less about choosing one perspective over another but about negating one, so that we don’t have to choose.\\" References External links * The illusion in ' at the University Library Heidelberg * Rabbitduck, a sculpture by Paul St George Category:Optical illusions Category:1892 in art Category:Rabbits and hares in art Category:Birds in art ","title":"Rabbit–duck illusion"},{"id":"34586567","text":"The National Football League Coaches Association (NFLCA) is a group of coaches in the National Football League (NFL).

He was later promoted to director of the society, and then became president of it in 1992 when it was reconfigured into the Wildlife Conservation Society. He retired as president in 1999 and retained the title of senior conservationist. During his tenure, Conway was responsible for modernizing the animal exhibits at the Bronx Zoo and he also introduced new attractions, including the World of Darkness exhibit in 1969 and the World of Birds exhibit in 1974. Conway was a proponent of zoological exhibition of animals in a setting that recreated the environment from which the species originated. Conway successfully negotiated the society's acquisition of the Central Park Zoo from the New York City municipal government in 1981, which resulted in an extensive renovation program for the attraction so it could meet modern zoological exhibition requirements. Conway has also been in the forefront of promoting captive breeding programs for endangered species. He was responsible for creating the Wildlife Propagation Trust in 1964, that resulted in the coordination of zoos to pursue the twin goals of preserving at-risk species and eventually reintroducing animals back to the wild. Conway was also responsible for leading the development of the American Zoo and Aquarium Association accreditation program. He has authored more than 250 articles and reports relating to wildlife conservation, ornithology, wild animal care propagation and ecological preservation.

He was cartoonist for Wellington's Evening Post for over 40 years, as well as the New Zealand Truth, the Listener, and the New Zealand Free Lance.  Early life  Nevile Lodge was born in Timaru, South Canterbury, New Zealand on 19 May 1918. He was educated at Rongotai College and Wellington College of Technical Art, working as an assistant window-dresser before the Second World War. During the war he served with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force and was captured by the Italians at El Alamein in July 1942 and interned in a POW camp in Italy. In 1943 he escaped at the Italian Armistice but was captured by a German patrol and taken to a German prison camp, where he remained a prisoner until the end of the war.  Career  Lodge began cartooning before the war but while serving in the Middle East he contributed cartoons to army publications. When he became a prison of war he drew cartoons of guards, and amused his fellow prisoners. His friend Roy Johnston recalled that he and Lodge were hungry and sold cartoons for two eggs – one for Lodge and one for Johnston. He continued to draw cartoons in the German prison camp, decorating the camp walls with them once they had been passed by the camp censor. He joked that he had \\"studied on the Continent for three years\\". After the war he became a free- lance cartoonist, illustrator and commercial artist working from an office above the vegetable markets in Blair St, Wellington. He became cartoonist for the Evening Post in 1946, as well as drawing sporting cartoons for Saturday's Sports Post. In 1955 he was hospitalised but continued to cartoon from his hospital bed. In 1956, when Neville Colvin left the Evening Post for London, he became the newspaper's editorial cartoonist, continuing to do free-lance work until 1965 when he began working full time for the Evening Post. In 1970 he visited South Africa and wrote an article, with cartoons, on his impressions of the country. Although Lodge formally retired as resident cartoonist from the Evening Post in 1985, he continued to produce cartoons, drawing his last one for the paper in November 1988. While Lodge was known for the gentleness of his cartoons, he was an astute observer of politics and society. He saw through politicians rhetoric but on the other hand he depicted readily recognisable scenes of New Zealand life. After his death Prime Minister David Lange and former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon both paid tribute to his work: Lange said \\"his drawing touched the universal funny- bone\\"; Muldoon described his work as \\"shot through with a delightful sense of humour that was never malicious\\". On his death the Evening Post cartoonist Tom Scott drew a cartoon in tribute for the newspaper.  Family and personal life  He married Patricia Joan Paul in 1952 and they had four children: Christopher, Debbie, Grant and Michael. In his spare time Lodge's hobby was model-making, a past-time he began as a boy in the 1930s.  Awards and recognition  In the 1981 New Year Honours, Lodge was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services as a cartoonist. An exhibition of Lodge's work was held May–July 2004 at the Museum of Wellington in conjunction with the launching of Lodge Laughs at Wellington.  Publications  Several collections of Lodge's cartoons were published. * Lodge Looks at Wellington (1952) * Lodge Laughter: being excerpts from Lodge laughs, Lodge listens, Lodgical conclusions and Lodge looks on, and other cartoons (1954) * Whitcombe & Tombs' wit and wisdom (1955) * Lodge Laughs at the Springbok tour: cartoons and comments (1956) * Lodge Laughs at the Lions tour: cartoons and comments (1959) * Lodge Laughs at the 1960 All Black tour: cartoons and comments (1960) * Sporting Laughter: a team of Sports Post covers fielded by Nevile Lodge (1960) * Lodge Laughs at the 1961 French tour: cartoons and comment (1961) * Lodge Returns: a replay of cartoons (1964) * Lodge Laughs again: a cartoon antholodge-y from the Evening Post and Sports Post (1974) References External links *A 1965 Lodge rugby cartoon *A Lodge cartoon, the TAB wins *A Lodge cartoon, the 6-o'clock swill *Nevile Lodge at a drawing table 1959 *Self-portrait, 1952 Category:1918 births Category:1989 deaths Category:New Zealand cartoonists Category:People from Timaru Category:New Zealand Officers of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Nevile Lodge"},{"id":"34586625","text":"Matilda Lo Keong (c.1856 - 18 December 1915) was a New Zealand storekeeper, homemaker and community worker.

Born in England, Llewwllyn work as a journalist before moving in New Zealand in the late 1930s. He served with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force during the Second World War. After the war, he wrote a volume of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45; this was Journey Towards Christmas, an account of the exploits of the Divisional Ammunition Company, with which he had served during the war. He served with Kayforce during the Korean War, first as a public relations officer and then as commander of the Divisional Transport Platoon. Returning to civilian life as a freelance journalist at the end of 1954, he later had three novels published, one after his death from heart issues in 1960. Early life Stephen Peter Llewellyn was born in Hereford in Herefordshire, England, on 18 July 1913 to a government valuer, Arthur Henry Llewellyn, and his wife, Martha Helen . He attended Durlston Court School before going on to Felsted School. His formal education was completed by 1931 and he started work as a journalist, serving as an apprentice for four years. In the mid-1930s, he was on the staff of the Daily Express before working freelance. Llewellyn emigrated to Auckland in New Zealand in the late-1930s and found work as a labourer with the Public Works Department. Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Llewellyn enlisted in the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) for service aboard. Assigned to the Divisional Ammunition Company, he left New Zealand for the Middle East in early 1940 with the rest of the 1st Echelon of the 2NZEF. He served as a driver throughout many of the campaigns that the 2NZEF was involved in during the war, seeing action in Greece, Crete, North Africa and Italy. Towards the end of 1944, he was appointed the historian of the Divisional Ammunition Company. He returned in New Zealand in 1946 and was posted to the archives section of the headquarters of the New Zealand Military Forces. He was discharged from the 2NZEF the following year, having attained the rank of warrant officer. Official histories At the time of Llewellyn's discharge, Sir Howard Kippenberger, the Editor-in-Chief of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45 series that was being produced by the War History Branch, was in the process of selecting authors to produce official histories of the units of the 2NZEF. Llewellyn was contracted to write the volume for the Divisional Ammunition Company, with which he had served during the war. His book was entitled Journey towards Christmas and was published in 1949. It was particularly well received and commended for its narrative style, in contrast to some other volumes of the official histories which were thought to be turgid and stilted. Part of Kippenberger's work involved the production of what were called Episodes and Studies, booklets of specific aspects of the war; Llewellyn wrote one of these, entitled Troopships, which discussed the transportation of the 2NZEF to and from New Zealand. This too was published in 1949. After a short period working with the New Zealand Forest Service, Llewellyn returned to the United Kingdom for a time. He briefly worked in freelance journalism and broadcasting. Back in New Zealand by early 1950, Kippenberger contracted him to produce another official history, this time for the 18th Battalion. However, shortly afterwards the Korean War broke out and Llewellyn volunteered to join Kayforce, the New Zealand contribution to the United Nations Command. His appointment was as a public relations officer and commenced in December 1950. Kippenberger supported Llewellyn's application and extended his official history contract. Llewellyn's role was to last for nearly two years, which he spent in Busan in Korea, and then Kure in Japan. He wrote reports on the activities of Kayforce for the New Zealand public. In 1953, he transferred to the Royal New Zealand Army Service Corps and was given command of the Divisional Transport Platoon. The same year he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his services. His term of duty with Kayforce ended in 1954 and he returned to New Zealand towards the end the year. By then, his contract with the War History Branch for the history of the 18th Battalion had been cancelled due to a lack of progress. Later life In civilian life, Llewellyn resumed his career in freelance journalism. He also turned to writing fiction and 1958, while he was living in the United Kingdom to care for his ill mother, he published his first novel, The Score at Tea-time which was set in Japan during the Korean War and involved New Zealand and British characters in a courtmartial. A second novel, The Angel in the Coffin was published a few years later, and was a mystery set on a passenger ship destined for New Zealand. These two works, neither of which were considered to be \\"impressive\\", were written under the pen name of Michael Ellis. He also wrote a number of short stories and book reviews for the New Zealand Listener. Stricken suddenly with a heart condition, Llewellyn died on 14 November 1960. At the time, he was living in Waikanae. A third novel, Kissing the Four Corners, was posthumously released in 1961. He never married.

He was born in Sneinton, Nottinghamshire, England on 23 April 1850. Early life Leys was born of Scottish parentage in Nottingham, where his father was Supervisor of Inland Revenue. He was five years a pupil at the People's College, Nottingham, and emigrated to New Zealand in 1863 with his parents, who joined the great Nonconformist movement to establish a special settlement at Albertland, north of Auckland. Career After arrival in New Zealand, Leys was apprenticed in the printing office of the Southern Cross, the oldest and most influential journal in the colony at that period. Three years later he obtained a transfer to the literary staff as shipping reporter, and in 1870, at the age of twenty, became sub-editor of the Daily Southern Cross and Weekly News, which were then owned by Julius Vogel, Colonial Treasurer. Compelled by ill-health to relinquish night work, he resigned and joined the editorial staff of the Auckland Star, assuming the chief editorship in February 1875, having also acquired a partnership interest in that paper, the New Zealand Farmer, New Zealand Graphic, and the large printing and publishing business connected with those journals. In the scant leisure which falls to the lot of the editor of a daily newspaper, Mr. Leys did much literary work. He contributed the Auckland section of Sir Julius Vogel's \\"New Zealand Handbook\\", edited the \\"Early History of New Zealand,\\" covering the period from the earliest times to 1845, and also the \\"Colonist's Guide,\\" a standard textbook for settlers in New Zealand. He has also edited for sixteen years the annual issues of the Auckland Almanack, a valuable compendium of statistical and descriptive matter relating to New Zealand. Being one of the party formed at Rotorua on the day after the Tarawera eruption to visit Rotomahana and ascertain the condition of the Terraces, Leys wrote a graphic description of that great volcanic outburst, which was published in separate form. Among his minor literary works are a brochure on \\"The Doctrine of Evolution,\\" in reply to Professor Denton, and notes of a holiday excursion to the South Sea Islands, \\"The Cruise of the Wairarapa\\". In 1891 Mr. Leys represented a syndicate of New Zealand journals at the Federation Convention in Sydney. Leys died on 27 September 1924 in Auckland and was buried at Purewa cemetery.

A. australis, along with A. amoreuxi and Pandinus imperator, is the most commonly available scorpions found in the exotic animal trade. Hardiness Unlike most other animals that live in deserts, Androctonus does not dig burrows to protect itself from a sandstorm. Instead, it can withstand sandstorms powerful enough to strip paint off steel, without any apparent damage. The resistance of Androctonus to sandstorms is suspected to be due to the discovery of its odd exoskeleton surface. Its armor is covered with dome-shaped granules that are high and across. When its odd surface is translated into other materials it protects them to a certain degree as well, which has led to the possibility of the applicability of imitation surfaces in such objects as aeroplanes and helicopters. Etymology The name Androctonus australis is derived from the Greek word Androctonus (roughly translated as \\"man-killer\\") and the Latin word australis (translated as \\"south\\") which together translate as \\"southern man-killer\\". Description and Behavior Androctonus australis is a medium-sized highly aggressive scorpion which can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. It has a very thick and powerful tail, and stripes on the sides of its dome for better vision while attacking another animal or for the use of self-defense. It is an animal of nocturnal habit, during the day it hides in humid and dark places, while the night goes out to hunt, it feeds on insects, small lizards and even small mammals. Cannibalism has been reported in this species. It's found mainly in deserts and arid places.https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/docs/lhd/venomous_animals_byspecies.pdf Toxicity Androctonus australis has very potent venom and is one of the world's most dangerous scorpions due to its relative toxicity and temperament. It claims hundreds of lives each year.Androctonus australis it has the most potent venom of its kind, it is mainly composed of neurotoxins, cardiotoxins and myotoxins and additional hemotoxins, deaths in humans usually occur by heart and respiratory failure, sometimes by cerebral hemorrhage, organ dysfunction and shock.https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/docs/lhd/venomous_animals_byspecies.pdf The LD50 for this species is 0.32 mg / kg subcutaneously.

Henry headed the firm from 1873 and was the first to hybridise wheat. As a result, he introduced 18 strains of high-yield wheat while continuing his father’s work on the breeding of sugar beets, and publishing Les meilleurs blés ('The Best Wheat') in 1880 with descriptions of the best winter and spring wheat varieties and their cultivation.

It is located in the village of Korvangla, 10 km from Hassan city, in Hassan district or Karnataka state, India.Foekema (1996), pp78-79 The temple was built in 1173 A.D. by a rich officer called Buci (or Buchiraja), to celebrate the coronation of Hoysala King Veera Ballala II.Foekema (1996), p79 Nearby are two more temples that are in ruins. From the inscriptions on the premises, it is evident that these two temples had been commissioned by Buci's older brothers, Govinda and Naka. This temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India. South West Side View Bucesvara temple at Koravangla, a view from the lateral side with elephant balusters  Architecture  By plan, the temple is a divikuta (two shrines) that face each other. These shrines are connected by a closed mantapa (hall) and an open mantapa. Consequently, one shrine appears much dimmer in lighting than the other. At the eastern end of the complex is a small shrine whose deity is the Bhairava, a form of the Hindu god Shiva. The western shrine facing the east, containing an image of Surya (the Sun god in Hinduism) has a staggered square plan (also called \\"cross in square\\", a square with three projections per side), its kalasa (decorative water-pot on top of the tower over the shrine,Foekema (1996), p27 and Hoysala crest (warrior stabbing a lion) standing above the sukanasa are intact, and the decorative features on the shikhara (tower over shrine) and the outer walls are \\"conventional\\" by Hoysala standards.Foekema (1996), p80Kamath (2001), p134 The eastern shrine, which contains a linga (the universal symbol of the Hindu god Shiva) has a similar plan; a Sukhanasi (called \\"nose\\") which is a low protrusion of the tower over the shrine and is built over the vestibule which connects the vimana (cella) to the hall.Foekema (1996), p22 However its main tower is missing and it is unclear if the tower was a part of the original plan or not. The temple decorative features can be said to belong to the \\"old kind\\" prevalent even before the Hoysala times. In this type of decoration, below the superstructure (tower), an eaves that projects about half a meter runs all around the temple. Below the eaves are decorative miniature towers (the aedicula) on pilasters. The miniature towers (turrets) are in various styles; nagara, dravida, vesara, and bhumija. In the \\"old kind\\", the large wall images of deities and their attendants are placed below these decorative towers. These images include among others; Bhairava (a version of the god Shiva), the goddess Saraswati and Durga, Maheshvara, Narasimha, Brahma, and Venugopala. Below these images, the base of the wall comprises five different horizontal moldings, one of which is a row of blocks.Foekema (1996), p28 The halls are adjoining. The closed hall is complete in design but the open hall is not. It has no structure above its eaves (due to the missing tower) and provides two side entrances into the temple, the southern entrance being flanked by two small elephant balustrades. The outer wall of the closed hall has, in addition to usual Hindu iconography, some unusual reliefs, depicting animals devouring animals. The ceiling art in the open hall is of fine quality and the pillars have a glossy finish. The pillars of the mantapa (hall) are bell shaped, a design achieved by turning with lathes.Kamath (2001), p135 Bucheswara Temple at Koravagala, south-east corner view  Notes  Gallery File:A profile of Bucesvara temple at Koravangala.JPGClose up profile of shrine and its superstructure (shikhara) at the Bucesvara temple in Koravangla File:Relief at Bucesvara temple at Koravangla.JPGMiniature decorative tower in relief bounded by decorative swirls in bas-relief File:Shrine outer wall relief in the Bucesvara temple at Koravangala.JPGWall bas-relief depicting the Hindu god Krishna Panoramic view of the Bucesvara Temple.JPGPanoramic view from South-East Corner with old Kannada inscription slab of King Veera Ballala II dated 1173 A.D.

About 15% of California's CSHCN receive specialty care through the CCS program. Nearly 150,000 children annually receive care through the CCS program and about 80% are Medi-Cal beneficiaries.Inkelas M, Ahn P, Larson K.

For providers to see patients covered by CCS, they must be approved by the state CCS program to be considered a CCS paneled provider. CCS provides the following support services. # Assist in treatment costs related to the CCS condition. Such examples include doctor services, surgical costs, inpatient costs, medical equipment, physical therapy, and laboratory tests. #Medical Case Management. Given that these patients have very complex healthcare condition CCS has the ability to ensure that physicians from various specialties can provide the services to the child. # Medical Therapy Program (MTP) services that provide medically eligible children with physical therapy, occupational therapy or both. =Funding for CCS= For a county CCS program the funding source is a combination of appropriations from the county, state general funds and the federal government. California is required to spend 30% of funds from its Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant on children with special health care needs, thus a portion of these federal funds go to the CCS program. The amount of state money available for the program is determined every year through the Budget Act. AB 948 states that the state and county need to share the costs of providing services, such as these, to ill children. Funding differs among those with CCS and other sources of financial assistance. Seventy percent of children that are eligible for CCS are also eligible for Medi-Cal. In this case, the Medi-Cal program reimburses their care. The other 30 percent of children account for those children who are CCS only and those that have Healthy Families (considered CCS-Healthy families). Funding for individuals with both CCS and Healthy Families is mainly provided by the federal Title XXI, with state and county funds providing 30% of the costs. Costs for individuals with just CCS are paid between the state and counties.Seidman RL, Wolf JC. Evaluation of Expenditures by California children’s Services (CCS) Beneficiaries: 2001-2005. Institute for Public Health Graduate School of Public Health (2007).

Healthy Families continue to pay for primary care services not pertaining to the condition that made the child CCS medically eligible. =Program Structure= The way the program is administered is dependent on the size of the population in the county. For instance, in counties that are considered independent counties, those that have more than 200,000, individuals residing in that specific location, county staff are expected to play a vital role in evaluation, eligibility determination, and authorizations. For those counties with less than 200,000 individuals, also referred to as dependent counties, the Children's Medical Services Branch provides assistance with these procedures through its regional offices. Dependent counties make decisions on financial and residential eligibility and have direct contact with families. Some dependent counties have participated in the Case Management Improvement Project (CMIP) to partner with regional offices in determining medical eligibility and authorization of services. Regional offices also provide assistance to independent counties, CCS paneled providers, and hospitals in their region.

In the early part of her career she was a nurse with the school medical service, focusing on education on the prevention of disease and illness. She also collected data on enlarged thyroids and this data led to the discovery of iodine deficiency as a cause of goitre. She trained as a Plunket nurse in 1924 and completed a course in public health at the University of Toronto in 1925–26. In 1928 she became one of two instructors for a postgraduate nursing programme in hospital administration and teaching or public health nursing.

In the 1955 New Year Honours he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for social welfare and philanthropic services. Laidlaw was a brother-in-law to Harry Ironside, who was Pastor of the Moody Church in Chicago from 1930 to 1948. Postal Sunday School Movement Robert Laidlaw founded the PSSM Bible Discovery trust was founded in 1938 with Mr. James Rowan. Mr. Laidlaw and Mr. Rowan originally started their operations separately but within 6 months of launching learned of the other and so merged their two operations. PSSM was founded on the idea of the mail order catalogue, something that Laidlaw had successfully used to gather customers in the rural farming areas of New Zealand for his company Farmers Trading Company. Laidlaw used the mail order catalogue system to send 'Sunday school' lessons to children in these rural areas, thus creating the \\"Postal Sunday School Movement.\\" This continued via post until 2011 when it was transferred to an email based system. At its peak, there were 9,000 subscribers in New Zealand and another 3,000 overseas. Countries served include Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and Samoa. In 2010 the PSSM Trust board decided that after declining rolls and lack of engagement, they needed to strategically reinvent their presence, becoming 2ndcity Studios.

Biography Ladd was born in Warkworth north of Auckland, New Zealand on 27 October 1908. After time in Auckland and Wellington, the family settled in Hamilton, where he attended Hamilton High School for one year. After a variety of jobs, he joined his father's carrying business in 1925 and took it over the following year after his father's death. He ran the company for 15 years. He was interested in flying, but did not have the means to pay for lessons until 1939. He joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 1941 and graduated as a pilot in the following year. During World War II, he flew 33 missions in the Pacific. Ladd started flying the Dunedin–Invercargill route for the New Zealand National Airways Corporation in 1948. With a strong entrepreneurial streak, he was the first Chief Pilot for Fiji Airways (1951–1954), before running his own company for 13 years, Tourist Air Travel, in the Hauraki Gulf. During that time, he became a household name in New Zealand, and was known for his catch phrases like \\"a shower of spray and we're away\\" for taking off in his Widgeon, an amphibious aircraft. On his last day as a tourist operator in 1967, he flew his Widgeon under the Auckland Harbour Bridge and was discharged without conviction for this offence. With over 21,000 hours of flying time, he had his commercial pilot's licence withdrawn by the Civil Aviation Authority in 1977 over age concerns. Ladd embarked on a fitness campaign for regaining his licence and set a national swimming record in the over 70 category, but was unsuccessful. In December 1983, he commenced gliding. In the 1963 New Year Honours, Ladd was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the people of Waiheke Island and other areas in the Hauraki Gulf in connection with rescue work and transport of the sick. He was promoted to Officer of the same order in the 1976 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to the tourist and aviation industries. Ladd died of cancer on 22 January 1989 at Taupō, survived by his wife and daughter. His ashes were buried in Taupo Public Cemetery.

It was produced by Haruki Kadokawa. Plot A young black man from New York named Johnny Hayward (Joe Yamanaka) receives a sum of money. He buys new clothes and takes a flight to Japan. After he arrives, he is found fatally stabbed in a lift in a Tokyo hotel at the same time as a fashion show by designer Kyōko Yasugi (Mariko Okada) is being held. The police department, including Munesue (Yūsaku Matsuda) and his partner (Hajime Hana), come to investigate. The only clue is the dying man's last words \\"straw hat\\". At the same time, a woman having an extramarital affair, Naomi (Bunjaku Han), is accidentally run over by Yasugi's son (Kōichi Iwaki). He and his girlfriend dump her body in the sea, but drops his watch at the scene. He is haunted by his actions and confesses to his mother, Kyōko, who suggests he flee to New York with his girlfriend. Munesue starts to suspect that Kyōko knows more than she is letting on. He travels to New York to find out more about the dead man. There he is partnered with American detective Ken Shuftan (played by George Kennedy), who seems to be the same man who killed Munesue's father. Munesue finds that the young man is the son of a black American soldier and a Japanese woman. He also finds Yasugi's son, who deliberately provokes Shuftan into shooting him dead. Munesue returns to Japan and begins to suspect Kyōko. He travels to a resort and discovers that Kyōko was a prostitute in the years after the war. Finally he has enough evidence and confronts Kyōko that Johnny was her mixed-race son, and she killed him to protect her reputation. Kyōko commits suicide. In America, Shuftan goes looking for the Johnny's father and finds he is dead. Then Shuftan is stabbed and dies.

Music The theme song, entitled Ningen no Shōmei no Tēma, with the line \\"Mama, do you remember\\" was a chart hit for Joe Yamanaka, selling 517,000 copies, and reaching number 2 on the Oricon chart in Japan. It was also a hit in other Asian countries. In Chinese speaking countries the song is called Old Straw Hat, taken from lyrics in the song. Television remake In 2004, the movie was remade as a 10 episode mini-series for Fuji TV. Though the basic premise was maintained, the story was greatly expanded to include many additional characters and subplots. A number of details were also altered, such as Kyoko being a famous author turned political candidate rather than a fashion designer, and Johnny being from Mississippi rather than New York. The series also featured a different, more optimistic ending, with Kyoko being arrested and convicted for her crimes, Shuftan dying in the line of duty while defending a young black boy from an attacker, and Munesue continuing his career as a detective. =Cast= * Yutaka Takenouchi as Ichiro Munesue * Bo Svenson as Ken Shuftan * Yui Natsukawa as Kiriko Motomiya * Keiko Matsuzaka as Kyoko Koori * Sousuke Takaoka as Shohei Koori * Ren Osugi as Atsushi Yokowatari * Nao Matsushita as Michiko Asaeda * Seiichi Tanabe as Tomoya Saeki * Maki Horikita as Sayaka Koori * Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as Johnny Hayward References External links * Category:Japanese films Category:Films directed by Junya Satō Category:Films set in the United States Category:Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department in fiction ","title":"Proof of the Man"},{"id":"34587113","text":"Thomas Lambert (3 December 1854 – 17 April 1944) was a New Zealand doctor, horticulturist, journalist and writer. He was born in Oughterard, County Galway in Ireland on 3 December 1854. Background Lambert was born in Oughterard, County Galway, to schoolmaster William Lambert, and former schoolteacher, Mary Jane Bingham. He was their eldest child. His father was a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, and taught his son the classics. He studied medical training at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, for eighteen months as a surgeon, becoming skilled at obstetrics, dressing wounds, and setting bones. During his time at St. Vincent's he published articles in the London Medical Press and Circular. Emigration to New Zealand Before he could complete his training, Lambert's family moved to New Zealand, arriving on 4 October 1875 at Spit, Wairoa, where William Lambert was appointed the first Anglican clergyman. Mary Jane Lambert was forced to make home in a two- room whare with a dirt floor, where she previously had a large house with four indoor servants. The Lamberts founded a tree nursery and Wairoa's first chemist shop. Thomas became the de facto medical practitioner, treating both Maori and Pakeha. In 1876, he became the local correspondent for a number of newspapers based in Hawke's Bay. In time he was appointed as editor of the Wairoa Free Press, Wairoa Guardian and East Coast Mail and Wairoa Gazette, served on several local committees, and was a regular activist for the Presbyterian church and the temperance movement. He also found time to judge at horticultural shows. Thomas Lambert married Jessie Shears in Napier on 7 April 1886, with whom he had nine children (two were to die in infancy). Wairoa railway and other interests From 1896, Lambert agitated for a rail link connecting Wairoa to the rest of the east coast. Travel was otherwise difficult and the future of the town was at stake. However, the railway was not completed until 1939. Lambert became so interested in the history of the Maori of Wairoa that he became a fluent speaker, a trusted interpreter, and explorer of the district. The Maori called him Tame Ramepata. In 1925, he published The story of old Wairoa and the East Coast district, of some eight hundred pages. This was followed with Pioneering reminiscences of old Wairoa in 1936. Later life William Lambert died in 1907, leaving Thomas the sole support of his mother and sisters, as well as having to provide for his own large family. He built a handsome house and remained in Wairoa, declining offers of employment elsewhere. In his 60 years of journalism and editing Lambert regularly attended Wairoa County Council meetings. He was widely respected for his astute and fair reporting for local and national newspapers, his enthusiastic advocacy of any projects likely to boost the town or the district, and his fairness, humour and friendliness. He retired in 1938 at the age of 84, but continued writing and gardening until his death, aged 89, on 17 April 1944 at Wairoa. He was survived by his wife, Jessie, and six daughters.

Overview Another view of the exterior Basilica of Our Lady of Graces, also known as Churches among the Churches, is dedicated to Virgin Mary. The Church was built by Begum Samru, a Muslim Nautch girl of 14 who married a European mercenary soldier Walter Reinhardt Sombre. Samru converted to Roman Catholicism in 1781 and adopted the name Joanna Nobilis. She is regarded as the only Catholic ruler in India, and ruled the Principality of Sardhana in 18th and 19th century. The Church is the largest in North India. History Side profile of the Basilica Begum Samru inherited the Jagir of Sardhana after her husband's death in 1778. Subsequently, she decided to construct a Church at Sardhana, dedicated to Virgin Mary. The construction of the Church cost Rs. 4 lakh, a huge amount in those days. Top masons were paid the equivalent of 25 p. per day, and the labourers in shells. Two huge lakes near the church are the result of the mud that was removed to supply the building material for the church. Two dates are often given for the beginning of the church - Mr. K. M. Munshi, the noted historian, gives the date as 1809. Many are inclined to follow this date because a Latin inscription over the main door of the church puts its dedication in 1822. The other date, given by Fr. Keegan in his study of the Begum, is 1820. Begum Samru requested the Pope to make Sardhana an independent circumscription. In 1834, Pope Gregory XVI established the Apostolic Vicariate of Sardhana from the Apostolic Vicariate of Tibet- Hindustan and appointed Bishop Julius Caesar Scotti as the Apostolic Vicar. The church was the cathedral of Sardhana. However, Scotti was the only Vicar Apostolic, and eventually, the Apostolic Vicariate of Sardhana was merged into the Apostolic Vicariate of Agra. Architecture The architect of the Church was Antonio Reghellini, an Italian from the city of Vicenza. The Church is based upon St. Peter's Basilica in Rome with touch of Palladio and some Indian architectural influence. The altar and its surrounds are of marble set with coloured stones. Much of the rest of the interior is also in marble, and everything is of the very highest craftsmanship. It is illuminated from an octagon set in the dome, from which the sun streams in. Christian missions in north India, 1813–1913: a case study of ... - Page 74 Main Altar of Basilica Reghellini completed the church in 11 years. The church is noted for the use of semi precious stone work, a Greek colonnaded veranda, an elevated altar with a stained glass dome and there are two spires and three Roman domes that add to the building's grandeur. Near the sanctuary is a majestic 18 feet high edifice over the Begum's tomb. Carved by the Italian sculptor Adamo Tadolini and transported to Sardhana from Italy to Kolkata by ship and by boats and bullock carts from there, it depicts Begum Sumru on the throne, smoking a hookah with Europeans and Indians in audience. It depicts her with a scroll from Emperor Shah Alam II bestowing upon her the fiefdom of Sardhana after her husband's death. Also depicted are her adopted son David Dyce Sombre and her diwan, Rae Singh who was the great-grandfather of Motilal Nehru. Upgrade to Minor Basilica On 13 December 1961 Pope John XXIII decided to upgrade the Church to the status of Minor Basilica, a dignity that is bestowed rarely and only on churches that are both historically famous and beautiful. The church is only one of 23 minor basilicas in India and is the only minor basilica in North India.

It is a wishing well located at the east of Sleeping Beauty Castle for Disneyland and west for Hong Kong Disneyland and Cinderella Castle for Tokyo Disneyland. Guests can throw a coin and make a wish in front of the grotto. When Tokyo Disneyland was under construction, the error in which Snow White was taller than the Dwarfs was corrected. However it was later decided to replicate the Disneyland version in which Snow White is the same height as the Dwarfs.  Overview  Snow White Grotto is located on the east side of the Sleeping Beauty Castle or Cinderella Castle. The grotto includes statues of Snow White, the seven dwarfs, and a few woodland creatures. Snow White is standing at the top of a cascading waterfall. There is a bridge and a walkway in front of the waterfall as well as a wishing well, the proceeds of which go to local children's charities. The statues were donated anonymously and Walt Disney was determined to incorporate them into the park. The only problem was that whoever made the statues made Snow White the same size as the dwarves, which she is not. Walt Disney Imagineer John Hench used the optical trick of forced perspective to make the statues work. He put Snow white at the top of the waterfall with a Disney-made small deer and put the dwarfs close to ground- level, making Snow White to appear further away, and thus smaller. One rumor as to the origin of the statues is that they were \\"a gift from an Italian sculptor that had never seen the film, but owned a set of soaps in the form of the princess and the dwarfs. Unfortunately, Snow White was the same size as the dwarfs in the soap set, so the sculptor made her that way.\\" The song \\"I'm Wishing\\" was also re-recorded and added to the grotto inside the wishing well in 1991https://d23.com/walt-disney-legend/adriana-caselotti/ by Adriana Caselotti, who was the original voice of Snow White from the 1937 film.

The ssRNA virus appears sporadically in mammary carcinoma of captive macaques at breeding facilities which expected as the natural host, but the prevalence of this virus in feral macaques remains unknown. M-PMV was transmitted naturally by virus-containing body fluids (saliva, urine, blood, etc.), via biting, scratching, grooming, and fighting. Cross contaminated instruments or equipment (fomite) can also spread this virus among animals. Some clinical and pathological symptoms of M-PMV-infected newborn rhesus macaques are diarrhea, weight loss, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, anemia, neutropenia, and neoplastic diseases (retroperitoneal fibromatosis or rare B-cell lymphomas). Infected new-born Rhesus monkeys may develop immunodeficiency disease accompanied by opportunistic infections. To prevent the infection of this virus, two vaccinations have been developed. Those two effective vaccinations are formalin-inactivated whole SRV-1 vaccine and recombinant vaccine expressing M-PMV envelope glycoprotein gp70 and gp22. M-PMV-based vector is a candidate for delivering therapeutic genes in human gene transfer. Based on the M-PMV 1) promoter region remain transcriptionally active in human cells and 2) the constitutive transport element (CTE) expression in the target cells aids the facilitation of the nuclear export for the gene therapy. History Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) derived from breast tumor tissue of an 8 years-old female rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) in 1970 by Dr. Harish C. Chopra and Marcus M. Mason. Initial discovery suspected the virus particles to be an oncogenic virus due to its resemblance to known oncogenic RNA virus (MMTV). Shortly after its discovery, M-PMV was considered to induce simian AIDS (SAIDs). However, current studies have shown that M-PMV is unrelated to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which is currently recognized as the simian counterpart of the human immunodeficiency virus. M-PMV now belongs to SRV-3. SRV-1 serotype was identified in the early 1980s in rhesus macaque, M. cyclopis, and M. fascicularis at National Primate Research Center (NPRC), California and New England. The SRV serotype-2 was found in endemic infections of pig-tailed monkey (M. nemestrina), cynomolgus macaques, a Japanese macaque (M. fuscata), at Washington NPRC, and in rhesus and Celebes black macaques (M. nigra) at Oregon NPRC. SRV-3 is present at Wisconsin Primate Center, while SRV-4 and SRV-5 have been identified at University of California and Beijing Primate Center. In 2010, a Japanese research group reported two SRV isolates from seropositive cynomolgus macaques and tentatively designated them as SRV/D-Tsukuba (SRV/D-T). In 2011, players of Foldit helped to decipher the crystal structure of the M-PMV retroviral protease. While the puzzle was available to play for three weeks, players produced an accurate 3D model of the enzyme in just ten days, which was then used to solve the structure with molecular replacement. The problem of how to configure the structure of the enzyme had stumped scientists for 15 years. Until 2015, seven serotype of M-PMV have been identified.  Classification  Mason-Pfizer monkey viruses are group VI retrovirus belongs to betaretrovirus genus of orthoretroviridae subfamily. M-PMV was classified based on viral serotype as simian retrovirus type 3 (SRV-3). Distinguished from other orthoretroviruses for its accumulation of A-type (immature particles) intracellular particles morphology in the cytoplasm and spherical nucleocapsid. Once assemble is complete in the cytosol, particles are then transported to the plasma membrane to complete the maturation process by producing exogenous mature particles (D-type morphology). D-type particles contain fewer dense surface spikes and contain icosahedral capsids. Morphology and genetic structure M-PMV is an enveloped RNA retrovirus with an icosahedral capsid (20 triangular faces and 12 vertices). The nucleic acid is encapsulated inside the spherical core. The enveloped virus is made up of lipid bilayer derived from host cell and virus-specific proteins. The matrix protein binds with nucleocapsid while lining the inner surface of the envelope to facilitate the viral genome assembly and budding process. The retroviral replication process steps include Gag particle formation, transport to the membrane (attachment), entry into the cell, uncoating of the viral capsid, release the genome, synthesis of new viral proteins and nucleic acids, assemble of progeny virions, budding, and viral release. About 60% of the virion dry weight made up of proteins, 35% of lipids, around 3% carbohydrate. The reverse transcriptase made up of 1771 amino acid protein, gp70 surface 586 aa protein, Pr95 911 aa protein, and Pr78 657 aa protein. Based on its structure, the M-PMV is sensitive to formaldehyde, high temperature (heat), and detergents. M-PMV contains two types of virus particles. One found in the cytoplasm and the other was found extracellularly. The intracytoplasmic particles (A-type) are small, ring-shaped structures, and 70 mµ in diameter. The virions commonly found in a cluster in the cytoplasm and enveloped of the plasma membrane at the cell surface. The immature particles bud intracellular and are not considered to be infectious. Upon completing budding, immature particles undergo the maturation process (D-type) to acquire infectivity. The extracellular mature particles are about 125 nm in diameter, while the nucleoid and core-shell are central cylindrical structures separated by a space of about 8-10 nm. = Genome structure = M-PMV genome consists of a dimer of linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA. The integrated provirus's fully sequenced genome made up of 8,557 nucleotides in length, two 349 bp LTRs, and transcription of the genome yield an RNA genome of 7,943 nucleotides. Each monomer has a poly(A) tail of 200 nucleotides at the 3' end and has a methylated nucleotide cap structure at the 5' end covalently linked to the viral RNA. The M-PMV genome contains four genes: 5'-gag-pro-pol-env-3'. Gag encodes group-specific antigen (nucleocapsid proteins), Pro for protease, Pol responsible for RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse-transcriptase) region & integrase, and Env encodes the envelope glycoprotein for virion peplomer proteins. Same with all retroviruses, M-PMV can transcribe its RNA genome into double-stranded DNA by using reverse transcriptase enzyme ( dependent for betaretroviruses). Gag protein serves multiple functions during the viral life cycle, including assembly, maturation, and early replication. Distinguished from other retroviruses, M-PMV has three gag-associated polyprotein precursors: Pr78, Pr95 (gag-pro fusion), and Pr180 (gag-pol). The assemble of Pr78 forms an immature capsid that plays an essential role in the early stages of the viral life cycle. The viral protease is responsible for prepping the structural proteins and viral enzymes for the budding process. In all retroviral systems, commonly found a conserved amino acid sequences pol and a gag-pol (Pr180) precursor. The viral envelop glycoprotein precursor is responsible for the secretion and a transmembrane anchor sequence for the virus during the budding process. The immunosuppressive segment in the env sequences of M-PMV found to be around 60% similar (highly conserved) to that of areticuloendotheliosis-associated virus, indicates a similar mechanism in M-PMV-induced disease. Generally, the envelope protein is found to be highly homologous to that of the avian C-type virus. The 5' UTR of the genome contains a packaging signal that is required for specific RNA encapsidation. = Life cycle = The glycoprotein found on the surface of the M-PMV interacts with specific receptors on the host cell surface. Following the attachment, fusion of the viral envelope release of the nucleocapsid into the host's cell membranes. Once inside the cytoplasm, the positive-sense RNA serves as a template for reverse transcriptase to produce cDNA from its viral RNA. The viral cDNA is then integrated into the host cell genome by viral integrase enzyme, where it becomes a permanent genetic element for the life of the cell. The integrated provirus may remain inactivate or be transcribed by host RNA polymerase II into mRNA that is translated to produce regulatory proteins and the viral structural. Once the new viral genomes and proteins have been synthesized, progeny virions are assembled. Capsids are formed as intracytoplasmic particles (A-type). The virus-encoded matrix proteins inserted and restructuring host cell membranes. The virus undergoes maturation as the A-type particles assemble in the cytosol and being transported to plasma membrane. The viral-encoded polyprotein precursors are then processed to become structural proteins and viral enzymes forming D-type particles ready for budding released of the free virion. Furthermore, the retrovirus Gag polyprotein plays a role in the transportation and assembly of type A particles to the plasma membrane region of host's cell, where assembly and budding occur through the matrix protein to the cell surface. During or shortly thereafter viral budding, viral protease cleaves Gag protein to yield the mature virion-associated proteins includes matrix protein, capsid, nucleocapsid, and other products. The process leads to the condensation of the viral core and is essential for virus infectivity. These mature Gag-cleavage products then repeat the process of infecting new cells and lay roles during the early stages of the viral life cycle.  Ecology  The exogenous and endogenous type D simian retroviruses exist naturally indigenous to various species of the genus Macaque and can infect a variety of mammalian hosts including Old & New World non-human primates (except apes), Squirrel monkey, Colobinae, sheep (Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus), and goats (Enzootic nasal tumor virus). The D-type virus sequences can also be isolated from humans, possum, and mice.

In 1985, China acceded to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, followed by the Patent Cooperation Treaty in 1994.http://www.wipo.int, PCT Notification No. 81, 1993-10-01. Consulted on February 1, 2012. When China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, it became a member of the TRIPS agreement. To comply with its international obligations, as well as to facilitate its development into an innovative country,http://www.ipr2.org, Eu-China Workshop on the revision of the Chinese Patent Law, 2008-09-24. Consulted on February 3, 2012. China has since amended its Patent Law three times: first in 1992, then again in 2000, and most recently in 2009.  Types of patent protection  Patents in China are granted by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), https://www.epo.org/searching-for-patents/helpful- resources/asian/asia-updates/2018/20180905.html which was renamed in English on 28 August 2018 from State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO). There are three types of patents: invention patents, utility model patents, and design patents. Invention patents are substantively examined, while utility model patents are subject only to a formal examination.  Enforcement of patents  Like other forms of intellectual property in China, patents may be enforced by administrative authorities or through civil or criminal litigation. = Administrative patent enforcement = The legal basis for administrative patent enforcement is found in the Patent Law, the Enforcement Regulations for the Patent Law, and SIPO's Regulations on Administrative Patent Cases. Two types of illegal patent acts can be handled by administrative authorities - ordinary infringement complaints regarding the making/importation, use, and sale/offering for sale of patented articles; and patent counterfeiting (which encompasses several acts similar to false marking). Administrative enforcement is traditionally the most commonly used option by patent owners and is handled by provincial or city-level intellectual property offices (formerly and still colloquially known as Patent Bureaux). On accepting a complaint, which requires some prima facie evidence of infringement, the local Bureau can raid infringers' premises and confiscate infringing materials and tooling. Often, the Bureau will attempt to mediate settlement between the parties. However, it is also empowered to make its own decisions. Sanctions can include destruction of products/tooling and an order to stop infringement, but Bureaux cannot award damages to patent owners. In cases of patent counterfeiting, the Bureau can however impose a fine on the infringer. Administrative decisions can be appealed to the People's Court. = Civil litigation = Courts' jurisdiction over patent proceedings is clarified in the Supreme People's Court's Several Provisions on Issues Relating to the Application of Law to Adjudication of Cases of Patent Disputes. Cases are usually begun in the Intermediate People's Court, although serious cases can be tried in the Higher People's Court and even exceptionally the Supreme People's Court. A degree of forum shopping is permitted as disputes can be heard either where the defendant is domiciled, or where the infringing act (e.g. sale of infringing goods) took place. Interim injunctions are available (including the equivalent of an Anton Piller Order), but if relief is granted the plaintiff is bound to initiate proceedings within 15 days thereafter. On a finding of infringement, the Court has a wide range of remedies available, including final injunctions, destruction of infringing goods/tooling, and compensatory damages (if the plaintiff cannot prove his loss, the maximum statutory damages available are RMB500,000 per infringement). = Criminal proceedings = China's Criminal Code enables Public Security Bureaux under the People's Procuratorate to take action in cases of serious infringement. Private prosecutions are possible in limited circumstances.  Patent interpretation  Patents are construed both literally and according to the doctrine of equivalents. In China, an equivalent is an element of an article which is \\"insubstantially different from\\"SPC Interpretations, [2009] Fa Shi No. 21. an integer of the patent's claim: a technical feature which can be conceived easily by the patent's addressee that performs substantially the same function as the claim's integer, in substantially the same way, achieving substantially the same result. The \\"all elements\\" rule applies, such that for an article to be an infringement it must contain features identical or equivalent to all elements of the patent claim.  Patent validity  Any person can contest a patent's validity. There is a post-grant opposition procedure available through SIPO, and actions may also be initiated at the Patent Review Board (PRB). Appeals may be made to the Beijing IP Court. Before 2014, appeals were made to the Beijing Intermediate People's Court. Patent litigation proceedings are bifurcated, meaning that issues of infringement are tried separately (and in a separate venue) from invalidity. Normally infringement proceedings will be stayed (on application by the defendant) pending outcome of the invalidity hearing. = Novelty = With the Third Amendment to the Patent Law, China now applies a standard of absolute novelty. That is, an invention is not new (and therefore is unpatentable) if it was published or publicly disclosed anywhere in the world before the priority date. = Inventiveness = To be considered inventive, an invention must have, in the eyes of a notional addressee, prominent substantive features that mark a notable progress in the state of the art, or in the alternative, that the addressee cannot obtain from existing technology all the necessary technical features of the invention. SIPO's examination guidelines, which are often followed by the Courts, recommend a \\"problem-solution\\" approach to assessing obviousness: 1\\\\. Identify the closest prior art; 2\\\\. Identify the technical problem to be solved; 3\\\\. Identify the differences between the prior art and the invention; 4\\\\. Would those differences be obvious to the skilled addressee trying to solve the technical problem? The notional addressee is an ordinary technician skilled in the field of the invention. = Industrial applicability and excluded matter = An invention possesses industrial applicability if it can be made or used in such a way as to generate effective results. Excluded subject matter is in line with TRIPS, that is scientific discoveries, methods for mental activities, methods for the diagnosis and treatment of disease, animal and plant varieties, and a catch-all for other undesirable inventions. Software is explicitly included as a method for mental activity. However, SIPO's examination guidelines follow EPO practice and allow software inventions which produce a technical effect and are not merely software-as-such. In April 2017, SIPO revised its patent examination guidelines to also allow the patenting of business methods provided the claimed method had technical features.

He was interviewed by government officials in 1857 while the government was considering what action to take over a rising demand by Waikato Māori for law and order in the district to replace ancient tikanga which had fallen into disuse. At an 1857 meeting at Paetai, near Rangiriri, to discuss proposals for a Māori kingship, Kukutai led a contingent that paraded under the Union Jack. Although opposed to land-selling, he spoke against the establishment of the kingship and supported the appointment of magistrates, laws and a form of rūnanga or council.Report of the Waikato Committee. Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives 1860. Session 1. Governor George Grey agreed to meet those demands. The Government introduced written laws, magistrates and courts, built a printing press to inform Māori of government decisions and helped establish a trade school in the Te Awamutu area where Christianity was popular among Maori. In 1861 Grey appointed Kukutai as a head Māori magistrate and government adviser. Kukutai and Wiremu Te Wheoro assisted British forces in the military invasion of the Waikato in July 1863, building and occupying a pa at Te Ia, (near Mercer) and transporting supplies for the British from steamers at Waikato Heads upriver to the Camerontown redoubt, until the supply line was severed by a Ngati Maniapoto attack in September. Kukutai fought with the Kingitanga forces at Rangiriri in November 1863. He was appointed as a major in the New Zealand militia.

Institutions like The School of Media & Culture Studies at Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai and WITNESS released statements disassociating themselves from Stalin. Stalin K issued a statement on Twitter denying any wrongdoing. In response, many more women, some whom were ex- employees and associates, came out with further allegations of sexual harassment against Stalin K that they had either undergone and heard about. On 18 October 2018, Video Volunteers released a statement which mentioned that Stalin K had stepped down from his position of 'Director' at 'Video Volunteers'. Despite the organisational statement claiming that Stalin will no longer be engaged with the daily activities and programs of the organization as well as not represent the organization, leaked internal emails in December 2018, show that Stalin continued to engaged in various capacities.

In August 1915, in common with all Territorial Force brigades, it was numbered as 200th (2/1st Surrey) Brigade. Between September 1917 and the end of the year, the brigade was extensively reorganized and lost its territorial identity; henceforth it was known as 200th Brigade. It was demobilized in February 1918. History In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course. The Brigade served on home defence duties throughout the war, whilst recruiting, training and supplying drafts to overseas units and formations. It was twice warned to prepare to be transferred to Ireland, and in April 1917 for service on the Western Front, but in the event never left England.

The body of Valeriu Boboc was handed to the relatives by the police on April 12 and was buried on the same day. Dorin Chirtoacă, the mayor of Chișinău and vice-president of the Liberal Party, attended Boboc's funerals. The opposition parties subsequently used his death as an important subject during the July 2009 electoral campaign. The police declared he was found dead in the Great National Assembly Square. According to the official investigation, he died of inhaling a toxic gas, his death certificate stating as cause \\"poisoning with an unknown substance\\". The Boboc family and the lawyers disputed this, claiming instead that the young man was beaten to death while in custody. Moldova's Attorney General however noted that the bruises and bleeding traces on Boboc's body were not a cause of his death.

On July 9, 2009, the Prosecutor General Valeriu Gurbulea said that on the night of April 8, Boboc was taken from the Great National Assembly Square, was taken to the Emergency Hospital in a police car and the doctors established that he was dead. \\"Legal action was immediately taken over this case,\\" Gurbulea saidThere was beating, 'but not like in Europe' On July 24, 2009, the Prosecutor General Valeriu Gurbulea said no policeman who maltreated protesters had been identified yet. Neither is it known who killed Boboc. One of the reasons is that policemen were wearing masks. Two days after July 2009 election, Ion Matiușenco, the prosecutor investigating Boboc's case, resigned on July 31 and was replaced by another prosecutor. But at year's end there were no further developments in the case. When the ruling coalition Alliance for European Integration came to power, it promised to tell the whole truth about the April 2009 unrest.

The brigade was formed as a duplicate of the Kent Brigade in October 1914 as part of the 2nd Home Counties Division. As the name suggests, the brigade recruited in Kent. In August 1915, in common with all Territorial Force brigades, it was numbered as 202nd (2/1st Kent) Brigade. Between September 1917 and the end of the year, the brigade was extensively reorganized and lost its territorial identity; henceforth it was known as 202nd Brigade. History In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course. The Brigade served on home defence duties throughout the war, whilst recruiting, training and supplying drafts to overseas units and formations. It was twice warned to prepare to be transferred to Ireland, and in April 1917 for service on the Western Front, but in the event never left England. It was eventually disbanded in March 1919. Order of battle The composition of 202nd Brigade was as follows (not all the infantry battalions served in the brigade at the same time): * 2/4th Battalion, Buffs (East Kent Regiment) * 2/5th Battalion, Buffs (East Kent Regiment) * 3/4th Battalion, Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) * 2/5th Battalion, Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) * 1st Battalion, Royal Guernsey Light Infantry (June – September 1917) * 284th Graduated Battalion, became 51st (Graduated) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps * 286th Graduated Battalion, became 52nd (Graduated) Battalion, Gordon Highlanders * 2/5th Battalion, Suffolk Regiment * 285th Graduated Battalion, became 52nd (Graduated) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps * 52nd (Graduated) Battalion, Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) See also * British infantry brigades of the First World War References Bibliography * * External links * * Category:Infantry brigades of the British Army in World War I Category:Military units and formations established in 1914 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1919 ","title":"202nd (2/1st Kent) Brigade"},{"id":"34587777","text":"Justice Sohrab Peshotan Kotval (September 1910 – 6 March 1987) served as Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court from 1 August 1966 – 27 September 1972.

It was raised as a second line brigade of the Territorial Force and initially assigned to the 71st Division for coast defence. Later it was reorganised as an all-arms brigade group for service in North Russia, but this was cancelled and it was reassigned to the 67th Division, a training and home defence formation, until the end of the war. Origin In November 1916 the War Office decided to organise new Home Service divisions composed of 2nd Line and Home Service units of the Territorial Force (TF). 71st Division was one of these, formed in southern England. One of its brigades, the 214th, was created by simply redesignating 190th (2nd Durham Light Infantry) Brigade from the disbanded 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division. This comprised three 2nd Line battalions of the Durham Light Infantry (DLI) based at Catterick Camp and it assumed its new identity at Andover, Hampshire on 29 November 1916.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 101–5.71 Division at Long, Long Trail.71 Division at Regimental Warpath.63 Division at Long, Long Trail. In the first week of March 1917 the division moved to Essex as part of Southern Army (Home Forces), where it was responsible for coastal defence from Mersea Island to Walton-on-the-Naze, where it stayed for the remainder of the year with 214th Bde at Colchester. During 1917 some of the 2nd Line TF units of the division were replaced by 'Graduated Battalions' of the Training Reserve (TR), in which 18–19-year-old recruits were progressively taken through the stages of training. In October these were numbered as battalions of county regiments.Becke, Pt 2b, Appendix 2.Training Reserve at Long, Long Trail. 214th Special Brigade In October 1917, 214th Bde was redesignated 214th Special Brigade and filled with men of A1 medical category for overseas service. It also had a field artillery brigade, cyclist battalions, a field engineer company and machine gun companies attached to it. This brigade group was intended to go to Murmansk as part of the North Russia Intervention, but this never happened and most of the A1 men were drafted as reinforcements to the Western Front in March 1918 after the German Spring Offensive.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75–82. 71st Division in turn was broken up on 12 February 1918 and 214th Special Bde joined 67th Division. This had formerly been the 2nd Home Counties Division (TF), but had lost its regional and territorial distinctiveness. The divisional HQ moved to East Anglia, with 214th Bde remaining at Colchester.67 Division at Long, Long Trail.67 Division at Regimental Warpath. After fit men had been 'combed out' for the Western Front in March 1918, 67th Division was mostly composed of training battalions but 2/7th Bn DLI was still formally a 2nd Line TF battalion, and a year after initially being selected to form part of the Allied expedition to North Russia it finally went there as a garrison battalion. It entrained at Colchester for Glasgow on 5 October 1918, embarking the following day and disembarking at Arkhangelsk on 24 October. It served there until demobilised at the end of August 1919.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 49–54.Dunn, pp. 196–200.Overseas Garrisons at Regimental Warpath. Disbandment After the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, the brigade was thoroughly reorganised again, with different Graduated Battalions and also Special Reserve (SR) battalions. However, demobilisation began in early 1919, and by 17 March the whole of 67th Division had been disbanded.

It is found, often in great numbers, on rocky shores on the Pacific coasts of North America. Classification Barnacles are classified with shrimps, crabs, isopods and amphipods in the subphylum Crustacea. They are included in the class Maxillopoda, though this class does not appear to be a monophyletic grouping. They are included in the infraclass Cirripedia, the barnacles, members of which are sessile suspension feeders with two active swimming larval stages, the nauplius and the cyprid. The order Pedunculata includes barnacles attached to the substrate by stalks, the goose barnacles. The attachment is made by the cementing of the antennules of the cyprid larvae to the substrate and the elongation of that region into a stalk. Pedunculata is not itself a single monophyletic group but forms a transitional series of lineages moving towards the sessile acorn barnacles. Pollicipes polymerus is included in the family Pollicipedidae. Description Pollicipes polymerus is attached to rocks or other objects by a strong, rubbery stalk, the peduncle, which is up to long. It has a muscular interior and the leathery surface is covered in bands of minute spiny scales on short stalks. The capitulum, at the end of the peduncle, is up to long and contains the rest of the body including all the limbs and other appendages except the first pair of antennae.Pollicipes polymerus Race Rocks. Retrieved February 1, 2012. The outside of the capitulum bears five strengthening calcareous plates corresponding with the plates that protect an acorn barnacle. The largest of these is the carina, on the morphologically dorsal side of the capitulum, with a pair of smaller scuta and terga on either side below. Further calcification occurs from other centres on the capitulum with the formation of many small scales. The thoracic crustacean appendages are modified into feather-like cirri. They project through the aperture at the end of the capitulum and are used for feeding. Distribution and habitat Pollicipes polymerus is found in the north eastern Pacific Ocean, its range extending from southern Alaska to Baja California. It occurs on rocky coasts in the intertidal zone and favours exposed areas where there is much wave action. It tends to occur in closely associated groups and is often abundant. Reproduction Pollicipes polymerus is a hermaphrodite. Reproduction takes place during the summer and there may be several broods per year. The ovaries are in the upper part of the peduncle and liberate from 104,000 to 240,000 eggs at a time into the mantle cavity. Here they stick together to form egg masses. The numerous small testes lie alongside the gut. Sperm from these is passed along the extensible penis into the mantle cavity of an adjoining individual where fertilisation takes place. Self-fertilisation does not seem to occur and any individual that is more than from its nearest neighbour is effectively sterile. The eggs are brooded for 3 to 4 weeks until they hatch into nauplius larvae and are liberated into the sea. There they become planktonic and feed on phytoplankton. They grow and undergo 6 moults in about 40 days before becoming non-feeding cyprid larvae. These search out suitable places to settle where they undergo metamorphosis and attach themselves permanently to the substrate. They do this by secreting a strong adhesive substance from glands on the antennules. Settlement is stimulated by the presence of peduncles of other gooseneck barnacles, and may take place on the peduncles themselves. Ecology Pollicipes polymerus is an omnivore. It feeds by extending its cirri through the aperture at the end of the capitulum and unfurling them. The posterior three pairs are biramous and form a net to trap particles. They are held at a suitable angle to intercept moving water and are periodically withdrawn into the capitulum with any food items that have been trapped. Here particles are scraped off by the other three, shorter pairs of cirri which have overlapping setae (bristles). The particles are then transported to the mouth where they are manipulated and sorted into edible and inedible items by the maxillae, mandibles and palps. This may be done with the help of chemoreceptors found on the appendages and near the mouth. Examination of the animal's gut contents show that it feeds on copepods, amphipods, barnacle larvae, small clams, polychaete worms and hydrozoans as well as detritus and algae. Predators on gooseneck barnacles include the glaucous- winged gull (Larus glaucescens), the black oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani), the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the six-rayed star (Leptasterias hexactis). A research study undertaken by Robert T. Paine in Makah Bay, Washington State in 1966 showed the importance of predators in maintaining a biodiverse community. Paine excluded the ochre sea star from an area of seabed where gooseneck barnacles and sea mussels (Mytilus californianus) predominated and found that the number of invertebrate species associated with them fell from fifteen to eight. Paine proposed the hypothesis that \\"Local species diversity is directly related to the efficiency with which predators prevent the monopolization of the major environmental requisites by one species\\". The distribution of both gooseneck barnacles and sea mussels is quite patchy. In an effort to understand this better, another study, undertaken by Wootton in 1994, excluded birds from an area where these two species were found on Tatoosh Island, Washington. In a carefully designed series of experiments he recorded the direct and indirect results on the numbers of goose barnacles, sea mussels, acorn barnacles, starfish and predatory whelks (Nucella spp.) present in the area. His results demonstrated the important part that predation by birds can play in the dynamics of gooseneck barnacle populations. Gooseneck barnacles compete with a number of other organisms in a complex struggle for survival in the limited available space in their rocky intertidal habitat. The first colonisers of bare rock are usually annual algae, soon to be followed by perennial species including coralline algae. Gooseneck barnacles, sea mussels and several species of acorn barnacles soon follow. Further competition is provided by sea palms, the large holdfasts of which may smother or squeeze out the molluscs and barnacles. Sea palms may settle on the mussels and may be carried away in storms, taking the mussels with them. Gooseneck barnacles may limit the colonisation of mussel recruits by feeding on their larvae. In areas where gooseneck barnacles predominate they may dominate until some are swept away in storms and allow in other species. In the long term, the mussels usually come to dominate as their byssal threads are able to overgrow all the other sessile organisms.

Viervant stemmed from a family of architects,Netherlands Architecture Institute on the family Viervant. cabinet builders and stonemasons. His father, Hendrik Viervant, was the son of cabinet builder and stonemason Leendert Viervant the Elder and married Catharina Maria Otten, the sister of the neoclassical architect Jacob Otten Husly. Also Hendrik's brother, Anthonie Viervant, was a cabinet maker and Anthonie's son Roelof Viervant designed garden pavillons and facades. All these family members have designed some buildings in 18th century Netherlands.Arneym, historical website about the city of Arnhem, on the family Viervant. Thanks to his family background, Viervant had a good basis to work from. Born and raised in the provincial city of Arnhem, he studied to become an architect with his uncle Husly. In 1768 he was entered into the stonemason guild of Amsterdam, where he lived and worked. He lived at the Amstel and later near Hoge Sluis (1784–1790). In 1791 he was forced to let his inventory be liquidated, because he couldn't fulfill his financial obligations any longer – finally he was able to come to arrangements with his creditors. According to his uncle Husly, Viervant couldn't handle money, and he lived a wild life.Teylers Museum on Leendert Viervant the Younger (Dutch) In 1798 he became one of the three directors at the City and Public Works Department of the City Amsterdam, after his predecessor had to leave because of his support of the Orange family (this was between the revolution and the inclusion in the French Empire).

He was taught by his uncle Husly, and had a for that period typical neoclassical style. Short after his entry in the stonemason guild of Amsterdam in 1768, he got an assignment by the churchmasters of the Oude Kerk (Old Church) for a 'Bardiglio Marmere schoosteenmantel met holle stijlen en ornament in het midden voor f 180 (a Bardiglio marmer chimney mantel with hollow styles and an ornament in the middle for 180 guilders). From 1772 to 1776 he worked on the town hall of Weesp. In 1779 he is asked by the Teylers Stichting to design the Oval Room, the Teylers astronomical observatory and a significant part of the interior of the Teylers Museum (works began in 1784). Here he could also use his family background of cabinet makers, designing amongst others the cabinets in the Oval Room and the lower part of the Big Electrostatic generator. In his works on the Teylers Museum, he based himself amongst others on work of the architects François de Neufforge, Michelangelo and Artus Quellinus. Viervant received some 9500 guilders, and was with that amount probably one of the best paid architects in the Netherlands at the time. His uncle Husly designed several of the ceiling decorations in the Oval Room. He also works on other projects for this foundation, including the Teylers Hofje, all in Haarlem.Teylers Museum digital 'bouwtekeningen' In the Regents' Room of Teylers Hofje, there is a large group portrait by Wybrand Hendriks, showing the first five Directors of Teylers Stichting sitting around a table, together with their accountant Koenraad Hovens and their architect: Leendert Viervant. In 1787 he designed the current Kalverstraat 8 for the patriotic society, but the building was stopped soon because the society was abolished. This does however show his involvement with the patriotic circles, which would later make him director of the City and Public Works Department.Boezaard, A. / Zantkuyl, H., Oud Hoorn 1993 p.80-87: Het cultuur-historisch pand Grote Oost 22 en zijn bewoners Also Viervant is believed to be the designer of the south entrance of the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam.

It was raised as a 2nd-Line duplicate of the Essex Brigade of the Territorial Force and formed part of the 69th (2nd East Anglian) Division. It served as a training formation in the United Kingdom without going overseas. Recruitment On the outbreak of war, units of the Territorial Force were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd-Line unit was authorised for each 1st-Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd-Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. The Essex Territorial Association recruited numerous volunteers for the four battalions of the Essex Regiment that constituted the Essex Brigade, but because they were not asked until after they had attested whether they wished to volunteer for Overseas Service, many opted for Home Service. Hence the 2nd- Line battalions filled up more quickly than the 1st-Line.Burrows, p. 33. In this way the 2nd Essex Brigade came into existence, forming part of the East Anglian Reserve Division. On 15 August 1915 they were numbered as the 206th (2nd Essex) Brigade (or, more formally, the 206th (2nd/1st Essex) Brigade) and 69th (2nd East Anglian) Division respectively.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 91-8. Order of battle The 206th (2nd Essex) Brigade was constituted as follows: * 2/4th Battalion, Essex Regiment – disbanded 6 December 1915, personnel drafted to 3/4th Bn and left the brigade * 2/5th Battalion, Essex Regiment – disbanded in March 1918Essex Rgt at Long, Long Trail * 2/6th Battalion, Essex Regiment – disbanded in January 1918 * 2/7th Battalion, Essex Regiment – broken up on 10 October 1917 to provide drafts to 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division * 4/1st Battalion, Hertfordshire Regiment – duplicate of 2/1st Bn, brought up to strength with drafts from 3/1st Bn and joined the brigade to replace 2/4th Essex * 237th Battalion – Graduated Battalion of the Training Reserve, joined between 21 July and 11 October 1917 * 238th Battalion – Graduated Battalion of the Training Reserve, joined between 21 July and 11 October 1917 * 51st Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (Graduated) – redesignation of 238 Bn from 27 October 1917 * 51st Battalion, Rifle Brigade (Graduated) – redesignation of 237 Bn from 27 October 1917; transferred to 67th Division in February 1918 * 52nd Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (Graduated) – joined on 5 March 1918 * 51st Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (Graduated) – joined on 15 January 1918 from 215th Brigade, 72nd Division * 52nd Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (Graduated) – joined on 15 January 1918 from 220th Brigade, 73rd Division Service By December 1914 the East Anglian Reserve Division concentrated around Peterborough and Stamford, Lincolnshire. Training was impeded by the lack of arms and equipment, the constant drain of providing drafts to the 1st- Line battalions (the Essex Brigade was serving at Gallipoli), and the decision to transfer the Home Service men to Provisional Battalions (forming the 66th and 67th Provisional Bns in 3rd Provisional Brigade). Eventually, the men were issued with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles for training.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 125–31.Burrows, pp. 353–5. In the summer of 1915, the 69th Division went under canvas in camp round Thetford. On 17 August the 206th Brigade was detached to Essex to work on the London Defences at Rayleigh, Billericay, Hadleigh and Brentwood. The brigade was relieved from this duty by 208th (2nd Norfolk and Suffolk) Brigade in September. In October the establishment strength of the 2nd-Line battalions was reduced to 23 officers and 600 men, the surplus being transferred to new 3rd-Line battalions, which had been authorised in May 1915 and were intended to provide drafts to both the 1st and 2nd Line. In November the men finally received Lee–Enfield rifles and were able to return the obsolete Japanese rifles to store. Whilst at Thetford, the division had formed part of First Army in Central Force. In June 1916 it moved to Harrogate as part of Local Forces in Northern Command. Here the battalions were brought up to full strength with drafts of Derby Scheme men, and thought that they were going to be sent overseas. However, this never happened, and they continued to send drafts to the 1st Line serving in Egypt. The camps around Harrogate were broken up in October and 206 Bde went into winter quarters round Doncaster. In early May 1917, 69th Division moved to the Retford area, with 206 Bde going under canvas at Welbeck. This camp was maintained until winter set in, when the brigade moved to County Durham, being stationed at Middlesbrough, Barnard Castle, Durham and Stockton-on-Tees. During the winter the brigades of 69th Division were completely reorganised, with the 2nd-Line TF battalions being replaced by Graduated Battalions of the Training Reserve (in the case of 206 Bde these were locally recruited battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers and Durham Light Infantry). The division and brigades thereby lost their local associations, and titles like 'East Anglian' and 'Essex' were dropped from 1 January 1918. At the end of the winter, 206 Bde moved to Guisborough and Catterick, where it remained for the rest of the war as a training formation. After the Armistice with Germany the brigade continued at nearly full strength for several months, until demobilisation began in earnest in March 1919, when the brigade was disbanded. World War II A new 206th Brigade was raised in 1940 as an independent Home Defence formation. This had no connection with the 2nd Essex Brigade, though coincidentally it was formed of battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers and Durham Light Infantry, as with 206 Bde of 1918.Joslen, p. 369. Commanders The following officers commanded 206 Bde during its existence: * Col A.G. Watson, appointed 9 January 1915 * Lt-Col G.

It is one of the largest lectin families with more than 70 lectins reported in a review in 1990. Leguminous lectins consist of two or four subunits, each containing one carbohydrate-binding site. The interaction with sugars requires tightly bound calcium and manganese ions. The structural similarities of these lectins are reported by the primary structural analyses and X-ray crystallographic studies. X-ray studies have shown that the folding of the polypeptide chains in the region of the carbohydrate-binding sites is also similar, despite differences in the primary sequences. The carbohydrate- binding sites of these lectins consist of two conserved amino acids on beta pleated sheets. One of these loops contains transition metals, calcium and manganese, which keep the amino acid residues of the sugar-binding site at the required positions. Amino acid sequences of this loop play an important role in the carbohydrate-binding specificities of these lectins. These lectins bind either glucose, mannose or galactose. The exact function of legume lectins is not known but they may be involved in the attachment of nitrogen-fixing bacteria to legumes and in the protection against pathogens. Some legume lectins are proteolytically processed to produce two chains, beta (which corresponds to the N-terminal) and alpha (C-terminal). The lectin concanavalin A (conA) from jack bean is exceptional in that the two chains are transposed and ligated (by formation of a new peptide bond). The N terminus of mature conA thus corresponds to that of the alpha chain and the C terminus to the beta chain.

He was declared a National Hero of Indonesia on 10 November 2007. Born in Kediri, East Java, Moestopo moved to Surabaya to attend the School of Dentistry there. At first becoming a practitioner, his work was interrupted in 1942 when the Japanese occupied Indonesia and Moestopo was arrested by the Kempeitai for looking suspicious. Upon his release, he became a dentist for the Japanese but eventually decided to train as an army officer. After graduating with honours, Moestopo was given command of PETA troops in Sidoarjo; he was later promoted to commander of the troops in Surabaya. While in Surabaya, during the Indonesian National Revolution Moestopo dealt with British expeditionary forces led by Brigadier Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby. When relations broke down and President Sukarno was called to Surabaya to mend them, Moestopo was offered a job as an adviser but declined. During the war he held several other positions, including leading a squadron of regular soldiers, pickpockets, and prostitutes to spread confusion in the ranks of the enemy Dutch forces. After the war, Moestopo continued to work as a dentist, and in 1961 he founded Moestopo University. He died in Bandung in 1986. Biography =Early life and dentistry= Moestopo was born in Ngadiluwih, Kediri, East Java, Dutch East Indies on 13 June 1913. He was the sixth of eight children born to Raden Koesoemowinoto. After his primary schooling, Moestopo went to the School of Dentistry (STOVIT) in Surabaya. His education initially paid for by his elder siblings, Moestopo later took to selling rice to earn his way through university. Taking further education in the field in Surabaya and Yogyakarta, in 1937 he became an assistant orthodontist in Surabaya. From 1941 to 1942, he became the assistant director of STOVIT. =Japanese occupation= After the Japanese occupied Indonesia in 1942 Moestopo was arrested by the Kempeitai as a suspected Indo (a person of mixed European and Indonesian heritage); this suspicion was based on Moestopo's large frame. However, he was soon released and, after serving as an army dentist for the Japanese, received military training in Bogor. Along with future generals Sudirman and Gatot Soebroto, he finished at the top of his class. During his training he wrote a paper on the military applications of bamboo spears tipped with horse feces, for which he received high marks. Upon graduation, Moestopo was given the command of troops command of PETA troops in Sidoarjo. Soon afterwards, he was promoted to commander of the native forces protecting Gresik and Surabaya; he was one of only five Indonesians to receive such a promotion. While in Surabaya, he worked at relieving the rising unemployment rate by establishing workshops to produce soap and toothbrushes and reportedly pushed for his men to put horse manure on their bamboo spears to spread tetanus and eat cats for better night vision – the remains of eaten cats are said to have been buried in their own heroes' cemetery. =National Revolution= After the end of World War II, on 17 August 1945 Indonesia proclaimed its independence; Moestopo maintained control of the nascent military forces in Surabaya and forcibly disarmed the Japanese forces while armed with bamboo spears. In October of that year he declared himself interim Minister of Defence. On 25 October of that year, the 49th Indian Infantry Brigade under the command of Brigadier Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby, arrived in the city; Mallaby sent his intelligence officer Captain Macdonald to meet with Moestopo. According to Macdonald's report, Moestopo was heavily against the coming of the British forces. When the British then went to Governor of East Java Soeryo seeking a more positive response, Moestopo reportedly wanted the envoys, Macdonald and a naval officer, shot upon arrival. Soeryo, however, proved amenable to the British declaration that they came in peace; he only refused to meet Mallaby on HMS Waveney after Moestopo refused to concede accept the British. The British landed in Surabaya that afternoon, after which Moestopo met with Colonel Pugh; Pugh emphasized that the British were not intending to reinstate Dutch rule, and Moestopo agreed to meet with Mallaby the following morning. At the meeting, Moestopo reluctantly agreed to disarm the Indonesian forces in the city. However, feelings soured almost immediately. That afternoon, Moestopo may have been forced to assist Mallaby in rescuing Dutch captain Huijer, and on 27 October a Douglas C-47 Skytrain from the capital in Batavia (modern day Jakarta) dropped a series of pamphlets signed by General Douglas Hawthorn demanding that the Indonesians surrender their weapons within 48 hours or be executed. As this was against the agreement with Mallaby, Moestopo and his allies took offense to the demands and refused to entertain British requests. Fighting between the forces took place from 28 to 30 October after Moestopo told his troops that the British would attempt to forcibly disarm them; the fighting culminated with Mallaby's death. When the British forces asked President Sukarno to interfere, the president took Moestopo as an adviser and told the Indonesian forces to stop fighting. Moestopo, unwilling to relinquish his command, chose to go to Gresik instead. Thus, when the Battle of Surabaya continued, Moestopo was no longer in command. By February 1946, when Dutch troops had already returned to Java, he went to Yogyakarta to work as a military educator, teaching for a time at the military academy there. In mid-1946 Moestopo was sent to Subang, where he led the Terate Troops. Aside from regular military forces, members of the Terate Troops under Moestopo's commanded also included legions of pickpockets and prostitutes who were tasked with spreading confusion in and procuring supplies from behind the Dutch lines. Moestopo also served as the political educator for military forces in Subang. In May 1947, after serving a period as head of the Struggle Bureau in Jakarta, he was transferred to East Java after being wounded in a skirmish with Dutch forces. =Later life= After the war, Moestopo moved to Jakarta, where he took office as Section Head for Jaw Surgery at the Army Hospital (now Gatot Subroto Military Hospital). In 1952, Moestopo began training other dentists in his off time from his home, giving basic training in hygiene, nutrition, and anatomy. Meanwhile, he came under consideration for position of Minister of Defence for the Wilopo Cabinet, but was ultimately not chosen; instead, he led a series of demonstrations against the parliamentary system. Moestopo formalized his home dentistry course in 1957, and in 1958 – after training in the United States – he established the Dr. Moestopo Dental College, which he continued to develop it until it became a university on 15 February 1961. That same year, he received his doctorate from the University of Indonesia. Moestopo died on 29 September 1986 and was buried in Cikutra Cemetery, Bandung. Accolades On 9 November 2007, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono gave Moestopo the title National Hero of Indonesia; Moestopo received the title along with Adnan Kapau Gani, Ida Anak Agung Gde Agung, and Ignatius Slamet Riyadi based on Presidential Decree Number 66 / TK of 2007. That same year he was awarded the Bintang Mahaputera Adipradana.

The department’s stated key goals for the period from 2009 to 2013 are: * Full immunisation of all children under the age of 1; * Reduction of maternal mortality; * Reduction of HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB prevalence; * Improving access to service for the poor. The current Minister for Health is Hon. Dr Puka Temu. Controversies  PNG’s National Department of Health has been accused of corruption, including taking bribes from pharmaceutical companies and misappropriation of government funds. =Ongoing Investigation into Corruption= In October 2011, Investigation Task Force Sweep Chairman Sam Koim expanded Task Force Sweep’s scope to include an investigation into corruption at the National Department of Health. His team began the process of collecting and collating information on: * (a) Instances of misappropriation of funds and assets, * (b) Instances of corruption in the procurement of medicines, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, and * (c) Activities of provincial hospitals and rural facilities. A report on these findings is due to be provided to the National Executive Council (NEC) in the coming months. The investigation was initiated after Maxtone-Graham handed over a file to the police fraud squad which contained allegations of corrupt activities in his department. In May 2011, Dr Clement Malau (Dr Malua), former Secretary for Health and Head of the National Department of Health until August 2011, under the previous PNG administration, was under fire for depositing a sum of PGK1.767 million from government money into the Bank of South Pacific (BSP) in 1998, instead using it for healthcare purposes and, ten years later, in August 2008, authorising the re-payment of this amount, plus interest, to an unregistered company named PACPNG Pharmaceuticals, instead of back to the government. =Payments from Pharmaceutical Companies= In March 2011, it was reported that senior officials in the National Department of Health received massive kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies for a period of up to ten years. At the time, Dr Malau said payments by medical suppliers to government officials for favours had run into “the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars”. PNG's former Health Minister Sasa Zibe also stated that the Health Department's drug supply division “is riddled with corruption and is ineffective”. The government blamed a lack of transparency within the tender process as a reason why the corruption went unnoticed for such a long period of time. However, pharmaceutical companies that have significant contracts with the PNG government, including Borneo Pacific Pharmaceutical Ltd, remained silent when questioned by the media. Doctors in national hospitals reported that they were “starved” of drugs in order to create an emergency system that would allow the National Department of Health to bypass the tender process and give preferential treatment to certain pharmaceutical companies. In order to combat these allegations, Dr Malau hired a drug procurement and distribution specialist, charged with establishing an efficient drug ordering and distribution system. However, officials in the department attempted to terminate the expert’s contract prematurely. =AUSAID Paper= A paper prepared by the Australian government’s aid division, AUSAID in 2005, stated that although the country has a sound national health policy, a number of factors are hindering its implementation. These factors include: * Management issues; * Relationships; * Financing arrangements; * The skills of health practitioners; and * External factors such as the institutional rules which affect the behaviour of sector stakeholders.

The Village Voice described him in 2003 as \\"one of Afghanistan's sharpest political satirists\\". Hamed was trained as a physician, but he views his primary work as the promotion of freedom of expression. In 1985, he began his first underground newspaper, Salam, in Mazar-i-Sharif. He went on to found nine more, including the women's magazine Sadaf. In 2003, Hamed said that he had started more than 90% of Afghanistan's \\"free\\" publications. He has criticized the power of local warlords on the BBC's Dari service, to which he is a frequent contributor. In 1997, he had a confrontation on the street with Mohammed Mohaqiq, then the Interior Minister of Afghanistan, for his outspokenness. Hamed alleges that Mohaqiq and eight bodyguards proceeded to assault him, the bodyguards striking him with rifle butts and bayonets. Alarmed by the lawlessness of Afghanistan and the rise of the Taliban, he fled the country the following year and received political asylum in Denmark. He returned to Afghanistan in 2002 after the US invasion drove the Taliban from power. He then co-founded the press freedom organization \\"Association for the Defense of Afghan Writers' Rights\\", as well as a new magazine, Telaya, focused on social and political problems. When regional authorities attempted to ban Telaya in Baghlan Province, Hamed responded by appealing to the national Information Ministry, who overruled the regional authorities and allowed him to continue publishing. Hamed also began to contribute to the satirical newspaper, Kalak-e-Rhaastgoy—an \\"ironic parody of news events\\" that he compares to the US satirical paper The Onion—as well as drawing cartoons and writing satirical songs. In April 2003, an unknown man approached Hamed on the street, called his name, and handed him a piece of paper; as Hamed was reading it, the man slashed him in the chest with a knife. Hamed was cut several more times, but eventually succeeded in disarming his attacker.

His appointment as a brigadier general was refused by the Confederate Senate after Confederate President Jefferson Davis failed to nominate Taylor, apparently following Davis's appointment of Taylor to the rank. Nonetheless, Taylor's name is frequently found on lists and in sketches of Confederate generals. He was often referred to as a general both during the Civil War and the years following it. Before the Civil War, Taylor served as a first lieutenant in the 3rd Kentucky Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Mexican–American War. After that war, he was a cattle driver, farmer and lawyer. After the Civil War, he was engaged in business in Mobile, Alabama for five years, and after returning to Kentucky, was a Deputy U.S. Marshal for five years and was chief of police at Louisville, Kentucky for eleven years. Early life Thomas H. Taylor was born July 31, 1825 at Frankfort, Kentucky.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 612.

Moreland of Mobile, Alabama, who died some time before 1878. In 1878, he married Eliza Adair Monroe. They had four children, Mary Louise, John Adair Monroe, Thomas Hart Jr. and Adair Monroe. American Civil War service Thomas H. Taylor began his Confederate Army Civil War service as a captain of cavalry in the Army of the Confederate States of America, the Regular Army of the Confederacy. According to one source, on July 3, 1861, he became lieutenant colonel of the Confederate 1st Kentucky Infantry Regiment. Other sources indicate that the 1st Kentucky Infantry was not formed until August 7, 1861.Allardice, 2008. p. 259. In early July 1861, Taylor was either a member of the personal staff of Confederate President Jefferson Davis or at least a special messenger on his behalf.Beatie, Russel Harrison.

On July 6, 1861, Taylor took dispatches from Jefferson Davis for President Abraham Lincoln. These dispatches insisted that the crew of the privateer Savannah be treated as prisoners of war and exchanged and threatened retaliation against Union Army prisoners if the crew were hanged as pirates. After proceeding to Manassas Junction, Virginia by railroad, on July 8, 1861, with an escort of about 12 men from Fairfax, Virginia, Taylor set out under a flag of truce toward the Union Army headquarters of Major General Irvin McDowell at Arlington, Virginia, presumably to ultimately present the dispatches to President Lincoln.Beatie, 2002, p. 212. About seven miles from Arlington, Taylor was met by Union Colonel, soon to be Brigadier General, Andrew Porter, a comrade from the Mexican–American War and First Lieutenant, later Brigadier General, William W. Averell.Beattie, 2002, p. 212 agrees with the editors of the Jefferson Davis Papers, Baton Rouge and London, 1971–1995, that the officer was Thomas H. Taylor, not John G. Taylor as stated by the editor of Averell's memoirs, which are incomplete. Moreover, Davis himself wrote that Colonel Thomas Taylor was the messenger. Davis, Jefferson.

After some personal conversation between Taylor and Porter, a Union cavalry escort took Taylor to Arlington, where they found McDowell was out. Taylor was taken to the office of U.S. Army General-in-Chief, Brevet Lieutenant General Winfield Scott in Washington when Scott learned of his mission and that McDowell was not present to receive him. Scott sent the dispatches to President Lincoln. Scott served wine and champagne while they waited for a reply. Due to the late hour, after 10:00 p.m., Lincoln sent no reply. Scott sent Taylor back to Major General Irvin McDowell for more hospitality and to stay the night, promising that he would send a reply from Lincoln promptly. After breakfast and with a stack of northern newspapers, Taylor and his party were escorted back to the Confederate lines. Lincoln never responded to Davis's messages. However, he did not enforce the stated policy of hanging privateers as pirates. On August 7, 1861, General Joseph E. Johnston combined two Kentucky battalions into the 1st Kentucky Infantry Regiment. Lieutenant Colonel Taylor was ordered to take command. On September 28, 1861, the regiment skirmished with small Union Army units as the Confederates evacuated Mason's Hill and Munson's Hill, about four miles from Alexandria, Virginia. Taylor was promoted to colonel on October 14, 1861. On December 20, 1861, the regiment fought at the Battle of Dranesville as part of a large foraging party under the overall command of Brigadier General J.E.B. Stuart. Taylor became separated from his men while moving down his line and had to extricate himself from behind enemy lines after nightfall.Stuart, J.E.B.

Taylor's regiment was assigned to Brigade 5, Division 1 of the Army of East Tennessee in March 1862.Warner, 1959, p. 300 and Sifakis, 1988, p. 643 say that the regiment saw some service in the Peninsula Campaign. This seems to contradict Eicher's statement of the date the regiment was assigned to duty in Tennessee. The 1st Kentucky Infantry was a 12-month regiment which was mustered out of the Confederate States Army in the summer of 1862. Taylor was assigned to brigade command in the Department of East Tennessee by Major General E. Kirby Smith. This division served at Cumberland Gap and in Kentucky. Thomas H. Taylor was appointed brigadier general on November 4, 1862 but the Confederate Senate refused the appointment when Confederate President Jefferson Davis failed to nominate Taylor.Boatner, Mark Mayo, III. The Civil War Dictionary. New York: McKay, 1988. . First published New York, McKay, 1959. p. 828. After commanding a brigade in Major General Carter L. Stevenson's division of the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana from July 1862 through April 1863, Taylor became provost marshal and inspector general for the Army of Mississippi under Lieutenant General John Pemberton at Vicksburg, Mississippi.Allardice, 2008, p. 262 He was in command of an attack on Donaldsonville, Louisiana on June 27, 1863Fredriksen, John C.

Taylor was captured at the fall of Vicksburg to Union forces commanded by Major General Ulysses S. Grant on July 4, 1863 He was paroled, went to Montgomery, Alabama and was later exchanged. After his exchange, Taylor had brief service at Mobile, Alabama and then was given command of the District of Mississippi and East Louisiana in the Department of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana from March 5, 1864 to April 28, 1864.Eicher gives an end date of April 5 but in view of Allardice's more specific information, including Taylor's arrival only on March 30, Allardice's end date is given in the text. Taylor was delayed by Union Major General William T. Sherman's capture of Meridian, Mississippi after the Battle of Meridian from February 14 to February 20, 1864. Taylor took command on March 30, 1864. He had a difficult time due to his small number of troops and civilian discontent as well as Union raids. Taylor was relieved on April 28, 1864 by Colonel John S. Scott, who had lived in East Louisiana, and reported to department headquarters at Demopolis, Alabama. On June 24, 1864, Taylor became provost marshal of the Department of Alabama and East Mississippi under Lieutenant General Stephen D. Lee at Meridian. From November 1864 until the end of the war, Taylor was in command of the post at Mobile, Alabama. In this capacity, he commanded only some reserve and local defense troops, charged more with maintaining order than defending the city, which he was compelled to evacuate with Confederate troops from local forts on April 11, 1865. According to some sources, no record of his parole has been found, but at least one source says Taylor was paroled on May 5, 1865 with troops at Jackson, Mississippi where he acted as parole commissioner for Confederate troops in that area under orders from Lieutenant General Richard Taylor. Aftermath After the Civil War, Taylor moved to Alabama where he engaged in business at Mobile until 1870. He returned to Kentucky and served for five years as deputy U.S. Marshal. Taylor was chief of police of Louisville, Kentucky from 1881 to 1892. Even though he had no experience as an engineer, he was superintendent of the Louisville and Portland Canal between February 1886 and 1889 when he was replaced due to a change in administration.

The reason for their popularity is that snowdrops can form impressive carpets of white in areas where they are native or have been naturalised. Most 'Snowdrop Gardens' will have the common snowdrop, Galanthus nivalis, but some have more unusual snowdrops, some which may be unique to the garden that they are growing in. The rarest may only survive in that garden due to the conditions and environment. Galanthophile A galanthophile is a snowdrop enthusiast. They may be authors of snowdrop books, cultivate snowdrops, collect snowdrops and have displays of them for personal and public display. Well known galanthophiles are the horticulturalist E. A.

The word is derived from the Greek , aitiologia, \\"giving a reason for\\" (, aitia, \\"cause\\"; and , -logia). Description In medicine, the term refers to the causes of diseases or pathologies. Discusses several examples of the medical usage of the term etiology in the context of cleft lips and explains methods used to study causation. Where no etiology can be ascertained, the disorder is said to be idiopathic. Traditional accounts of the causes of disease may point to the \\"evil eye\\". The Ancient Roman scholar Marcus Terentius Varro put forward early ideas about microorganisms in a 1st- century BC book titled On Agriculture.Varro On Agriculture 1, xii Loeb Medieval thinking on the etiology of disease showed the influence of Galen and of Hippocrates.Maimonides: an early but accurate view on the treatment of hemorrhoids -- Magrill and Sekaran 83 (979): 352 -- Postgraduate Medical Journal Medieval European doctors generally held the view that disease was related to the air and adopted a miasmatic approach to disease etiology.Case study: the history and ethics clean air Etiological discovery in medicine has a history in Robert Koch's demonstration that the tubercle bacillus (Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex) causes the disease tuberculosis, Bacillus anthracis causes anthrax, and Vibrio cholerae causes cholera. This line of thinking and evidence is summarized in Koch's postulates. But proof of causation in infectious diseases is limited to individual cases that provide experimental evidence of etiology. In epidemiology, several lines of evidence together are required to infer causation. Sir Austin Bradford-Hill demonstrated a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer, and summarized the line of reasoning in the epidemiological criteria for causation. Dr. Al Evans, a US epidemiologist, synthesized his predecessors' ideas in proposing the Unified Concept of Causation. Chain of causation and correlation Further thinking in epidemiology was required to distinguish causation from association or statistical correlation. Events may occur together simply due to chance, bias or confounding, instead of one event being caused by the other. It is also important to know which event is the cause. Careful sampling and measurement are more important than sophisticated statistical analysis to determine causation. Experimental evidence involving interventions (providing or removing the supposed cause) gives the most compelling evidence of etiology. Related to this, sometimes several symptoms always appear together, or more often than what could be expected, though it is known that one cannot cause the other. These situations are called syndromes, and normally it is assumed that an underlying condition must exist that explains all the symptoms. Other times there is not a single cause for a disease, but instead a chain of causation from an initial trigger to the development of the clinical disease. An etiological agent of disease may require an independent co-factor, and be subject to a promoter (increases expression) to cause disease. An example of all the above, which was recognized late, is that peptic ulcer disease may be induced by stress, requires the presence of acid secretion in the stomach, and has primary etiology in Helicobacter pylori infection. Many chronic diseases of unknown cause may be studied in this framework to explain multiple epidemiological associations or risk factors which may or may not be causally related, and to seek the actual etiology. Etiological heterogeneity Some diseases, such as diabetes or hepatitis, are syndromically defined by their signs and symptoms, but include different conditions with different etiologies. These are called heterogeneous conditions. Conversely, a single etiology, such as Epstein-Barr virus, may in different circumstances produce different diseases such as mononucleosis, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or Burkitt's lymphoma. =Endotype= An endotype is a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or pathobiological mechanism. This is distinct from a phenotype, which is any observable characteristic or trait of a disease, such as morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that patients with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases. One example is asthma, which is considered to be a syndrome, consisting of a series of endotypes. This is related to the concept of disease entity. Other example could be AIDS, where an HIV infection can produce several clinical stages. AIDS is defined as the clinical stage IV of the HIV infection.

In a career that lasted from May 1798 to August 1801 he ran nineteen times and won nine races. Lightly campaigned in his first two seasons he won Epsom Derby on his racecourse debut and the Claret Stakes at Newmarket in 1799. Sir Harry was much more active in his two remaining years, running fifteen times and winning seven more races including several match races and King's Plates. After his retirement from racing he was exported to the United States where he had a successful record at stud. Background Sir Harry was a brown horse bred by his owner Joseph Cookson. He was the fifth Derby winner to be trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by Frank Neale. Sir Harry's sire, Sir Peter Teazle (or simply \\"Sir Peter\\") won the Epsom Derby in 1787 and became the most successful stallion of the time, winning the title of Champion sire on ten occasions between 1799 and 1809. Sir Harry made Sir Peter Teazle the first Derby winner to sire another winner of the race. Sir Harry was the last of three foals produced by Matron, also known as Betsey. After having her first foal in 1789, Matron was trained for racing for two years and then used as a hunter for two further years until being returned to stud in 1794. Racing career =1798: three-year-old season= Sir Harry made his first racecourse appearance in the Derby at Epsom on 24 May 1798. The race attracted thirty-seven entries, each paying fifty guineas, of which ten appeared to run in the race. Despite his lack of previous experience Sir Harry was made favourite at odds of 7/4. Ridden by Sam Arnull, he won from the 33/1 outsider Telegraph, with Young Spear third. Sir Harry had only one other race in 1798, when he ran at Newmarket in October. He started second favourite for a Sweepstakes over ten furlongs (\\"Across the Flat\\")) and finished second of the four runners behind the favourite Admiral Nelson. One source from late 1798 lists Sir Harry as the property of \\"Sir H. Hoghton\\", but this may be an error as Mr Cookson was listed as the colts owner for all his races from 1798 to 1800. =1799: four- year-old season= In the Claret Stakes at Newmarket on 9 April Sir Harry was opposed by some of the previous year's best three-year-olds including the colts Admiral Nelson (the 6/4 favourite), Telegraph and Schedoni as well as the filly Bellissima, winner of The Oaks. Sir Harry started at odds of 8/1 and won the two mile race from Bellissima and with Telegraph third. In August Sir Harry was walked 170 miles to compete in a four mile match race at York against the 1798 St Leger winner Symmetry in which he was scheduled to concede two pounds to his opponent. Very heavy rain turned the ground extremely soft and left parts of the course \\"knee deep\\" in mud and water. Sir Harry started 2/5 favourite but Symmetry coped better with the conditions to take the 500 guinea prize. A rematch was quickly arranged for the following spring at Newmarket =1800: five-year-old season= After running only four times in the previous two years, Sir Harry ran four times in five weeks at Newmarket in the spring of 1800. On 14 April he was beaten in a 500 guinea match race over ten furlongs against Mr Baldock's horse Schedoni, to whom he was conceding half a pound. Two weeks later the rematch between Sir Harry and Symmetry was held over the two mile \\"Ditch In\\" course. On this occasion, Sir Harry carried half a pound less than his opponent and reversed the York form to win a prize of 200 guineas. Three days later Sir Harry reappeared for a Sweepstakes over the four Mile Duke's Course. He was made the 2/1 favourite and won from Lord Sackville's Laborie, the 1796 Oaks winner Parisot and two others. A third match against Symmetry, with Sir Harry conceding six pounds, had been scheduled for the next Newmarket meeting, but Mr Cookson withdrew his horse and paid a forfeit. At the same meeting on 17 May, Sir Harry ran a match against the Derby runner-up Telegraph over ten furlongs in which Sir Harry conceded seven pounds and ran a dead heat. There was no run-off, meaning that the 300 guinea stake was divided. As in 1799, Sir Harry traveled to York in late summer, but had no success. On 26 August he carried top weight in the York Oatlands Stakes over two miles and finished last of the three runners behind Sir Harry Tempest-Vane's St Leger winner Cockfighter. On the following afternoon Sir Harry started 6/4 favourite for the Great Subscription Plate and finished last of the five runners over four miles. On his last appearance of the season, Sir Harry returned to Newmarket for a Sweepstakes over the four mile Beacon Course. He was made 13/8 favourite and finished second of the six runners beaten by Mr Adams' horse Humbug. =1801: six-year-old season= Sir Harry began his final season of racing in the ownership of a Mr Turnor. On 9 April he conceded at least ten pounds to his opponents in a race over the Duke's Course at Newmarket and won from Jack Andrews, Hippona and Telegraph. On his next start three days later, Sir Harry ran in the colours of Mr Bullock in a ten furlong Subscription Plate. Conceding at least twelve pounds to his seven opponents he finished second to Hornby Lass. On 22 April, running over the Round Course, Sir Harry finished second of the three runners to Sorceror in another subscription race. On his final start at Newmarket, Sir Harry ran over the sprint distance of six furlongs for a match race on 5 May. He took the prize money by defeating his familiar opponent Telegraph, to whom he was conceding seven pounds. On 9 June Sir Harry competed in a Sweepstakes at Ascot which carried the condition that the winner must be offered for sale at 300 guineas. Sir Harry won the race from Wrangler and was duly bought by Mr Concannon, the owner of the runner-up. This was seen as an unfortunate result for Mr Bullock who had reportedly turned down an offer of 500 guineas for the horse on the previous day. Two weeks later, Sir Harry made his first appearance for his new owner in a King's Plate at Lewes where his opponents were Warter and Slapbang. In King's Plate races, horses carried heavy weights and raced in a series of four mile heats, with the prize going to the first horse to win twice. Sir Harry, carrying 168 pounds, finished last of the three runners behind Warter in the first heat, but then won the second. With Slapbang being withdrawn, the two winners then took part in deciding heat, which Sir Harry won to claim the prize, having galloped twelve miles in the course of the afternoon. Following this race, a match was arranged between Sir Harry and Warter on 7 August at Brighthelmston. Racing over one mile at level weights, Sir Harry started a slight favourite but was narrowly beaten by Lord Sackville's horse. The winning margin was so small that Concannon tried to claim a victory for Sir Harry before the official result was announced, creating \\"great confusion\\" among the racegoers. A week later, Sir Harry ran his last race in another King's Plate at Lewes. He finished second in the first heat and third in the second before being withdrawn. He was then retired to stud. Stud career Sir Harry began his breeding career at Dennis O'Kelly's stud at Cannons, near Little Stanmore, Middlesex, where he stood at a fee of five guineas alongside the established stallions Dungannon and Volunteer. The most notable of his English offspring was an unnamed mare who produced The Oaks winner Medora. In 1804 he was sold to William Haxall and exported to the United States. He was based in Virginia until 1816 when he was moved to Samuel Griffith's stud in, Harford County, Maryland. He was a success at stud in America, siring the good winners Sir Alfred and Sir Hal and several important broodmares.
