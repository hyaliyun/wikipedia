He was one of the most productive 20th-century scholars of the ancient world and is considered one of the leading researchers of his time. Although some of his research results are controversial, his work in several areas is viewed as groundbreaking. Professor Alf√∂ldi contributed significantly to the massive Cambridge Ancient History, including Vol. 12: The Imperial Crisis and Recovery. He became a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1955. Life and career The son of a doctor, Alf√∂ldi was born in 1895 in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Although the family finances were damaged after the death of his father in 1910, Alf√∂ldi was able to begin his studies of classical history after his graduation from high school. His first area of interest was in classical numismatics, which at the time was a neglected area of study in Hungary. Like many middle class young men of his age, Alf√∂ldi participated in World War I. He was a highly decorated soldier, and after sustaining a severe injury, he was dismissed from the military in 1917. In later years he looked back on his service with pride and he retained an interest in military and strategic subjects throughout his life. The Treaty of Trianon, which officially ended the war in Hungary and established its borders, was perceived as a humiliation to the country. This strengthened Alf√∂ldi's interest in regional history. In the aftermath of World War I, national ties and boundaries that had been established over hundreds of years were dissolved and rebuilt. As was not uncommon in the years between the wars, archeology served to strengthen national identity. In 1923, Alf√∂ldi was appointed chair of Ancient History at the University of Debrecen. In 1930, he was appointed to a prestigious chair at the University of Budapest. Over the next 15 years Alf√∂ldi shaped the field of ancient history and archeology in Hungary, and was also recognized as an outstanding scholar by the international community. His work transformed the Danube and Carpathian regions into some of the most thoroughly researched areas of the former Roman Empire. Particular areas of interest were the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century, the history and culture of Eurasian herders and horsemen and the imagery and representation of Roman emperors in late antiquity. Alf√∂ldi's work was not interrupted by the second world war, but the post-war influence of the Soviet Union over the Hungarian state put an end to his research. He emigrated to Switzerland in 1947. Although most of his research materials remained behind in Budapest, the continued to contribute to the field of classical studies and archaeology. He was awarded the medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1953. In 1956, Alf√∂ldi accepted a position in the Institute for Advanced Study's School of Historical Studies. The position afforded better pay and more opportunities for travel, and Alf√∂ldi would continue to work on projects at Princeton even after his retirement. While at Princeton, he married his second wife, Elisabeth Alf√∂ldi-Rosenbaum, who was also a classical scholar and art historian. After emigrating, Alf√∂ldi expanded his areas of research into early Roman history and the eventual demise of the empire. In Alf√∂ldi's obituary, G√©za Alf√∂ldy said: \\"He illuminated the history of Rome from the beginning to end like no other scholar in this century.\\" WorkEarly Rome= In Afoldi's opinion, the importance of Rome in the Etruscan period was far less than was later portrayed. He attempted to compare the oldest structures of the Roman state with the Eurasian horsemen and herdsmen. Although his theories were not received with a wholly positive response, even his critics recognized the originality of his arguments. In addition to archeological and later literary sources, he employed the methods of comparative religion in his work. =The fall of the Roman Republic= Alf√∂ldi's work regarding the downfall of the Roman Republic was marked by his thesis that Julius Caesar intended to establish a monarchy along the old Roman pattern. He believed that he found evidence that confirmed this theory in the coinage of the year 44BC. Alf√∂ldi defended Caesar in this. Like Theodor Mommsen, Alf√∂ldi was fascinated by the personality of Caesar and disappointed by the ‚Äúopportunism‚Äù of Cicero. Although he saw Cicero as the ideological instigator of Caesar's murder, he also considered Cicero to be an artist of nature. The murder of Caesar attested to the blindness and scrupulousness of the senatorial oligarchy, which in turn no way supported a republican order. In his eyes, the outrage against Caesar arose from the conflict between the Greek-influenced upper class, and with Caesar, who bore the stamp of the native Roman tradition. He based his work on Octavian's rise primarily on literary sources. Here he highlighted not only the emotional and religious grounds for Octavian's approach after Caesar's death, but also the underlying tangible economic aspects. =Study of the Roman Empire= ‚ÄúThe Design of the Monarchical Ceremony at the Roman Imperial Court‚Äù (1934 ) and ‚ÄúInsignia and Costume of the Roman Empire‚Äù (1935) mark the pinnacle of Alf√∂ldi's work. In these two essays he describes both the religious foundations as well as the continuous development and official expressions of Roman rulers‚Äô ideology. In these articles Alf√∂ldi again connects numismatic, literary, epigraphic, and archaeological studies. His understanding of the ancient imagery and of their abstraction to small coin designs was particularly praised. These studies provided a basis for further exploration of the world of ideas and representation within the empire. In the absence of comprehensive written sources for Roman history in the middle and the second half of the 3rd Century, in the time of the so-called imperial crisis, Alf√∂ldi once again approached his research on the basis of numismatic sources. He reviewed great collections of material from this time. His investigation of the Siscia mintmark proved particularly important. Based on the coins he studied, Alf√∂ldi a worked out a new chronology of this period in Roman history. Among his new findings was that during the period of soldier-emperors, many Pannonians held some of the highest positions in the empire. In addition, he presented Gallienus as a great Roman emperor, which was different point of view from that hitherto presented by historical research. =Late Antiquity= Alf√∂ldi also made noteworthy contributions to the study of late antiquity and here again he made particular use of numismatic sources. Of particular importance was the cataloging of the so-called Contorniate coins, which opened up a new, hitherto almost unknown source, especially for the history of ideas of the late 4th and early 5th centuries. The coins had been almost totally misunderstood before his work.Rito√≥k, Zsigmond. (1997) \\"The contribution of Hungary to international classical scholarship\\", Hungarian Studies, 12. Archived here. This research took place during the second World War, which makes the achievement particularly noteworthy. Despite the turmoil of war Alf√∂ldi was able to obtain the materials he needed from the different museums of Europe. What most interested Alf√∂ldi in the study of late antiquity, however, was the era between Constantine I and the victory of Christianity over paganism. His work ‚ÄúA Festival of Isis in Rome under the Christian Emperors of the IVth Century‚Äù (Budapest 1937), in which he writes about a festival honoring the goddess Isis in Rome at the time of Christian emperors of the 4th century, is considered outstanding. Also his annual organization of an international colloquium to the Historia Augusta, which was held on a regular basis for 20 years, contributed greatly to the study of late antiquity. Legacy and recognition Probably the most important contribution that Alf√∂ldi made to the study of ancient history was the realization that epigraphic, numismatic, and archaeological sources are equal and complementary, and that literary sources should not just be treated as an auxiliary scholarly pursuit. As an opponent of excessive specialization in a field that increasingly broke down into specialist divisions, he himself was a specialist in many areas. In a historical perspective, he stood in the tradition of Mommsen, but in a methodological perspective he followed the tradition of Michael Rostovtzeff, who based his economic-historical studies on archaeological sources. Alf√∂ldi's use of numismatic sources was also a major contribution. Ancient coins were, thanks to him, one of the main sources of ancient history. His methods, which included the study of series of coins, as well as the analysis of mintmarks and the use of coins as a source for religious studies interpretations were groundbreaking. Just as Mommsen is regarded as the great organizer in the study of Roman inscriptions, Alf√∂ldi is thought of as the doyen of numismatics. \\"He had a big role in ensuring that the Numismatics has become a historical science.\\" (G√©za Alf√∂ldy). Alf√∂ldi's contributions to the exploration of the Danube and Carpathian regions are also noteworthy. Through his efforts, this area which was once almost a blank spot on the \\"map\\" of the ancient world became one of its most well researched areas. Alf√∂ldi's ≈ìuvre includes more than 300 articles, including about a dozen in the form of monographs. In addition to his better-known research, Alf√∂ldi also pursued other studies. He wrote about the art of photographing of Greek vase paintings, the psychological foundations of witchcraft and the importance of the theriomorphic worldview among the peoples of North Asia. In 1972, Alf√∂ldi was awarded the Order Pour le M√©rite for Arts and Sciences. The only other historian to receive this honor was Sir Ronald Syme. In addition, he was a member or honorary member of many scientific societies and academies. He also held honorary doctorates from several universities and earned other awards . The Historic Class of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences took accepted him as a corresponding member in 1936. In 1975 he was awarded the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art.

She was built in 1966 by Lindholmens varv in Gothenburg, Sweden for Rederi AB Svea as MS Svea. As Svea she was used on the joint Sweden‚ÄìUnited Kingdom service operated by Ellerman's Wilson Line, Swedish Lloyd and Rederi AB Svea. In 1969 Svea was sold to Swedish Lloyd and renamed MS Hispania. In 1972 she was renamed MS Saga. In 1978 she was sold to Minoan Lines following the closure of Swedish Lloyd's passenger services and renamed MS Knossos. In 1998 she passed to Diler Lines, becoming their MS Captain Zaman II. In 2003 she was sold to Blue Line and was renamed Ancona. She was sold for scrap in October 2010 and breaking up was commenced on 15 December 2010. Concept and construction In the mid-1960s Rederi AB Svea, Swedish Lloyd and Ellerman's Wilson Line decided to establish a joint service between Sweden and the United Kingdom, appropriately named England‚ÄìSweden Line, abbreviated ELS. Each participant company had a new ship built for the service; Rederi AB Svea and Swedish Lloyd opted to order two identical sister ships ( and MS Svea) from Gothenburg's Lindholmens varv, while Ellerman's Wilson ordered a slightly smaller vessel () from Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. Swedish Lloyd also ordered a third ship of the Saga/Svea design () for their UK‚ÄìSpain service. All three ships built for the UK‚ÄìSweden service were based on an essentially traditional concept with subdued and luxurious interior fittings and without full-height car decks, with a service speed of . Rederi AB Svea's Svea was launched from drydock on 3 March 1966, and delivered to her owners on 27 October of the same year. Service history1966‚Äì69: Rederi AB Svea= Following delivery to Rederi AB Svea, Svea sailed from Gothenburg to her port of registry Stockholm. On 30 October 1966, she made an introductory cruise around the Stockholm archipelago. Subsequently she sailed back to Gothenburg, and entered service on the Gothenburg‚ÄìHull route on 10 November 1966, running parallel to Ellerman's Wilson Line's Spero, while Swedish Lloyd's Saga sailed on the Gothenburg‚ÄìTilbury route. From early on the ELS service faced fierce competition from Tor Line, who had also initiated a UK‚ÄìSweden service in 1966. Unlike the ELS ships, Tor Line's and featured modern furnishings, full-height car decks and had a service speed of . Possibly due to the high level of competition Rederi AB Svea decided to withdraw from the joint UK‚ÄìSweden service in March 1968, when Svea was sold to Swedish Lloyd for a delivery in 1969. =1969‚Äì78: Swedish Lloyd= Swedish Lloyd took over Svea on 7 January 1969, when the ship arrived at the Burmeister & Wain shipyard for rebuilding for UK‚ÄìSpain service. In April 1969 she was renamed Hispania and entered service on the Southampton‚ÄìBilbao route, running parallel to her sister ship Patricia. On 29 November 1970 Hispania was moved to the Gothenburg‚ÄìTilbury service, running parallel to Saga. During the off-season Swedish Lloyd marketed round trips on their ships as four-day mini cruises, making Hispania and her sister ships some of the first cruiseferries in the world. Competition from Tor Line remained fierce on the line service, and in February 1972 the joint ELS service was radically cut down: on 7 February Swedish Lloyd sold Saga to Stena Line, and Hispania was in turn renamed Saga. On 25 February Ellerman's Wilson Line withdrew Spero from the service, leaving Saga (ex-Svea) as the sole ship of the England‚ÄìSweden Line. In 1975‚Äì76 Tor Line introduced notably larger and faster sister vessels and to the UK‚ÄìSweden service. The Saga could not compete with the more modern tonnage, and on 2 September 1977 Swedish Lloyd abandoned the Gothenburg‚ÄìTilbury service. The Southampton‚ÄìBilbao service had been abandoned a month before, and as a result both Saga and Patricia were laid up at Lindholmens varv in Gothenburg. =1978‚Äì98: Minoan Lines= In March 1978 Saga was sold to the Greece-based Minoan Lines. On 6 April 1978, she was renamed Knossos and subsequently entered service on Minoan Lines Piraeus‚ÄìHeraklion route. On 16 September 1980 the ship suffered an engine room fire while in Piraues. In 1985 she again sailed parallel to one of her sister ships, when Minoan Lines acquired Festos, ex-Saga. In 1988 Knossos was moved to the Piraeus‚ÄìChania service, where she remained until October 1995 when Minoan Lines decided to abandon the route. Knossos was laid up until March 1996, when she started sailing on the Patras‚ÄìIgoumenitsa‚ÄìCorfu‚ÄìAncona service. The following year the service was shortened to Igoumenitsa‚ÄìCorfu‚ÄìBrindisi, with calls at Corfu omitted during the northern hemisphere winter season. =1998‚Äì2003: Diler Lines and Comanav= In February 1998 Knossos (as well as Festos) was sold to Ferro Ferryboat & RoRo Transport. Knossos was renamed Captain Zaman II, while Festos became Captain Zaman I. Both ships entered service on Turkey-based Diler Lines' Istanbul‚ÄìOdessa route. In August of the same year the route of the ships was altered into Brindisi‚ÄìIgoumenitsa. During the northern hemisphere summer seasons of 2001 and 2002 Captain Zaman II was chartered to Comanav for service between Nador and Set√©. Following the end of her 2002 charter to Comanav Captain Zaman II was laid up at Tuzla, Turkey. =2003‚Äì10: Blue Line= On 17 January 2003, Captain Zaman II was sold to the Croatia-based SEM Maritime for service with their subsidiary Blue Line International. The ship was renamed Ancona and entered service on Blue Line's Ancona‚ÄìSplit service on 1 April 2003. During the northern hemisphere summer season the service also included occasional calls at Hvar and Vis. Retirement Ancona was withdrawn from service in 2010 due to the new SOLAS 2010 regulations coming into effect. Scrapping was commenced at Alang, India on 15 December 2010.

History Blackpool Sea Eagles RLFC were founded in 2002 by Chris Aylen and Dave Gavaghan with assistance from the Blackpool Rugby League Supporters Club. Further friendlies took place throughout the summer, all taking place at Blackpool RUFC. Blackpool Sea Eagles became founder members of the North West Division of the Rugby League Conference in 2003. They ended the league campaign with two wins both coming against local rivals Lancaster before crashing out to Gateshead Storm in the first round of the RLC Shield play- offs. 2004 saw the club compete in an expanded eight team North West Division. The Sea Eagles competed well in every match, but only finished the campaign with 1 point. Despite this disappointing league campaign the Sea Eagles reached the quarter-finals of the RLC Shield with victories over North Wales Coasters and Lancaster before losing out to Crewe Wolves 37 - 20. The club enjoyed a much better league campaign in 2005 ending the regular season with a 50% win ratio. The Sea Eagles went on to defeat four teams en route to the RLC Shield final against St Ives Roosters. The final staged at the Butts Park Arena, Coventry saw Blackpool register a record 74 - 10 win and be crowned RLC Shield winners. In 2006, Blackpool Sea Eagles were promoted to the RLC North Premier division. Despite the step up, Blackpool recorded seven victories and finished in fourth place, just missing out on the play- offs. Due to a restructuring of the leagues, the 2007 season saw Blackpool rejoin the North West division. Taking this opportunity to integrate a number of younger players into the squad, the club picked up seven wins and finished the season in third place; going out of the play-offs in the first round to eventual champions Widnes Saints. 2008 saw the club compete in a combined North West & Cheshire division. A tough season saw the Sea Eagles finish with only one victory to their name, a 20 - 18 victory over Rhyl Coasters. Despite the lack of wins, Blackpool competed well in every game, blooding a number of youngsters in the process. In 2009 the club stepped up to the newly created North West Premier. An up and down season saw the club compete well in every game, finishing the season with three victories. In 2010, Blackpool made the decision to take a step down to the North West regional division. A strong season saw the Sea Eagles finish the regular league season with six wins and progress to the divisional grand final, where the club lost out to Mancunians RL 48 - 14.

PlotSetting= Manga artist Kaori Yuki has described the setting of Grand Guignol Orchestra as the \\"Middle Ages (sort of) with a French air.\\" The series takes place in a fictional universe, where a worldwide epidemic of a virus, the , has turned part of the population into , zombies which resemble marionettes. Certain types of music can restore humanity and memories to the guignols while speeding up their destruction; the queen's Grand Orchestra destroys guignols through music, as does the much smaller, unofficial Grand Orchestra. If an area becomes more than seventy percent infected by the virus, the queen sends her to destroy the area and keep the virus from spreading. The virus, however, originates from the first queen, whose father transformed her into a guignol; subsequent queens and their potential successors are grown from her cells. Opposed to the queen's rule is Le S√©nat: consuls and , chancellor , and regent , all of whom have been governing for a century. =Story= The plot follows the unofficial Grand Orchestra led by singer , who searches for a way to rescue his younger sister ‚Äîwho now despises him as the cold-hearted Queen Gemsilica, convinced that he tricked her into becoming queen in his place. The other members include the violence-prone violinist , who was bitten by a guignol; and cellist , a former sculptor of guignols who keeps his daughter's hedgehog with him. They are soon joined by pianist , who has lived under the identity of her twin brother, after a guignol attack left her the only surviving child in her town. They periodically encounter , the unofficial orchestra's former pianist whose violence drove his beloved, Lucille, away and who was resurrected by Le S√©nat after his suicide. Other reoccurring characters include , a spy for the queen who can manipulate her voice and whom Lucille befriended when she snuck into the all-male monastery as a child. The unofficial orchestra visits infected towns and destroys the guignols there for a fee. Eventually, they obtain the , rumoured to be able to destroy the queen and neutralize the virus when performed. Having left Eles behind for her own protection and unaware that she took the Black Oratorio out of fear of its effects on the orchestra, Lucille and his orchestra confront Queen Gemsilica, and find Berthier with a kidnapped Eles and the Black Oratorio. Queen Gemsilica is fatally wounded by their servant . Secretly the host of the original king, Cook is responsible for the manipulation that caused her to become queen instead of Lucille. Berthier, persuaded to return the Black Oratorio, kills Cook as he attempts to escape, and the music of the Black Oratorio is broadcast throughout the world by the satellites formerly used for Divine Lightning. Upon hearing the music, the guignols sing along and are destroyed. Separated from Lucille and the orchestra, Eles realizes that she can live as herself now. Later, she joyfully reunites with Lucille, and rejoins the unofficial orchestra, all of whom have been affected by the neutralization of the virus. Development A sculpture from the Park of the Monsters in Bomarzo, Italy. The park served as the model for the garden which appears in Lucille's memories of his childhood. Yuki noted that the title of the series was potentially misleading, as the orchestra is not composed of guignols; she chose the word \\"guignol\\"‚Äîwhich describes hand puppets, not marionettes‚Äîfor its sound. Page limitations affected the roles of Kohaku and Carnelian, Lucille's castrato rival, although she felt that the story still ended as she had planned it. She also faced difficulty with Berthier's character design. Initially, she planned to have him appear in a \\"full-body animal suit\\" costume, but decided against the idea as \\"too comical.\\" One of his early character designs was used for a minor character, an assassin for Le S√©nat. Included with the bound-volume release of Grand Guignol Orchestra is \\"Camolet Garden\\", Yuki's 92-page romantic one-shot manga originally published in the April 2008 issue of the monthly sh≈çjo (targeted towards girls) manga magazine Bessatsu Hana to Yume. It focuses on Ry≈´, who finds himself in a boys' dormitory, where its inhabitants have ranks corresponding to a deck of playing cards. He struggles to solve the mystery of the boys' dormitory, closed off from the outside world and where death only results in rebirth. In it, Yuki made allusions to the Victorian poem \\"The Lady of Shalott\\" by the English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. In retrospective, she felt that its setting was \\"not really the best,\\" and the many characters presented some difficulty in remembering. Release Written and illustrated by Kaori Yuki, Grand Guignol Orchestra appeared as a serial in Bessatsu Hana to Yume from the August 2008 issue, to the June 2010 issue. Hakusensha collected the eighteen chapters into five bound volumes, and released them from 19 February 2009, to 19 August 2010. At the 2009 New York Anime Festival, Viz Media announced that it had licensed the series and would publish the series under its Shojo Beat imprint. Viz Media published the series from 5 October 2010, to 6 December 2011. It also released a digital version of the series. The series is distributed by Madman Entertainment in Australasia (Australia and New Zealand). It has also been translated into other languages, among them German, Italian, French, and Mandarin. =Volume list=Reception Grand Guignol Orchestra was positively received by English-language readers. Three volumes appeared on the list of the 300 bestselling graphic novels. The first volume sold 464 copies and appeared at the 256th spot in October 2010; it reached the fifteenth spot in BookScan's list of the twenty bestselling graphic novels for September 2011. The second volume sold an estimated 334 copies, and appeared at the 265th spot for February 2011. The fifth volume sold an estimated 297 copies, and appeared at the 267th spot. Writing for School Library Journals blog Good Comics for Kids, Snow Wildsmith reviewed the first volume positively, and wrote, \\"The elements her fans adore are all there: beautiful characters, gender ambiguity, horror themes, blood and gore, and, of course, gorgeous costumes.\\" According to Wildsmith, the unexplained aspects of the plot helped to create interest for the readers. David Welsh of Comic World News had more mixed feelings about the first volume; although he praised the aesthetic, premise, translation, and guignols, he wrote that Yuki's work would be more appealing \\"if she could just strike that balance between creative focus and intellectual abandon and emotional shamelessness.\\" About.com's Deb Aoki reviewed it negatively, criticizing its plot. Aoki wrote that it would only appeal to fans of Yuki. While finding aspects of the setting and costume design historically confusing and trying on the reader's suspension of disbelief, Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network wrote that the Gwin's backstory, the quick pacing, Yuki's detailed art, and her frightening portrayal of zombies made the third volume \\"a winning entry in an already fascinating series.\\" Silverman had mixed feelings about the dense page layouts: according to her, they contributed to the narrative suspense, although they affected the reader's ability to easily read the volume in places. In her review of the fourth volume, Silverman praised the character development and Yuki's ability to create mysteries, although she wrote that not all readers would enjoy the numerous plot twists. She also suggested the possibility of a metaphor for the French Revolution in the series. Another reviewer for Anime News Network, Carlo Santos gave the third volume a C-; while he praised Yuki's illustrations and ability to create \\"dramatic revelations,\\" he wrote that it was overshadowed by the confusing and cluttered narrative. Sequential Tarts Sheena McNeil reviewed the series positively, with Yuki's art, characterization, and storytelling a source of praise. She, however, expressed her feelings of annoyance and frustration with the conclusion of the fourth volume, which saw the female characters left behind on purpose by the male members of the orchestra and then Eles' kidnapping by Berthier. She also wrote that Yuki's inclusion of a happy ending felt surprising compared to the rest of the story. Reviewing \\"Camelot Garden\\", she enjoyed it less than Grand Guignol Orchestra, and wrote that the short story contained an implicit reference to Lewis Carroll's children's novel Through the Looking Glass (1871) and its character, the ever-sleeping Red King.

The males are and the females long. The female is covered with fox-red hair on the dorsal surface of its thorax and abdomen and black hair on its head and ventral surface. The male is less distinctive, being clad in golden-brown or reddish-brown hairs, with some long white hairs on the face, and a tooth on each of the mandibles. The tawny mining bee lives in Europe, ranging from the Balkans to southern Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and Ireland. It lives among short vegetation in light woodlands and dry grasslands, and also in parks and gardens. It is widely distributed but has a low population density. It is present in lowland England and Wales and at a few sites in southern Scotland. In Ireland it is known only from County Kilkenny, and may be regionally extinct there. The tawny mining bee flies from March until May. It prefers to fly to a range of different nectar-producing and pollen-bearing plants; these include beech (Fagus sylvatica), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), buttercup (Ranunculus sp.), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), gooseberry (Ribes uva-crispa), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), holly (Ilex aquifolium), maple (Acer sp.), oak (Quercus sp.), plum (Prunus domestica), sallow (Salix sp.), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and wayfaring- tree (Viburnum lantana). Mining bee nest entrance and soil spoil heap It mates in spring, after which the male dies and the female starts to build a nest. Sometimes more than a hundred females build nests in a few square metres but the tawny mining bee normally does not create a colony, each female having her own nest. The tawny mining bee is therefore classified amongst solitary and communal bees. The nest is a vertical shaft deep, with several brood cells branching off it. The female fills these cells with a mixture of nectar and pollen, on which she lays one egg in each cell. The larva hatches within a few days, grows quickly and pupates within a few weeks. The adults emerge in spring after hibernation. Female Tawny Mining Bee collecting pollen from a Blackcurrant flower.

Ambrosii was born in 1791 in Maistra, at that time part of the Ottoman Empire. He was of Greek origin. He became a bishop in 1835, and converted to the Old Believers in 1846, thus establishing a full Church Hierarchy of the Old Believers. This hierarchy became known as the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy.  Early life  Ambrosii was born Andreas Popovic in 1791 in Maistra, at that time part of the Ottoman Empire. He was of Greek origin. In 1811, Popovic married, and shortly after was ordained as a priest by Metropolitan Matthew. In 1814 he lost his wife, who had given birth to a son, named George after his grandfather. In 1817 he was elected Igumen (abbot) of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity on the island of Halki. Patriarch Constantine had him locum tenens of the patriarchal Greek Church in 1827. As is clear from a document dated 9 September 1835, he was ordained as a bishop of Sarajevo in Bosnia by Patriarch Gregory VI, assisted by four other bishops. He remained in his position for five years before being removed by the Ottoman authorities. In Vienna, the Minister of Interior, Count Kolovrat, and Archduke Ludwig prepared the way for permission to be given by Ferdinand in 1844 to invite a foreign bishop to establish his headquarters in Belaya Krinitsa, to serve the needs of the Old Believers in the domains of the Empire. There existed for generations communities of Old Believers in Turkey who were European refugees from the persecutions in Russia, and it was a natural place to search for a bishop in order to establish an independent full Church Hierarchy. Osip Semenovich Goncharov, Ataman of the Nekrasov Cossacks, established contact between Bishop Ambrosii and two Russian monks, Pavel and Alimpii, who were searching for an orthodox bishop willing to join the Old Believers. A Serb, Costantino Efimovic, acted as an interpreter between Bishop Ambrosii and the monks. Pavel and Alimpii examined the orthodox beliefs of Ambrosii, who presented documents from the Patriarch of Constantinople which confirmed his canonical status. Bishop Ambrosii and his son then took time to investigate the status of the Russian Orthodox Old canonry, before giving his consent on 15 April 1846.\\"Background on the Old Rite\\", Church of the Nativity, Erie, Pennsylvania  Conversion to the Old Faith  After a trip along the Danube, Bishop Ambrosii, Pavel and Alimpii arrived in Tulcea, in modern-day Romania, where 500 Nekrasov Cossacks, together with the monks of the monastery of Slavo-Rus, their Father and Igumen Makarii Arkadii Lavrentiyevskii, presented the Metropolitan the traditional tokens of hospitality: bread with salt. The government requested and obtained from the Patriarchate of Constantinople a favourable report on the bishop, before giving him permission to establish his residence in their domains. After a meeting to discuss the procedure for settlement of Ambrosii, on 28 October 1846 he held the office Vigil in honour of St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker. The following day, after having read the usual confession of faith in Slavonic, Bishop Ambrosii was accepted according to Canon 95 of the Sixth Ecumenical Council. The priest monk Ieronim, with the blessing of the first and the new Metropolitan of Belaya Krinitsa and all the Russian Old Believers, began the Divine Liturgy, celebrated by Ambrosii. The bishop read the prayers in his native language, Greek, but the deacon and the choir used Slavonic. Due to the absence of two other bishops, he used two archpriests, a procedure already used before in the history of the Church in cases of necessity, and described in some lives of saints. In August 1847 there was the ordination of Bishop Arkadii by Salvo-Rus, an ancient seat of an Orthodox monastery at Tulcea. The Russian Foreign Ministry threatened to retaliate against the Roman Catholic government of the Habsburg Empire, if it did not withdraw the permission to the Old Believers to establish their own Metropolia in their lands. The Holy Synod, by which the Tsar had controlled the State Church since the abolition of the Patriarchate under Peter I, likewise threatened to cut all financial assistance from the Patriarchate of Constantinople, if it did not do everything in its power to induce the Metropolitan Ambrosii to change its position. Metropolitan Ambrosii, however, refused. The Old Believers convinced him that the system of the Holy Synod, established in 1700 by Peter I to check the status of the church in place of the patriarch, was not canonical. By decree of Tsar Paul I, the Russian rulers had declared \\"the Church\\" and all the bishops of the church had been obliged to honour an oath to that effect.  Exile and death  In response to diplomatic pressure, the Austrian-Hungarian authorities closed the monastery of Belaya Krinitsa on 3 March 1848, and Metropolitan Ambrosii was sent into exile in Tzill in Styria. After the outbreak of revolutions in Vienna, and with the assistance of Count Kolovrat, the monastery of Belaya Krinitsa was reopened at the end of 1848, though the Metropolitan had to remain in exile. His successor was Antonii (Shutov), who became the first Old Believers' Archbishop of Moscow. Metropolitan Ambrosii lived fifteen years in exile and suffered from his isolation. Nonetheless he had assisted the Old Believers in their goal to establish a full Church Hierarchy, which he saw as the Will of God. On 28 October 1863 he sent his last official act as primate of the Russian Old Believer Archbishop Antonii and all the bishops under his jurisdiction. The document begins with the words: \\"For the mercy of God, the humble Archbishop and Metropolitan of all the Old-Rite Orthodox, Ambrosii.\\" In the text he expresses regret that he had lived so far away from his flock, and that his health did not allow him to do more, but that he remained open to discuss any issue relating to the church people under his spiritual care. This document clearly refuted allegations from some enemies of the Old Faith that wanted people to believe that the Holy Metropolitan had eventually rejected his flock. Metropolitan Ambrosii died in 1863. Metropolitan Kirill held his funeral at Belaya Krinitsa monastery, but the Metropolitan was buried in the Greek-Orthodox cemetery of Trieste.  Investigation by the Patriarchate of Constantinople  In 1899 the Patriarch of Constantinople established a commission to investigate the issue of Metropolitan Ambrosii and his acceptance of the primacy of the Russian Old Orthodox Church. The committee issued a decree of recognition of the hierarchy established by Metropolitan Ambrosii. This decree met with disapproval from Constantine Pobedonostsev, Ober-Procurator of the Most Holy Synod.  Canonization  At a joint synod held at the Monastery of Belaya Krinitsa 150 years after its acceptance of the primacy, Metropolitan Ambrosii was canonized on 11 November 1996, in the presence of both his successors, Metropolitan Leontii of Belaya Krinitsa and the Metropolitan Alimpii of Moscow and All Russia. The day of his feast was assigned to October 30 (November 12, according to the new calendar) each year. On 18/31 May 2000 Ambrosii's remains were exhumed and transferred from Trieste to Braila, Romania. Some years later, the monks Pavel and Alimpii were also canonized by the Old Believers.

As with the term hyperparameter, the use of hyper is to distinguish it from a prior distribution of a parameter of the model for the underlying system. They arise particularly in the use of conjugate priors. For example, if one is using a beta distribution to model the distribution of the parameter p of a Bernoulli distribution, then: * The Bernoulli distribution (with parameter p) is the model of the underlying system; * p is a parameter of the underlying system (Bernoulli distribution); * The beta distribution (with parameters Œ± and Œ≤) is the prior distribution of p; * Œ± and Œ≤ are parameters of the prior distribution (beta distribution), hence hyperparameters; * A prior distribution of Œ± and Œ≤ is thus a hyperprior. In principle, one can iterate the above: if the hyperprior itself has hyperparameters, these may be called hyperhyperparameters, and so forth. One can analogously call the posterior distribution on the hyperparameter the hyperposterior, and, if these are in the same family, call them conjugate hyperdistributions or a conjugate hyperprior. However, this rapidly becomes very abstract and removed from the original problem.  Purpose  Hyperpriors, like conjugate priors, are a computational convenience ‚Äì they do not change the process of Bayesian inference, but simply allow one to more easily describe and compute with the prior. = Uncertainty = Firstly, use of a hyperprior allows one to express uncertainty in a hyperparameter: taking a fixed prior is an assumption, varying a hyperparameter of the prior allows one to do sensitivity analysis on this assumption, and taking a distribution on this hyperparameter allows one to express uncertainty in this assumption: \\"assume that the prior is of this form (this parametric family), but that we are uncertain as to precisely what the values of the parameters should be\\". = Mixture distribution = More abstractly, if one uses a hyperprior, then the prior distribution (on the parameter of the underlying model) itself is a mixture density: it is the weighted average of the various prior distributions (over different hyperparameters), with the hyperprior being the weighting. This adds additional possible distributions (beyond the parametric family one is using), because parametric families of distributions are generally not convex sets ‚Äì as a mixture density is a convex combination of distributions, it will in general lie outside the family. For instance, the mixture of two normal distributions is not a normal distribution: if one takes different means (sufficiently distant) and mix 50% of each, one obtains a bimodal distribution, which is thus not normal. In fact, the convex hull of normal distributions is dense in all distributions, so in some cases, you can arbitrarily closely approximate a given prior by using a family with a suitable hyperprior. What makes this approach particularly useful is if one uses conjugate priors: individual conjugate priors have easily computed posteriors, and thus a mixture of conjugate priors is the same mixture of posteriors: one only needs to know how each conjugate prior changes. Using a single conjugate prior may be too restrictive, but using a mixture of conjugate priors may give one the desired distribution in a form that is easy to compute with. This is similar to decomposing a function in terms of eigenfunctions ‚Äì see Conjugate prior: Analogy with eigenfunctions. = Dynamical system = A hyperprior is a distribution on the space of possible hyperparameters. If one is using conjugate priors, then this space is preserved by moving to posteriors ‚Äì thus as data arrives, the distribution changes, but remains on this space: as data arrives, the distribution evolves as a dynamical system (each point of hyperparameter space evolving to the updated hyperparameters), over time converging, just as the prior itself converges.

Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 2006, 17 different albums topped the chart, based on electronic point of sale data provided by SoundScan Inc. The year both began and ended with Carrie Underwood's album Some Hearts at number one. Underwood had won the fourth season of TV singing competition American Idol in 2005, and Some Hearts, her debut album had reached number one in December of that year. In the issue of Billboard dated January 7, it spent its fifth week at number one, and occupied the top spot for 11 of the first 13 weeks of the year, its time atop the listing being interrupted for one week by Josh Turner's Your Man and for one week by Alan Jackson's Precious Memories. In December, shortly after it was named Album of the Year at the 2006 Billboard Music Awards, Some Hearts returned to number one, more than eight months after it had last occupied the top spot, and remained there for the final three weeks of the year. It was the best-selling album of 2006 in the US, and such was its enduring popularity that it was the biggest-selling country music album of both 2006 and 2007. Alan Jackson was the only act to achieve more than one number one in 2006; following the single week he spent at number one with Precious Memories in March, he returned to number one in October with Like Red on a Rose. Three acts reached number one for the first time in 2006: Josh Turner with Your Man in February, Rodney Atkins with If You're Going Through Hell in August and Kellie Pickler, like Carrie Underwood a former American Idol finalist, with Small Town Girl in November. Johnny Cash, who had died in 2003, had a posthumous number one in July with American V: A Hundred Highways. It was his first chart-topper since 1971. The album also reached number one on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart, as did Me and My Gang by Rascal Flatts and Taking the Long Way by the Dixie Chicks. Despite being the year's biggest-selling album of any genre, Carrie Underwood's Some Hearts could only peak at number two on the Billboard 200. Me and My Gang spent 13 weeks atop the country listing, the most by any album during 2006. In November, Alabama, one of the most successful country music acts of the 1980s, ended another lengthy absence from the top of the country albums chart when Songs of Inspiration became the band's first number one since 1989. Chart history Small Town Girl was the first number one for Kellie Pickler. Carrie Underwood spent 14 weeks at number one in 2006, the most by any act. Johnny Cash (pictured in 1970) had a posthumous number one with American V: A Hundred Highways. Alan Jackson was the only act to achieve more than one number one in 2006. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" !scope=colIssue date !scope=colTitle !scope=colArtist(s) !scope=col class=unsortableRef. - !scope=row rowspan=5 Some Hearts rowspan=5 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  Your Man  align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=4Some Hearts  rowspan=4 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  Precious Memories  align=center - !scope=row rowspan=2 Some Hearts rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  Precious Memories  align=center - !scope=row  Reflected: Greatest Hits Vol. 2  align=center - !scope=row rowspan=7 Me and My Gang  rowspan=7Rascal Flatts align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row rowspan=6 Taking the Long Way rowspan=6 Dixie Chicks align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row rowspan=2 American V: A Hundred Highways rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  If You're Going Through Hell  align=center - !scope=row rowspan=3 Me and My Gang  rowspan=3Rascal Flatts align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row rowspan=2 Dangerous Man rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row rowspan=3 Me and My Gang rowspan=3 Rascal Flatts align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  Live: Live Those Songs Again  align=center - !scope=row  Like Red on a Rose  align=center - !scope=row  It Just Comes Natural  align=center - !scope=row  Take the Weather with You  align=center - !scope=row  Long Trip Alone  align=center - !scope=row  Songs of Inspiration  Alabama align=center - !scope=row  Small Town Girl  align=center - !scope=row rowspan=3 Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing rowspan=3 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row rowspan=3 Some Hearts rowspan=3 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center } References 2006 United States Country Albums ","title":"List of Top Country Albums number ones of 2006"},{"id":"21761904","text":"Terig Tucci Terig Tucci (June 23, 1897 ‚Äì February 28, 1973) was an Argentine composer, violinist, pianist, and mandolinist.

Carter's constant was derived for a spinning, charged black hole by Australian theoretical physicist Brandon Carter in 1968. Carter's constant along with the energy, axial angular momentum, and particle rest mass provide the four conserved quantities necessary to uniquely determine all orbits in the Kerr‚ÄìNewman spacetime (even those of charged particles). Formulation Carter noticed that the Hamiltonian for motion in Kerr spacetime was separable in Boyer‚ÄìLindquist coordinates, allowing the constants of such motion to be easily identified using Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The Carter constant can be written as follows: ::C = p_{\\\\theta}^{2} + \\\\cos^{2}\\\\theta \\\\Bigg( a^{2}(m^{2} - E^{2}) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{L_z}{\\\\sin\\\\theta} \\\\right)^{2} \\\\Bigg), where p_{\\\\theta} is the latitudinal component of the particle's angular momentum, E is the energy of the particle, L_z is the particle's axial angular momentum, m is the rest mass of the particle, and a is the spin parameter of the black hole. Because functions of conserved quantities are also conserved, any function of C and the three other constants of the motion can be used as a fourth constant in place of C. This results in some confusion as to the form of Carter's constant. For example it is sometimes more convenient to use: ::K = C + (L_z - a E)^{2} in place of C. The quantity K is useful because it is always non- negative. In general any fourth conserved quantity for motion in the Kerr family of spacetimes may be referred to as \\"Carter's constant\\".  As generated by a Killing tensor  Noether's theorem states that all conserved quantities are related to spacetime symmetries. Carter's constant is related to a higher order symmetry of the Kerr metric generated by a second order Killing tensor field K (different K than used above). In component form: :: C = K^{\\\\mu u}u_{\\\\mu}u_{ u} , where u is the four-velocity of the particle in motion. The components of the Killing tensor in Boyer‚ÄìLindquist coordinates are: ::K^{\\\\mu u}=2\\\\Sigma\\\\ l^{(\\\\mu}n^{ u)} + r^2 g^{\\\\mu u}, where g^{\\\\mu u} are the components of the metric tensor and l^\\\\mu and n^ u are the components of the principal null vectors: :l^\\\\mu = \\\\left(\\\\frac{r^2 + a^2}{\\\\Delta},1,0,\\\\frac{a}{\\\\Delta}\\\\right) :n^ u = \\\\left(\\\\frac{r^2 + a^2}{2\\\\Sigma},-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{2\\\\Sigma},0,\\\\frac{a}{2\\\\Sigma}\\\\right) with : \\\\Sigma = r^2 + a^2 \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\ \\\\Delta = r^2 - r_{s} \\\\ r + a^2.  Schwarzschild limit  The spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild metric for non-spinning black holes allows one to reduce the problem of finding the trajectories of particles to three dimensions. In this case one only needs E, L_z, and m to determine the motion; however, the symmetry leading to Carter's constant still exists. Carter's constant for Schwarzschild space is: ::C = p_{\\\\theta}^{2} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{L_z}{\\\\sin\\\\theta}\\\\right)^{2}. By a rotation of coordinates we can put any orbit in the \\\\theta=\\\\pi/2 plane so p_{\\\\theta}=0. In this case C = L_z^2, the square of the orbital angular momentum.

He was persecuted during the Second World War and fled to the United Kingdom. After his death his significant poetic output fell into obscurity, but has been rediscovered in recent decades. Several of his poems have been set to music.  Biography  Theodor Kramer was born on 1 January 1897. His father was the village doctor of Niederhollabrunn in the Weinviertel region of Lower Austria. After completing his secondary education with the matura examination he served as an officer in the Austrian army until the end of the war. After the war, he began to study Germanic philology and governmental studies, but curtailed his university education to work as a civil servant and later a book retailer. From 1931 he earned his living by writing. His literary output, almost exclusively poetry, brought him significant success and he became well known in the German-speaking world. After the Anschluss with Nazi Germany, Kramer ‚Äì a Jew and Social Democrat ‚Äì was forbidden to work. In 1939 he was able against all the odds to secure emigration to the United Kingdom, first for his wife and then for himself. From 1940 to 1941 he was imprisoned as an enemy alien. In 1943 he started work as a college librarian in Guildford. In 1946 he took British citizenship, and stayed in the same job until 1957. He was on the governing body of the Austrian PEN club, an association of persecuted writers. He was in close contact with other members of the club like Elias Canetti, Erich Fried and Hilde Spiel. In the 1950s he gradually withdrew from social contact and his health deteriorated. In 1957 he was recalled to Vienna, where he received an honorary pension. He died in Vienna on 3 April 1958 and was buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery (30B - 1- 2) in a grave of honour (a grave given to particularly significant citizens). Kramer's work was soon forgotten. His lyrical yet unromantic poetry draws its power and poetic quality from its depiction of outsiders: members of the proletariat, tramps, craftsmen, servants and whores. Kramer wrote sensitive poetic portraits of people and landscapes. His literary influences were Georg Trakl and Bertolt Brecht. Kramer's oeuvre consists of 10,000 works, many of which remain unpublished. Thomas Mann called him, \\"one of the greatest poets of the young generation,\\" and Stefan Zweig and Carl Zuckmayer promoted his writing. Yet the eighteen years of his exile in the United Kingdom were sufficient to allow his work to fall into obscurity, at least amongst the general reading public. From the end of the 1970s, the interpretations of his poetry by the German folk duo Zupfgeigenhansel contributed significantly to the rediscovery of Kramer. In recent years the Berlin singer Hans-Eckardt Wenzel has released two albums of Kramer's poems set to music, which has revived interest in the poet in the German-speaking world. In her 1996 book, In der Falle, Nobel Prize-winning author Herta M√ºller analyzed Kramer's autobiographical poetry in the context of dictatorship.

Born in Los Angeles, California, Sandy Graham rode in pre-1940 when jockeys had no union representation and at a time when they were the contracted legal property of a racing stable owner who bore no responsibility for their job safety. Riding horses at their fastest speed possible was dangerous work and technology at the time meant a jockey's only protection from a head injury in a racing accident was a cardboard skullcap without a chin strap to secure it in place. In the autumn of 1927, Sandy Graham was competing at the Polo Park Racetrack in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. On September 1, he was running ahead of the field aboard a colt named Vesper Lad when the horse stumbled and threw him to the ground. Trampled by other oncoming horses, Graham's back was broken and his chest was crushed. With no ambulance service available, he lay on the track until several jockeys carried him to the tack room. Stablemate and close friend Tommy Luther pleaded with racetrack officials to take Graham to a hospital but to no avail. His fellow jockeys could not help, as they were under contract to race and were afraid of the consequences if they left the track to get him medical attention. According to a February 24, 2001 Thoroughbred Times recount of the event, Luther begged officials to take the stricken boy to a hospital, but no one would. The riders could not do it themselves, as each was obligated to ride in upcoming races, and to leave the jockey's room would probably have cost them their livelihoods. Desperate to do something to aide his injured friend, Tommy Luther took up a collection to pay for a taxi. However, at a time when most jockeys did not receive a share of the race purse, they did not have enough money among them to pay the cab fare. All afternoon Luther stayed with his suffering friend, unable to do anything more than drip water into his parched mouth. At the end of the day's racecard, someone finally offered to drive Graham to the hospital but by then it made little difference and he died ten days later. The sixteen-year-old Sandy Graham had no savings and there was no life insurance provided by either his employer or the race track. His impoverished family could not afford to have his remains returned home to Los Angeles, and as such he was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave in the Brookside Cemetery in Winnipeg. Sandy Graham's story was told by author Laura Hillenbrand in her 2001 number one bestselling book, Seabiscuit: An American Legend (pp. 69‚Äì70). The publicity Graham's death received as a consequence of the book's popularity, and the ensuing success of the 2003 film Seabiscuit resulted in a new headstone being erected at his grave. The bottom of the stone reads: \\"Remembered By His Fellow Jockeys\\". Slaid Cleaves also brought to life the story in a song \\"Quick as Dreams\\" on his 2004 album Wishbone.

Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 2005, 21 different albums topped the chart, based on electronic point of sale data provided by SoundScan Inc. In the issue of Billboard dated January 1, Shania Twain's album Greatest Hits was at number one, its sixth week in the top spot. It remained at number one through the issue dated February 5, after which it was displaced by Kenny Chesney's Be as You Are (Songs from an Old Blue Chair). Chesney was the only act to achieve more than one number one, as he would return to the top of the chart in November with The Road and the Radio. Toby Keith spent the highest cumulative total number of weeks at number one in 2005, topping the chart for seven non- consecutive weeks with Honkytonk University. The album's time at number one was interrupted by George Strait's Somewhere Down in Texas, which made Strait the first act to achieve 20 number ones on the Top Country Albums chart. Somewhere Down in Texas also topped the all-genre Billboard 200 chart, as did both of Chesney's albums and Fireflies by Faith Hill. Several acts reached number one on the Top Country Albums chart for the first time in 2005, including comedian Larry the Cable Guy, who spent four weeks atop the chart with The Right to Bare Arms, a live recording of one of his stand-up comedy performances. The album entered the country chart despite consisting almost entirely of spoken-word performance rather than music; previous albums by the performer and other \\"redneck\\"-styled comedians such as Jeff Foxworthy and Bill Engvall had also been deemed eligible for the country albums chart. Five other acts topped the chart in 2005 for the first time: Miranda Lambert with Kerosene in April, Dierks Bentley with Modern Day Drifter in May, Sara Evans with Real Fine Place and Gary Allan with Tough All Over, both in October, and Carrie Underwood with Some Hearts, which reached number one in December and was the year's final chart-topper. Underwood had won the fourth season of TV singing competition American Idol earlier in the year, and Some Hearts, her debut album, would go on to be a major success, becoming the best-selling album of 2006 in the US. Such was its enduring popularity that it was the biggest-selling country music album of both 2006 and 2007. Miranda Lambert had also risen to prominence via a TV singing contest, having finished in third place on the first season of Nashville Star in 2003. Chart history Real Fine Place was the first number one for Sara Evans. American Idol winner Carrie Underwood topped the chart with her debut album Some Hearts. Gary Allan had his first chart-topper with Tough All Over.

Both countries are full members of APEC. Russia has an embassy in Manila, while the Philippines has an embassy in Moscow, and two honorary consulates (in Saint Petersburg and Vladivostok). HistoryEarly history= Russia had been interested in developing ties with states in Southeast Asia as early as 19th century. The Russian Empire's interest in establishing relations with Southeast Asian countries stemmed from its need to ensure food and raw supply security in the Russian Far East as communication between the far eastern part of Russia and its European side is significantly difficult. Under Russian Emperor Alexander I, Russia's first diplomatic mission in Southeast Asia, specifically in Manila, was established A strategy to \\"explore the Far East via India and the Philippines to establish trade links\\" was suggested to Peter the Great by the Siberia Governor Fydor I. Semyonov in 1722. In 1813, Russian Emperor Alexander I supported a plan created by Peter Dobell on trade and development with Southeast Asian states. Dobell was an Irish-born American businessman who resided in Southeast Asia. He was the first to initiate the promotion of relations with the Russian Far East, particularly the Kamchatka peninsula region. Russia finally decided to establish its first diplomatic mission in Southeast Asia in 1817 - a Consulate General in Manila. Peter Dobell became a naturalized citizen and took the name Petr Vasilievich Dobel and was appointed as the Consul General in the Philippines. Establishing a formal Russian diplomatic mission was not easy as hoped because Spain's colonial government refused to recognize the Russian mission in Manila. However, a compromise was reached with Petr Valsilievich Dobel being allowed to stay and act in Manila as an unofficial representative of Russia in the Philippines. The Consulate General began operations at the end of the 19th century, but it was not run by the Russians but rather by mostly French merchants also known as \\"freelance consuls\\". This type of Consulate operations continued until 1917. =Cold War era= The Russian Empire became the Soviet Union after the October Revolution and contacts between Soviet Russia and the Philippines were maintained through Comintern, Profintern and the Communist Party of the United States (since the Philippines was then a colony of the United States). Due to the restrictive policy of the American colonial administration of the Philippines against Communists, the relations between the Philippines and the Soviet Union gradually waned. The diplomatic ties of the Philippines and the Soviet Union was reinitiated by President Ferdinand Marcos' Executive Secretary Alejandro Melchor Jr. and his then-aide-de-camp Major Jose T. Almonte through the help of Professor Ajit Singh Rye of the Institute of Asian Studies in the University of the Philippines. It was through Professor Rye that Secretary Melchor and Major Almonte were able to pave way for an endorsement to Indira Gandhi for a dialogue with Moscow. At the time, the Philippines had been considered the United States' strongest ally in Southeast Asia and a reliable partner during the Cold War. However, the Marcos administration believed that the United States was going to lose the Vietnam War, and thus saw the need to establish ties with the \\"enemy.\\" With one visit to New Delhi in 1975, Major Almonte met with the Soviet Ambassador, which then led to a flight by Secretary Melchor and Major Almonte to the Kremlin where they were received as state guests. This meeting led to the creation of formal ties between the Philippines and the USSR in 1976. In 1980, President Ferdinand Marcos with his wife Imelda Marcos met Yuri Andropov's Acting Chairman of the Presidium of the Soviet Union Vasily Kuznetsov during a conference meeting in Moscow. =After the collapse of the Soviet Union= When the dissolution of the Soviet Union was formalized on December 26, 1991, the Philippines formally recognized the Russian Federation, the Soviet state's successor, on December 28, 1991. =Duterte Administration= During the administration of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Russo-Philippine relations have advanced vastly. As reported by Russia's ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev, \\"During the last two years, our two countries concluded more documents on bilateral cooperation in different fields than the previous 40 years.\\" Bilateral relationsEconomic relations=Filipino migration to Russia Former Philippine president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo with then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in St. Petersburg for the 2009 International Economic Forum. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines during the APEC summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, November 10, 2017 Filipino economic migrants began to flock to Russia in the early 2000s. In 2004, 2,010 Filipino nationals were registered to be staying in Russia. In 2013, that number increased to 4,335 according to statistics from the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO). However, the estimated total becomes about 8,000 Filipinos in Russia when illegal immigrants are taken into account. About 93% of all Filipinos in Russia are in Moscow. Many Overseas Filipino Workers in Russia has professional training but most of them work in the household service sector as cleaners, cooks, drivers and nannies. The PH Department of Foreign Affairs counted \\"around 6,000 Filipinos living and working in Russia as of June 2017.\\" Due to a sharp increase in the number of Filipino nationals being sought to work in private homes throughout Russia, the Philippine Government has deemed it necessary to impose new requirements on the direct hiring of Filipino housekeepers and nannies in Russia in order to secure their well-being through placement in qualified households as well as ensure the engagement of only competent staff. Vehicle-purchases from Russia Talks are also underway to make the Russian truck brand Kamaz available in the Philippines via the Philippine company Lifetruck International Inc. The signed memorandum of understanding anticipates the supply of at least 1,000 trucks before the end of 2020. \\"The parties have provisionally negotiated supplies of dump trucks, long-haul trucks and platform trucks at the recent stage\\", but they \\"will further agree upon a specific schedule of project implementation, the model range of Kamaz trucks for the Philippine market and subsequent activities\\". Lifetruck \\"will support promotion of Russian trucks in its turn. The agreement also contemplates establishment and development of the dealership network and service centers of Kamaz throughout Philippines\\". Lifetruck is listed in Kamaz's website as its sole Philippines-based dealer, distributor, and service center. If Kamaz thrives in the backdrop of Pres. Duterte's extensive, nationwide Build, Build, Build! project, Kamaz's success may encourage other Russian vehicle companies to enter the Philippine market. Agricultural trade between Russia and the Philippines The Philippine Department of Agriculture is planning trade mission to Moscow in order to investigate the untapped, unexplored Russian market. The hope is of signing an Implementing Agreement (IA) with the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, with the IA based on the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) signed between the 2 agricultural authorities during Pres. Duterte (and cabinet)'s May 2017 abruptly-cut visit to Moscow. Under the MOA, Russia is to import $2.5 billion (US) in Philippine agriculture, which is significantly more than the $46 million annually exported to Russia currently. \\"[T]he new agreement will identify the areas of engagement between the two countries, including the investments by Russian business groups in the development of agriculture and aquaculture in the Bangsamoro Area.\\"(As of yet, Philippine 3 fishing companies currently export products to Russia.) \\"The planning of the trade mission was primarily prompted by the efforts of the DA to find new markets for its coconut products in the face of very low prices of coco oil in the world market‚Ä¶ [T]he Philippines is interested in importing fertilizers, wheat and modern farm machinery from Russia, while Russia is interested in importing coconut products, bananas and seafood.\\" \\"The first four Russian enterprises have received the right to supply poultry meat to the Philippines\\" starting 12 May 2019. The companies are the \\"Blagodarnensky poultry plant (a branch of the Stavropol Broiler company), the LISCo broiler company, the Vasilyevskaya poultry farm and the Bryansk Broiler.\\" Also, \\"in 2018 the trade turnover between Russia and the Philippines increased threefold to $246 mln. At the same time, exports from Russia to that country increased fivefold to $208 mln. Deliveries of grain to the Philippine market increased almost fivefold last year, to 719,860 tonnes against 155,650 tonnes in 2017.\\" =Security relations= Admiral Panteleyev delivers Russian arms as aid to the Philippine government in the Battle of Marawi. The Office of Defense Attach√© in the Philippine Embassy in Moscow has been headed by Col. Dennis Pastor and with his administrative assistant T/Sgt. Pablito Igne since May 2018. (On 3 September 2019, Moscow sent to the Russian Embassy in Manila Col. Dmitry Nikitin, their 1st defense attach√©, in an effort to strengthen military and technical cooperation with Manila.) Also, Philippine \\"[m]ilitary observers might be deployed to Russia next year to determine what kind of training exercises Filipino troops can participate in.\\" Russia has already invited the Philippines to join its International Counter-Terrorism Database and has \\"conveyed the readiness of the Federal Protective Service of Russia to train members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG)\\", though a Moscow has already administered a VIP Protection Training Program to Manila's 21 PSG personnel sent for training from 27 February-11 March 2017. Russia is interested in selling surface-to-air missile system to the Philippines. In December 2016, Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that the Philippines is interested in purchasing drones and sniper rifles from Russia to modernize the former's military program. On a later date, he also mentioned Russia as a finalist for submarine-procurement for its Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines, specifically the advanced version (Project 636 Varshavyanka) \\"considered to be the most noiseless from among Russian conventional subs\\" and \\"are furnished with modern radar and communications systems, the sonar, 533mm torpedoes and Kalibr cruise missiles\\", as opposed to the original, Soviet-era (Project 877 Paltus) edition. Talks are also underway for the purchase of 10 boats from the Kalashnikov Group that \\"produces the BK-18 multipurpose cutter, the BK-16 transport and landing boat, as well as the BK-10 high-speed assault boat and the BK-9 high-speed amphibious assault cutter\\" aside from its world- famous rifles. Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) technical working groups were sent to Russia \\"look into the Mil-Mi-17 \\"Hip\\" medium helicopter, Kilo- class diesel-electric submarine and other equipment being offered by Russia to the Philippines.\\" On 3‚Äì7 January 2017, two Russian Navy ships ‚Äì the Udaloy- class destroyer and the Boris Chilikin-class fleet oiler Boris Butoma of the Russian Pacific Fleet ‚Äì docked at the Manila South Harbor for a goodwill tour aimed at bolstering Philippines‚ÄìRussia relations, especially in security. On 25 October 2017, the Udaloy-class destroyer delivered \\"20 units of Ural-4320 multi-purpose vehicles; 5,000 units of AKM Kalashnikov assault rifles, one million units 1943-type cartridges with steel core bullets; and 5,000 units of steel helmets\\" to assist Manila's efforts during the Marawi siege. The Philippine Navy (PN) is also preparing its BRP Tarlac (LD-601) for the PN's historic, first-ever port-call to Russia scheduled for Friday 17 September 2018. The port visit to the Russian Pacific Fleet in Vladivostok is estimated to take 8‚Äì10 days and the actual visit to last 5 days. Afterward, it will also participate in the International Fleet Review from in Jeju, South Korea.

The article includes an English translation of the following documents: The Fundamental Law (Qanun-e Asasi-e Mashruteh) of the Iranian Empire of 14th Dhu-‚Äòl-Qa‚Äôdah 1324 (December 30, 1906); The Amendment of the Fundamental Law of the Iranian Empire of 29th Sha‚Äôban 1325 (October 7, 1907). EnghelƒÅb-e Mashr≈´teh), also known as the Constitutional Revolution of Iran, took place between 1905 and 1911. The revolution led to the establishment of a parliament in Persia (Iran) during the Qajar dynasty. The revolution opened the way for fundamental change in Persia, heralding the modern era. It was a period of unprecedented debate in a burgeoning press, and new economic opportunities. Many groups fought to shape the course of the revolution, and all segments of society were in some way changed by it. The old order, which King Nassereddin Shah Qajar had struggled for so long to sustain, was finally replaced by new institutions, new forms of expression, and a new social and political order. King Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar signed the 1906 constitution shortly before his death. He was succeeded by Mohammad Ali Shah, who abolished the constitution and bombarded the parliament in 1908 with Russian and British support. This led to another pro- constitutional movement. The constitutionalist forces marched to Tehran, forced Muhammad Ali Shah's abdication in favor of his young son Ahmad Shah Qajar, and re-established the constitution in 1909. The 1921 Persian coup d'√©tat (Persian: ⁄©ŸàÿØÿ™ÿß€å €≥ ÿßÿ≥ŸÅŸÜÿØ €±€≤€π€π) refers to several major events which led to the establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty as Iran's ruling house in 1925. Iran's parliament amended the 1906‚Äì1907 constitution on December 12, 1925, replacing the 1797‚Äì1925 Qajar dynasty with the Pahlavi dynasty as the legitimate sovereigns of Iran. The revolution was followed by the Jungle Movement of Gilan (1914-1921). History Revolutionary fighters in Tabriz; Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan are in the center. The first Islamic Consultative Assembly (October 7, 1906 - June 23, 1908); chairman MortezƒÅ Qoli Khan Sani od-Dauleh, who had been finance minister for seven months when he was assassinated on 6 February 1911 by two Georgians in Tehran, is in the center.W. Morgan Shuster, The Strangling of Persia, 3rd printing (T. Fisher Unwin, London, 1913), pp. 48, 119, 179. According to Shuster (p. 48), \\"Five days later [measured from February 1st] the Persian Minister of Finance, Saniu'd-Dawleh was shot and killed in the streets of Teheran by two Georgians, who also succeeded in wounding four of the Persian police before they were captured. The Russian consular authorities promptly refused to allow these men to be tried by the Persian Government, and took them out of the country under Russian protection, claiming that they would be suitably punished.\\" With the first provision signed by Muzzafir al-Din days before his death, Iran saw legislative reform vital to their goal of independence from Britain and Russia. The three main groups of the coalition seeking a constitution were the bazaar merchants, the ulama, and a small group of radical reformers. They shared the goal of ending royal corruption and ending dominance by foreign powers. According to the revolutionaries, the role of the shah was being used to keep the Qajar dynasty and other aristocrats wealthy at the expense of Iran's resources and economy. They argued that whilst Iran's oil industry was sold to the British, tax breaks on imports, exports and manufactured textiles destroyed Iran's economy (which had been supported by the bazaar merchants). Muzzafir al-Din accumulated a fortune in foreign debt while selling assets to pay interest, instead of investing in Iran. This sparked the revolt. The new fundamental law created a parliament, the Majles, and gave the legislature final approval of all loans and the budget. More power was divested from the shah with the supplementary fundamental law, which was passed by the National Assembly and signed by the new shah, Mohammad Ali, in October 1907. A committee of five mujtahids was to be created to ensure that new laws were compatible with the sharia. However, the committee never convened. Despite the ulamas efforts at independence from external dominance, Britain and Russia capitalized on Iran's weak government and signed the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention dividing the country between them (with a neutral central zone). This constitutional period ended when the Majlis in Tehran's neutral zone dissolved over the issue of equal rights for non-Muslims; Russia then invaded and captured the city. Although Iran gained a constitution, Iranian independence was not achieved by the revolts. =Background= Sanctuary at the British Embassy, 1906 Weakness and extravagance continued during the brief reign of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar (1896‚Äì1907), who often relied on his chancellor to manage his decentralized state. His dire financial straits caused him to sign many concessions to foreign powers on trade items ranging from weapons to tobacco. The aristocracy, religious authorities, and educated elite began demanding a curb on royal authority and the establishment of the rule of law as their concern about foreign (especially Russian) influence grew. Qajar had taken large loans from Russia and Britain to pay for his extravagant lifestyle and the cost of the government; the shah financed a royal tour of Europe in 1900 by borrowing 22 million from Russia, using Iranian customs receipts as collateral.Mackey, Sandra The Iranians : Persia, Islam and the Soul of a Nation, New York : Dutton, c1996. p.150-55 =First protests= Amir Khan Amir al-Alam treats an injured man after the Triumph of Tehran In 1905, protests erupted about the imposition of Persian tariffs to repay the Russian loan for Mozaffar ad-Din Shah's royal tour. In December of that year, two merchants in Tehran were bastinadoed for price-gouging. The city's merchants rebelled, closing its bazaar. The clergy followed suit as a result of the alliance formed during the Tobacco Protest. The two protesting groups sought sanctuary in a Tehran mosque, but the government entered the mosque and dispersed them. The dispersal triggered a larger movement which sought refuge at a shrine outside Tehran. The shah yielded to the demonstrators on January 12, 1906, agreeing to dismiss his prime minister and transfer power to a \\"house of justice\\" (forerunner of the Iranian parliament). The basti protesters returned from the shrine in triumph, riding royal carriages and hailed by a jubilant crowd. During a fight in early 1906, government forces killed a sayyid (a descendant of Muhammad). In a skirmish shortly afterwards, Cossacks killed 22 protesters and injured 100.Abrahamian, Ervand, Iran Between Two Revolutions, Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 84 The bazaar again closed and the ulama went on strike, a large number taking sanctuary in the holy city of Qom. Many merchants went to the British embassy in Tehran, which agreed to shelter the basti on the grounds of the embassy. =Creation of the constitution= Parliament in 1906 During the summer of 1906, about 12,000 men camped in the gardens of the British embassy in what has been called a \\"vast open-air school of political science\\". Demand for a parliament (majlis) began, with the goal of limiting the power of the shah. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah agreed on a parliament in August 1906, and the first elections were held that fall. One hundred fifty-six members were elected, the overwhelming majority from Tehran and the merchant class. The National Consultative Assembly first met in October 1906. The shah was old and frail, and attending the inauguration of parliament was one of his last official acts. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah's son, Muhammad Ali, was unsympathetic to constitutionalism; the shah signed the constitution (modeled on the Belgian constitution) by December 31, 1906, making his power contingent on the will of the people, and died three days later. =Aftermath= Shah Muhammad Ali, the sixth Qajar shah, came to power in January 1907. The Anglo-Russian Convention, signed in August of that year, divided Iran into a Russian zone in the north and a British zone in the south; the center of the country was neutral. The British switched their support to the shah, abandoning the constitutionalists. In 1908, the shah moved to \\"exploit the divisions within the ranks of the reformers\\" and eliminate the majlis. Persia tried to remain free of Russian influence through resistance (via the majlis) to the shah's policies. Parliament appointed William Morgan Shuster Persia's treasurer-general. Russia issued an ultimatum to expel Shuster and suspend the parliament, occupying Tabriz. Notable participantsConstitutionalists= Poster commemorating the July 1909 Triumph of Tehran.

Other people described in Hindu sacred texts also have the name Sushena. Many Hindu or Buddhist people, especially in India, China, Cambodia, The Maldives, Indonesia and Mongolia are named Su·π£hƒìn or Su·π£hƒìna or Su·π£h—în or Su·π£h—îna. Vishnu sahasranama Vaishnavas consider that Vishnu is the supreme god in the trimurti or Hindu triad. Vishnu sahasranama is one of the most sacred and commonly chanted stotras in Hinduism, and the version found in the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata is the most popular. It lists names that each eulogise one of Vishnu's great attributes. Stanza 58 of the Vishnu sahasranama contains the name su·π£hƒìnah: mahƒÅvarƒÅho govind·∫°h su·π£hƒìnah kanakƒÅngade guhyo gabhƒìro gahan·ªç gupta≈õchakragadƒÅdharah Authorities have different views of the meaning of the word su·π£hƒìnah in this context. The Advaita philosopher Adi Shankaracharya wrote a definitive Sanskrit commentary on the sahasranƒÅma in the 8th century CE which has been particularly influential for many schools of Hinduism. His commentary on Stanza 58 included: \\"Su·π£hƒìnah ‚Äì He who has a charming army. The army of Vishnu is called as His GanƒÅ. They are mainly constituted of great sages and seers and hence, their compelling enchantment.\\" In the 13th century CE, Parasara Bhattar wrote a commentary in Tamil on Vishnu sahasranama from a Vaishnavite viewpoint, giving the opinion that Bhagavan (Vishnu) has a body which is pure suddha-sattva, and the constituents of this pure body are like an army that can win over the jivas (nitya-muktas and baddha-muktas) and make them join him in mutual enjoyment of Bliss.

On May 20, 2009, the Senate bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama. The stated purpose of the act, a product of the 111th United States Congress, was to allow bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages on primary residences, among other purposes; however, that provision was dropped in the Senate and is not included in the version that was eventually signed into law. In addition, the bill amends the Hope for Homeowners Program as well as provide additional provisions to help borrowers avoid foreclosure. On May 20, 2009, President Obama signed the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act into law (), reauthorizing HUD's Homeless Assistance programs. It was included as part of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009. The HEARTH Act allows for the prevention of homelessness, rapid re-housing, consolidation of housing programs, and new homeless categories. In the eighteen months after the bill's signing, HUD must make regulations implementing this new McKinney program.

In late 2009, some homeless advocacy organizations, such as the National Coalition for the Homeless, reported and published perceived problems with the HEARTH Act of 2009 as a HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization bill, especially with regard to privacy, definitional ineligibility, community roles, and restrictions on eligible activities.National Coalition for the Homeless, \\"NCH Public Policy Recommendations: HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization\\", Washington, D.C., September 14, 2009 Legislative history In the wake of the bursting of the United States housing bubble and the collapse of the American subprime mortgage industry, this bill was introduced by Rep. John Conyers (D-Michigan) on February 23, 2009. It was then referred to the House Financial Services Committee, the House Judiciary Committee, and the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. However, on February 25, the House passed a resolution, 224-198, which permitted the Speaker of the House to declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House for exclusive consideration of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, waiving most points of order against consideration of the bill and all points of order against provisions of the bill.H.R.1106: All Legislative Actions, Congressional Record, Library of Congress On February 26, the House considered the bill under the provisions of the resolution passed the previous day, which provided for one hour of general debate. With Rep. Jos√© Serrano (D-New York) designated as chairman of the committee, the House debated the bill for one hour and then left it as unfinished business. On March 5, the House voted to pass the bill, 234-191, with most Democrats supporting the bill and most Republicans opposing it.Roll Call 104, via House.gov The engrossed House legislation was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on March 11, 2009. Similar legislation, and were both introduced on April 27, 2009 since then. On May 6, the Senate passed S.896 on a vote of 91-5. The key difference between H.R.1106 and S.896 is that the latter does not include a controversial cram down provision, which failed to garner majority support in the Senate. On May 19, the House approved an amended version of S. 896 by a 367-54 vote, with one member voting \\"present\\". The Senate promptly approved the House's amendment, and President Obama signed the bill into law the next day. Provisions The Helping Families Save Their Homes Act will:https://www.gop.gov/bill/111/1/hr1106 *Expand eligibility for Chapter 13 bankruptcy by excluding home mortgage debt from the current maximum debt limitations. *Authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to pay out all or some of the balance owed on any Federal Housing Administration- insured loans that are modified under the legislation. *Expand the HOPE for Homeowners program *Provide a legal safe harbor from liability for lenders that enter into loan modifications or workouts with borrowers. (Under current law, lenders that have packaged and sold one or more mortgages to investors as securities may be held liable for losses suffered by the investor as a result of the loan modification.) *Extend increased Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) deposit insurance limits until December 31, 2013.Section 204 of Public Law 111-22, available from Wikisource (The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act temporarily increased the FDIC and NCUA limits from $100,000 to $250,000 in 2008, but those increases were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2009.) =Cram down= H.R. 1106 contains a provision, frequently called \\"cram down,\\" which would allow judges to modify the rights of a mortgage holder, whether that mortgage holder is a primary lender or an investor in a mortgage-backed security, with regard to delinquent mortgages on primary residences if the borrower has entered Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings. Among other modifications, the bill would allow bankruptcy judges to reduce the principal amount contractually owed by the borrower under the original mortgage. Proponents of cram down, chiefly Democrats, have cited studies saying that the provision could have helped 20% of homeowners facing foreclosures stay in their homes.http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/03/saving_american_homes.html This provision drew extensive criticism because it would have allowed borrowers to abdicate their contractual obligation to repay the full amount of their loan. Many argued that cram down would have made it more costly for other individuals to purchase a home because lenders would have had to increase interest rates and down payments to supplement the loss from the loan modification. Opposition to cram down stalled H.R. 1106 and led to the introduction of S.896, which does not include cram down, in its place.

In the issue of Billboard dated January 3, Toby Keith was at number one with Shock'n Y'all, the album's seventh week in the top spot. It occupied the top spot for the first seven weeks of 2004 before being displaced by Kenny Chesney's When the Sun Goes Down, which would go on to spend 14 consecutive weeks at number one, the year's longest unbroken run in the top spot. It also meant that Chesney was the act with most weeks at number one during the year; his figure of 14 weeks atop the chart was nearly twice that achieved by any other act. When the Sun Goes Down was one of five of 2004's Top Country Albums number ones to also reach the top spot on the all-genre Billboard 200 listing, along with releases by Jimmy Buffett, Tim McGraw, Alan Jackson and George Strait. The year's final country chart-topper was Greatest Hits by Shania Twain, which held the top spot for the final five weeks of 2004. Following that album's release, Twain, one of the most successful artists in country music history, would take a lengthy hiatus from the music industry and not release an album of new material until 2017. Four acts reached number one for the first time in 2004. Most notably, in the issue of Billboard dated July 31, Jimmy Buffett gained his first number one with License to Chill after more than 30 years in the music industry. Buffett had first entered the Top Country Albums listing with his major-label debut A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean in 1973 and had placed 10 albums on the chart between then and 1986 without ever reaching number one. After that, although his albums continued to enter the all-genre Billboard 200, he did not return to the country listing until License to Chill entered at number one in July 2004. Gretchen Wilson, Keith Urban, and the duo Big & Rich also reached number one for the first time in 2004 with Here for the Party, Be Here and Horse of a Different Color respectively. Wilson's album recorded the highest first-week sales to date for a debut album by a country musician.

The company was founded by Arturo Ceriani in 1951. Arces is an acronym derived from Arturo Ceriani S.r.l. In the European motorcycle industry, it was common for many smaller parts companies to exist, each responsible for creating individual parts to later be assembled into a complete motorcycle. Within a few years of its creation, Ceriani's company was able to successfully make a name for itself by manufacturing components noted for their quality and vision. In 1964, under the leadership of Arturo's son Enrico Ceriani, the companies operations were expanded. Enrico accelerated the expansion by moving the company to a new and more modern plant in Samarate. From 1964 the company was known within the industry as ARCES (an acronym of ARturo CEriani Samarate) but the brand identity was maintained and the company continued to be known as Ceriani by consumers. A central development in the new plant was the creation of a team that was dedicated to studying and designing new solutions for the suspension systems and frames of competition motorcycles. In the late 1960s, Ceriani began to produce an innovative new type of fork slider made of a light alloy for use in competition and a revolutionary type of telescopic hydraulic suspension that was originally used on motocross bikes but was later applied to street motorcycles. The demand for the new suspension was so high that ARCES output had doubled compared to the year before. The new technology exploded onto the market and by 1972 Ceriani had sold 100,000 suspension units, 30,000 to competition motorcycles and 70,000 to consumer street bikes. In the late 1970s, Ceriani experienced a rapid and unexpected decline during the overall crisis in the European manufacturing sector due to increased demand that stressed the capabilities of smaller companies. Other companies were able to successfully adapt and fill the niche of competition motorcycle parts manufacturing that was left vacant by Ceriani's inability to effectively meet rising demand. Ceriani was not able to recover to the changing market and their plant closed down in 1980. The prestigious Ceriani brand name was bought in 1997 by Italian motorcycle parts maker Paioli.

Since its establishment in 1912, the studios located at the site have been the home of motion picture producers, including Lubin, Essanay, Willis and Inglis, J.D. Hampton, Charles Ray, Ralph Like, Monogram Pictures, Allied Artists, and ColorVision. Since 1970, it has been the home of public television station KCET, but in April 2011 KCET announced that it had sold the facility to the Church of Scientology. Early years In 1912, Siegmund Lubin, a film producer from Philadelphia, built the first film studio on the site of what is now KCET Studios. Lubin's company, called Lubin Manufacturing Company, produced educational films at the site, including \\"An Alligator Farm\\" (1912) and \\"An Ostrich and Pigeon Farm.\\" In 1913, Lubin sold the studio to the Chicago-based Essanay Film Company. Essanay produced 20 one-reel Westerns before selling the site to the Kalem Company. Kalem began operating at the lot in late 1913, and Marshall Neilan began working at the site in the Spring of 1914. The \\"Ham and Bud\\" comedy series was shot there from late 1914 through February 1917. At that time, Kalem relocated to Glendale and abandoned the Fleming Street studios. In 1917, Willis and Inglis acquired the studio and rented space for use by independent producers. Wallis and Inglis build a by outdoor stage and a by indoor stage. During this time, The Marine Film Corporation filmed \\"Lorelei of the Sea\\" at the studios, and comedian Fay Tincher made a series of two-reel comedies there. In August 1918, Jesse D. Hampton began renting space from Willis and Inglis. And in March 1919, Willis and Inglis built another station that became known as Hampton Studio. In April 1919, a trade magazine reported: \\"The entire frontage along Fleming Street, heretofore adorned by a blank wall, is now occupied with a long row of offices filled with workers and other functionaries necessary to the operation of the big place.\\" Hampton made more than 25 films at the site from 1918 to 1920. In 1920, actor Charles Ray purchased the studios and built many of the red brick buildings that still survive at the site. When Ray's new soundstage was completed, Moving Picture News called it \\"the last word in studio construction\\" and noted: \\"Perhaps the most striking feature of the studios is the glass enclosed stage, topped by a glass roof. The sides may be removed to permit openings when the shooting of street scenes is required . . . The placing of a tank beneath the stage was a unique arrangement . . . the installation of electrical equipment will insure a wealth of sunshine for daylight pictures as well as for night scenes.\\" Ray's soundstage remains in use as KCET's Studio A. In 1922, Ray also added a Spanish-style, red brick administration building (pictured in infobox above) that is still in use by KCET. With a budget of $800,000, Ray shot his epic film, The Courtship of Myles Standish, at the site. The most famed extravagance created for the production was a life-size replica of the Mayflower and a pool of water with a mechanism to rock the ship back and forth. The film was a flop at the box office, and by 1923, Charles Ray Productions was bankrupt. After Charles Ray's production company went bankrupt, the Bank of Italy became the receiver for the property and rented studio space to independent producers. The bank changed the studio's address from 1425 Fleming Street to 4401 Sunset Boulevard and renamed it the Sunset Studio. Actress Jean Navelle bought the studio from the bank in 1927, but her production company ceased operations in late 1929, and the studio was returned to the Bank of Italy. Ralph M. Like Ralph M. Like was an engineer who developed a system for recording sound on film. He leased space at the site as far back as 1926, and in 1932, he leased the entire studio for use by his company International Recording Engineers. Like built a new soundstage, the present Stage B, in 1932. In 1933, Like's mother bought the studio from the Bank of Italy. Through the 1930s, many westerns were shot at the studio. In 1937, John Ford directed \\"Hurricane)\\" there. The studio facilities were improved in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and adjoining land was acquired to build dock sets, a city street set, a third sound stage, and a costume department. Monogram Pictures and Allied Artists Brick soundstages built in the 1920s Monogram Pictures began renting space at the studio in the late 1930s and bought the property from Like in 1943. Monogram Pictures was a small studio that made B-Movies. Monogram's features included film series featuring \\"Charlie Chan,\\" the \\"East Side Kids,\\" \\"The Bowery Boys,\\" \\"Bomba, the Jungle Boy,\\" \\"Joe Palooka,\\" \\"The Range Busters,\\" and \\"The Cisco Kid,\\" and westerns featuring Tex Ritter. Allied Artists followed Mongram at the site, where it produced both motion pictures and television programs in the 1950s and 1960s. The motion pictures filmed at the Sunset Boulevard studios during the Mongram and Allied Artists years include the following: * Smart Alecks (1942) with Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Maxie Rosenbloom and Gale Storm * It Happened on Fifth Avenue (1947) with Don DeFore, Ann Harding, Charles Ruggles, Victor Moore, and Gale Storm *Black Gold (1947) with Anthony Quinn *The Babe Ruth Story (1948) starring William Bendix and Claire Trevor * Kidnapped (1948) starring Roddy McDowell * Triggerman (1948) with Johnny Mack Brown * Yukon Gold (1952) with Kirby Grant, Martha Hyer and Chinook: The Wonder Dog *Killer Leopard (1954) with Bomba, the Jungle Boy (Johnny Sheffield) and Beverly Garland * Two Guns and a Badge (1954) with Wayne Morris and Beverly Garland * Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954) starring Neville Brand and Leo Gordon * Shack Out on 101 (1955) with Frank Lovejoy, Terry Moore, Keenan Wynn and Lee Marvin * Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) ‚Äì the science fiction classic directed by Don Siegel *Friendly Persuasion (1956) with Gary Cooper, Dorothy McGuire, and Anthony Perkins * Love in the Afternoon (1957) with Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn * The Oklahoman (1957) with Joel McCrea and Barbara Hale *Queen of Outer Space (1958) with Zsa Zsa Gabor *House on Haunted Hill (1959) with Vincent Price * Al Capone (1959) starring Rod Steiger and Martin Balsam *Sex Kittens Go to College (1960) starring Mamie Van Doren, Tuesday Weld and Martin Milner * El Cid (1961) starring Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren * Tickle Me (1965) with Elvis Presley In 1964, financial difficulties forced Allied Artists to cease production activities and to become a film distribution company. The company moved its operations to New York, and the studios were used mostly for production of television program and commercials from 1964 to 1967. In 1967, ColorVision purchased the studio and continued to rent space for independent productions. ColorVision itself went bankrupt in 1969. KCET In July 1970, the site was purchased by Los Angeles public television station KCET for $800,000. In November 1971, KCET dedicated its renovated $3.2 million studio facilities. At the time, the studios were the largest in public television and were intended to be used as the West Coast production center for public television. In 1975, KCET announced plans to build a new $1.5 million brick administration building on the site. KCET has used the Sunset Boulevard studio facilities to create numerous productions, including Carl Sagan's acclaimed series Cosmos, Steve Allen's Meeting of Minds, California's Gold, and Visiting...with Huell Howser. In 1979, while demonstrating a karate kick, a KCET employee kicked a hole in the wall. A maintenance manager assigned to repair the hole noticed an arched brick wall and column behind the wallboard. The wallboard was removed and uncovered the ornate exterior of a little theater built in the 1920s. The exterior, consisting of two brick facades and six columns, had been built in the silent era and was later covered with wallboard to improve the acoustics for screening sound pictures. In March 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that KCET was in negotiations to sell the studio to the Church of Scientology. On April 25, 2011, KCET confirmed the sale, at an undisclosed price, and with an expectation that KCET would relocate to other production facilities in about one year. The Church of Scientology said that it expected to use the facilities to produce videos and internet content, and would use its satellite uplink facilities for high definition video transmissions.

It is among the best examples of the late Venetian Gothic and was the final residence of Princess Louise of Artois. History and description Detail of the facade. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1969. The edifice was built in the late 15th century, perhaps with the participation of Bartolomeo Bon. The palace consisted originally of two separated sectors, one for each branch of the family, which were later joined by a fa√ßade; these are the Ca' Giustinian dei Vescovi (now housing part of the Ca' Foscari University) and the Ca' Giustinian dalle Zogie (now privately owned). Behind the fa√ßade, they are separated by an alley which, through a sottoportego, or portico-tunnel, connects to the central portal. The two sub-palaces share numerous decorative features with the annexed Ca' Foscari. They have an L-shaped plan with four floors, the upper ones having mullioned windows. At the piano nobile they form a six-arches arcade with an interwoven motif of multi-lobes circles. The single windows are ogival, or decorated with a three- lobe motif. Ca' Giustinian dei Vescovi has in the rear a court with a Gothic staircase, while Ca' Giustinian delle Zogie has a large garden. =Owners and notable residents= The family sold the palazzo in the 19th century. Since then, personalities such as painter Natale Schiavoni, German composer Richard Wagner (who wrote the second act of Tristan und Isolde here between 1858 and 1859), the last Duchess of Parma, Louise d'Artois, and Hungarian violinist Franz von Vecsey have lived here.

Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 2003, 16 different albums topped the chart, based on electronic point of sale data provided by SoundScan Inc. In the issue of Billboard dated January 4, Shania Twain was at number one with Up!, the album's fifth week in the top spot. It spent two weeks atop the listing in 2003 before being displaced by Home by the Dixie Chicks, which regained the peak position having first reached number one in 2002. Home spent fourteen non-consecutive weeks at number one during 2003, making it the year's longest-running chart-topper and the all-female trio the act with the most weeks in the top spot during the year. It was the group's third consecutive album to win the Grammy Award for Best Country Album. The only act to have more than one chart-topping album in 2003 was Toby Keith, who engaged in a public feud with the Dixie Chicks in the early part of the year after the group's lead singer Natalie Maines made controversial comments about then- United States President George W. Bush, which led to many country music radio stations refusing to play their songs. Keith topped the chart with both Unleashed and Shock'n Y'all, which was the final number one of the year. Four acts topped the chart for the first time in 2003. In April, Chris Cagle interrupted the Dixie Chicks' time at number one for a single week and gained his first chart-topper with his eponymous album. In July, another self-titled album gave Buddy Jewell his first number one, two months after he won the first season of the TV singing contest Nashville Star. In July, Trace Adkins reached the top of the chart for the first time with Greatest Hits Collection, Vol. 1, one of several greatest hits albums to reach number one during the year. Two weeks later, Brad Paisley gained his first number one with Mud on the Tires; Paisley would go on to be one of the biggest new country stars of the early 21st century.

From 1998 until his death, he gave lectures at the Japanese Center in Lyon (53, rue de Montesquieu 69007) and in Switzerland, Italy, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. In 1998 he was invited by Radio France to do a special concert in the music festival \\"98 Presence\\". In this experimental concert, Tanaka improvised 24 works live on stage, responding to the images and inspirations of the music played by pianist Thierry Ravassard and composed by twenty French composers such as Gilbert Amy and Pascal Dusapant. Each composer chose one haiku from the 24 poems of the four seasons, and composed according to the image of the poem. This concert gained a good reputation, and three concerts were performed again at the National Supreme Academy of Music in Lyon. Muzzik European Channel decided to make a film of this music project for world-wide release, and beginning production from 2001 to 2002 through four seasons in Japan. In Paris Tanaka collaborated with the musician of crystal sound, Michel Deneuve. He also made some other experimental performances with music, called \\"music and the art of the moment\\" in the Netherlands. He also performed at St. Jean Cathedral in Lyon in December 2000. A concert also took place in October 2001 with two Japanese musicians of the traditional Yokobue (bamboo flute). Tanaka exhibited worldwide and in 2005 he received Kyoto's Art and Culture Award.

Background The International Olive Council (IOC) is an intergovernmental organization based in Madrid, Spain, with 16 member states plus the European Union. It promotes olive oil around the world by tracking production, defining quality standards, and monitoring authenticity. More than 98 percent of the world's olives are grown in IOC member nations.International Olive Council The United States is not a member of the IOC, and the US Department of Agriculture does not legally recognize its classifications (such as extra-virgin olive oil). On October 25, 2011, the United States adopted new olive oil standards, a revision of those that have been in place since 1948, which affect importers and domestic growers and producers by ensuring conformity with the benchmarks commonly accepted in the U.S. and abroad.\\"New U.S. Olive Oil Standards in Effect Today\\" Olive Oil Times The IOC officially governs 95 per cent of international production and holds great influence over the rest. IOC terminology is precise, but it can lead to confusion between the words that describe production and the words used on retail labels. Olive oil is classified by how it was produced, by its chemistry, and by its flavor. All production begins by transforming the olive fruit into olive paste. This paste is then malaxed to allow the microscopic oil droplets to concentrate. The oil is extracted by means of pressure (traditional method) or centrifugation (modern method). After extraction the remnant solid substance, called pomace, still contains a small quantity of oil. The EU regulates the use of different protected designation of origin labels for olive oils. US Customs regulations on \\"country of origin\\" state that if a non-origin nation is shown on the label, then the real origin must be shown on the same side of the label and in comparable size letters so as not to mislead the consumer.Durant, John. US Customs Department, Director Commercial Rulings Division Country of origin marking of imported olive oil; 19 CFR 134.46; \\"imported by\\" language 2000-09-05. United States International Trade Commission Rulings See reference to HQ 560944 ruling of the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on April 27, 1998, \\"blending of Spanish olive oil with Italian olive oil in Italy does not result in a substantial transformation of the Spanish product\\" 2006-02-28. Yet most major US brands continue to put \\"imported from Italy\\" on the front label in large letters and other origins on the back in very small print. These products are a mixture of olive oil from more than one nation and it is not clear what percentage of the olive oil is really of Italian origin. This practice makes it difficult for high quality, lower cost producers outside of Italy to enter the US market, and for genuine Italian producers to compete.  Investigations, incidents, and recalls  With Italian extra-virgin olive oil in high demand with concomitant high prices, adulterated olive oil has become the biggest source of agricultural fraud problems in the European Union.Olive Oil Fraud Rampant as Demand Skyrockets, National Public Radio, August 7, 2007 While less than 10% of world olive oil production meets the criteria for labeling as extra-virgin, it has been estimated that up to 50% of retail oil is labeled \\"extra-virgin\\".Deborah Bogle. ‚ÄúOils ain't oils in the olive grove‚Äù. The Advertiser May 12, 2012, pp. 11‚Äì14. Some oil labeled \\"extra-virgin\\" is diluted with cheaper olive oils or other vegetable oils. In some cases, lampante, or \\"lamp oil,\\" which is made from spoiled olives fallen from trees, is used, even though it can't legally be sold as food. One fraud ring is accused of coloring low-grade soy oil and canola oil with industrial chlorophyll, and flavoring it with beta-carotene. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't routinely test imported olive oil for adulteration, and some products are difficult to test. An article by Tom Mueller in the August 13, 2007, issue of The New Yorker states that major Italian shippers routinely adulterate olive oil and that only about 40% of olive oil sold as \\"extra virgin\\" actually meets the specification.Mueller, Tom. ‚ÄùSlippery Business‚Äù The New Yorker. 2007-08-13. In some cases, colza oil with added color and flavor has been labeled and sold as olive oil.EUbusiness.com This extensive fraud prompted the Italian government to mandate a new labeling law in 2007 for companies selling olive oil, under which every bottle of Italian olive oil would have to declare the farm and press on which it was produced, as well as display a precise breakdown of the oils used, for blended oils. In February 2008, however, EU officials took issue with the new law, stating that under EU rules such labeling should be voluntary rather than compulsory.Eubusiness.com Under EU rules, olive oil may be sold as Italian even if it only contains a small amount of Italian oil. In 1993, the FDA ordered a recall of Rubino U.S.A. Inc., (Cincinnati, Ohio) olive oils which were nothing more than canola oil. In 1997, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency began conducting tests on 100 oils that claimed to be 100% olive oil and in 1999 the CFIA concluded that 20 per cent of the oils were fake. In 2013, \\"Figures released at the [IOC's] Workshop on Olive Oil Authentication, held in Madrid June 10‚Äì11, show that one in four olive oils sampled in Spain, and nearly one in three in Canada, failed recent official fraud tests.\\" In March 2008, 400 Italian police officers conducted \\"Operation Golden Oil\\", arresting 23 people and confiscating 85 farms after an investigation revealed a large-scale scheme to relabel oils from other Mediterranean nations as Italian. In April 2008, another operation impounded seven olive oil plants and arrested 40 people in nine provinces of northern and southern Italy for adding chlorophyll to sunflower and soybean oil and selling it as extra virgin olive oil, both in Italy and abroad. 25,000 liters of the fake oil were seized and prevented from being exported. On December 22, 2008, the Guardia Civil in La Rioja (Spain) warned about the possible sale of adulterated olive oil in the area. This warning came after 550 litres of oil was found in a large container labelled \\"Astispumante 1510\\" in Rinc√≥n de Soto and after the theft of 1,750 litres of oil was reported in the area on December 18, 2008. In the first week of March 2010, researchers at the University of California at Davis' Olive Center purchased three bottles each of 14 imported olive oils and five California oils at retail stores in three different regions of California (Sacramento County, San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles County). All of the oils were labeled \\"extra-virgin olive oil.\\" Samples were shipped to the Australian Oils Research Laboratory in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, and were analyzed by their laboratory (which is recognized by the IOC to provide chemical analysis of olive oil) and tested by their sensory panel (which is recognized by the IOC as qualified to perform olive oil sensory analysis). Duplicate testing was performed at the UC Davis olive oil research project laboratories. Sixty-nine percent of the imported olive oils and 10% of the California oils failed to meet the IOC/USDA taste standards for extra-virgin olive oil. Samples that failed had a median of up to 3.5 IOC-standardized sensory defects (such as rancid, fusty, and musty). The standard IOC/USDA chemical tests only identified 31% of the failed oils as defective, primarily by exceeding the IOC/USDA limit for ultraviolet absorbance of late oxidation products (K232 and K268); two more recently introduced German chemical tests (now incorporated into the Australian extra- virgin standard) were each more than twice as effective at detection of defective oils. A subsequent round of testing in 2011 found similar results. The UC Davis report was contested by the North American Olive Oil Association on the grounds that UC Davis has a conflict of interest due to the fact that they market their own olive oil and have an interest in promoting olive oil from California. The IOC stated that the study contained \\"[an] evident undercurrent of aggressive, inexplicable criticism of imported olive oil quality\\". On March 15, 2011, the Florence, Italy prosecutor‚Äôs office, working in conjunction with the forestry department, indicted two managers and an officer of Carapelli, one of the brands of the Spanish company Grupo SOS (which recently changed its name to Deoleo) and Pietro Coricelli. The charges involved falsified documents and food fraud. Carapelli lawyer Neri Pinucci said the company was not worried about the charges and that \\"the case is based on an irregularity in the documents\\".‚ÄúInvestigations Into Deodorized Olive Oils‚Äù Olive Oil Times. 2011-03-29. However, in June 2017 the Italian Antitrust Authority (Autorit√† Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato), found them guilty of unfair business practices regarding their olive oil brands and imposed fines on them and the discount supermarket chain Lidl, amounting to nearly ‚Ç¨1 million. According to independent testing, oil from the brands Carapelli, Bertolli, Sasso, Primadonna and Coricelli labelled as \\"extra virgin\\" was in fact only \\"virgin.\\" Olive Oil Times. 2017-06-23. Standards Australia has adopted a code of practice for the testing of olive oils; however, while allowing oils to be certified as being genuine extra-virgin, the code regarding labeling is voluntary. The Australian Olive Association (AOA) is campaigning to have the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission force supermarkets to adhere to the code. After testing by AOA in 2012, every imported brand of extra-virgin olive oil fell below the standard that would be required for AOA certification. Adulterated oil is usually no more serious than passing off inferior, but safe, product as superior olive oil, but there are no guarantees. Almost 700 people died, it is believed, as a consequence of consuming rapeseed (canola) oil adulterated with aniline intended for use as an industrial lubricant, but sold in 1981 as olive oil in Spain (see toxic oil syndrome).  Testing for purity  UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis of olive oil samples in an Italian laboratory The detection of olive oil adulteration is often complicated with no single test that can accomplish the task. A battery of tests is employed to determine olive oil authenticity and identity of the adulterant. Included in this testing regime is the determination of free acidity, peroxide value, UV extinction, fatty acid composition, sterol composition, triglyceride composition, wax content, steroidal hydrocarbons, and the Bellier test. Methods employing chromatography/mass spectrometry and spectroscopy are often used to detect adulteration of olive oil These methods can be very expensive, time consuming, and results are often incomplete, since components added/substituted can not always be identified. Test results are measured against the International Olive Council trade standard to identify abnormalities. Each test provides key information which allows a decision to be made with respect to the grade of Olive oil and the identity of any adulterants. However, the International Olive Council does not test for deodorisation which makes up the bulk of fake extra-virgin oils. Soft column deodorisation is the process where steam is forced through a tank of inferior oil which removes all taste, colour and nutrients, colouring is then added before the tank is topped up with real extra-virgin oil to add flavour. A test published in 1887 described the detection of olive oil adulterated with mineral oil by a simple titration of the carboxylic acid moieties present in natural vegetable oils. The procedure involved boiling 10 milliliters of olive oil with 40 milliliters of approximately 1 molar potassium hydroxide in 95% ethanol, adding water to 100 grams to dissolve the saponified lipids, and titrating against a normal sulfuric acid solution using phenolphthalein as a pH indicator dye. The base stock solution was titrated to neutralize an equal quantity of the acid, so without the presence of vegetable oil it would require 40 milliliters of acid to cause a color change, but in the pure oils tested (almond, benne, cottonseed, cod liver oil, linseed oil, and olive oil, only 6 milliliters were required. In accordance with this, olive oil adulterated with 10% mineral oil required 8 milliliters, and with 20% 11 milliliters. The adulterated oil tested in 1887 required 14 to 17 milliliters to neutralize, so it might have been 30‚Äì40% mineral oil.Pharm. Zeitsch. f. Russl., 1887, 65 translated in Olive oil DNA analysis methods, based on the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (e.g. DNA fingerprinting), have been use for determining counterfeit. These techniques requires extensive sample preparation, which needs specific optimization to ensure extraction of sufficient DNA, and that PCR inhibitors are not affecting the analysis. To date, there is no DNA extraction method applicable to any sample. Another method against olive oil adulteration, making use of artificial, sub-micrometer-sized DNA barcodes, has recently been developed. The barcodes consist of magnetically recoverable silica particles containing synthetic DNA sequences, which are added to the oil in very small amount (down to 1 ppb) and can be retrieved at any time for authenticity test by PCR/sequencing. The advantages of this method, compared to conventional techniques, are that it is low-cost, sample preparation is minimal and requires minute volumes, and the method is universal, since it can be applied to any oil type/sample without specific procedure optimization. = Certifications of quality = The North American Olive Oil Association offers a Quality Seal Program to guarantee authenticity of olive oil. Members of the association agree to have their oils tested twice a year to ensure the oil meets or exceeds the International Olive Council (IOC) standards. The testing includes both sensory (taste/smell) and chemical tests for purity. Samples are purchased from the retail marketplace to ensure that the products tested are the same as the ones purchased by consumers. The test samples are not selected and submitted by olive oil producers. Brands pay for the testing through a yearly licensing fee. The California Olive Oil Council tests samples of olive oil submitted by producers for extra virgin quality. The samples are provided by the producers. The testing is primarily sensory with some chemical tests. The Extra Virgin Alliance offers the EVA Mark of quality and authenticity. Auditors purchase oils from retail sources and test the oils against standards set by the EVA. The testing consists of sensory analysis and focuses on detection of defects. = Simple home tests = Refrigeration  There is a persistent mistaken belief that when genuine olive oil (or, in some versions, extra virgin olive oil specifically) is refrigerated, it will solidify or become much more viscous. This mistaken belief is based on the fact that olive oil is composed mainly of the monounsaturated fat oleic acid, and pure oleic acid (triolein) has a melting point of 5 ÀöC, which is slightly above the high end of proper refrigerator temperature. Thus, if olive oil were pure triolein, it would solidify in a properly set refrigerator. However, olive oil is a complex mixture with significant variability in its fatty acid structure, and can be anywhere from 55% to 83% oleic acid, with the remainder a mixture of polyunsaturated fat and saturated fat, as well as containing waxes, phytosterols, and other compounds that affect its melting temperature. Thus, in practice, many olive oils have significantly lower melting temperatures. In fact, one might expect a refined seed oil with very high oleic acid content (such as high oleic sunflower oil) to be more likely to solidify in the refrigerator, based on their fatty acid composition and lack of minor compounds. This was demonstrated by a test by scientists at the Olive Center at the University of California, Davis. Researchers put seven samples of different oils into a refrigerator at 4.7 ÀöC, including a premium extra- virgin olive oil; low-quality extra-virgin olive oil; a blend of virgin and refined olive oil; refined canola oil; refined safflower oil; a 50‚Äì50 blend of premium extra virgin olive oil with refined canola oil; and a 50‚Äì50 blend of premium extra virgin olive oil with refined safflower oil. When tested at intervals up to 180 hours, not one of the oils fully solidified, and one of the oils that solidified the most was the olive oil-canola oil mixture. Thus, the \\"Fridge Test\\" using a single temperature is not reliable for determining oil purity or quality.  Ignition  Pure olive oil should burn in an oil lamp. The ignition test however, like the refrigerator test, is not conclusive.

Watts became particularly active in the fighting after the murder of his uncle, Old Tassel, by militant frontiersmen who attacked a band of delegates traveling to a peace conference in 1788. Family life John Watts was the \\"mixed-blood\\" son of a British trader (who was also named John Watts and was the official British government Indian interpreter for the area until his death in 1770). His mother was a sister of Old Tassel, Doublehead, and Pumpkin Boy.Note: Under the Cherokee clan system, a maternal uncle-nephew link was more important than a father-son lineage, since clan identity was centered on that of one's mother. Watts' parents resided in the Overhill Towns along the Little Tennessee River. Wurte Watts, Sequoyah's mother, may have been his sister. Separation from the Overhill Towns Although he withdrew from the Overhill Towns along with Dragging Canoe's band, Watts was, at first, only occasionally involved in the activities of Dragging Canoe and his Chickamauga warriors. He moved first to Running Water Town, and later to Willstown. Watts eventually became Dragging Canoe's hand-picked successor. Warrior Watts led his first major action of the Cherokee-American wars in 1786 against the forces of the State of Franklin over their incursions into the territory of the Overhill Towns. Warriors from the Valley Towns also joined in the attacks. His next major action came in October 1788. Following Old Tassel's murder, he led a large war party into North Carolina's Washington District (now Tennessee). The band included The Ridge (known as Nunnehidihi, or Ganundalegi) going into his first battle. They captured and burned Gillespie's Station, killing its defenders and taking several prisoners. The Cherokee warriors then proceeded against White's Fort (modern day Knoxville, Tennessee), where they were repulsed. Afterward, the group made a semi-permanent camp along Flint Creek (in the area of the future Unicoi County, Tennessee), harassing, raiding, and attacking white settlers in the surrounding countryside. Their base was discovered (in January the following year) and they were attacked by a troop commanded by John Sevier. Watts signed the 1791 Treaty of Holston, along with fellow war leaders: Doublehead, Bloody Fellow, Black Fox (a future chief of the Cherokee Nation), The Badger (Dragging Canoe's brother), and Rising Fawn.  War chief of the Lower Cherokee  In 1792, Dragging Canoe died suddenly. Watts, who had been living back in the Overhill area, succeeded Dragging Canoe as war council head, or \\"skiagusta,\\" of the Lower Cherokee (in accordance with the old warrior's wishes).Chronicles of Oklahoma ; article; Brown, John P.; \\"Eastern Cherokee Chiefs\\" (Volume 16, Number 1); March1938; retrieved July 2013. =First actions= Watts, along with Bloody Fellow, Doublehead, and \\"Young Dragging Canoe\\" (Tsula), continued Dragging Canoe's policy of Indian unity. He honored the agreement with McGillivray, of the Upper Muscogee, to build blockhouses (from which warriors of both tribes could operate) at Running Water, Muscle Shoals, and at the junction of the Tennessee and Clinch Rivers. Watts traveled to Pensacola to conclude a treaty with the Spanish governor of West Florida, Arturo O'Neill. The treaty provided them with arms and supplies with which to carry on the war. At about this time, Watts moved his base of operations to Willstown, which positioned them closer to their Muscogee allies while further insulating his band from the westward expansion of the new United States. In September 1792, Watts assembled a large gathering of Cherokee and Muscogee warriors (which also included a contingent of cavalry). He planned to lead a campaign into the Cumberland region of Appalachia. It was to be a three-pronged attack: Tahlonteeskee (Ataluntiski) would lead a force to ambush the Kentucky road; Middle Striker would take the Walton road; and Watts would lead the main army of 280 Cherokee, Shawnee, and Muscogee warriors against Nashville itself (then capital of the Mero District of the new Southwest Territory). On the way to Nashville, the army encountered and attacked a settlement known as Buchanan's Station. It proved to be a disaster. Watts was seriously wounded, while Siksika (known as \\"The Shawnee Warrior,\\"‚Äîand an older brother of Tecumseh)); Tahlonteeskee (also called Talotiskee of the Broken Arrow‚Äîa Muscogee warrior); Little Owl (a brother of Dragging Canoe); and Pumpkin Boy (a brother of Doublehead), all died in the encounter. =Last campaign= A delegation of Shawnee is known to have stopped in Ustanali in 1793 on their way to the Muscogee and Choctaw settlements. The purpose of the trip was to ask the tribes to join in a united effort to punish the Chickasaw for joining St. Clair's army in the north. Later in 1793, Watts sent envoys to Knoxville, which was at the time the capital of the Southwest Territory, to meet with Governor Blount to discuss terms for a lasting peace. The peace party included Bob McLemore, Tahlonteeskee, Captain Charley of Running Water, and Doublehead, as well as the white delegates. Along the way, the group was attacked by a militant group of frontiersmen during a stop at the Overhill town of Coyatee. Hanging Maw was wounded, while his wife and daughter (along with several other Indians and one of the white delegates), were killed. The Cherokee people, along with Watts' Chickmauga warriors, agreed to await the outcome of the subsequent trial. In large part because the man responsible (who had lost his family in an Indian raid) was a close friend of John Sevier, the trial proved to be a farce. Watts responded by invading the Holston area with one of the largest Indian forces ever seen in the region, over one thousand Cherokee, Muscogee, and Shawnee. He intended to attack Knoxville itself. On the way, the Cherokee leaders were discussing among themselves whether to kill all the inhabitants of Knoxville, or just the men. Doublehead argued for the former, while James Vann advocated the latter. On the way to Knoxville, the war party encountered the small settlement of Cavett's Station. After they had surrounded the place, Bob Benge negotiated with the inhabitants, agreeing that if they surrendered, their lives would be spared. However, after the settlers had walked out, Doublehead's group and his Muscogee allies attacked and killed them. Vann managed to grab one small boy and pull him onto his saddle, only to have Doublehead smash the boy's skull in with an axe. Watts intervened in time to save another young boy, handing him to Vann, who put the boy behind him on his horse and later handed him over to three of the Muscogee for safe-keeping; unfortunately, one of the Muscogee chiefs killed the boy and scalped him a few days later.  Final peace  With the defeat of the Western Confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, and the destruction of Nickajack Town and Running Water Town in September 1794, the leaders of the Lower Cherokee became convinced that continuing the war was futile. The council signed the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse in November, officially ending hostilities. Although a \\"national\\" government, complete with a Principal Chief and National Council, was elected in 1794, it had no real power, with individual regional councils for each of the major Cherokee geographic divisions predominating. Watts himself spurned any \\"national office.\\" He served as chief of the Lower Cherokee until his death in 1802, upon which he was succeeded by Doublehead.

Gill is an American anthropologist, and a Professor Emeritus at the University of Wyoming and is \\"widely recognized as an expert in skeletal biology\\". Career In the late 1980s, partly in response to demands from American forensic anthropology organizations to scrutinize methods of racial identification in order to ensure accuracy in legal cases, Gill tested, supported, and developed craniofacial anthropometric and other means of estimating the racial origins of skeletal remains. He found that the employment of multiple criteria can yield very high rates of accuracy, and even that individual methods can be accurate more than 80 percent of the time. Gill cites these findings in arguing against the prevailing tendency among American anthropologists to treat human races as social constructs. Gill suggests that \\"race denial\\" can stem from overstatements of the importance of clinal variation among human phenotypes, and from \\"politically motivated censorship\\" in the mistaken but \\"politically correct\\" belief that \\"race promotes racism\\". Gill argues that \\"we can often function within systems that we do not believe in\\": Categories can have practical utility, even if they also seem conceptually problematic. Gill served on a NOVA-sponsored panel in which he and five others debated the reality of race. Among Gill's opponents was American anthropologist C. Loring Brace--a fellow plaintiff in the Kennewick Man case--who maintains that the term \\"race\\" is not warranted by \\"a biological entity\\". =Easter Island= Gill has researched human osteology on the Polynesian island and Chilean territory of Easter Island, and in 1981 led the National Geographic Society's Easter Island Anthropological Expedition.

She possessed a flexible warm voice with a wide vocal range that, while focusing mostly within the mezzo-soprano repertoire, enabled her to sing roles normally associated with contraltos and sopranos. Indeed, during her lifetime she was often identified as either a mezzo-soprano or a contralto by music critics without much consistency. While she had an excellent vocal technique and an exceptionally beautiful tone quality, her gifts as an actress and interpreter were only mediocre.J.B. Steane: \\"Eugenia Mantelli\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed March 01, 2009), (subscription access) Biography Mantelli was born in Florence, Italy. Her parents were both singing teachers and her earliest musical training was received from them. She entered the Milan Conservatory, graduating from there in 1877 with diplomas in both voice and piano. She made her professional opera debut at the Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos in Lisbon as Urbain in Giacomo Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots in 1883. That same year she sang the role of Kaled in Jules Massenet's Le roi de Lahore at the Teatro Sociale in Treviso. This was followed by a highly successful concert tour throughout Germany, Italy, Argentina, and Brazil with tenor Juli√°n Gayarre. In November 1887 she sang the role of Adalgisa in Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. This was followed by several appearances at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, including the role of Eboli in Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlo with Adalgisa Gabbi, Jos√© Oxilia, Giuseppe Kaschmann, and Auguste Boudouresque. In 1889 she joined the opera company that inaugurated the Teatro Argentino de La Plata in Buenos Aires. She sang with the company both in that city and at the Teatro Solis in Montevideo, notably sharing the stage with Mattia Battistini in performances of La favorita, Amleto, La forza del destino, and Gli Ugonotti (the Italian version of Les Huguenots). In 1894 Mantelli joined the roster of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, making her first appearance there as Amneris in Verdi's Aida on 23 November. She remained a member of the company until the end of the 1899-1900 season. One of her most successful roles at the Met was L√©onor in La favorite, which she also sang for her first performance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1896. She left the Met in 1900 just before she married her husband. Although she returned to the Met briefly in 1903 and appeared in a few vaudeville productions during the early 1900s, she spent most of her remaining career performing at the Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos. After retiring from the stage, she remained in Lisbon where she taught singing for many years.

It is the seventh depression and third typhoon of the season. Forming out of an area of low pressure on June 14, the storm briefly attained tropical depression status before degenerating. By June 17 the system regenerated in the South China Sea. Slowly tracking northward, the storm intensified, attaining severe tropical storm status on June 19 and peaking in intensity the following day. On June 21, Linfa made landfall in Fujian Province, China as a tropical storm before weakening to a tropical depression. In Taiwan, outer bands of the storm produced significant amounts of rain over southeastern areas of the island. Along the western coast, rip currents resulted in the drowning of one person. Six hikers also were reported to be missing. In China, torrential rains triggered flooding that destroyed 100 homes, killed one person and left six others missing. In all, seven people were killed by Linfa, with damages in mainland China estimated at ¬•641 million (US$93.8 million) and agricultural losses in Taiwan reached NT$400 million (US$12.1 million). Meteorological history On June 10, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a persistent area of convection situated about 140 kilometres (85 mi) southeast of Palau. Satellite imagery depicted an elongated low-level circulation with deep convection centered along the southwestern portion of the system. Strong wind shear, which normally inhibits cyclonic development, provided energy for further convective development around the system. Tracking in a general northwestward direction, the low gradually developed northward outflow due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) located north of the disturbance. Following further development, the Japan Meteorological Agency declared the system as a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on June 14. Later on June 14, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the depression. Deep convection consolidated around the center of circulation and convective banding features developed along the periphery of the system. Several hours later, the TCFA was canceled as the system rapidly degenerated, with convection mostly dissipating and an exposed low. Outflow significantly deteriorated as the system detached itself from the TUTT. By this time, the JMA had ceased advisories on the depression. Two days later, after tracking across Luzon, the system began to regenerate. Convection redeveloped around the low and outflow was reestablished to the south. Early on June 17, the JTWC issued a second TCFA as the system continued to organize. By this time the system was nearly stationary and at 0600 UTC, the JMA declared that the low had developed into a tropical depression. Several hours later, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 03W while the storm was situated about 705 km (440 mi) south-southwest of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Little movement took place for the first few days of the storm's existence as weak steering currents were in place over the South China Sea. Following further development of the depression, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm late on June 17. At 0600 UTC on June 18, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm and gave it the name Linfa. Limited poleward outflow hindered intensification for the remainder of June 18\\\\. By this time, the storm began to increase in forward motion due to a strengthening subtropical ridge located east of Taiwan and a mid-latitude trough to the west. TRMM image of Severe Tropical Storm Linfa on June 20 Around 1200 UTC the following day, Linfa further intensified into a severe tropical storm. A microwave satellite image of the storm depicted an eye-feature surrounded by deep convection. Interacting with a nearby upper-level low, poleward outflow significantly improved late on June 19, fueling further strengthening. Slowly tracking in a general northward direction, Linfa continued to organize and by June 20, the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon. A small, ragged eye appeared on visible satellite images by this time and several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity just below typhoon-status according to the JMA. Maximum sustained winds peaked at 110 km/h (70 mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 975 hPa (mbar). Later on June 20, convection near the center of circulation began to decrease‚Äìan indication of weakening‚Äìand the eye was no longer visible. Upper-level wind shear rapidly increased to 55 km/h (35 mph), preventing re-intensification of the cyclone. Taking a more northward track than anticipated, Linfa began to interact with land and was downgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC on June 21. Around 1230 UTC, the storm made landfall in southern Fujian as a tropical storm with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph 10-minute winds). Deep convection rapidly dissipated shortly thereafter due to interaction with land. Several hours later, the JTWC downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression. The following day, the JMA also downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression as the storm moved away from the Chinese coastline. The system later dissipated just offshore; a circulation was no longer evident on satellite imagery. Preparations and impact The Colombo Queen run aground by Tropical Storm Linfa Although Linfa was not forecast to directly impact the Philippines, the outer effects of the storm were anticipated to produce increased rainfall and large swells along western facing coastlines. By June 20, the Central Weather Bureau issued extremely heavy rain warnings, indicating 24-hour rainfall totals in excess of were anticipated, for most of Taiwan. Beaches throughout Taiwan were closed due to rough seas and local officials inspected all public shelters to ensure they were stocked and prepared to provide for evacuees. Later that day, a level 3 emergency was declared for eastern Guangdong Province and southern Fujian Province. The local governments in the provinces enacted their emergency response plans following this declaration. Rainfall in the vicinity of the South China Sea between June 18 and June 25, 2009. The greatest amounts of rainfall appear in deep blue. On June 21, officials in China closed Xiamen port and stated that it would resume operations once the storm passed. Later that day 33,000 vessels sought refuge at port. Following the issuance of a land warning, government offices and schools were closed throughout the island. Officials sent 10 million text messages to residents throughout Fujian Province to warn them about the approaching storm. In Hong Kong, public warning signal number one was raised for nearly 24 hours as Linfa briefly threatened the city on June 20. Officials also evacuated roughly 160,000 people from coastal areas in Fujian. A total of 167 flights to and from Taiwan were canceled or delayed due to the storm. On June 21, large swells of up to caused a 498-tonne oil tanker, the Colombo Queen, to run aground in southern Taiwan. Rescue crews were unable to reach the ship as it was still in the storm. Although no fuel was reported to have leaked, the ship struck a coral reef, damaging the coral. Once Linfa passed, rescuers were able to reach the nine crew members on the ship. Officials estimated that it would take over a week to remove all of fuel from the tanker. In Taiwan, two people were hit by fallen trees and two monks were struck by a wall that collapsed during a ceremony. Rip currents in Taiwan resulted in one death after a boy went into the water unwatched. Six hikers also went missing. Power to all 505 residences of Chiangchun was also lost during the storm. Average amounts of of rain were recorded across southeastern parts of Taiwan on June 21. The highest total was in Taitung. Further rainfall of fell on June 22, pushing totals over in isolated areas along southeastern areas. In Kinmen County, 50 trees were downed, six billboards were destroyed and two homes lost their roofs. By June 22, power companies reported that 2,834 residents had lost power in Wuqiu Township for several hours. Severe damage was reported in the agricultural sector in Taiwan, leaving NT$400 million (US$12.1 million) in losses. In mainland China, Linfa produced torrential rains, peaking at and triggering severe flooding. Heavy rains also impacted Hong Kong, where more than fell over a three-day span. Following a landslide, one person was killed. Flood waters destroyed 100 homes and inundated 10,000 others as well as an estimated 32,000 hectares of farmland in Fujian Province. In Taoyuan Town, a total of of rain fell within one hour, breaking a 200-year-old record in the town. In Meizhou, Guongdong Province, flash flooding resulted in five additional fatalities after of rain fell within a nine-hour span. This rainfall was higher than any recorded amount in the past 100 years in the region. A total of 362 homes were destroyed in the town and infrastructure was severely damaged.

During the period 1940 to 1942, the wing controlled 21 Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bombers and 92 assorted fighters in about a dozen groups and squadrons. On 17 April 1942, the wing was inactivated, and its mission was taken over by the VI Interceptor Command, Antilles Air Task Force. The organization was reactivated as the 13th Bombardment Wing in October 1942 at MacDill Field, Florida under Third Air Force. It was one of three bombardment wing headquarters (12th, 13th, 14th) which were formed at MacDill for deployment to Eighth Air Force in England. The 13th deployed in June 1943. There, it controlled the 95th, 100th and 390th Bombardment Groups under the 3d Bombardment Division, flying Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. Controlling the combat operations of the groups, it carried out strategic bombing of enemy aircraft, petroleum, and ball bearing industries as well as German airfields. Later, organizational units took part in the famous raid against the ball bearing industry at Schweinfurt in October 1943 and followed with missions against shipyards and shipbuilding installations at Wilhelmshaven and Bremen.Freeman, With the end of the war in Europe, it returned to the United States and was inactivated on 17 October 1945. The wing was redesignated as the 13th Air Division and then activated under Strategic Air Command (SAC) in July 1959. The 13th was one of SAC's first strategic missile command organizations, initially being assigned the 703d and 706th Strategic Missile Wings at Lowry AFB, Colorado with the new SM-68 Titan I ICBM.SAC.com 703d Missile Wing However, these wings never became operational;Ravenstein, instead the division became an SM-65 Atlas organization, controlling the 389th and 451st Strategic Missile Wings.

Family Flaccus was a patrician and son of the Publius Valerius Flaccus who was consul in 227 BC with M. Atilius Regulus. His brother was the flamen dialis Gaius Valerius Flaccus, who made a respectable political career as praetor, though not consul. Career The patrician Flaccus became a friend, political patron, and ally of the young plebeian senator Marcus Porcius Cato, later called Cato the Elder, during the earlier years of the Second Punic War. Flaccus is possibly the Valerius Flaccus who was a military tribune in 212 BC, serving under the consuls who captured Hanno's camp at Beneventum.Livy 25.14.6; Valerius Maximus 3.2.20. M√ºnzer regarded this tribune as the fictional creation of Valerius Antias to bolster the Valerian family tradition. See T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1951, 1986), vol. 1, pp. 269 and 272 (note 6). Flaccus was curule aedile in 201 BC.Livy 31.4.5‚Äì6. He was probably the L. Valerius Flaccus who was a legate under the praetor L. Furius Purpureo in Gaul in 200.Livy 31.21.8. As praetor in 199, he was assigned to the province of Sicily. Flaccus received Italy as his province when he was consul in 195 BC, and continued to wage war as proconsul the following year against the Gauls, with a victory over the Insubres at Mediolanum (Milan).Livy 33.43.5, 34.22.1‚Äì3 and 46.1, 42.2.4; Plutarch, Cato Maior 10.1. In 191 Flaccus was a legate under M'. Acilius Glabrio in the war against the Aetolians and at the Battle of Thermopylae.Livy 36.19.1, 22.7, 27.3‚Äì8, 28.8; Appian, Syrian War 19. In 190, Flaccus served on the three-man commission (triumviri coloniis deducendis) created to strengthen Placentia and Cremona. His fellow commissioners were M. Atilius Serranus (praetor 174 BC) and L. Valerius Tappo (praetor 192 BC). The following year, the commission founded Bononia (modern Bologna) as a Roman colony (colonia).Livy 37.46.10‚Äì11 and 37.57.7‚Äì8. In a \\"hotly contested\\" election,Broughton, MRR1 p. 374; Livy 39.40‚Äì41; Plutarch, Cato Maior 16.1‚Äì6. Flaccus became censor along with Cato in 184. Their censorship was noted for its severity: L. Quinctius Flamininus, the consul of 192, was kicked out of the senate; Scipio Asiaticus, the consul of 190, lost his equestrian rank; and public contracts were leased stringently.Broughton, MRR1 pp. 374‚Äì375, with various ancient sources. The two men shared common conservative political sympathies and cultural outlook, and were loyal to the military and political views of the older generation represented by Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus. Both he and Cato sought to defend Roman tradition against Hellenism. Flaccus was a member of the College of Pontiffs from 196, when he succeeded M. Cornelius Cethegus, until his death. Flaccus became princeps senatus when Scipio Africanus died in 183. He himself died three years later. References Dates, offices, and citations of ancient sources for the career of Flaccus from T.R.S.

Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 1999, eight different albums topped the chart, based on electronic point of sale data provided by SoundScan Inc. In the issue of Billboard dated January 2, Garth Brooks occupied the top spot with the live recording Double Live, the album's fifth week at number one. Having been certified more than 20 times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, Double Live is the biggest-selling live album of all time in the United States. Later in the year, Brooks returned to the top of the chart when he spent a single week at number one with the seasonal album Garth Brooks & the Magic of Christmas. It was the singer's eighth consecutive number one and his tenth chart-topping album of the 1990s, a decade in which he experienced a level of mainstream popularity and success unprecedented for a country artist. Another country singer who became a global superstar during this era was Canadian vocalist Shania Twain, whose album Come On Over spent 26 weeks at number one during 1999, including a spell of 15 consecutive weeks in the top spot, the longest such run of the year. The album would ultimately spend a total of 50 weeks at number one, making it the longest-running chart-topper in the history of the Top Country Albums listing. In 2000, it was recognized by the Recording Industry Association of America as the highest-selling album of all time by a female artist, as well as the biggest-selling country album. Garth Brooks was one of two acts with two number ones in 1999, the other being the all-female trio the Dixie Chicks. The group's first album to enter the Top Country Albums listing, Wide Open Spaces, finally reached the top spot in its 51st week on the chart, and remained there for seven weeks. The group returned to the top spot in September with Fly, which spent eight weeks at number one. Both albums won the Grammy Award for Best Country Album, at the 1999 and 2000 ceremonies respectively. As well as the Dixie Chicks, Faith Hill topped the chart for the first time in 1999 with her album Breathe, which reached the peak position in the issue of Billboard dated November 27. It would go on to win the Grammy Award for Best Country Album at the 2001 ceremony. Hill's first appearance atop the listing came six months after her husband, Tim McGraw, achieved his fourth consecutive number one with A Place in the Sun. Chart history Shania Twain spent 26 weeks at number one with Come On Over, which would go on to become the longest-running chart-topper in the history of the Top Country Albums listing. Faith Hill had her first number one in 1999 with Breathe.

Life Ephrem Rahmani was born on 21 November 1848 (or on 9 November 1849 according to other sources) in Mosul. He studied with the Dominican friars in Mosul and later in the College of the Propaganda in Rome and was ordained priest in April 1873. Rahmani was appointed vicar to the bishop of Mosul with the titular title of bishop of Edessa and consecrated bishop on 2 October 1887 by Patriarch Ignatius George V Shelhot. On 1 May 1894 Rahmani was appointed bishop of Aleppo. After the death of Ignatius Behnam II Benni (13 September 1897) he was elected Patriarch on 9 October 1898 and confirmed by Pope Leo XIII on 28 November 1898. As patriarch Rahmani was particularly interested in the instruction of the clergy. The early 20th- century was a period of expansion for the Syriac Catholic Church who received many Syriac Orthodox converts. In 1910 he moved the Patriarchal See from Mardin to Beirut. The arrival of World War I was catastrophic: the Armenian Genocide brought destruction also to the Christian Syrians who lived in the same areas as the Armenians, with the result that the Syriac Catholic Church had the number of its members cut by half with five dioceses (on ten) and fifteen missions destroyed.

History  The Lindenhof was the site of the Helvetii Oppidum and the first century BC Roman settlement (15 BC), with traces of a hypocaustum excavated between Weinplatz and M√ºnsterhof. It was then the historical core of modern Z√ºrich. This is the oldest area of the city, with settlements dating to the pre-Roman La T√®ne culture, and fortified as oppidum with a surrounding Vicus Turicum in the final decades of the 1st century BC. In medieval times, the Oetenbach nunnery was located in the district, but was abolished in 1525 and finally demolished in 1901/02. The Uraniastrasse road and the Urania Sternwarte were later built, and the so-called Waisenhaus Z√ºrich asylum became the headquarters of the Z√ºrich City Police.Today the Schipfe is well known for its romantic houses at the Limmat and several almost hidden shops opposite the Limmatquai.

Throughout their career, the album has been re-released many times under various titles. The song \\"One Elephant, Deux √âl√©phants\\" became the opening theme to their popular children's television show, The Elephant Show, which ran for five seasons. This was also the first time that Sharon, Lois, and Bram covered Skinnamarink, which became the group's signature song and was performed at the end of every episode of The Elephant Show and Skinnamarink TV. Background and production The group had a combined 40 years of performing for children, before their first recording. The album was recorded in a studio in Kensington Market, Toronto. The first issue of the record, out in the autumn of 1978, included an activity book with lyrics, as well as suggested games, actions, and activities. The group loaned $1000 from 20 friends, allowing them to press the initial 5000 copies of the album. =Genres= The album was noted for its variety. Canadian Press newswire service noted that it included \\"everything from an Iroquois lullaby to a Bach gavrotte.\\" Sharon Hampson told the agency that \\"adults mean well, but they often underestimate what children can understand and enjoy so they feed them feeble music.\\", reprinted as Songs on the album include children's voices, as well, recorded live on playgrounds. Promotion The album was promoted as \\"a children's record for the whole family.\\" Young People's Theatre in Toronto hosted A Children's Elephant Concert with Sharon, Lois and Bram over two days and four performances, \\"in celebration of the release of their first album.\\" CTV Television Network commissioned a special titled One Elephant, Deux √âl√©phants, which aired on 7 July 1979. The one-hour program was commissioned by at least April, and filmed before June. The Red Deer Advocate called it a \\"vibrant, refreshing musical special... What Sharon, Lois and Bram have done is simply recognize the world most children live in and offer the music, chants and clapping games that come directly from their world. One Elephant, Deux √âl√©phants quite accurately reflects the way children hear words blended with music and offers these songs with witty invention and high spirits.\\" A CBC special taped in July of that year was released in October as Sharon, Lois and Bram Downtown. The lyrics of the song \\"One Elephant, Deux √âl√©phants\\" were used for later productions. A 1995 VHS tape featuring songs from Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show was released as One Elephant Went Out to Play. Critical reception Edmonton Journal columnist Lesley Francis commented that \\"The first time I put it on the turntable I couldn't I stop singing or swaying to the music. I probably enjoyed it more than my two-year-old son... My hat is off to this talented trio and their producer, Bill Usher, for bringing out a record which not only appeals to children but to the whole family.\\" In Regina, The Leader-Post reviewer Sherry Crone suggested the album and booklet \\"will be a delight to any child. The mixture of adult and children's voices creates a moment of enormous fun for everyone.\\" A feature about the group in Montreal's The Gazette suggested that the album \\"sounds good enough to have come from a major recording studio in Los Angeles... The content is distinctive and eclectic... The result was a children's album you didn't have to send children up to their rooms to listen to.\\" In an article about the larger children's music industry in The Globe and Mail mentioned the album. \\"It sparkles with wit, with play, with the wisdom of humor.\\" Awards The album was nominated for a 1979 Juno Award, in the category \\"Special Award for Children's Album\\"; Anne Murray's There's a Hippo in My Tub won. Other nominees were Sandy Offenheim and Family's Are We There Yet?, soundtrack Songs From the Polka Dot Door, and a group album called Canada's Favorite Folksongs for Kids. Commercial performance The album was the fastest-selling Canadian children's record ever, at the time. The first printing of the album had 5000 copies. In its first three months, by mid-December 1978, the album had sold over 27,000 copies. By April 1979, a press mention listed the number as having grown to 100,000 copies, although an interview with the group in June contradicted that, listing 47,000 sales. It had sold 100,000 copies by at least December 1980. It was certified as a Gold Album in September 1979 (50,000+ copies sold), a Platinum Album in December 1980 (100,000+ copies), and Double Platinum on 18 November 1986 (200,000+ copies). The group is unsure when the Triple Platinum certification was reached (500,000+ copies).

The first release of the album cost $7.98, more than the average children's album of the era, which sold for $2.98 to $3.98. The lower price point meant a lack of interest from the recording industry, and lack of quality product. The album was viewed as part of a turning point for the industry.

It stars Helen Mirren, Sam Worthington, Jessica Chastain, Ciar√°n Hinds, Tom Wilkinson, Marton Csokas and Jesper Christensen. Although ready for release in July 2010, and scheduled for a December 2010 release in the United States, the film only toured various film festivals during the autumn of 2010 and spring of 2011. It didn't see a general release until it was released in France on 15 June 2011, followed by Kazakhstan and Russia in July 2011, and the United States, Canada and India on 31 August 2011. Plot In 1997, Rachel is honoured by her daughter Sarah during a release party in Tel Aviv for Sarah's book based on the account Rachel, Stefan and David gave of the events in 1965. Concurrently, David is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck. In 1965, a young Mossad agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in East Berlin to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold. Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel‚Äîinfamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War II‚Äîand bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as a married couple from Argentina and Rachel becomes a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. At a doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in an ambulance. They attempt to leave by train, but Vogel awakens and sounds the horn of the van where he is being held, alerting guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to save the compromised Rachel. The agents have no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction. The agents take turns monitoring and feeding Vogel while leaving him chained to the wall heater. During his shift, David becomes violently enraged after Vogel explains his beliefs that Jews have many weaknesses, such as selfishness, making them easily subdued. David smashes a glass plate over Vogel's head and repeatedly beats him, only to be stopped and restrained by Stefan. Later on, Stefan and David go out, leaving Rachel home to monitor Vogel by herself. After managing to cut through his bonds using a shard of the broken plate, Vogel ambushes Rachel with the shard, leaving her with a permanent scar on her face and escapes. Panicking and hoping to avoid humiliation, Stefan convinces Rachel and David to go along with the fiction that Vogel was killed. They agree to lie and use the cover story that Rachel shot and killed Vogel as he attempted to flee. In the following years, the agents become venerated as national heroes for their roles in the mission. At a dinner after their daughter's book release party, Stefan takes Rachel aside to set a meeting to discuss new information he has obtained. Later, at David's flat, Stefan provides evidence that Vogel is in a Mental Hospital in Ukraine, and is soon scheduled to be interviewed by a local journalist. Stefan claims David killed himself because he was a coward. Rachel refutes Stefan's explanation, recalling an encounter with David a day before his suicide, in which he revealed his shame about the lie and disclosed that he had spent years unsuccessfully searching the world for Vogel so he could finally be brought to justice. He was further disheartened by Rachel's admission that she would continue propagating the lie to protect those closest to her, particularly her daughter. Nevertheless, Rachel finally feels compelled to travel to Kiev. She investigates the journalist's lead and is able to travel to the asylum. She reaches the room just minutes before the journalist and discovers the man claiming to be Vogel is not him. Describing the encounter to Stefan over the phone, Rachel declares she will not continue to lie about the 1965 mission. She leaves a note for the journalist and suddenly spots the real Vogel among the other patients and follows him to an isolated area of the hospital. After a confrontation in which Vogel stabs her twice with scissors, Rachel kills Vogel by plunging a poisoned syringe into his back. Later Rachel's note is discovered and read by the journalist. It describes the truth of the mission, ready to be relayed to the world.

Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 1997, eight different albums topped the chart, based on electronic point of sale data provided by SoundScan Inc. The number-one position was occupied for more than half of the year by LeAnn Rimes, who had first topped the chart the previous year when she was 13 years old. In the issue of Billboard dated January 4, Rimes held the top spot with her album Blue, the record's 20th week in the top spot. Blue occupied the peak position for the first eight weeks of 1997, after which it was displaced by Unchained Melody: The Early Years, also by Rimes. This was a compilation of tracks released to capitalize on the success of her first major-label album, and consisted mostly of tracks from the independent album All That, originally released when she was aged 11. It spent 10 consecutive weeks at number one, meaning that Rimes occupied the top spot from the start of the year until early May. In September, Blue spent one final week at number one and then Rimes returned to the top spot with her next album You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs, which spent eight weeks atop the chart, giving the teenage singer a total of 27 weeks at number one in 1997. In November, Canadian singer Shania Twain entered the chart at number one with the album Come On Over. The album initially only spent three weeks at number one, but would return to the top spot repeatedly, eventually spending a total of 50 weeks at number one, making it the longest-running chart-topper in the history of the Top Country Albums listing. In 2000, it was recognized by the Recording Industry Association of America as the highest-selling album of all time by a female artist, as well as the biggest-selling country album. The year's final number one was Sevens by Garth Brooks, which also topped the all- genre Billboard 200 chart. It was the singer's fifth consecutive number one and his ninth consecutive multi-platinum album. Three months earlier, Trisha Yearwood, who would marry Brooks in 2005, gained her first number one with (Songbook) A Collection of Hits. Chart history LeAnn Rimes had three number ones in 1997, which between them spent more than half of the year in the top spot. Everywhere was a chart-topper for Tim McGraw.

Hanna in 1892 by Globe Iron Works at Cleveland, Ohio, yard number 46, as the private yacht Comanche, official number 126888. The U.S. Navy purchased her on 28 May 1898 for service during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and commissioned her as USS Frolic on 6 July 1898 with Commander E. H. Gheen in command. Service historySpanish‚ÄìAmerican War= Frolic departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 23 July 1898 with mail for ships of the North Atlantic Station on Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War duty off Cuba and Puerto Rico. The war ended in August 1898 while she was performing these duties. She arrived at Norfolk Navy Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 17 September, and was decommissioned there on 27 September. =Post-war= Frolic was recommissioned on 25 October 1900. Assigned to the Asiatic Station, she cleared Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 30 December bound for the Mediterranean Sea, the Suez Canal, and finally Cavite on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, where she arrived on 24 April 1901. Cooperating with the United States Army in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, Frolic patrolled the southern Philippines, serving primarily off Samar. Several times during the next year, she aided ships in distress, and from October 1902 made hydrographic surveys. She performed a variety of other duties in establishing American control in the Philippines, including investigation of possible telegraph sites and transport duty. In February 1904, Frolic added patrols and target practice in Chinese waters to her operating schedule at intervals. Frolic was decommissioned on 31 March 1906.

Overview Colt New Army Model 1892 series revolver In 1892, the revolver was adopted by the United States Army chambered for .38 Long Colt cartridges, and was given the appellation \\"New Army and Navy\\". Initial experience with the gun caused officials to request some improvements. This would be an ongoing condition, resulting in Models 1892, 1894, 1896, 1901, and 1903 for the Army, as well as a Model 1895 for the Navy and a Model 1905 Marine Corps variant. Features The revolver featured a counter-clockwise rotating cylinder, which could be opened for loading and ejection by simply pulling back on a catch mounted on the left side of the frame behind the recoil shield. It was easily manipulated by the thumb of the right hand, and upon release the cylinder could be poked out sideways with the shooter's forefinger. Empty cases were removed by simply pushing back on an ejector rod to activate a star extractor. The six-shooter could then be quickly reloaded and the cylinder clicked back into place. Sights Sights were the basic rounded front blade and topstrap notch. The finish on all military revolvers was blue, though civilian guns could be had nickeled or with other special finishes and embellishments. History and usage The M1892's counter-clockwise cylinder rotation tended to force the cylinder out of alignment with the frame over time, and this was exacerbated by relatively weak lockwork used to \\"time\\", or match individual chambers to the barrel. In 1908, Colt improved and strengthened the lockwork, and changed the cylinder rotation to a clockwise movement. A Model 1892 revolver was recovered from the USS Maine after it exploded in Havana Harbor in 1898. It was presented to then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, who would later become President of the United States. Roosevelt brandished this pistol to rally his Rough Riders during the famed charge up San Juan Hill on July 1, 1898. This revolver was on display at Sagamore Hill and was stolen from there in 1963, recovered and then stolen again in 1990. It was recovered in 2006 and returned to Sagamore Hill on June 14, 2006. This revolver was thought of as a decent handgun for its time, but complaints arose from the military concerning the revolver's cartridge chambering. Beginning in 1899, combat reports arose from the Philippines campaign regarding the poor performance of the M1892's .38-caliber ammunition. Specifically, users complained that the .38 bullet repeatedly failed to stop charging Filipino rebels at close ranges, even when hit multiple times. The complaints caused the U.S. Army to hurriedly issue stocks of .45 caliber revolvers, and played a central role in its decision to replace the M1892 with the .45 Colt M1909 New Service revolver in 1909. In the rush to furnish arms to the rapidly expanding Army and Navy after the United States entered World War I, surplus stocks of these old Colts were inspected, refurbished as needed and then issued to rear- echelon Army troops and Navy officers as a substitute standard side arm. Modifications and variants During its service life, the M1892 series received modifications to the basic design, including cylinder lockwork, the addition (in 1894) of an interlock between the cylinder latch and the trigger and hammer, different barrel markings, the addition of a lanyard ring in the Model 1901, and a reduction of bore diameter in the Model 1903 in an effort to increase accuracy.

Early life He was born as Bob Benge about 1762 in the Overhill Cherokee town of Toqua, to a Cherokee woman and a Scots-Irish trader named John Benge, who lived full-time among the Cherokee and had taken a \\"country wife.\\" They also had a daughter Lucy. Benge stood out physically because of the red hair he inherited from his father. Under the Cherokee matrilineal kinship and clan system, children were considered born into their mother's family and clan. Their mother's eldest brother was considered the most important male figure in their growing up, especially for boys. The children were reared largely in Cherokee culture and identified as Cherokee. The available sources strongly imply, but do not prove, that young Benge and his sister Lucy were half- siblings of Sequoyah, also known as George Guess. They were related to maternal great-uncles Old Tassel and Doublehead. When Dragging Canoe and his party moved southwest from eastern Tennessee in 1777, trader John Benge also moved his family to Running Water, one of the Chickamauga Lower Towns in the Piedmont. Bob Benge, who later became known as \\"Captain Bench,\\" his half- brother 'The Tail,' and cousin Tahlonteeskee were around 20 years old, they joined their maternal uncle John Watts as warriors to fight against European- American settlers who were encroaching on their territory. These armed confrontations began soon after the Americans had gained independence from Great Britain in their revolutionary war, and began migrating over the Appalachian Mountains to settle in Cherokee territory. Exploits as a warrior While living at Running Water (now Whiteside, Tennessee), Benge had met members of the Shawnee band of Chiksika and his brother Tecumseh. Benge often took part in their raids and forays against the Americans. In one of the early raids, in spring 1777, Benge is said to have captured two women while raiding near Fort Blackmore, Virginia.Robert Addison, History of Scott County, Virginia p. 83. Afterward he often ran with warriors led by Doublehead out of Coldwater Town at the head of Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee River (now in northern Alabama). He is credited with saving the population of the town of Ustally in 1788, which American John Sevier had slated for destruction. Benge raided as far north as the Ohio River, deep into southwestern Virginia, all of the Washington District of North Carolina, and southeast into Georgia and South Carolina. These included a joint raid between his party and that of Doublehead into the Kentucky hunting grounds. Brown family Benge was at Running Water when word came that the Cherokee had reached agreement with John Sevier to exchange hostages. The Brown family was mentioned by name, a group of settlers taken captive in 1788 when they reached Nickajack, after passing through the Five Lower Towns on the Tennessee River. Only three of the surviving Brown family were still held by the Cherokee; the other three had been passed to the Muscogee. Joseph Brown and his sister Polly were brought immediately to Running Water, but when runners were sent to Crow Town to retrieve Jane, their youngest sister, her owner refused to surrender her. Benge mounted his horse and hefted his famous axe, saying, \\"I will bring the girl, or the owner's head\\". The next morning he returned with Jane. The three were later transferred to Sevier at Coosawattee. Cavett's Station Goodspeed's \\"Aboriginal Map of Tennessee\\", showing the various forts and frontier stations in what is now East Tennessee, circa 1780s and 1790s. White's Fort is now Knoxville, Campbell's Station is now Farragut, Southwest Point is now Kingston, Gamble's Station corresponds to modern Walland, McTeer's Station was near modern Seymour, and Gillespie Station was near modern Maryville. Cavett's Station, located in the Bearden area of West Knoxville, was sacked by the Cherokee in 1793. Benge came to a parting of the ways with his former close ally, Doublehead, over an incident at Cavett's Station. In 1793 John Watts led a raid on the Holston River settlements, aiming at White's Fort (now Knoxville, Tennessee). There, Benge negotiated the surrender of the garrison and its defenders with the promise of safe passage. Doublehead and his band violated the parole by attacking and killing them all: men, women, and children, as soon as they were outside the small fort. This was over the pleas of Benge, Watts, and James Vann to honor the agreement. Benge never operated again with Doublehead after the incident. The massacre also contributed to a bitter animosity between Doublehead and Vann that led to a division between the Upper and Lower Towns after the end of the wars in 1794. Death Benge raided as far as the westernmost counties of Virginia, attacking Gate City, Virginia in 1791, and Moccasin Gap and Kane's Gap on Powell Mountain in 1793.Addison, p. 3. He was killed April 6, 1794 in an ambush in what is in what is now Wise County, Virginia during an extended raid deep into enemy-held territory, while escorting prisoners captured from a settlement earlier in the day back to the Lower Towns. The militia took his scalp and sent it to the Governor of Virginia, Henry Lee III, who sent it on to President George Washington. Credit for killing Benge went to militia leader Vincent Hobbs Jr, son of one of the original white settlers of current Lee County, Virginia.

Early life Geoffrey Haward Martin was born in Essex on 27 September 1928. He was educated at Colchester Royal Grammar School, where he published a history of the school in the school magazine, The Colcestrian, before reprinting it as a separate volume with additions and corrections, The History of Colchester Royal Grammar School (1539‚Äì1947), published by the Borough of Colchester. In 1947 he went to Merton College, Oxford, to read history, specialising in Richard II and John of Gaunt. Soon afterwards he published his DPhil on the medieval history of Ipswich. Academic career Having completed research at the University of Manchester during 1952, Martin joined University College, Leicester as a lecturer in economic history. Whilst at Leicester, he was a Reader in History, 1966‚Äì73, a Public Orator, 1971‚Äì74, and a Professor of History, 1973‚Äì82. He was also for a term (1975‚Äì80) head of the university's history department and Pro-Vice-Chancellor, 1979‚Äì82. He was a visiting professor at Carleton University, Ottawa, for the years 1958‚Äì59 and 1967‚Äì68. In 1971 he returned to Merton College, where he had studied for his DPhil, as a visiting research Fellow and in 1990 became a senior research Fellow. In 1997 Martin and his former Oxford tutor Dr Roger Highfield published the first official history of the college, A History of Merton. Keeper of the Public Records In May 1982 Martin was appointed Keeper of Public Records at the Public Record Office (PRO), where he remained until his retirement in 1988. He was a member of the executive committee of the International Council on Archives from 1984 and 1988; and he also played a leading role in the formation of the Association of Commonwealth Archivists in 1984, serving as its first chairman. In 1985 he led the first official delegation of British archivists to China, and he often represented the PRO overseas. He ensured that the 900th anniversary of Domesday Book in 1986 was celebrated with a major public exhibition, held at Chancery Lane in the former Rolls Chapel. It was a great success, linking sound scholarship with the use of the then new technology of \\"talking heads\\". He remains the only career academic who has ever had charge of the national archives, and later felt obliged to criticise the appointment of another head of the archives who he considered to be unsuitable for the job. Extramural activities and honours He served as chairman of the council of the British Records Association from 1982 to 1991, and later became one of its vice-presidents. From 1984 to 1988 he was a vice-president of the Royal Historical Society. From 1987 to 1994 he was a member of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England. He and his wife had a second home in the Lake District, and from 1999 to 2002 he served as president of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society. He was appointed CBE in 1986. Later life, personal life and death After his retirement Martin was appointed to a research chair at the University of Essex, where he taught on the Second World War. In 2002 he provided the introduction to the Penguin edition of Domesday Book, the first wholly English language edition of Domesday. In 1953, Martin married Janet Hamer, another historian, and they had four children. Through his wife Martin developed his attachment to the Lake District, and in 1969 they bought a house there: when illness eventually reduced his activities during 2003, this was where he retired. He died on 20 December 2007, aged 79.

While the existence of FDC tumors was predicted by Lennert in 1978, the tumor wasn't fully recognized as its own cancer until 1986 after characterization by Monda et al. It accounts for only 0.4% of soft tissue sarcomas, but has significant recurrent and metastatic potential and is considered an intermediate grade malignancy. The major hurdle in treating FDCS has been misdiagnosis. It is a newly characterized cancer, and because of its similarities in presentation and markers to lymphoma, both Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin subtypes, diagnosis of FDCS can be difficult. With recent advancements in cancer biology better diagnostic assays and chemotherapeutic agents have been made to more accurately diagnose and treat FDCS. Signs and symptoms  Follicular dendritic cells are localized in germinal centers of lymphoid follicles and have an integral role in regulation of the germinal center reaction and present antigens to B cells. Most cases of FDCS develop in the lymph nodes, but about 30% develop in extranodal sites. In 1998 the largest study on the disease was a retrospective review with fifty-one patients. Of these fifty-one patients, no conclusive pattern was found in regard to age, sex, race or presentation. The median patient age was 41 (range 14‚Äì76), and while most cases presented with cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, 17 presented in extranodal sites including the liver, spleen, bowel and pancreas. With such a range of patient histories no definitive cause has been linked to FDCS. There has, however, been some evidence that previous exposure to the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) or diagnosis of Castleman's disease can increase the risk of developing FDCS--medical literature in 2000 reported approximately 12% of all cases of FDC tumors are associated with EBV, with variance in different organs, but the role of EBV remains unclear in FDC tumor pathogenesis; and EBV does not appear to play a role in the transformation process of Castleman's disease to FDC sarcoma because all cases the report found associated with Castleman's disease were EBV negative. Symptoms of FDCS vary, and are largely dependent on the part of the body in which the tumor develops. The most common symptom is painless swelling in lymph nodes. This symptom alone, however, is nonconclusive, as it is associated with many other diseases, including the common cold. Other symptoms include cough, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, weight loss and tiredness. In cases that present in extranodal sites outside of the head and neck region, organ specific symptoms are observed. DiagnosisStaining= Proliferation of FDC cells is characteristic of many neoplastic conditions including follicular hyperplasia, follicular lymphoma, nodular lymphocyte predominate Hodgkin‚Äôs disease and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Despite finally being recognized as its own disease in 1986, diagnosis of FDCS is still difficult. FDC cells are large, contain two nuclei, and form clusters with lymphocytes making them difficult to distinguish in staining. These cells are best visualized with immunostaining using the FDC markers CD21, CD35, R4/23, clusterin, and KiM4p. Marker analysis has also led to debate over the origin of the cell type; it coexpresses CD45, a leukocyte common antigen, and CD15, a monocyte common antigen. Because of the debate and difficulty of staining, pathologic diagnosis often requires morphologic, cytochemical and electron microscope analysis as well. =Cellular mutations= Cellular abnormalities found within the FDCS tumor have been exploited for diagnostic purposes. Characteristically, FDCS have mircotubuloreticular structures (MTRS) and increased levels of intracellular clusterin. MTRS contribute to microtubule formation of many structures, including the mitotic spindle, during cell division. This contributes to many of the hallmarks of cancer, including proliferative signaling, growth activation, and replicative immortality. Clusterin is a heterodimeric protein that aids in the clearance of cellular debris and is involved with apoptosis. Clusterin can be stained to help distinguish FDCS and is involved in the many important cancer hallmarks, including resistance to cell death and evading growth suppressors. TreatmentCHOP= At the time of the follicular dendritic cell sarcoma discovery, information on the effect of chemotherapy and radiation on it was nonexistent. The best physicians could do was try existing chemotherapeutic agents. With no evidence of the clinical benefit of chemotherapy, many of the first cases were treated solely with complete resection and/or radiation. However, 12 of 31 patients who had surgery alone as primary treatment relapsed. Of the patients who received surgery and radiation, 2 of 8 relapsed. It became apparent that better treatment options were necessary. Being so similar to lymphomas, physicians began using a common leukemia and non- Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma chemotherapy regimen on FDCS patients: CHOP. Chemical structure of cyclophosphamide The CHOP regimen consists of Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Oncovin, and Prednisone (CHOP). They all exploit different pathways common in cancer cells. Cyclophosphamide slows or stops cell growth. It targets cells that are rapidly dividing, which include cancer cells that are self-sufficient in growth signals and insensitive to antigrowth signals. More importantly, the biological actions of cyclophosphamide are dose- dependent. At high doses it is very cytotoxic; its metabolite phosphoromide adds an alkyl group to the N7 position on guanine resulting in arrested growth and cell death. The metabolite is only formed in cells with low levels of cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), resulting in relatively low chemotherapeutic toxicity in other non-cancer cells like bone marrow. It is also an immunosuppressant and decreases the inflammatory response. At low doses, while it is less cytotoxic, it shows some anti-angiogenic properties. The mechanism is not fully understood; it is thought that it interferes with the VEGF growth factors produced in and around the tumor microenvironment. Doxorubicin interferes with cell growth and replication by intercalating in DNA. This stops topoisomerase II from relaxing the DNA strands and inhibits transcription. Recent studies have also shown that doxorubicin may be involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. An important hallmark of cancer, Akt is part of the cell survival pathways by inhibiting apoptosis. There is also evidence that Akt is involved in angiogenesis and vascular maturation. Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway mediates VEGF production in cells. Therefore, doxorubicin has a dual role in cancer treatment: it inhibits cell survival (causes apoptosis), and decreases angiogenesis. Oncovin, more commonly known as vincristine, is a mitotic inhibitor. It binds to tubulin dimers, inhibiting the assembly of microtubule structures like the cytoskeleton and mitotic spindle. Although this drug still cannot strictly target cancer cells, cancer cells have a higher average turnover of microtubules making them more susceptible to the cytotoxicity of oncovin. Prednisone, the last drug in the CHOP combination therapy is a corticosteroid that acts as an immunosuppressant. Although some results were seen in FDCS patients treated with CHOP, they were far from consistent. Using a chemotherapy regimen designed for another cancer is an archaic ‚Äúguess-and-check‚Äù way of treating a disease. In 2008 the largest review of FDCS was published as a retrospective analysis on 98 patients and the authors recommended that surgery with no adjuvant treatment be the standard for FDCS treatment. Patients treated with surgery alone had a recurrence rate of 40% and those treated with adjuvant therapy after surgery did not have a significantly different recurrence rate. Radiation and/or chemotherapy had no significant effect in improving patients‚Äô disease-free survival. With developments in our understanding of the hallmarks of cancer, however, novel approaches to specifically targeting and treating FDCS are being developed. =(PEG)-liposomal doxorubicin= One such development is in the delivery of doxorubicin. While it is an effective inducer of apoptosis, doxorubicin is quickly filtered out of the body. By loading a PEG-liposome with doxorubicin the circulation time and localization to tumors greatly increases. Cancerous tumors characteristically have extensive angiogenesis and leaky vasculatures, which causes the PEG-liposomes to naturally accumulate in the tumor. This also allows for patients to receive lower and fewer doses of the drug and experience fewer side effects. =Taxotere and gemcitabine= Chemical structure of Gemcitabine Chemical structure of Taxotere Newer cases are also starting to be treated by taxotere and gemcitabine. Taxotere is similar to Oncovin used in CHOP; it irreversibly binds beta tubulin halting formation of microtubules. Taxotere has an added benefit though; it also phosphorylates bcl-2 to halt the anti-apoptotic pathway. The dual effect of taxotere on integral cancer pathways makes it a more potent drug than Oncovin. Gemcitabene is a nucleoside analog and when incorporated into DNA during replication leads to apoptosis; the fluorine on the 2‚Äô carbon atom stops other nucleosides from attaching. The most important part of this combination therapy, however, is the synergism between the drugs. While researchers are not entirely sure of the mechanism, there is evidence of synergistic effects of taxotere and gemcitabine when used in combination. This allows for decreased dosages of each single agent with an increased apoptotic response. Research All advances in the understanding and treatment of FDCS come from advances made in other cancers. Funding for research is hard to come by and being such a rare cancer FDCS does not receive monetary priority. CHOP, Gemcitabine, and Taxotere were all initially developed for other cancers, but mutually mutated pathways allow for its use in FDCS. The hallmarks of cancer have helped physicians realize that there are biological commonalities between seemingly very different cancer types that can be exploited to develop new and better treatment plans.

Leftmost is John Sung. Andrew Gih or Ji Zhiwen (; January 10, 1901‚ÄìFebruary 13, 1985) was a Chinese Protestant evangelist who cofounded the Bethel Worldwide Evangelistic Band in 1931 and founded the Evangelize China Fellowship in 1947, both initially based in Shanghai. After the political situation worsened in China due to the communist revolution, he and his wife Dorcas Zhang would move to Hong Kong and eventually retire at the Los Angeles headquarters of Evangelize China Fellowship in 1978. Biography Andrew Gih was born in Shanghai. His father was a Confucian scholar that offered Gih a traditional Confucian education, and his mother was a Buddhist who practiced Chinese folk religions. He would attend a China Inland Mission middle school when he was 18 to learn English, but was introduced to Christianity and was eventually baptized as a Christian. After gaining an interest in evangelistic activities under the influence of the preaching of Paget Wilkes, Gih was initially associated with the Bethel Mission in Shanghai, founded by the Chinese medical doctor Mary Stone and the American missionary Jennie Hughes. Gih, together with John Sung and three other men from the Bethel Mission, would establish the Bethel Worldwide Evangelistic Band in 1931 in Shanghai. Between 1931 and 1935, their band reportedly traveled over 50,000 miles, visited 133 cities, held nearly 3,400 revival meetings throughout China, and saw an estimated 50,000 Christian converts. In 1933, Sung left the movement, and Gih continued it by using again the name Bethel Mission until 1947, when he founded the Evangelize China Fellowship (ECF) and the Mandarin Church in Shanghai. After the Communist victory in China's civil war, he moved to Hong Kong, and asked his co-worker Paul Shen to establish ECF in Taiwan, where he also opened an orphanage. Despite his short stay in Hong Kong until 1951, his revivalist message has impacted his followers to create independent denominational churches in Hong Kong. Andrew Gih would become well known as an evangelist in mainland China and amongst overseas Chinese communities. In 1950, he received an honorary doctorate from Oregon Bible Seminary in the United States and, in the next year, he began an evangelistic tour in Southeast Asia, traveling to the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. Throughout his years, Gih would establish a number of orphanages, primary and secondary schools, and bible colleges. He would eventually retired in 1978 and move to the Los Angeles headquarters of Chinese Evangelization Society. However, after suffering from tuberculosis and lung cancer, Andrew Gih died on February 13, 1985. During his lifetime, the ECF has grown to include 375 churches, two seminaries and seven schools in seven Asian countries in addition to the United States.

Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, vol. 2, 99 B.C.‚Äì31 B.C. (New York: American Philological Association, 1952), pp. 6‚Äì7, 66‚Äì 68, 76, 79, 83, 135, 137 (note 13), 629. He is noted for his peace initiatives, which failed, and for sponsoring the Lex Valeria that created the dictatorship of Sulla. Life and career Flaccus belonged to the patrician gens Valeria, one of the most important gentes of the Republic. Flaccus' ancestors reached the consulship over five generations; his grandfather was consul in 152, his father was consul in 131 and also Flamen Martialis, the sacred priest of Mars. In addition, Flaccus had two homonymous cousins active during his lifetime: Gaius Valerius Flaccus, who became consul 93, and Lucius Valerius Flaccus, consul in 86. The earliest official capacity recorded for Lucius Flaccus is monetalis (\\"moneyer\\"), a common preliminary to the political career track for young men of senatorial rank. In 108 or 107 BC, Flaccus issued coinage depicting Victory and Mars. Flaccus was elected praetor sometime before 103 BC. In 100, he was the colleague of Gaius Marius for Marius' sixth consulship. He was so little at variance with Marius that his contemporary Rutilius Rufus, in his non-extant history, disparaged him as \\"more a servant than a colleague.\\"Quoted by Plutarch, Marius 28.8. In 97, Flaccus was censor with the Marcus Antonius who was consul in 99 BC. The duties of the censors included revising the census, which not only registered citizens, but determined social rank (ordo). Although no figures have survived from this census, Italians were registered as citizens in great numbers, presumably to strengthen the political power of those likely to support the Marian faction.E. Badian, \\"Caepio and Norbanus,\\" Historia 1957, as reprinted in Studies in Greek and Roman History (New York 1964), p. 48. Flaccus and Antonius expelled Marcus Duronius from the senate because as tribune he had abrogated a sumptuary law passed by Publius Licinius Crassus.Fasti Capitolini, Degrassi 54f., 128, 478f.; Valerius Maximus 2.9.5. They also reappointed Marcus Aemilius Scaurus as princeps senatus.Asconius, note to In Scaurum 18 and 22c. Flaccus himself was recognized as princeps perhaps as early as 92‚Äì91 BC,Robin Seager, \\"Sulla,\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History (Cambridge University Press, 1994), 2nd ed., vol. 9, p. 181 online. but certainly in the census of 86. Theodor Mommsen erroneously thought that Sulla had abolished the position and that Flaccus was the last princeps.Francis X. Ryan, Rank and Participation in the Roman Senate (Franz Steiner Verlag, 1998), p. 191 online and p. 194. Denarius issued by L. Valerius Flaccus in 108/107 BC, depicting Victory, and Mars flanked by a flamen's cap and stalk of grain Flaccus served as interrex in 82,Cicero, Ad Atticum 9.15.2, De Lege Agraria contra Rullum 3.5, Pro Sexto Roscio Amerino 125; Appian, Bellum civile 1.98. presiding over the centuriate assembly for the election of Sulla as dictator, who in turn made Flaccus his magister equitum (\\"Master of the Horse\\"),Fasti Capitolini in Degrassi 54f., 130, 484f. and remained so until 79 BC. =Religious office= Lucius Flaccus was flamen MartialisCicero, Pro Rabirio Perduellionis Reo 27, De Divinatione 1.104, Varro, De lingua latina 6.21. The passages from Cicero's treatise on divination and from Varro less likely refer to the Lucius Valerius Flaccus who was consul in 131 and also a flamen Martialis, but the reference from Rab. Perd. points to the consul of 100. when he died, sometime after the cooptation of Julius Caesar to the pontifical college in 73 and before that of the Publius Sulpicius Galba who was praetor around 66.Ryan, Rank and Participation, pp. 191‚Äì194, offers a highly detailed discussion of evidence for his date of death. The year Flaccus acquired the priesthood is undetermined. The iconography of coinage he issued as monetalis in 108 or 107 BC includes a flamen's distinctive cap. His father also had served as the high priest of Mars, and the image may refer to this heritage; since sons often succeeded fathers in religious office, it is possible that the coin also marks the beginning of his own priesthood. Role in civil war CiceroCicero, Ad Atticum 8.3.6. lists Lucius Flaccus among those who preferred dealing with Cinna to destroying their country through civil strife. Neither Cinna nor Sulla could lay claim to complete constitutional legitimacy, but during the period 86 to 83 BC, no former consuls supported Sulla.Michael Lovano, The Age of Cinna: Crucible of Late Republican Rome (Franz Steiner Verlag, 2002), p. 55. As princeps senatus and the oldest living consularis, Flaccus took the lead in attempting negotiations with Sulla, anticipating his return to Italy with troops after his peace settlement with Mithridates VI of Pontus in the fall of 85 BC. By this time, Lucius's cousin (also named Lucius Valerius Flaccus), the suffect consul who had filled Marius's term in 86, had taken up his proconsular province of Asia; in early 85, he was killed in a mutiny led by the pro-Marian officer Fimbria. The murder is assumed to have influenced the feelings of the Valerii Flacci regarding the Cinnan-Marian faction.Lovano, The Age of Cinna, p. 81; Christoph F. Konrad, Plutarch's Sertorius: A Historical Commentary (University of North Carolina Press, 1994), p. 86 online. In an address to the senate, Flaccus urged concordia (\\"harmonious order\\") and took the initiative by sending envoys to Sulla in Greece. In the meantime, Cinna and Carbo arranged to prolong their consulship for a second term in 84 by spinning Sulla's imminent return as a state of emergency, against which they also began to assemble troops. Flaccus and the \\"peace party\\" at Rome appear not to have mounted any opposition to this action. The Cinnans' fears were confirmed when Sulla made it clear to the senatorial envoys that he would not dismiss his army when he reached Italy. After the mutinous murder of Cinna, Carbo rejected peace negotiations. So did Sulla.Lovano, The Age of Cinna, pp. 105‚Äì113, limited preview online. Flaccus was chosen in 82 BC by the senate ‚Äì at the instigation of Sulla ‚Äì as interrex, the official required for holding elections if for some reason the previous year's consuls were unable to do so. In this case, both consuls were dead: Carbo had by now been defeated in battle and executed by the young Pompeius Magnus. Sulla sent a letter to Flaccus and the senateAppian, Bellum civile 1.98; the letter from Sulla is discussed at length in H. Bellen, \\"Sullas Brief an den interrex L. Valerius Flaccus. Zur Genese der sullanischen Diktatur,\\" Historia 24 (1975) 555-569. The letter may have preceded Flaccus's speech to the senate. in which he urged, given the chaotic state in which Rome found itself, that the appointment of a dictator would do more to restore order than the messy business of elections. Although the office of dictator had constitutional precedent, with frequent dictatores holding short-term military commands in the Early Republic, there had been no Roman dictator for 120 years, since the Hannibalic War. Sulla furthermore pressed to remove the term limit of six months from the office.Cicero, Ad Atticum 9.15.2, Leges Agrariae 3.5, Pro Sexto Roscio Amerino 125; Appian, Bellum civile 1.98; Erik Hildinger, Swords Against the Senate: The Rise of the Roman Army and the Fall of the Republic (De Capo Press, 2002), p. 209 online. As interrex, Flaccus took Sulla's hint; instead of nominating consules suffecti to fill the vacancies left by the deaths of Cinna and Carbo, he introduced a bill to the comitia appointing Sulla as dictator.H.H. Scullard, From the Gracchi to Nero: A History of Rome from 133 B.C. to A.D. 68 (Routledge, 1988), p. 79 online. The legislation was therefore known as the Lex Valeria by the gentilic name of its sponsor. At this time, Flaccus was also made magister equitum.Fast. Cap. in Degrassi 54f., 130, 484f. Flaccus is thought to have influenced his cousin Gaius Valerius Flaccus to support, or at least to accept the necessity of, Sulla's regime. Gaius was the brother of the Lucius Flaccus who was murdered in Asia in 85; he was governor of Gallia Transalpina and most likely Cisalpina in the mid-80s, and was also a recent and possibly still current governor of one or both of the Spanish provinces. He thus would have commanded the largest number of troops in the western empire outside of Italy.Bruce W. Frier, \\"Sulla's Propaganda: The Collapse of the Cinnan Republic,\\" American Journal of Philology 92 (1971), p. 597. The concession of the Valerii Flacci was a significant factor in the establishment of the Sullan regime. Selected bibliography * Lovano, Michael. The Age of Cinna: Crucible of Late Republican Rome.

On 1 January 1994 the ownership of these vehicles was transferred to the DB's legal successor Deutsche Bahn AG and its subsidiaries or business areas. The Class 614 is a direct evolution of the Class 624 / 634 and only differs from them in a few points of detail. As a result, the technical section will only cover these differences.  History  Prototypes = In 1971 the prototypes, 614 001 + 914 001 + 614 002 and 614 003 + 914 002 + 614 004, were delivered. Testing was carried out from Trier along the Moselle valley and into the Eifel. Unlike the production vehicles the prototypes had a tilting systems. = Production units = Full production by MAN SE and the Uerdingen Waggonfabrik began in 1973. The first series of 25 three-coach units was delivered at the time when so-called \\"pop liveries\\" were in vogue and so they were painted in stone-grey and orange. Immediately following the first batch were the 15 units of the second series delivered in 1975 and stabled at Brunswick locomotive depot. These were already painted in the new ocean blue and beige livery. = Operations = 614 at Soltau station There are a total of 42 Class 614 three-car units, which are stationed at Nuremberg and Brunswick. In the early years, Trier was also a base for these DMUs. The Brunswick 614's have mainly worked in the Harz and Weser Uplands since their introduction. In doing so they often ran on former East-West trunk lines, which lost their significance after the partition of Germany. The most important termini were Altenbeken, Bad Harzburg, Bad Lauterberg, Bielefeld, Brunswick, Bodenburg, G√∂ttingen, Hamelin, Hildesheim, Kreiensen, L√∂hne, Northeim, Ottbergen, Paderborn, Salzgitter-Lebenstedt, and Walkenried. During some timetable periods they also called at Lemgo, M√ºnster, Nordhausen, Osnabr√ºck, Oldenburg, Rahden, Uelzen and Wilhelmshaven. Currently the units all operate in the standard configuration as three-car multiples, whereas in former years they were frequently run as just two-car units or sometimes in fours. Quite often they formed part of mixed multiples, for example: 614+914+934+634. Meanwhile, following the transfer of numerous lines to private firms as a result of competition, and the delivery of the Class 648.25 to DB Regio, the Brunswick DMUs have largely withdrawn from these classic routes. Instead they have been used on atypical routes, like e.g. Leer - Nieuweschans, Emden Hbf - Emden-Au√üenhafen, Minden - Rotenburg, Uelzen - Bremen and Hanover ‚Äì Soltau - Buchholz, although currently only the last two routes are still worked by them. The Brunswick Class 628's freed up from other locations were expected to replace the remaining 614's during 2008. Several vehicles have already been set aside and scrapped, several were moved to Hamm Rbf and are hoping for a better future there. The Nuremberg 614's are underway in the Upper Palatinate (Oberpfalz) and in Franconia (Franken), working such routes as Forchheim‚ÄìEbermannstadt, F√ºrth‚ÄìCadolzburg, F√ºrth‚ÄìMarkt Erlbach and Nuremberg‚ÄìSimmelsdorf-H√ºttenbach/Neuhaus an der Pegnitz. Here too only three- coach trains are used, whilst previously several 934's were stationed at Nuremberg in order to be able to form four-car multiples. These formations were not liked by drivers because the lack of engine power on the 614 was only too obvious on inclines. The use of the Nuremberg VT 614's is coming to an end, because in December 2008 new VT 648s were to be used on most of the routes in the Nuremberg diesel network. A number of class 614 units have been sold on to CFR in Romania, where they form CFR's Class 76. Some have been partially rebuilt by Remarul 16 Februarie with new driver's cabs and MTU powerplants.  Differences from 624/634  Even though their external appearance is somewhat different, the variations between Classes 614 and 624 are not that great. The following sections describe their main differences; in all other respects the classes are the same. = Running gear = The bogies were slightly changed. They are supported, as on the 634's, by air bags, but are controlled by 4 air suspension valves on each coach (apart from 614 001 to 004). The resulting four-point support changes over to a three-point support at speeds below 25 km/h using a pressure control on the wheelset bearing, which deactivates one of the valves. Instead of the mechanical anti-skid system on the 624/634 the Class 614 has electronic anti-skid control. = Engine = The D 3650 HM 12 U diesel engine from MAN is largely the same as that on the 624/634, but is driven at a higher final speed of 2150 rpm and is rated at 370 kW/500 hp, but only set at 331 kW/450 hp (as is normal on the 624/634). The handpump fitted to many 624/634's for topping up the cooling water is not installed on the 614. The fan equipment for the coolant water system can be set to emergency operation by the driver should the fan valve fail, something which can only be done in a workshop on the 624/634. 26 coaches (13 sets) have been equipped with new Cummins diesel engines in recent years. These engines have the considerably higher power of 448 kW. However, this remotoring programme was stopped when the operational future of the Class 614 became markedly bleaker. = Heating = On modernisation all 614's, and even the 914 centre coaches, were given a timer that enables the time to be set for coaches to be preheated. In this way their preparation time can be shortened. At the same time standard thermostat valves from trade were installed in the 1st class compartments. = Door operation = The Class 614 has door control with selective door opening and door sensory systems. The doors, which on the 624/634 were not always easy to open, are assisted by compressed air. As part of modernisation in the mid-90s a warning tone device was retrofitted and - unlike the 624 - also an anti-jam system. Some of the vehicles also have warning lights in the area of the door. Shortly after the turn of the millennium several 614's were converted to TAV (technikbasierte Abfertigungsverfahren) automatic door operation. Door control computers were installed, door handles removed and replaced by door opening buttons and photoelectric beams. Because the new door control system was not very reliable and the vehicles were approaching the end of their service life the TAV installation programme was halted after a few years, even before the end of the remotoring programme. = Passenger information systems = Until their modernisation the 614's had the destination blinds familiar from the 624/634 series. These were later replaced by two electronic dot matrix displays on each VT coach. The control of all displays in the train was achieved by entering the destination code number into Brose entry devices that are installed on every driver's console. In addition several Nuremberg 614's were given early passenger information displays. = Passenger areas = Interior of 614 002 after modernisation (31 March 2006) The interior of the Class 614 always set it apart clearly from its older brethren. On delivery the coaches had adjustable seats with individual, fabric-covered cushions. The colour of the seat covers as well as the imitation leather arms and headrests varied, being either red-brown or green. The sides were screened with beige plastic. The 1st class compartment was largely the same as that on the 624/634. And whilst the interiors looked very smart, the colours were very much contemporary and were no longer up to date by the mid-1990s. During the course of the modernisation programme the 614's were given the first double-decker coaches delivered to the old Federal states and the y-coaches of well-known design with beige wall coverings and light green fabric-covered individual seats, some arranged facing each other, others all facing in the same direction. One unique feature is the folding table at every seat, some of which are now missing as a result of vandalism. As on the 624/634 the luggage compartment behind the cab, together with its loading doors, was omitted. The 1st class compartments were given pink wall coverings, blue tables and blue, adjustable individual seats with red head cushions. The last 914's to be modernised were each given two closed vacuum toilet systems, of which one is fitted for the disable. Later the remaining 914's were retrofitted with them. = Livery = 614 + 934 + 934 + 614 F√ºrth (Bay) Hbf, June 1987 The first series to be delivered, which went to Nuremberg depot, were painted in the contemporary 'pop' colour scheme. This was later changed on the 614 to a blood orange window stripe on a gravel grey background. This livery was retained until the coaches were modernised. The second series, delivered to Brunswick depot, was supplied in ocean-blue and beige. Unlike the 624/634 the 614 was given an additional thin blue decorative stripe above the line dividing the colours which lent the vehicles a more dynamic appearance. Almost all 614s were initially painted light grey and mint green for the redesign and, later on, traffic red and white. The only exception is unit 614 005 + 914 003 + 614 006 which was painted in gravel grey and orange on modernisation and preserved the 'pop' colour scheme into the new millennium. All other vehicles have since been repainted in the current scheme of traffic red and white.

He was the first of the slave-officers to govern Bengal. Biography Aibak was a Khitan of the Turco-Persian tradition. He was purchased as a slave by Iltutmish from the heirs of Ikhtiyar ad-Din Chust Qaba. Through his hard work and efforts, he managed to rise through the ranks, becoming the more powerful amongst the Maliks and titled Amir al-Majlis. He was given the iqta' of 28 wilayat in Sursuti by 1227. He was later stationed in Bihar. After the dismissal of Alauddin Jani, the Sultan appointed Aibak to be the next governor of Bengal. During his governorship, Aibak took on an expedition to South Bengal with the intention of capturing elephants. His expedition was successful, capturing a number of elephants, and dispatching several of them to the Sultan. Iltutmish was pleased with Aibak and conferred him the title of \\"Yughantat\\". Aibak married his daughter to Malik Qamaruddin Kiran Timur Khan. It is said that he was assassinated or poisoned in April 1236 AD by a rebellious courtier named Awar Khan Aibak. Awar Khan was quickly defeated and Sultan Iltutmish commanded Tughral Tughan Khan, who had succeeded Saifuddin in Bihar, to succeed as governor of Bengal following Saifuddin's death.King Lists, Bengal (History Files) See also *List of rulers of Bengal *History of Bengal *History of Bangladesh *History of India References Category:Rulers of Bengal Category:Governors of Bengal Category:1236 deaths Category:13th-century Indian Muslims Category:13th-century Indian monarchs Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Saifuddin Aibak"},{"id":"21763376","text":"U Minh is a township (th·ªã tr·∫•n) and capital town of U Minh District, C√† Mau Province, in Vietnam.

He also appeared on the compilation album Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles , which was the year's final number one. Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 1993, nine different albums topped the chart, based on electronic point of sale data provided by SoundScan Inc. In the issue of Billboard dated January 2, Garth Brooks was at number one with The Chase, the album's 13th week at number one. It held the top spot for three further weeks for a final total of 16 weeks atop the chart, meaning that Brooks had spent 90 weeks at number one in less than three years. In the fall, he returned to number one with his next album In Pieces, which spent seven weeks in the top spot. Brooks experienced a level of mainstream popularity and success in the early 1990s unprecedented for a country artist, making him one of the biggest-selling acts not only within the country market but across all genres. Billy Ray Cyrus also had two chart-toppers in 1993. In the issue of Billboard dated January 30, he returned to the top spot with Some Gave All, which had already spent 18 weeks at number one in 1992. In its second spell in the top spot, the album added a further 16 weeks to its total; its final total of 34 weeks in the top spot was the third-highest figure in the chart's history to date. Cyrus returned to number one in July with the album It Won't Be the Last; this would prove to be his final Top Country Albums number one. In July, George Strait spent a single week at number one with Pure Country, the soundtrack to the film of the same name in which he starred. It was the first soundtrack album to top the country albums chart for more than ten years. The following month, Alan Jackson gained his first number one with A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love). Jackson would go on to become one of the most successful country stars of the 1990s, achieving five consecutive number ones on the albums chart between 1993 and 1998, and would remain a regular in the upper reaches of the chart well into the 21st century. The year's final chart-topper was Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles, a charity compilation album featuring various country artists performing songs originally recorded by the Eagles. Alan Jackson was the only artist who achieved a number one in his own right in 1993 and also appeared on the album, which held the top spot for the final eight weeks of the year. Chart history Billy Ray Cyrus spent 16 weeks at number one with Some Gave All, which had already spent 18 weeks in the top spot in the previous year.

In a standard n-tape Turing machine, n heads move independently along n tracks. In a n-track Turing machine, one head reads and writes on all tracks simultaneously. A tape position in a n-track Turing Machine contains n symbols from the tape alphabet. It is equivalent to the standard Turing machine and therefore accepts precisely the recursively enumerable languages.  Formal definition  A multitrack Turing machine with n-tapes can be formally defined as a 6-tuple M= \\\\langle Q, \\\\Sigma, \\\\Gamma, \\\\delta, q_0, F \\\\rangle , where * Q is a finite set of states * \\\\Sigma is a finite set of symbols called the tape alphabet *\\\\Gamma \\\\in Q * q_0 \\\\in Q is the initial state * F \\\\subseteq Q is the set of final or accepting states. * \\\\delta: \\\\left(Q \\\\backslash F \\\\times \\\\Sigma^n \\\\right) \\\\rightarrow \\\\left( Q \\\\times \\\\Sigma^n \\\\times \\\\\\\\{L,R\\\\\\\\} \\\\right) is a partial function called the transition function. : Sometimes also denoted as \\\\delta \\\\left(Q_i,[x_1,x_2...x_n]\\\\right)=(Q_j,[y_1,y_2...y_n],d), where d \\\\in \\\\\\\\{L,R\\\\\\\\}.

Proof of equivalency to standard Turing machine This will prove that a two-track Turing machine is equivalent to a standard Turing machine. This can be generalized to a n-track Turing machine. Let L be a recursively enumerable language. Let M= \\\\langle Q, \\\\Sigma, \\\\Gamma, \\\\delta, q_0, F \\\\rangle be standard Turing machine that accepts L. Let M' is a two- track Turing machine. To prove M=M' it must be shown that M \\\\subseteq M' and M' \\\\subseteq M * M \\\\subseteq M' If all but the first track is ignored then M and M' are clearly equivalent. * M' \\\\subseteq M The tape alphabet of a one- track Turing machine equivalent to a two-track Turing machine consists of an ordered pair. The input symbol a of a Turing machine M' can be identified as an ordered pair [x,y] of Turing machine M. The one-track Turing machine is: M= \\\\langle Q, \\\\Sigma \\\\times {B}, \\\\Gamma \\\\times \\\\Gamma, \\\\delta ', q_0, F \\\\rangle with the transition function \\\\delta \\\\left(q_i,[x_1,x_2]\\\\right)=\\\\delta ' \\\\left(q_i,[x_1,x_2]\\\\right) This machine also accepts L.

The basic idea of a system theory in social science is to solve the classical problem of duality; mind-body, subject-object, form-content, signifier-signified, and structure- agency. System theory suggests that instead of creating closed categories into binaries (subject-object); the system should stay open so as to allow free flow of process and interactions. In this way the binaries are dissolved. Complex systems in nature‚Äîfor example, ecosystems‚Äîinvolve a dynamic interaction of many variables (e.g. animals, plants, insects and bacteria; predators and prey; climate, the seasons and the weather, etc.) These interactions can adapt to changing conditions but maintain a balance both between the various parts and as a whole; this balance is maintained through homeostasis. Human societies are complex systems, as it were, human ecosystems. Early humans, as hunter-gatherers, recognized and worked within the parameters of the complex systems in nature and their lives were circumscribed by the realities of nature. But they couldn't explain complex systems. Only in recent centuries did the need arise to define complex systems scientifically. Complex systems theories first developed in math in the late 19th century, then in biology in the 1920s to explain ecosystems, then to deal with artificial intelligence (cybernetics), etc. Anthropologist Gregory Bateson is the most influential and earliest founder of system theory in social sciences. In the 1940s, as a result of the Macy conferences, he immediately recognized its application to human societies with their many variables and the flexible but sustainable balance that they maintain. Bateson describes system as \\"any unit containing feedback structure and therefore competent to process information.\\"Gregory Bateson, A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind, 260. Thus an open system allows interaction between concepts and materiality or subject and the environment or abstract and real. In natural science, systems theory has been a widely used approach. Austrian biologist, Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy, developed the idea of the general systems theory (GST). The GST is a multidisciplinary approach of system analysis.  Main concepts in systems theory  Non- representational and non-referential = One of the central elements of the systems theory is to move away from the representational system to the non- representation of things. What it means is that instead of imposing mental concepts, which reduce complexity of a materiality by limiting the variations or malleability onto the objects, one should trace the network of things. According to Gregory Bateson, \\"ethos, eidos, sociology, economics, cultural structure, social structure, and all the rest of these words refer only to scientists' ways of putting the jigsaw puzzle.\\"G. Bateson and R. E. Donaldson, A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind (Cornelia & Michael Bessie Book, 1991), 50. The tracing rather than projecting mental images bring in sight material reality that has been obscured under the universalizing concepts. = Non-Cartesian = Since the European Enlightenment, the Western philosophy has placed the individual, as an indispensable category, at the center of the universe. Ren√© Descartes' famous aphorism, 'I think therefore I am' proves that a person is a rational subject whose feature of thinking brings the human into existence. The Cartesian subject, therefore, is a scientific individual who imposes mental concepts on things in order to control the nature or simply what exists outside his mind. This subject- centered view of the universe has reduced the complex nature of the universe. One of the biggest challenges for system theory is thus to displace or de- center the Cartesian subject as a center of a universe and as a rational being. The idea is to make human beings not a supreme entity but rather to situate them as any other being in the universe. The humans are not thinking Cartesian subject but they dwell alongside nature. This brings back the human to its original place and introduces nature in the equation. The systems theory, therefore, encourages a non-unitary subject in opposition to a Cartesian subject. = Complexity = Once the Cartesian individual is dissolved, the social sciences will move away from a subject-centered view of the world. The challenge is then how to non-represent empirical reality without reducing the complexity of a system. To put it simply, instead of representing things by us let the things speak through us. These questions led materialists philosophers such as Deleuze and Guattari to develop a \\"science\\" for understanding reality without imposing our mental projections. The way they encourage is instead of throwing conceptual ideas we should do tracing. Tracing requires one to connect disparate assemblages or appendages not into a unified center but rather into a rhizome or an open system.Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, = Open system and closed system = Ludwig Bertalanffy describes two types of systems: open system and closed system. The open systems are systems that allow interactions between its internal elements and the environment. An open system is defined as a \\"system in exchange of matter with its environment, presenting import and export, building-up and breaking-down of its material components.\\"L. Bertalanffy, General system theory (G. Braziller New York, 1988). 141. For example, living organism. Closed systems, on the other hand, are considered to be isolated from their environment. For instance, thermodynamics that applies to closed systems.  Tracing \\"systems theory\\" in anthropology  Marx‚ÄìWeber debates = Although the term 'system theory' is never mentioned in the work of Karl Marx and Max Weber, the fundamental idea behind systems theory does penetrate deeply in to their understanding of social reality. One can easily see the challenges that both Marx and Weber faced in their work. Breaking away from Hegelian speculative philosophy, Marx developed a social theory based on historical materialism, arguing that it is not consciousness that determines being, but in fact, it is social being that determines consciousness.Karl Marx. (1970[1946]). The German Ideology. Ed. C. J. Arthur. New York: International Publishers Co. More specifically, it is human beings' social activity, labor, that causes, shapes, and informs human thinking. Based on labor, Marx develops his entire social theory that specifically questions reified, bourgeois capitalism. Labor, class conflict, commodity, value, surplus-value, bourgeoisie, and proletariat are thus central concepts in Marxian social theory. In contrast to the Cartesian \\"pure and rational subjectivity,\\" Marx introduced social activity as the force that produces rationality. He was interested in finding sophisticated, scientific universal laws of society, though contrary to positivist mechanistic approaches which take facts as given, and then develop causal relationship out of them. Max Weber found Marxist ideas useful, however, limited in explaining complex societal practices and activities. Drawing on hermeneutic tradition, Weber introduced multiple rationalities in the modern schema of thinking and used interpretive approach in understanding the meaning of a phenomenon placed in the webs of significance. Contrary to Marx, who was searching for the universal laws of the society, Weber attempts an interpretive understanding of social action in order to arrive at a \\"causal explanation of its course and effects.\\"Max Weber, Sociological Writing, 228. Here the word course signifies Weber's non-deterministic approach to a phenomenon. The social actions have subjective meanings that should be understood in its given context. Weber's interpretive approach in understanding the meaning of an action in relation to its environment delineated a contextualized social framework for cultural relativism. Since we exist in webs of significance and the objective analysis would detach us from a concrete reality which we are all part of it, Weber suggested ideal-types; an analytical and conceptual construct \\"formed by the accentuation of one or more points of view and by the synthesis of a great many diffuse, discrete, more or less present, and occasionally absent concrete individual phenomena, which are arranged according to those one-sidedly emphasized viewpoints into a unified analytical construct.\\"The methodology of the social sciences (Edward A. Shils & Henry A. Finch, Trans. & Eds.; foreword by Shils). New York: Free Press, 1997 (1903-1917). p.88. Although they are analytical concepts, they serve as reference points in interpreting the meaning of society's heterogeneous and polymorphous activities. In other words, ideal-types are simplified and typified empirical reality, but they are not reality in themselves. Bureaucracy, authority, religion, etc. are all ideal-types, according to Weber, and do not exist in the real world. They assist social scientists in selecting culturally significant elements of a larger whole which can be contrasted with each other to demonstrate their interrelationship, patterns of formation, and similar societal functions. Weber's selected ideal-types ‚Äì bureaucracy, religion, and capitalism ‚Äì are culturally significant variables through which he demonstrated show multiple functionalities of social behavior. Similarly, Weber emphasizes that Marxist laws are also ideal-types. The concept of class, economy, capitalism, proletariat and bourgeoisie, revolution and state, along with other Marxian models are heuristic tools for understanding a society in its context. Thus, according to Weber, Marxist ideal-types could prove fruitful only if used to access a given society. However, Weber warns of dangerousness or perniciousness in relation to Marxist ideal-types when seen as empirical reality. The reason is that Marxist practitioners have imposed analytical concepts as ahistorical and universal categories to reduce concrete-process and activities from the polymorphous actions into a simplified phenomenon. This renders social phenomena not only ahistorical but also devoid of spatio- temporal rigour, decontextualized, and categorizes chaos and ruptures under the general label of bourgeoisie exploitation. In fact, history emerged as a metanarrative of a class struggle, moving in a chronological order, and future anticipated as a revolutionary overthrow of state apparatuses by the workers. For instance, the state as an ideal-type imported to the physical world has deceived and diverted political activism away from the real sites of power such as corporations and discourses. Similarly class as an ideal-type, projected to a society, which is an ensemble of population, becomes dangerous because it marginalizes and undermines organic linkages of kinship, language, race, and ethnicity. This is a significant point because society is not composed of two conflicting classes, bourgeoisie and proletariat, and does not just have vicissitudes along economic lines. It does not exist in binaries, as Marxist ideal-types would suppose. In fact, it is a reality in which people of various denominations ‚Äì class backgrounds, religious affiliations, kinship and family ties, gender, and ethnic and linguistic differences ‚Äì do not only experience conflict, but also practice cooperation in everyday life. Thus when one inserts ideal-types into this concrete dynamic process one does categorical violence to multifariousness of the population and similarly reduces feeling, emotions, non-economic social standing such as honor, and status, as Weber describes, to economism. Moreover, the ideal-types should also be treated relevant to a context that defines and delimits the former's parameters. Weber's intervention came at the right moment when Marxism ‚Äì particularly vulgar Marxism ‚Äì reduced \\"non-economic\\" practices and beliefs, the superstructure, to a determined base, the mode of production. Similarly, speculative philosophy imposed its own metaphysical categories on diverse concrete realities thus making a particular instance ahistorical. Weber approaches both the methods, materialist and purely idealist, as \\"equally possible, but each, of it does not serve as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation.\\"Max Weber. (1978). Max Weber: Selections. Trans. Eric Matthews. Ed. W. G. Runciman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 172. To prove this point, Weber demonstrated how ethics and morality played a significant role in the rise of modern capitalism. The Protestant work ethic, for instance, functioned as sophisticated mechanism that encouraged population to \\"care for the self\\", which served as an underpinning social activity for bourgeois capitalism. Of course, work ethics was not the only element, utilitarian philosophy equally contributed in forming a bureaucratic work culture whose side-effects are all too well known to the modern world. In response to the reductive approach of economism or vulgar Marxism, as it is also known, Louis Althusser and Raymond Williams introduced new understanding to Marxist thought. Althusser and Williams introduced politics and culture as new entry points alongside the mode of production in Marxist methodology. However, there is a sharp contrast between the scholars' arguments. Taking Williams as our point of discussion, he criticizes the mechanistic approach to Marxism that encourages a close reading of Marxian concepts. Concepts such as being, consciousness, class, capital, labor, labor power, commodity, economy, politics, etc. are not closed categories but rather interactive, engaging, and open practices or praxis.Raymond Williams. (1972). Marxism and Literature. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Althusser, on the other hand, proposes ‚Äòoverdetermination' as multiple forces rather than isolated single force or modes of production. However, he argues that the economy is \\"determinant in the last instance.\\"Louis Althusser. (2005 [1965]). For Marx. Trans. Ben Brewster. New York: Verso Books.  Closed systems  In anthropology, the term 'system' is used widely for describing socio-cultural phenomena of a given society in a holistic way. For instance, kinship system, marriage system, cultural system, religious system, totemic system, etc. This systemic approach to a society shows the anxieties of the earliest anthropologists to capture the reality without reducing the complexity of a given community. In their quest of searching the underline pattern of a reality, they \\"discovered\\" the kinship system as a fundamental structure of the natives. However, their systems are closed systems because they reduce the complexity and fluidity by imposing anthropological concepts such as genealogy, kinship, heredity, marriage. = Cultural relativism = Franz Boas was the first anthropologist to problematize the notion of culture. Challenging the modern hegemony of culture, Boas introduced the idea of cultural relativism (understanding culture in its context). Drawing on his extensive fieldwork in the northwestern United States and British Columbia, Boas discusses culture separate from physical environment, biology, and most importantly discarded evolutionary models that represent civilization as a progressive entity following chronological development. Moreover, cultural boundaries, according to Boas, are not barriers to intermixing and should not be seen as obstacle to multiculturalism. In fact, boundaries must be seen as \\"porous and permeable,\\" and \\"pluralized.\\"Ira Bashkow, \\"A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries,\\" 137 His critique on the concept of modern race and culture had political implications in the racial politics of the United States in the 1920s. In his chapter, \\"The Race Problem in Modern Society,\\" one can feel Boas' intellectual effort toward separating the natural from the social sciences and setting up the space for genuine political solutions for race relations. = Structural-functionalism = A. R. Radcliffe-Brown developed a structural functionalism approach in anthropology. He believed that concrete reality is \\"not any sort of entity but a process, the process of social life.\\"A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, Structure and Function in Primitive Society, Free Press, 1952. 4 Radcliffe-Brown emphasized on learning the social form especially a kinship system of primitive societies. The way in which one can study the pattern of life is by conceptually delineating a relation determined by a kinship or marriage, \\"and that we can give a general analytical description of them as constituting a system.\\"A. R. Radcliffe- Brown, Structure and Function in Primitive Society. Free Press, 1952, 6 The systems consist of structure which is referred to \\"some sort of ordered arrangement of parts or components.\\"A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, Structure and Function in Primitive Society. Free Press, 1952, 9 The intervening variable between the processes and structure is a function. The three concepts of process, structure, and function are thus \\"components of a single theory as a scheme of interpretation of human social systems.\\"A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, Structure and Function in Primitive Society. Free Press, 1952, 12 Most importantly, function \\"is the part it plays in, the contribution it makes to, the life of the organism as a whole.\\"A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, Structure and Function in Primitive Society. Free Press, 1952, 179 Thus the functionality of each part in the system works together to maintain a harmony or internal consistency. British anthropologist, E. R. Leach, went beyond the instrumentalist argument of Radcliffe-Brown's structural-functionalism, which approached social norms, kinship, etc. in functionalist terms rather than as social fields, or arenas of contestation. According to Leach, \\"the nicely ordered ranking of lineage seniority conceals a vicious element of competition.\\"E. R. Leach, Political Systems of Highland Burma, 194. In fact, Leach was sensitive to \\"the essential difference between the ritual description of structural relations and the anthropologist's scientific description.\\"E. R. Leach, Political System of Highland Burma, For instance, in his book, Leach argues, \\"the question that whether a particular community is gumlao, or gumsa, or Shan is not necessarily ascertainable in the realm of empirical facts; it is a question, in part at any rate, of the attitudes and ideas of particular individuals at a particular time.\\"E. R. Leach, Political System of Highland Burma, 286 Thus, Leach separated conceptual categories from empirical realities. = Structural anthropology = Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, in search of discovering universal laws of language, formulated a general science of linguistic by bifurcating language into langue, abstract system of language, and parole, utterance or speech. The phonemes, fundamental unit of sound, are the basic structure of a language. The linguistic community gives a social dimension to a language. Moreover, linguistic signs are arbitrary and change only comes with time and not by individual will. Drawing on structural linguistics, Claude L√©vi-Strauss transforms the world into a text and thus subjected social phenomena to linguistic laws as formulated by Saussure. For instance, the \\"primitive systems\\" such as kinship, magic, mythologies, and rituals are scrutinized under the similar linguistic dichotomies of abstract normative system (objective) and utterance (subjective). The division did not only split social actions, but it also conditioned them to the categories of abstract systems that are made up of deep structures. For example, L√©vi-Strauss suggests, \\"Kinship phenomena are of the same type as linguistic phenomena.\\"Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Structural Anthropology, Basic Books, 1974, 34 As Saussure discovered phonemes as the basic structures of language, L√©vi-Strauss identified (1) consanguinity, (2) affinity, and (3) descent as the deep structures of kinship. These \\"microsociological\\" levels serve \\"to discover the most general structural laws.\\"Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Structural Anthropology, Basic Books, 1974, 35 The deep structures acquire meanings only with respect to the system they constitute. \\"Like phonemes, kinship terms are elements of meaning; like phonemes, they acquire meaning only if they are integrated into systems.\\"Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Structural Anthropology, Basic Books, 1974, 34 Like the langue and parole distinctions of language, kinship system consists of (1) system of terminology (vocabulary), through which relationships are expressed and (2) system of attitudes (psychological or social) functions for social cohesion. To elaborate the dynamic interdependence between systems of terminology and attitudes, L√©vi-Strauss rejected Radcliffe-Brown's idea that a system of attitudes is merely the manifestation of a system of terminology on the affective level. He turned to the concept of the avunculate as a part of a whole, which consists of three types of relationship consanguinity, affinity, and descent. Thus, L√©vi-Strauss identified complex avuncular relationships, contrary to atomism and simplified labels of avunculate associated with matrilineal descent. Furthermore, he suggested that kinship systems \\"exist only in human consciousness; it is an arbitrary system of representations, not the spontaneous development of a real situation.\\"Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Structural Anthropology, Basic Books, 1974, 50 The meaning of an element (avunculate) exists only in relation to a kinship structure. L√©vi-Strauss elaborates the meaning and structure point further in his essay titled \\"The Sorcerer and His Magic.\\" The sorcerer, patient, and group, according to L√©vi- Strauss, comprise a shaman complex, which makes social consensus an underlying pattern for understanding. The work of a sorcerer is to reintegrate divergent expressions or feelings of patients into \\"patterns present in the group's culture. The assimilation of such patterns is the only means of objectivizing subjective states, of formulating inexpressible feelings, and of integrating inarticulated experiences into a system.\\"Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Structural Anthropology, Basic Books, 1974, 166 The three examples that L√©vi-Strauss mentions relate to magic, a practice reached as a social consensus, by a group of people including sorcerer and patient. It seems that people make sense of certain activities through beliefs, created by social consensus, and not by the effectiveness of magical practices. The community's belief in social consensus thus determines social roles and sets rules and categories for attitudes. Perhaps, in this essay, magic is system of terminology, a langue, whereas, individual behavior is a system of attitude, parole. Attitudes make sense or acquire meaning through magic. Here, magic is a language. = Interpretive anthropology = Influenced by Hermeneutic tradition, Clifford Geertz developed an interpretive anthropology of understanding the meaning of the society. The hermeneutic approach allows Geertz to close the distance between an ethnographer and a given culture similar to reader and text relationship. The reader reads a text and generates his/her own meaning. Instead of imposing concepts to represent reality, ethnographers should read the culture and interpret the multiplicities of meaning expressed or hidden in the society. In his influential essay, Thick Description: Towards an Interpretive Theory of Culture, Geertz argues that \\"man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun.\\"Clifford Geertz, Interpretation of Culture, 5. = Practice theory = French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu challenges the same duality of phenomenology (subjective) and structuralism (objective) through his Theory of Practice. This idea precisely challenges the reductive approach of economism that places symbolic interest in opposition to economic interests. Similarly, it also rejects subjected-centered view of the world. Bourdieu attempts to close this gap by developing the concept of symbolic capital, for instance, a prestige, as readily convertible back into economic capital and hence, is ‚Äòthe most valuable form of accumulation.' Therefore, economic and symbolic both works together and should be studied as a general science of the economy of practices.Pierre Bourdieu, Outline of a Theory of a Practice, Cambridge University Press, 179  System theory: Gregory Bateson  British anthropologist, Gregory Bateson, is the most influential and one of the earliest founders of System Theory in anthropology. He developed an interdisciplinary approach that included communication theory, cybernetics, and mathematical logic. In his collection of essays, The Sacred Unity, Bateson argues that there are \\"ecological systems, social systems, and the individual organism plus the environment with which it interacts is itself a system in this technical sense.\\"Gregory Bateson, A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind, 260 By adding environment with systems, Bateson closes the gap between the dualities such as subject and object. \\"Playing upon the differences between formalization and process, or crystallization and randomness, Bateson sought to transcend other dualisms‚Äìmind versus nature, organism versus environment, concept versus context, and subject versus object.\\"John Tresch, Heredity is an Open System: Gregory Bateson as Descendant and Ancestor, Anthropology Today, Vol. 14, No. 6 (Dec., 1998), pp. 3. Bateson set out the general rule of systems theory. He says: > The basic rule of systems theory is that, if you want to understand some > phenomenon or appearance, you must consider that phenomenon within the > context of all completed circuits which are relevant to it. The emphasis is > on the concept of the completed communicational circuit and implicit in the > theory is the expectation that all units containing completed circuits will > show mental characteristics. The mind, in other words, is immanent in the > circuitry. We are accustomed to thinking of the mind as somehow contained > within the skin of an organism, but the circuitry is not contained within > the skin.Gregory Bateson, A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of > Mind, 260 = Influences on poststructuralism = Bateson's work influenced major poststructuralist scholars especially Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari. In fact, the very word 'plateau' in Deleuze and Guattari's magnum opus, A Thousand Plateaus, came from Bateson's work on Balinese culture. They wrote: \\"Gregory Bateson uses the word plateau to designate something very special: a continuous, self-vibrating region of intensities whose development avoids any orientation toward a culmination point or external end.\\"Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, 22 Bateson pioneered an interdisciplinary approach in anthropology. He coined the term \\"ecology of mind\\" to demonstrate that what \\"goes on in one's head and in one's behavior\\" is interlocked and constitutes a network.Gregory Bateson, A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind, 265 Guattari wrote: > Gregory Bateson has clearly shown that what he calls the \\"ecology of ideas\\" > cannot be contained within the domain of the psychology of the individual, > but organizes itself into systems or \\"minds\\", the boundaries of which no > longer coincide with the participant individuals.Dana Arnold, Joanna R. > Biographies and Space, 18. = Posthumanist turn and ethnographic writing= In anthropology, the task of representing a native point of view has been a challenging one. The idea behind the ethnographic writing is to understand a complexity of an everyday life of the people without undermining or reducing the native account. Historically, as mentioned above, ethnographers insert raw data, collected in the fieldwork, into the writing \\"machine\\". The output is usually the neat categories of ethnicity, identity, classes, kinship, genealogy, religion, culture, violence, and numerous other. With the posthumanist turn, however, the art of ethnographic writing has suffered serious challenges. Anthropologists are now thinking of experimenting with new style of writing. For instance, writing with natives or multiple authorship.

History During the infighting of the Khalji Maliks he assumed power in 1208 and ruled for two years until being dethroned by Ali Mardan Khalji in 1210. But after the death of Ali Mardan Khalji he once again took power in 1212 and styled himself as Ghiyas-ud-din Iwaz Shah. Ghiyas-ud-din Iwaz Khalji ruled for 15 long years and established peace in Bengal. He transferred the capital from Devkot to Gau·∏ça. He prepared a powerful navy for Bengal. Ghiyas-ud-din Iwaz Khalji carried out invasions into neighboring regions and made Vanga (Eastern Bengal), Kamarupa (Assam), Tirhut (Northern Bihar) and Utkala (Northern Orissa) his tributary states.KingListsFarEast Bengal Ghiyas-ud-din Iwaz Khalji's conquest of Bihar was considered as a threat to the Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi) and the Sultan of Delhi Iltutmish decided to reduce him. In 1224 Iltutmish invaded Bengal. The two armies confronted in Teliagarh of Bihar. Ghiyas-ud-din Iwaz Khalji's navy and infantry were defeated by the Delhi army. He gave 8,000,000 taka and 38 war elephants to Iltutmish and was compelled to strike coins at the name of Iltutmish. But with the withdrawal of Iltutmish, Ghiyas-ud-din Iwaz Khalji once again declared independence and invaded eastern Bengal to crush a rebellion. Iltutmish once again invaded Bengal in 1226 and defeated him. Ghiyas-ud-din Iwaz Khalji and his courtiers were killed in the battle and Bengal became a province of the Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi). Details Iwaz Khalji (H 609-624/1212-1227 AD) sultan of the kingdom of lakhnauti (gaur) from 609-624 AH corresponding to 1212 to 1227AD. Son of Hussain and a humble native of Garamsir in northern Afghanistan, his original name was Husamuddin Iwaz Khalji. It is said that in his early life he was an ass-driver carrying loads to distant places. During one such travels he pleased some saints with food and drink and they blessed him and bade him to go to Hindustan. On the way Iwaz met bakhtiyar khalji and they reached India in 1195 AD. He took a leading part in the sack of the Odandapura Vihara as the deputy of Bakhtiyar. His exploits in Bihar drew the attention of Bakhtiyar who, after the conquest of Lakhnauti granted Iwaz the jagir of Kangori, which lay southeast of devkot (Deokot or Devikot). Bakhtiyar's death was followed by an internal feud among his lieutenants. At this critical juncture Qaimaz Rumi, governor of Oudh invaded Bengal under the order of Sultan Qutbuddin Aibak. Iwaz, a practical man of politics, welcomed the imperial army. Rumi, after successfully settling the affairs of Bengal installed him as a vassal of Delhi and departed for Oudh. Iwaz retained this position till ali mardan khalji's reappearance in Bengal in 1210 as the viceroy of the Delhi Sultanate. On Ali Mardan's arrival, Iwaz retired to his post making over the charge of the province to Ali Mardan. His policy of blood and iron, however, soon made Ali Mardan unpopular. Taking advantage of this situation Iwaz organised the discontented Khalji nobles, killed Ali Mardan and ascended the throne of Bengal with the title of Sultan Ghiyasuddin Iwaz Khalji in 1212 AD. Soon Iwaz Khalji consolidated his authority at Lakhnauti. He recalled the Khalji nobles exiled by Ali Mardan, redressed their sufferings and succeeded in winning over the Turkish soldiers to his side. One of his earliest steps was retransferring of the capital from Devkot to Lakhnauti where he built entirely a new city. By the west of this city a river then flowed. For the sake of defence Iwaz Khalji enclosed the other three sides of the capital by a high earthen rampart. Besides, with the same purpose, he built a fort-town at Basankot adjacent to the capital city. Iwaz was the first to realise the importance of a navy for a riverine country like Bengal and built a flotilla of war-boats to face any aggression. For defence as well as for administrative purposes, he connected the capital city with the outlying towns of Devkot and Lakhnur by an embankment with ferries on the Ganges and other rivers. In order to protect his kingdom from the annual floods he constructed a series of dykes with arched bridges. After establishing peace in Lakhnauti, Iwaz Khalji turned his attention towards the expansion of his kingdom towards the south and the east. minhaj-i-siraj says that he conquered and annexed Lakhnur to his Kingdom and captured many elephants, much wealth and treasures came to his hand and he posted his own Amirs there. It appears that the neighbouring states of Jajnagar, Bang, Kamrup and Tirhut all sent tributes to Ghiyasuddin Iwaz Khalji. Sultan Ghiyasuddin Iwaz Khalji issued coins and read the Khutbah in his own name. In order to stabilise his political position against Sultan iltutmish he tried to show his connection with the Ghurid ruling family of Ghazna. Besides, he also invoked the name of the Khalifah of Baghdad on his coins. The main objective of invoking the name of the Khalifah was to enhance his position in the eyes of the local people and to place himself equal to the sultan of Delhi. Equally important were his measures for the promotion of Islam in the country. On the coins he described himself as the 'Helper of the Commander of the faithful'. He also extended patronage to men of learning and built a number of mosques. He gave pensions to good men among the ulama, the mashaikh and the sayyads. The sultans of Delhi always cast their suspicious eyes towards Bengal. Hence, when Iwaz started functioning as an independent ruler, Iltutmish got annoyed. No sooner had he freed himself from his pre-occupations with the internal troubles and Mongol invasions than Iltutmish marched with a large army to bring Bihar and Bengal under his control. He took possession of Bihar without opposition in 1225. Iwaz Khalji rose to the occasion and moved out from his capital with his army and fleet to prevent the imperial army from crossing the Ganges. Perhaps he gave resistance to the imperial army at the teliagarhi pass of the Rajmahal hills. According to Minhaj a treaty was concluded between the two sides and Iwaz had to pay an indemnity of eighty lakh tankas and thirty- eight elephants. Iwaz acknowledged the authority of the Delhi sultan and undertook to read the Khutbah and issue coins in his name. The Delhi sultan, on the other hand, allowed Iwaz Khalji to retain the government of Lakhnauti. Leaving alauddin jani in charge of Bihar Iltutmish returned to Delhi. But hardly had he turned his back when Iwaz expelled Alauddin Jani from Bihar and made further aggressions. Iwaz Khalji rightly realised that Iltutmish would certainly come back to attack Bengal again. In the meantime, there arose a chaotic condition in Oudh due to the serious upsurge of the Hindus. Iltutmish sent his eldest son Nasiruddin Mahmood to quell down the rebellion. Supposing that it would take time for the prince to attack Bengal due to his preoccupations in Oudh, Iwaz marched towards eastern Bengal in 1227 AD leaving his capital unprotected. Nasiruddin, however, made a sudden dash for Bengal from Oudh. Iwaz Khalji hurriedly returned and fought a pitched battle with the Delhi forces near Lakhnauti but was defeated. Thus came to an end the significant and constructive regime of Sultan Ghiyasuddin Iwaz Khalji who had contributed to the consolidation of Muslim rule in Bengal in its early phase.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Iwaz_Khalji See also *List of rulers of Bengal *History of Bengal *History of Bangladesh *History of India References Category:Rulers of Bengal Category:Indian Muslims Category:13th-century Indian monarchs ","title":"Iwaz Khalji"},{"id":"21763679","text":"The Ten Broeck Mansion in Albany, New York was built in 1797.

The British captured her later that year and she served in the Royal Navy in the Channel and the North Sea until she was broken up in 1819. Construction Frolic was one of a class of three heavy flush-decked sloops of war, designed by William Doughty and constructed late in the War of 1812. Her sister ships were USS Peacock and USS Wasp. Frolic was launched on 11 September 1813 by Josiah Barker at Charlestown, Massachusetts. United States service Frolic first put to sea on 18 February 1814 with Commander Joseph Bainbridge (younger brother of Commodore William Bainbridge) in command, standing out of President Roads in Boston Harbor at Boston, Massachusetts, for a cruise in the West Indies. On 29 March 1814 she destroyed a British merchant ship, and later on the same day she sank an unnamed Spanish-American privateer, sailing from Cartagena in present-day Colombia. Frolic prevailed in a brief action in which nearly 100 of the privateer's crew drowned.Roosevelt, p.172Forester, p.169 (Privateers from several countries seeking independence from Spain were preying on ships of all nations in the Caribbean.) Frolic sank another British merchant ship on 3 April 1814. (This may have been Little Fox.) While in the Florida Strait on 20 April 1814, Frolic encountered the British 36-gun frigate and 12-gun schooner . Frolic beat away to southward, making for the coast of Cuba as the two British ships gave chase. Frolics men labored to lighten their ship, cutting away the starboard anchor, and casting overboard the guns mounted on her port (lee) side and small arms. Overtaken after six hours, Frolic was forced to surrender to the superior British force when about 15 miles off Matanzas, Cuba. British service After her capture, the Admiralty purchased Frolic for ¬£8,211 1s 7d and took her into service as the post ship HMS Florida.Winfield (2008), p. 243.Rea (1981), pp.201-2. She was commissioned in June at Halifax under Captain Nathaniel Mitchell. She arrived at Woolwich on 30 August 1815. She was recommissioned in September under Captain William Elliot and fitted for Channel service on 22 December. In April 1816 she sailed for the North Sea under Captain Charles S. J. Hawtayne, where she was employed in searching for and catching smugglers. In February 1818 she was re-rated as a 22-gun sloop. On 11 May she captured St Thomas, a galley out of Calais with a crew of 12 men. In making the capture, Florida's master's mate, Mr. Kieth Stewart shot and killed one of the smugglers in self- defense.Chatterton (1912), pp.276-83. Fate She was broken up at Chatham in May 1819.

V. Narasimha Rao Expressway is an 11.6 km long elevated road connecting the Hyderabad International Airport with Mehdipatnam. Chief minister Y.S Rajasekhara Reddy laid the foundation stone for the project. It was opened to the traffic at the end points on 19 October 2009. The entry for cyclists, two and three-wheelers, three and four-wheeled seven seater and goods vehicles is prohibited. History When the construction of the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport started in March 2005, the erstwhile Government of Andhra Pradesh came up with a plan to provide implement a Traffic signal free route from the city to Shamshabad. The 3 routes which lead to Shamshabad from the city were NH44(NH7) via Nehru Zoological Park, Srisailam Highway(NH765) and the Inner Ring Road, Hyderabad via Mehdipatnam. Out of the 3 routes, the NH44 already had a very high volumes of traffic and was not in a position to withstand any further rise in the traffic. The Srisailam Highway is not accessible to the Western part of the city, which houses prominent localities like Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills, Punjagutta and some others. The Inner Ring Road was a wide 6-Lane road, which barely served any traffic. Construction of an elevated highway over this road was very easy and the Government chose to develop this route, leaving behind the former routes. The initial plan was to widen this road to 8-lane, but was later changed to construct a 4-Lane elevated expressway. The construction began in October 2005, with an intention to complete the project in 28 months. But due to the financial difficulties, the construction work was dragged and was opened on October 19th 2009. It was last scheduled to be opened on October 2 but the inauguration was put off in view of the death of chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, who had laid the foundation stone for the project. The Expressway starts at Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital in Mehdipatnam and merges with NH44 near Aramghar. The total cost was estimated to be 400 crores INR but later extended to 500 crores INR.  Entry and exit ramps  The earlier design of the expressway did not had any ramps for entry and exits. This made the expressway unusable to the people form surrounding areas. One has to enter the expressway at Mehdipatnam and has to exit at Aramghar. So, the traffic on the flyover was estimated to be too low, making it worthless. The design was later modified and 3 sets of Entry and Exit ramps were constructed. The 3 sets of ramps are constructed at the below junctions. *Lakshmi Nagar Junction *Budvel Junction *Aramghar Junction  See also  *Unified Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Hyderabad (India) *Inner Ring Road, Hyderabad *Radial Roads, Hyderabad (India) *Intermediate Ring Road, Hyderabad (India) *Outer Ring Road, Hyderabad *Regional Ring Road *List of Flyovers in Hyderabad References Category:Proposed roads in India Category:Expressways in Telangana Category:Roads in Hyderabad, India ","title":"P.

Several stores suffered damage due to a large roof leak in January 1990, with all stores reopening after a few days, and the roofs replacement planned for April. Leh's closed in June 1996 due to bankruptcy, with Gallery Furniture taking over its former space in 1997. Clover closed in 1996, with its replacement Kohl's opening in April 1997. =1998‚Äìpresent= Whitehall Mall received a $15 million renovation in 1998, where it was almost totally demalled, except for a portion near Kohl's. Retaining the traditional mall look was determined to not be cost effective. Sears was expanded during this time. Three additional buildings were added to the mall's grounds during the renovation. Weis Markets closed during renovations that almost doubled its space. Plaza Theater closed in June 1999 due to having only two screens and being obsolete. The theater was previously operated by Budco, and by AMC from 1987-1996. The opening of Gold's Gym in the mid 2000s was delayed due to design changes. Gold's Gym would use the former Leh's store and Plaza Theater. Raymour & Flanigan relocated to the mall in 2012, occupying two vacant storefronts. PREIT sold its 50% ownership of the Whitehall Mall in 2014 to Washington Prime Group, the mall's other owner. Sears closed in February 2020.

Computers and the Internet Internet security involves the protection of a computer's internet account and files from intrusion by an outside user. Internet users today are familiar with companies like Symantec (Norton Anti-Virus) and McAfee that provide them with internet security products to guard against computer viruses, as well as to provide secure firewalls and protection against spyware. Organizations like the Center for Internet Security (CIS) provide enterprises with resources for measuring information security status and making rational security investment decisions. An example of secure smart card technology usage is the Microsoft .NET card framework. This is a software framework that is available with several Microsoft Windows operating systems. It includes a library of coded solutions to prevent common programming problems and a virtual machine that manages the execution of programs written specifically for the framework. Telecommunications Perhaps the most widely known digitally secure telecommunication device is the SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card, a device that is embedded in most of the world‚Äôs cellular devices before any service can be obtained. The SIM card is just the beginning of this digitally secure environment. The Smart Card Web Servers draft standard (SCWS) defines the interfaces to an HTTP server in a smart card. Tests are being conducted to secure OTA (\\"over-the-air\\") payment and credit card information from and to a mobile phone. Combination SIM/DVD devices are being developed through Smart Video Card technology which embeds a DVD-compliant optical disc into the card body of a regular SIM card. Other telecommunication developments involving digital security include mobile signatures, which use the embedded SIM card to generate a legally binding electronic signature. Financial transactions and retail The UCLA Internet Report: Surveying the Digital Future (2000) found that the privacy of personal data created barriers to online sales and that more than nine out of 10 internet users (were) somewhat or very concerned about credit card security.Lebo, Harlan (2000). The UCLA Internet Report: Surveying the Digital Future. World Internet Project. 1-55 The most common web technologies for improving security between browsers and websites are named SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security), identity management and authentication services, and domain name services allow companies and consumers to engage in secure communications and commerce. Several versions of SSL and TLS are commonly used today in applications such as web browsing, e-mail, internet faxing, instant messaging, and VoIP (voice-over-IP). There are various interoperable implementations of these technologies, including at least one implementation that is open source. Open source allows anyone to view the application's source code, and look for and report vulnerabilities. The credit card companies Visa and MasterCard cooperated to develop the secure EMV chip which is embedded in credit cards. Further developments include the Chip Authentication Program where banks give customers hand-held card readers to perform online secure transactions. Other developments in this arena include the development of technology such as Instant Issuance which has enabled shopping mall kiosks acting on behalf of banks to issue on-the-spot credit cards to interested customers. Travel and transportation Many modern passports are now biometric passports, containing an embedded microchip that stores a digitized photograph and personal information such as name, gender, and date of birth. In addition, more countries are introducing facial recognition technology to reduce identity-related fraud. The introduction of the ePassport has assisted border officials in verifying the identity of the passport holder, thus allowing for quick passenger processing. Plans are under way in the US, the UK, and Australia to introduce SmartGate kiosks with both retina and fingerprint recognition technology. Additionally, e-Drivers‚Äô licenses are being developed using the same technology. For example, Mexico‚Äôs licensing authority (ICV) has used a smart card platform to issue the first e-Drivers‚Äô licenses to the city of Monterrey, in the state of Nuevo Le√≥n.https://www.gemalto.com/govt/customer-cases/mexico The airline industry is moving from the use of traditional paper tickets towards the use of electronic tickets (e-tickets). These have been made possible by advances in online credit card transactions in partnership with the airlines. Long- distance bus companies are also switching over to e-ticketing transactions today. Shipping companies have adopted RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology as an efficient, digitally secure, tracking device. Unlike a barcode, RFID can be read up to 20 feet away. RFID is used by FedEx https://www.supplychainmarket.com/doc/the-cutting-edge-of-rfid-technology-and- appli-0001 and UPS. Health care Today, all health-care providers and health insurance companies use the internet to provide enhanced products and services, and to reduce costs. The health care company Humana partners with WebMD, Oracle Corporation, EDS and Microsoft to enable its members to access their health care records, as well as to provide an overview of health care plans. Patient records are increasingly being placed on secure in-house networks, alleviating the need for extra storage space. Secure access The FBI, CIA, and Pentagon, all utilize secure controlled access technology for any of their buildings. However, the use of this form of technology is spreading into the entrepreneurial world. More and more companies are taking advantage of the development of digitally secure controlled access technology. GE's ACUVision, for example, offers a single panel platform for access control, alarm monitoring and digital recording. New approaches combine network DVR capabilities with intelligent access control and alarm monitoring panel functionality into a single image processing application. Some systems now combine digital video monitoring/recording/playback, access control and intrusion detection functionality in a single panel solution. With these integrated digital video recording and access control platforms, security officers can display live and stored video associated with alarm conditions and cardholder activity.

Later local opposition to licenses turned to open \\"warfare\\" in the \\"oyster wars\\" when a fleet of state vessels fought \\"oyster pirates\\" in armed conflicts. Frolic was built in 1884. The schooner was assigned to Queen Anne's County, Maryland in 1902 and later to the Commission's Second District which included Eastern Bay, and the Miles and Wye Rivers. That force became the Maryland State Fishery Force under the Conservation Commission of Maryland with which the schooner served when the entire force, boats and men, became a part of the U.S. Naval Reserve in an agreement between the state and the Navy in 1917. The force was one of the elements forming today's Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police. During an extreme cold period in January 1893, with Annapolis iced in and ice extending across the upper Chesapeake, many of the force's schooners were frozen in ice. The force's steamers, and , along with tugs broke ice keeping a narrow channel in Annapolis clear and then carried supplies and ammunition to schooners trapped in ice. Governor P. F. Thomas brought in the captain of Daisy Archer in for supplies and then returned him to the schooner in West River then transporting supplies for Frolic trapped in Eastern Bay. In an example of normal enforcement duties Frolic made a raid on \\"scrapers\\" (dredgers) illegally harvesting in Eastern Bay during March 1894 resulting arrest of three sloops and one bugeye. Each paid a $25 fine. In 1904, of the eleven sailing schooners of the fleet, Frolic was in need of extensive repairs and Julia Hamilton was in need of replacement.Julia Hamilton continued to operate through World War I and was sold in 1918 for $350. The logbook, now in the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum collection, kept by Deputy Commander John W. Jones when he commanded Frolic from September 1904 until September 1908 is perhaps the only surviving logbook of the State Fishery Force from the time. The Navy approached the Conservation Commission shortly after the nation's entry into World War I proposing the Commission's boats be used to maintain constant local patrols. The state legislature agreed that the boats and men of the state force would become part of the U.S. Naval Reserve providing they patrol the same districts for fisheries enforcement as well as federal interests with the benefit that patrol time would be increased and the expense for all be paid by the federal government. The Maryland State Fishery Force boats began operating under a contract in which they were under a free lease to the United States Navy in August 1917, serving as Squadron Number 8 of the 5th Naval District, patrolling their regular areas enforcing state conservation law and federal laws. They were under the command of a Conservation Commission member who was also a Lieutenant in the Navy with all expenses, wages, supplies and repairs paid by the federal government. Frolic served in a non-commissioned status with the section patrol identification number SP-1336 during World War I. The Conservation Commission resumed full responsibility on 27 November 1918. The Conservation Commission retired and sold the old schooners Frolic and Nellie Jackson in 1918 with Frolic bringing $800.00, considered a good price for age and condition.

As public property it dates back to the city charter in 1686, and has seen many uses including that of gunpowder storage, square/parade grounds, and cemetery. The park is often mistaken as being designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, as it incorporate many of the philosophical ideals used by Olmsted when he designed Central Park in Manhattan. The park is about in size with the Washington Park Lake, a roughly and lake, in the southwestern corner. Not only is the park historic, but so is the mostly residential surrounding neighborhood. Many architectural works line the streets facing the park, designed by some of the most famous architects of the late 19th century, including Henry Hobson Richardson. At least two governors of New York lived in buildings facing Washington Park outside of their term in office. Due to the historical and architectural significance of the park and neighborhood both were included in 1972 as the Washington Park Historic District; and in 1998 the park was named one of the nation's 100 most important parks by the American Association of Architects. In 2008 Boston- based composer Peter Child wrote an orchestral piece inspired by the park, entitled Washington Park. HistoryCemetery and parade grounds= Cemetery along State Street in 1809. North to top-right. Washington Park has been public property since the Dongan Charter was granted to Albany incorporating it as a city. The charter specified that all land not privately owned at the time became property of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of the city of Albany, including the land that would become the site of Washington Park. A portion of the land was set aside for a structure built to house gunpowder in 1802, and in 1806 the areas between Willett and Knox streets, and between State Street and Madison Avenue, became the Middle Public Square. In 1800, the land west of Knox Street to Robin Street and south from State Street to Hudson Avenue was taken for a cemetery, which was apportioned into sections for each of Albany's churches. There were separate sections for African-Americans and for strangers. West of the cemetery was the alms-house farm and the penitentiary grounds. In 1809 the Middle Public Square was renamed Washington Square, and later the Washington Parade Ground. In 1868 the remains and headstones in the cemetery were removed and reinterred, most to Albany Rural Cemetery, and some to the cemeteries of other churches. For years leading up to the creation of the park, the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had pushed for a grand public park. Frederick Law Olmsted's Olmsted, Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park. In their plan they envisioned Washington Park as the centerpiece of a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo, Boston, and Brooklyn. Though Olmsted and his company was not involved in the actual design of the park, their broad vision was followed for the detailed designs, including the idea of damming the Beaver Kill (Beaver Creek) to form a grand lake. =Construction of the park= Area of Washington Park in 1857; north is to the top-right. The New York Legislature passed a law in 1869 authorizing the creation of a large public park on the spot and the creation of the Board of Trustees of the Washington Park of the City of Albany (later Commissioners). John Bogart and John Cuyler drew the plans for Washington Park in 1870. Bogart had worked for Olmsted and Vaux on Central Park in New York and later Bogart was the chief engineer for the New York City Department of Parks from 1872 to 1877. From 1869 to 1872 R.H. Bingham was the chief engineer in charge of the drafting of the plans and the supervision of construction, after 1872 his assistant William S. Egerton took charge. It was under Egerton that the formal garden settings were planted. Map of Washington Park in 1876; north is to the top-right. Work on the Washington Parade Grounds between Willett and Knox streets was begun in July 1870 and finished by the end of the year. During 1871 the former cemetery was landscaped and that area reopened as part of the park. The section of Washington Park between Lexington (formerly Snipe) and Robin streets was the focus of work in 1873, including the damming of the Beaverkill to form Washington Park Lake. In 1874 focus shifted to roughly along Madison Avenue from Lake to Robin and a footbridge was built over the lake in 1875. Nine acres of mostly row houses along Knox Street north of Madison were purchased, destroyed, and landscaped in 1880; this included the area that would be the site of the King Memorial Fountain. The large house and landscaped grounds of John Taylor was the last part of the park to be purchased, in 1882, since 1889 it has been the site of tennis courts. The northwestern corner that is cut out of the park's otherwise rectangular shape was never part of the park; those plots were mostly owned by the Barnes family and developed into urban mansions facing Thurlow Terrace and Englewood Place. The process of buying and improving the land piecemeal was criticized because each improvement raised the value of the existing land that still needed to be purchased. The increase in property value can be shown through the value of the lands surrounding Washington Park almost doubling in the six years in which the majority of the park improvements were made; from $2,696,688 in 1869 to $4,843,440 in 1875. The properties next to Washington Park on Robin Street, which was renamed Englewood Terrace, increased in value from $9,500 in 1875 to $175,800 by 1891. Design of Washington Park as originally constructed The Commissioners were given by the state additional powers to build and maintain approaches to the park and other parks as well, this allowed the commissioners to build a series of boulevards around the city. Western Avenue from the northwestern corner of Washington Park to the location of the toll gate of the Western Turnpike was under the purview of the commissioners. Work on the road began in late 1876 and was finished the next year. The total construction cost of the park, including purchasing the real estate and improving Western Avenue, was $1,073,020.91. In 1878 Northern Boulevard (today Manning Boulevard) was constructed by the commissioners, it extended from the western end of their jurisdiction on Western Avenue north and east to the intersection of Clinton and Central avenues. In 1896 the state legislature also gave the commissioners authority over Lake Avenue from the park corner at Madison Avenue south to New Scotland Avenue (then- Albany, Schoharie, and Rensselaerville Plank Road). In addition to boulevards the Commissioners of Washington Park also gained control of other existing parks, and built new ones throughout the city, including Academy Park, Bleeker Park, Hudson Avenue Park, Clinton Square, Rensselaer Park, St. Joseph's Park, Townsend Park, Beaver Park (later Lincoln Park), and the former grounds of the Dudley Observatory. In 1900 the board of commissioners was transformed into the Bureau of Parks in the Department of Public Works and later the bureau became a separate department. =Modern times= In 1958 Lancaster Street, which had previously ended at Willett Street opposite the park, was extended through to Northern Boulevard (today Henry Johnson Boulevard). Associated with this extension Northern Boulevard was also widened and both Lancaster and State streets were turned into one-ways. Entrances to Washington Park from Thurlow Terrace and Englewood Place were closed in 1972 turning those into dead end streets from Western Avenue. In 1988 Washington Park Road was renamed Albany Plan of Union Avenue in honor of the colonial congress held in Albany by Benjamin Franklin that proposed closer ties and support among the Thirteen Colonies. In 1991 Northern Boulevard from its intersection with Madison Avenue and Willett Street north through the park and continuing to Livingston Avenue in Arbor Hill was renamed Henry Johnson Boulevard in honor of African-American World War I hero Henry Johnson. In the 1950s Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) killed all the elms that once populated the park and crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications, the pedestrian mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease- resistant elms planted to form a canopy, the King Fountain relit at night, and the lilac shrub border around the periphery of the park being restored. Structures Originally, Washington Park included many buildings: several shelters of untrimmed logs, a pavilion, wellhouse, croquet shelter, and lakehouse once dotted the landscape. The wooden lake house was replaced in 1929 with a \\"modern\\" brick structure while the others over time succumbed to age and changing use-patterns for the park and no longer stand. The footbridge over Washington Park Lake, erected in 1875, is the only remaining original structure in Washington Park. The lamps on the bridge were originally gas lamps, but they were electrified in 1881. The current Washington Park Lake House was built in 1929 replacing the original stick style structure constructed in 1876. It is constructed in the Spanish Revival style with terracotta, terrazzo, brick, and guastavino tile. The area in front of the lake house has been the site for the performance of plays by the Park Playhouse for over 20 years. A 900-seat amphitheater faces the lake house allowing for comfortable seating for the over 60,000 people who visit every year. A proposal by the city to turn the lake house into a 125-seat restaurant and 200-seat banquet hall with an expanded dock with boat, cross-country ski, and ice skate rentals failed to materialize due to a lack of interest from the private business sector. Monuments King Memorial Fountain of Moses smiting the rock on Mount Horeb Soldiers and Sailors' Monument in 1911 *Dr. James H. Armsby Memorial is a bust of James H. Armsby, the co-founder of Albany Medical College. Erected in 1879, it was the first memorial in the park. *Robert Burns Statue is a bronze statue erected in 1888, with four panels around the base installed in 1891. It is of the famous Scottish poet Robert Burns, his statue was sculpted by Charles Calverley and each of the four panels around the base have one of Burns' poems carved by George H. Boughton. The Saint Andrew's Society funded conservation of the statue in 1978. *King Memorial Fountain is a fountain erected in 1893 with a monumental bronze statue of Moses smiting the rock for water on Mount Horeb. Four figures of Israelite slaves around the statue on the side of the mountain represent the four stages of life: infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age. The fountain is in the center of formal gardens laid out by William S. Egerton. It was a gift from Rufus H. King and was sculpted by J. Massey Rhind, who also sculpted the Philip Schuyler statue that stands at the center of the intersection of Eagle Street and Washington Avenue in front of city hall. In 1988, the statue of Moses was cleaned and applied with a wax coating to protect it from the weather, and an arm was reattached to one of the four other statues on the fountain. *Marinus Willett Memorial is a monument to Colonel Marinus Willett commemorating his combat and character during the French and Indian Wars. It consists of a boulder from the \\"scenes of conflict\\" he fought in, and the plaque is dedicated to his \\"patriotic services in defense of Albany and the people of the Mohawk\\". The boulder was placed by the Sons of the American Revolution in 1907, facing towards an entrance to the park from the corner of State and Willett streets, an entrance that no longer exists. The boulder's back faced Henry Johnson Boulevard (formerly Northern Boulevard) and was the scene of many vehicular accidents as drivers missed a sharp curve. In 2006, as part of the 200th anniversary of the park, the boulder was moved to the corner of State and Willett. *Soldiers and Sailors' Monument is a marble monument sitting on a granite base with a bronze statue representing the Nation, holding the palms of victory. The monument is built of Tennessee marble above the seat and the remainder is of Stony Creek granite. It is high, long and deep, surrounded by a seat, the whole resting upon a platform long by deep. It sits at the Henry Johnson Boulevard entrance from State Street to the park. The monument represents \\"The Nation at Peace Won Through Victorious War\\". It was finished in 1911 by American Sculptor Hermon A. MacNeil and erected in 1912 by the Grand Army of the Republic as a monument to Civil War veterans. The monument was restored in 1986 and renamed the Albany Veterans Memorial Monument with an unveiling by two 85-year-old women who, as 12-year-olds, had unveiled the monument when it was first erected in 1912. *Henry Johnson Memorial is a bust of World War I hero Henry Johnson in a traffic island at the intersection of Henry Johnson Boulevard and Willett Street near Madison Avenue, erected in 1991. Activities Tulips during TulipFest behind King Fountain Washington Park has many activities open to visitors and residents, some maintained by the city, others are spontaneously set up by individuals. Washington Park's open spaces are often used by visitors to play boccie, volleyball, and badminton games. Tennis, basketball, and handball courts are maintained by the city in the park, and ice skating is permitted on Washington Park Lake, though swimming is prohibited. Bicycling is popular on the many roadways, many of which are closed to vehicular traffic. Though skateboarding is legal throughout the park itself, the monuments and ball courts in the park fall under a citywide ban on skateboarding on public monuments, statues, and tennis/basketball courts. thumb Washington Park is the site of many festivals, concerts, and special occasions. The Tulip Festival held every year since 1949 in Washington Park is highlighted by the blossoming of 200,000 tulips throughout the park. The African-American tradition of Pinksterfest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, was later incorporated into the Tulip Fest and since 1998 the Tulip Fest has also included the Mother of the Year award. The Latin Festival and the Columbus Day Parade and Italian Festival are some of the ethnic festivals held every year in the park. The city, the Albany Police Athletic League, and Hannaford supermarkets sponsor the Capital Holiday Lights every winter, with 125 displays through the park. Proceeds benefit juvenile crime prevention programs. Many fund raisers are held every year in the park as well, such as the American Cancer Society walkathon and the Freihofer's Run for Women. The Freihofer's Run is an International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Silver Label race that draws professional marathon runners from Kenya, Ethiopia, Australia, and all across the United States along with locals as well. It is one of the largest all-women races in the world, and has served as the 5K national championship in 1989, 1990, and 1993‚Äì2004. Historic district The streets surrounding Washington Park, State Street to the north, Willett Avenue to the east, Madison Avenue to the south, and South Lake Avenue to the west, along with Englewood Terrace, Thurlow Terrace, and the residence at 76 Western Avenue to the northwest, are all included in the Washington Park Historic District. Most of the existing properties date to after the 1880s, with very few predating the creation of the park. =State Street= State Street is a one-way eastbound street along Washington Park's northern border. Over 60 townhouses sit on State Street facing the park, most are of brick or brownstone and three stories tall. Many of these homes were built for industrialists, bankers, railroad executives, and politicians by notable national architects such as Henry Hobson Richardson and Stanford White, and local ones such as Marcus T. Reynolds and Albert Fuller. Many of the buildings have fine details such as decorative tiles, terracotta, or stone. On the corner of State and Willett is located the First Presbyterian Church, designed by J. Cleveland Cady in 1882, and the church is noted for its four Tiffany windows. New York Governor John Alden Dix lived at 491 State Street before and after his term in office. 423 State Street is owned by the University at Albany and used by its Center for Legislative Development. At 465 State Street is the Benjamin Walworth Arnold House and Carriage House, the only buildings in Albany designed by Stanford White. =Willett Street= Willet Street is a northbound one-way street comprising three blocks, stretching from the southeastern corner of the park at the intersection with Madison Avenue to the northeastern corner with State Street. All of Willett Street is in the historic district, including approximately 33 buildings. The street is entirely residential except for the First Presbyterian Church, built in 1883 on the corner with State Street. Willett Street has many different styles including Queen Anne, Spanish Revival, Classical revival, Georgian, Romanesque, Italianate, and brownstones. Two larger apartment buildings, built in 1909 and 1927, break up the otherwise continuous row of older townhouses. One of those apartment buildings is the Willett, formerly the Wareham, a five- story building built in 1909 that spans 84‚Äì92 Willett Street. This building sits on a former site of the New York State Normal College, predecessor to the University at Albany, which burned in 1906. The oldest building on Willett to maintain its original facade, 22 Willett, was built in 1872. Nearby 28 Willett Street was the home of Martin Glynn, an owner and publisher of the Albany Times Union, a state comptroller, and the governor of New York from 1913 to 1914. Glynn was the first Catholic New York governor and the only longtime Albany resident to reach that position. =Madison Avenue= Madison Avenue is part of the cross-country US Route 20, and at four lanes wide it is the busiest street in the district. Roughly 90 buildings on Madison Avenue face the park. East of the intersection with Robin Street, Madison is more urban with 19th-century rowhouses; west of Robin Street is dominated by large detached residences, many of which have been converted to medical offices. A few buildings, such as 694 and 710 Madison predate park improvements that occurred across the street at the Taylor property, which later became basketball and tennis courts. 682 Madison was formerly the home of the Academy of Holy Names. It is currently administrative offices for the Albany Medical Center Foundation. =South Lake Avenue= South Lake Avenue facing Washington Park consists of 23 rowhouses, a modern apartment building, and a converted carriage house. The Elouise Apartments were built in 1927 in the Classical Revival architecture style and are eight stories tall. 55 South Lake Avenue is in the Art Deco style, while 57 to 87 South Lake, built in 1896‚Äì97 is a row of yellow brick facades designed by Albert Fuller. =Englewood Place and Thurlow Terrace= Englewood Place and Thurlow Terrace were constructed by the Commissioners of Washington Park and maintained by them for some time, with half the maintenance cost assessed on the private property facing the street. Restrictions were placed to prevent fences and unwelcome uses to preserve a park-like appearance. Englewood Place was a part of Robin Street until receiving its current name in the 1870s; it was laid out in lots in 1879, with large mansions and carriage houses built between 1879 and 1887. 5 and 7 Englewood Place were designed by Robert Gibson, who also designed the All Saints Cathedral. 5 Englewood Place became the residence of the University at Albany's president after 1997. Thurlow Terrace was developed a decade after Englewood. 8 Thurlow Terrace was the residence of the Albany Catholic bishops until 1957. From 1958 to 1972 the State University of New York owned 7, 8, 9, and 10 Thurlow Terrace as their central administration, prior to moving to One Commerce Plaza.

Fisher also is credited with playing the harmonica (credited as Fisher 'Super Harp' Stevens). Patrick Breen wrote the screenplay adapted from his own off-Broadway play entitled \\"Marking\\" and starred in the film. It was filmed in New York, NY. Plot Dag (Ron Eldard) is a successful director of television commercials who shares his home with his girlfriend, Halley (Kyra Sedgwick). Dag, however, has a serious case of roving eye and is given to frequent flings with other women. Halley tries to turn a blind eye to Dag's infidelity, but when she discovers he had a one- night stand with Rebecca (Marley Shelton), a beautiful but troubled modern dancer who is dating Dag's close friend Peter (Patrick Breen), she decides things have gone too far. It worsens when she hears a message on her answering machine for Dag from another woman looking to meet up. Halley gives Dag his walking papers and she soon makes the acquaintance of Andre (Taye Diggs), a very handsome and well-mannered classical musician. Andre, however, is married to Colleen (Sarita Choudhury), a woman with exotic sexual tastes who meets up with Peter, now suddenly without a girlfriend, on an airline flight. Peter and Colleen have sex on the plane in the bathroom. Peter makes a cell phone call right before the plane lands, which interferes with the control tower which causes the plane to crash. The plane breaks in half and everyone in the first- class section lives, only landing a few feet from the front gate. Everyone in the tourist section is burned beyond all recognition. An ambulance runs over Colleen and kills her. Meanwhile, Peter's very angry confrontation with Dag attracts the attention of Paula (Marisa Tomei), a mysterious but very sexy woman who has taken a decidedly carnal interest in Peter. Though she at first gets involved with Dag--injuring and finally killing him. As he rejects her and mourns Rebecca, Paula plots to kill him next. Andre, Peter and Rebecca mourn their lovers. However, as Paula makes her way through Peter's daisy- chained circle of friends, events begin taking a strange turn as her new acquaintances begin to die in great numbers.

These programs occur at the four national high adventure bases that the Boy Scouts own. They are only open to youth aged 14 to 20, with specific ages varying by program, and are available at a substantially lower price than other programs at the base. They each include a period of service and a trek period during which the participants get to plan their own routes and experience the best of the bases. Trail Crew OATC crew at the summit of Mt. Baldy The first program that the Order of the Arrow established is the Trail Crew trek at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. The program, started in 1995, is held in multiple sessions every summer. Each session is a fourteen-day program for Order of the Arrow members aged 16 to 20 that gives participants an opportunity to work on various conservation projects around the ranch. Participants build trail for seven days and then go on a seven-day trek throughout Philmont. Many Order of the Arrow lodges and sections offer scholarships to Order of the Arrow members. Wilderness Voyage Wilderness Voyage Foremen doing trail work After the success of the Trail Crew program, the Order of the Arrow established another program following the same model at the Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases in Minnesota. Instead of hiking and backpacking as in Trail Crew, the participants use canoes for transportation. Their work occurs in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the Superior National Forest. Since its inception, the program has worked on some of the most treacherous portage trails in the area including the notorious Birch to Frog and Ensign to Boot portages. In the summer of 2007, the program did its first work in Canada on the Big Knife portage on the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Participants aged 16‚Äì20 are led by Foremen of the Northern Tier Conservation Department. Participants do conservation service for seven days and then go on a seven-day canoe trip. Crews have traveled all the way to International Falls and the Grand Portage National Monument on Lake Superior in only a week. The program also draws a lot from the history of the area, as many of the trails were previously maintained by the Civilian Conservation Corps and crews often map their treks around historic routes often including the Height of Land Portage.http://oa-bsa.org/high-adventure/our-adventures/oa-wilderness-voyage In 2003, the program and the Order of the Arrow received the US Forest Service Chief's Volunteer Award for Youth Volunteer Service.http://oa- bsa.org/uploads/bulletin/nb3q2003.pdf OA Wilderness Voyage Awarded USFS Highest Volunteer Service Award Ocean Adventure Starting in the summer of 2005, another program was established at the Florida National High Adventure Sea Base in the Florida Keys. This program also has a week of service but, initially, it followed a week during which participants gain PADI SCUBA Certification. The OAOA participants, aged 16‚Äì20, provided services such as marine life monitoring for the Reef Environmental Education Foundation, and coral reef conservation for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. OAOA underwent a program revision in 2010, thus cancelling all OAOA programs for that year, and resumed under the new program in 2011. Under the new program, participants spend a week providing service to the various parts of the Florida Keys, including a few spaces on the Florida Sea base property, such as Big Munson Island or the Florida Keys Heritage Trail. The remainder of the time is spent on the water, enjoying the Sea Base program.http://oa- bsa.org/high-adventure/our-adventures/oa-ocean-adventure In 2017, the Ocean Adventure program began a new chapter of its short history. This new program, based out of Camp Jackson Sawyer, sent participants to Ft. Jefferson at Dry Tortugas National Park. There, scouts work hand-in-hand with NPS maintenance staff to ensure that the Civil War era fort continues to be accessible to its visitors. Fishing, kayaking, and snorkeling in one of the least traveled national parks is what any scout can expect to experience while there. Canadian Odyssey The Canadian Odyssey Order of the Arrow High Adventure Program began in the summer of 2009. Based at the Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases, this program builds on the success of the Wilderness Voyage program by doing trail work in the Quetico Provincial Park in Ontario. Work crews, composed of Arrowmen aged 16‚Äì20, canoe from the base in Atikokan, Ontario to base Ely, Minnesota. As of 2013, the program began working exclusively in the Southern Quetico.http://oa-bsa.org/high-adventure/our- adventures/oa-canadian-odyssey Summit Experience With the opening of the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve for high adventure programming in 2014, the Order of the Arrow developed a program to be held at the Summit Bechtel Reserve. This program differs from its counterparts in that admission to the program is granted only to those Arrowmen who are between the ages of fourteen and eighteen during the entire trek. Further, the program is significantly shorter; the program runs for only eight days, as opposed to the fourteen of the other programs. However, the structure of the program echoes the structure of the Northern Tier and Philmont programs. For the first four days, participants will be working on a project in the New River Gorge area; the remaining time on the trek will focus on the various activities that are offered at the Summit Bechtel Reserve, especially around whitewater rafting and kayaking.http://oa-bsa.org/high-adventure/our-adventures/oa-summit- experience See also * High-adventure bases of the Boy Scouts of America * Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases * Florida National High Adventure Sea Base * Philmont Scout Ranch ReferencesExternal links * Order of the Arrow High Adventure Official Site Category:Order of the Arrow Category:Scouting events ","title":"High adventure programs of the Order of the Arrow"},{"id":"21764248","title":"Fedosei Ciumacenco"},{"id":"21764264","text":"Jehozadak is a man in the Bible, his name means Jehovah-justified.

It is based on the classical lifting scheme and generalizes it by breaking out a restriction hidden in the scheme structure. The classical lifting scheme has three kinds of operations: # A lazy wavelet transform splits signal f_j[n] in two new signals: the odd-samples signal denoted by f_j^o[n] and the even-samples signal denoted by f_j^e[n]. # A prediction step computes a prediction for the odd samples, based on the even samples (or vice versa). This prediction is subtracted from the odd samples, creating an error signal g_{j+1}[n]. # An update step recalibrates the low-frequency branch with some of the energy removed during subsampling. In the case of classical lifting, this is used in order to \\"prepare\\" the signal for the next prediction step. It uses the predicted odd samples g_{j+1}[n] to prepare the even ones f_j^e[n] (or vice versa). This update is subtracted from the even samples, producing the signal denoted by f_{j+1}[n]. The scheme is invertible due to its structure. In the receiver, the update step is computed first with its result added back to the even samples, and then it is possible to compute exactly the same prediction to add to the odd samples. In order to recover the original signal, the lazy wavelet transform has to be inverted. Generalized lifting scheme has the same three kinds of operations. However, this scheme avoids the addition- subtraction restriction that offered classical lifting, which has some consequences. For example, the design of all steps must guarantee the scheme invertibility (not guaranteed if the addition-subtraction restriction is avoided).  Definition  The (forward) Generalized Lifting Scheme transform block diagram. Generalized lifting scheme is a dyadic transform that follows these rules: # Deinterleaves the input into a stream of even-numbered samples and another stream of odd-numbered samples. This is sometimes referred to as a Lazy Wavelet Transform. # Computes a Prediction Mapping. This step tries to predict odd samples taking into account the even ones (or vice versa). There is a mapping from the space of the samples in f_j^e[n] to the space of the samples in g_{j+1}[n]. In this case the samples (from f_j^e[n]) chosen to be the reference for f_j^o[n] are called the context. It could be expressed as: #: \\\\textstyle g_{j+1}[n] = P(f_j^o[n];f_j^e[n]) # Computes an Update Mapping. This step tries to update the even samples taking into account the odd predicted samples. It would be a kind of preparation for the next prediction step, if any. It could be expressed as: #: \\\\textstyle f_{j+1}[n] = U(f_j^e[n];g_{j+1}[n]) Obviously, these mappings cannot be any functions. In order to guarantee the invertibility of the scheme itself, all mappings involved in the transform must be invertible. In case that mappings arise and arrive on finite sets (discrete bounded value signals), this condition is equivalent to saying that mappings are injective (one-to-one). Moreover, if a mapping goes from one set to a set of the same cardinality, it should be bijective. In the Generalized Lifting Scheme the addition/subtraction restriction is avoided by including this step in the mapping. In this way the Classical Lifting Scheme is generalized.  Design  Some designs have been developed for the prediction-step mapping. The update-step design has not been considered as thoroughly, because it remains to be answered how exactly the update step is useful. The main application of this technique is image compression.

Matulka's style ranged from Abstract expressionism to landscapes, sometimes in the same day. He has directly influenced artists like Dorothy Dehner, Francis Criss, Burgoyne Diller, I. Rice Pereira, and David Smith. Early life Matulka was born on 7 November 1890 in Vlachovo B≈ôez√≠, Bohemia, then part of Austria-Hungary and now part of the Czech Republic. In 1907 Jan, his parents Maria and John, and his five younger sisters moved to the Bronx. Soon after John separated from Jan's mother and left the family alone and with little money. In 1908 Jan Matulka began studying at the National Academy of Design in New York City. Upon graduation in 1917 Matulka met Ludmila \\"L√≠da\\" Jirou≈°kov√° who would on 1 May 1918 become his wife. L√≠da Matulka worked for the New York Public Library as the head of the Czechoslovak literature section and helped connect her husband to the larger cultural community. Between 1917 and 1918 Matulka traveled around the United States and the Caribbean as the first recipient of the Joseph Pulitzer National Traveling Scholarship, painting as he went. While in the Southwest he became one of the first modern artists to portray the Hopi snake rain dance. Work Hopi Snake Dance #2 by Jan Matulka 1917‚Äì18 In 1919 Matulka illustrated Czechoslovak Fairy Tales with writer Parker Fillmore and published by Hippocrene Books. In 1920 the pair compiled a second book, The Shoemaker's Apron, published by Harcourt Brace & Company The next few years Jan and Lida traveled to Czechoslovakia to visit the old family farm, as well as to Germany and France. Matulka found inspiration in the scenery of T≈≠ri P√¥le village, a place that fueled many more paintings over the years. Jan established a studio in Paris and would over-winter there while Lida returned to New York City each October. In Paris he was acquaintances with Gertrude Stein, Andr√© Lhote, Jean Lur√ßat, Josef ≈†√≠ma, V√°clav Vytlaƒçil, and Albert Gleizes. In the 1920s Matulka maintained both his studios, frequently traveling to and fro from Paris to New York City. Around the middle of the decade Matulka began painting stark and jazzy cityscapes. This by no means meant he limited himself to that style, as he was also painting landscapes in Cape Ann, as well as Abstract pieces. Katherine Sophie Dreier became his patron briefly from 1925 to 1926, which came to a premature end mainly due to petty disagreements and Matulka's general lack of social grace, ranging from tardiness to tantrums. In November 1926 he started to contribute illustrations to The New Masses. In 1927, Matulka began an association with the Frank K. M. Rehn Gallery. The clientele of the gallery wanted more conservative and representational works so Matulka complied because he needed the income. Again, this did not prevent him from painting in other styles for other outlets. In 1928 he began drawing from the model when he started meeting with the Society of Independent Artists, while contributing illustrations to the socialist Dƒõln√≠k Kalendar. \\"T≈≠ri P√¥le Landscape\\" by Jan Matulka (1921) With help from Max Weber and V√°clav Vytlaƒçil Matulka landed a teaching job at the Art Students League of New York, his first salaried position. Being the only modernist faculty member, his classes were quite popular. His students include Dorothy Dehner, Francis Criss, Burgoyne Diller, I. Rice Pereira, David Smith, Jacob Burck, and Esther Shemitz. The lattermost would later state that Matulka was the greatest influence on his work. Matulka was pushed out of his position at the Art Students League by conservative factions in 1931, but with encouragement from students he continued teaching a private class, which later disbanded in 1932. Matulka continued teaching one-on-one classes for a time after that. Personal and global financial woes soon prevented Matulka from traveling annually to Paris. In 1928 he sublet his studio there to jazz painter Stuart Davis. Later Josef ≈†√≠ma sublet it, taking it over completely from Matulka in 1934. ≈†√≠ma stored all Matulka's paintings and other works left in the studio, eventually transporting them to his own house in Fontainebleau, where unfortunately these things did not survive World War II. From 1934 until it ended in 1935 Matulka became one of the few abstract painters to join the Public Works of Art Project, giving him a taste for murals and public art. Immediately afterward he joined the Federal Art Project and also worked on the Williamsburg Houses, eventually completing two murals, both of which were eventually destroyed or painted over. Isolation and death In 1936 Matulka helped found the American Abstract Artists, but refused to join the group. His emotional state continued to decline, even more so when his sister Barbara killed herself on 5 July. By the time his association with the Federal Art Project ended in 1939 he had become even more socially and emotionally isolated. He continued painting more and more experimental works. Over the next few decades Matulka received much acclaim from his exhibitions, but remained relatively withdrawn from society. As age caught up with him, he suffered from many health issues, including deafness. Matulka died 25 June 1972 in New York City.

It was published in 2000. Plot introduction The novel begins with chapter one of a murder mystery set in a seaside resort. This tale is later revealed as being written by Euphemia (Effie) Stuart-Murray as part of a creative writing class at the University of Dundee in 1972. This main narrative is in fact being told by Effie to her presumed mother Nora on a remote Scottish Island in return for which Effie hopes to entice from Nora the truth about her family history and parentage... Reception Reviews were mixed: \\"Two indifferently received novels followed [Behind the Scenes at the Museum]\\" *Stephanie Zacharek in The New York Times complained: \\"sometimes it's clear in a novel's first 50 pages that its story is going nowhere fast. But there are other times, and harder cases, when a novelist kicks off a book with such lively, crackling prose and such deft character descriptions that you hang on desperately to the hope that its plot is going somewhere good...But there's a problem with too much clever wordplay and so many enticingly detailed descriptions: they can build you up just to let you down. Atkinson is terrific at setting the stage for her story; she just hasn't given it a very good foundation, and eventually it crumbles away to nothing.\\"Stephanie Zacharek, \\"You Go First. No, You.

Emotionally Weird - an unexplained and inexplicably grotty title that suggests a rather different kind of book - is teeming with various fictions; the book itself boasts a bewildering array of typefaces. A more insidious by-product of this carnival of confabulation is that, after a while, the reader has no idea what's true and what isn't. By that point, Atkinson is relying, rather too heavily at times, on the fact that we won't care, so beguiled are we by her narrative exuberance and comic invention...Take out the typefaces and banish the overly ponderous outer reaches of this book and it's just a series of gags; but they're pretty good gags, and it's none the worse for that.\\"\\"Wag tales Comedy?

It was fought over by the Carthaginians and the Romans during this period. According to the texts, most of them from Titus Livius's History of Rome, the city was situated in the north east of the Iberian Peninsula, near the mouth of the Ebro river. After the occupation and rule of both nations the city adopted the name Dertosa. Archeology For a long time nobody had found any trace that this city existed, with its foundations heavily concealed underground. This led to its very existence being disputed. In August 2007, archaeologists brought to light the remains of some of the city walls, dating from the 7th century BC near to the city of Tortosa. The walls provided sufficient evidence that this city existed exactly where it was written, and defended its remains from external attacks on the site. Latin reference > [P. et Cn.

When Hasdrubal heard about this, instead of bringing assistance to his allies, he chose rather to proceed himself with an attack on a town that had recently surrendered to the Romans. The blockade of Hibera, which had already commenced, was therefore abandoned by the Romans, whose operations were now focused directly on Hasdrubal himself.\\" [Livy, xxiii 28, transl. J. C.

MIB is produced by various blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and filamentous bacteria in the class Actinomyces, and also some other prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The main genera in the cyanobacteria that have been shown to produce geosmin include Oscillatoria, Phormidium, and Planktothrix, while the main genus in the Actinomyces that produces geosmin is Streptomyces. They give a musty or earthy odor that can be quite strong if an algal bloom is present. Subsequent death of the microorganisms will release MIB that is trapped in the cells. Along with geosmin, the off flavors caused are issues in the seafood industry. This chemical is the major cause of \\"muddy\\" or \\"dirt\\" flavors in catfish and crawfish.

It received a theatrical release in Mexico on August 20, 2010. Plot Kate, Steve, Mick, and Jenn Jones move into an upscale suburb under the pretense of being a typical family relocating because of the changing nature of Kate's and Steve's careers. In reality, Kate is the leader of a team of stealth marketers, professional salespeople who disguise product placement as a daily routine. Their clothing, accessories, furniture, and even food are carefully planned and stocked by various companies to create visibility in a desirable consumer market. While Kate's team is highly effective, Steve is new to the team, Jenn is a closet nymphomaniac with a penchant for hitting on her fake fathers, and a 30-day review is fast approaching. The team quickly ingratiates itself into the community, slowly shifting from displaying products to recommending them. Soon, local stores and businesses are stocking products based on the Joneses' trend-setting styles. However, at the end of the 30-day review, Steve discovers that he has the lowest sales numbers of the team, and Kate's job is endangered unless he can get his numbers up before the next review in 60 days. Eventually, Steve begins to find a sales tactic that works by playing on the fears of his neighbors and sympathizing with their dull, repetitive, unfulfilled careers. As someone who is frustrated with his job and disconnected from his fake \\"family,\\" Steve turned to their products to keep himself entertained. When he recognizes this same pattern in his neighbors, his sales begin to steadily increase as he starts pitching products as the solution for suburban boredom and generating product \\"buzz\\" through unwitting ropers. The team's dynamics become more complicated when Kate applies herself to the technique as well. Realizing that they can boost sales by perfecting their fake family dynamic to sell the image of a lifestyle, the lines between acting and reality start to break down. Things also get more complicated when Mick finds himself growing closer to an unpopular girl at the high school, Naomi (Christine Evangelista), in whom he can confide, while Jenn's flirtation with Alex Bayner (Robert Pralgo) (one of the men in the neighborhood) raises the suspicions of the neighbors. The team's cover is almost blown at several times: once when an old acquaintance of Steve's recognizes him at a restaurant, again when Jenn's indiscretions nearly expose her real age, and after a party where Mick markets alcohol to minors. Eventually, each member of the team finds that the constant pretense slowly erodes their individual desires. Jenn's dreams of running away with a rich, older man come to a close when she realizes that she was being used by Alex. Mick has a crisis of conscience when Naomi gets into a car accident after drinking too much of a wine cooler that the family was marketing to teens. Worse, when he makes a pass at Naomi's brother, he punches Mick in rage. After creating nearly record-breaking numbers, Steve is offered the chance to join an \\"icon\\" unit alone. He refuses, knowing that this is Kate's dream and because he believes that the \\"family\\" can do it together. When Steve's closest friend in the community, Larry (Gary Cole), reveals that he's going to lose his house because he's overextended his credit, Steve tries again to see if Kate wants something more than a pretend marriage. She rebuffs him, and the next day Steve discovers to his horror that Larry has committed suicide over the debts. Grief-stricken, Steve confesses to the community about the real nature of his job. With their covers blown, the rest of the Joneses leave quickly and are reassigned to a new home. Steve refuses the offer to join an icon cell and tracks the family down to their new location. There, he reunites with Kate and tries one last time to convince her to leave. Though hesitant she follows him out of town and agrees to meet his family in Arizona.

Origins Tuffley is a suburb of Gloucester, in the county of Gloucestershire. Recorded as Tuffley, Tufley, Tufly, Tuffel, Tuffill and possibly others, this suburb was once a village mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as 'Tuffelege', which suggests a meaning of Tuffa's farm, with Tuffa being an Anglo-Saxon personal name. To this was added the suffix 'leah,' meaning a fenced enclosure or farm. In 1900, Lower Tuffley was moved into the parish of Quedgeley.

The village is west of Norwich, east of King's Lynn and north-north-east of London. The Village is located a small distance south of the B1145County A to Z Atlas, Street & Road maps Norfolk, page 230 a route which runs between King's Lynn and Mundesley. The nearest railway station is at King's Lynn for the Fen Line which runs between King's Lynn and Cambridge. The nearest airport is Norwich International Airport. The parish of Leziate in the 2001 census, has a population of 581, including Ashwicken and increasing to 592 at the 2011 census. History This large parish is in the west of the county located east of the town of King's Lynn. The parish is bordered with Grimston to the north, East Winch to the south, Bawsey to the west and Gayton to the east. There are two hamlets within the parish and they are Leziate and Ashwicken, both these settlements are described as a shrunken village. During the medieval period the village of Leziate was much larger, but the village had shrunk sufficiently by the late 15th century for the parish of Leziate to be united with Ashwicken. The name Leziate comes from the Old English meaning meadow gate,Dictionary of English Place-Names: By A D Mills (Oxford, Oxford University Press) while the name Ashwicken is also derived from Old English and means either place at the dwellings or buildings or place at the ash trees. In 1086, when the Domesday Book was compiled, Leziate was in the hundred of Freebridge, and was quite small, with just three households. It had of meadow land and a mill. Leziate once had a parish church of All Saints, situated on a plot to the east of Leziate Drove. A list of its possessions compiled in 1368 mentions a chapel of St Thomes. After the parish was united with Ashwicken in the late 15th century, Thomas Thursby, the Lord of the Manor, was accused of appropriating most of the common land for himself, by enclosing it, and of evicting tenants from their homes before demolishing them. In 1602 Mr Bramwell, the parson, had removed the lead from the roof of the chancel of the church without authority, causing it to become ruined, but services were still held in the rest of the building until the late 1700s, by which time it was decrepit. It was demolished soon after 1816, so there are now no remains above ground, and the site is a scheduled monument. The remains of the parish church of Bawsey, dedicated to St Michael, are also within the parish, further to the west. This is a grade II* listed site, as much of the 12th century structure remains intact, although the font is now in the garden of Whitehouse Farmhouse. Between 1846 and 1968, the village was served by Middleton Towers railway station. This was on the Lynn and Dereham Railway, which ran between King's Lynn and Dereham. When the railway opened, the station was known at Middleton, but it was renamed as Middleton Towers on 1 November 1924. Following the publication of Dr Richard Beeching's report in 1963, closure of Norfolk's railways began in earnest, with Middleton Towers becoming an unstaffed halt in 1966, and the final passenger trains running on 7 September 1968. The station building is actually in the adjacent parish of Middleton, although the railway to the east and west of the platforms lies in Leziate. Soon after the opening of the line, extraction of high grade silica sand began from pits to the north of the railway. It was used for the manufacture of glass. A siding was constructed to the west of the level crossing in 1881, allowing a Mr Bagge to trade in sand and coal. Sand from the pit at Old Carr, around to the north, was conveyed to the railway by a separate mineral railway, probably of gauge. The operation had ceased by the early 1900s, and Old Carr was used for forestry. However, a new siding to the east of the station was approved on 1 March 1904, for the use of J Boam & Sons, again for sand traffic. Sand was being extracted from an area of , and a large industrial plant developed to the north of the station, with standard gauge railway sidings and narrow gauge tramways used to transport the sand to the works. A 20-ton weighbridge was installed in 1907, and the railway minutes quote 3,000 wagons of sand per year, but are unclear as to whether this was the projected or actual traffic. After closure of the line to Dereham, the section between Middleton Towers and King's Lynn remained open for the sand traffic and a new run-round loop was constructed to the east of the station buildings. British Industrial Sand took over Boam's siding on 23 March 1981, and shortly afterwards, the railway sidings and tramway were replaced by conveyors. Some of the tramway track had previously been acquired by the East Anglia Transport Museum, and was reused to construct their East Suffolk Light Railway. The extraction of silica sand has continued, although by 2015 the operation was owned by Sibelco. Around 800,000 tonnes of sand are extracted each year, of which three-quarters is transported away by rail. Trains normally consist of over 30 wagons, into which 1,000 tonnes of sand are loaded from a gantry which straddles the track. Two trains each day take sand to three glass factories, at Barnsley, Doncaster and Goole, although more trains are run when hot weather or major sporting events increase the volume of glass needed. Governance Leziate is a parish of the Kings Lynn and West Norfolk district council, which is responsible for the most local services. Norfolk County Council is responsible for roads, some schools, and social services. For Westminster elections it forms part of the North West Norfolk constituency, represented by James Wild (Conservative). The deserted village of Holt During the medieval period there was another settlement within the parish. It was called Holt. The village was demolished when the landlord, the notorious Thomas Thursby, enclosed the land and converted it to pasture for his sheep. Holt was the only Norfolk village recorded in the Commission of Inquiry in 1517 as being totally depopulated in this way.

It did not reach production and only one was built. Development In January 1926 the Air Ministry funded Gloster Aircraft to produce an all-metal version of their Gamecock for a high altitude fighter role, hence requiring a supercharged engine. The result was the Goldfinch, a single-bay biplane with unequal span wings of marked stagger. Unsurprisingly, this aircraft had a strong similarity to the Gamecock and in particular to the Gamecock II with its narrow-chord ailerons. Because of the supercharged engine the fuselage was longer forward of the cockpit. The tail also was slightly different, the tailplane having rounded trailing tips and the fin, initially, was very broad in chord and short in height.Flight 4 October 1928 Only one Goldfinch was built but there were two rather different versions. The first build had all-metal wings but a fuselage of mixed metal and wood construction. Both the wings and fuselage were fabric covered. The fuselage was then rebuilt entirely of metal, apart from its covering and lengthened. The rebuild also brought a revised fin and rudder, with a narrower, higher fin of simpler overall shape.Flight 4 October 1928: the g/a drawings show the early fin and the photographs the later arrangement Throughout, the Goldfinch was powered by a supercharged 450 hp (335 kW) Bristol Jupiter VIIF driving a 9 ft (2.74 m) two-bladed fixed-pitch propeller. The Goldfinch first flew in May 1927,Jarrett 1997, pp. 48‚Äì49. and in December it went to RAF Martlesham Heath for trials where it proved fast and high with a rapid climb rate, and generally good manoeverability, although spinning behaviour was substandard.Jarrett 1997, p. 50. Gloster's submitted it as a contender for Air Ministry specification F.9/26 for an all-metal day-and- night fighter, but it failed to meet the required load and fuel requirements and was eliminated quite early.

He was a high- school athlete and musician and was a member of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain (1969‚Äì72). While at Imperial he was awarded a Kennedy Scholarship to study at MIT (1974‚Äì76), where he received a doctorate in nuclear engineering (1979). From 1977‚Äì78 he was a Visiting Research Fellow in International Relations at the Rockefeller Foundation. He has been a member of the MIT faculty since 1979.  Nuclear power and waste management  First at the Rockefeller Foundation and later as a member of the MIT faculty, Lester developed a number of projects focusing on the management and international control of nuclear technology. During the mid-1980s he led a study of the role of innovative nuclear power technologies in restoring the economic viability and social acceptability of nuclear power in the United States and elsewhere. He also made contributions to the field of nuclear waste management, introducing the nation's first graduate course on this subject, serving on the National Academy of Sciences‚Äô Board on Radioactive Waste Management, and publishing (with co-author Mason Willrich), Radioactive Waste: Management and Regulation (Free Press, 1978). During this period he held the Atlantic Richfield Professorship in Energy Studies at MIT.  Made in America: Regaining the Productive Edge  In 1986, as an Associate Professor of Nuclear Engineering, he was appointed Executive Director of the MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity, and led the research that culminated in the publication of Made in America: Regaining the Productive Edge (MIT Press, 1989.). An assessment of America's manufacturing performance and how to strengthen it, Made in America was widely influential in the U.S. and around the world, and for a while was the best-selling volume in the history of MIT Press. Returning to the themes of Made in America, he later authored The Productive Edge: A New Strategy for Economic Growth (W.W. Norton, 1998), an analysis of America's industrial resurgence during the 1990s.  MIT Industrial Performance Center  In 1992, Lester founded the MIT Industrial Performance Center (IPC),http://web.mit.edu/ipc/ an interdisciplinary research center for the study of innovation, productivity, and competitiveness that brings together faculty and students from across MIT to explore questions such as: What is needed in order to prosper in a globalizing economy? What skills, what strategies, what technologies, and what new forms of organization are most likely to bring success in particular competitive situations? And how do technological changes now underway shape these options? While heading the IPC, Lester published the following books: * Made By Hong Kong (Oxford University Press, 1997), co-authored with Suzanne Berger. * Making Technology Work: Case Studies in Energy and the Environment (Cambridge University Press, 2003), co-authored with John M. Deutch. * Innovation ‚Äì The Missing Dimension (Harvard University Press, 2004), co-authored with Michael J. Piore. * Global Taiwan: Building Competitive Strengths in the New International Economy (M.E.Sharpe, 2005), co-edited with Suzanne Berger * Unlocking Energy Innovation: How America Can Build a Low-Cost, Low-Carbon Energy System (MIT Press, 2012), co-authored with David Hart During this period he was also co- author of two influential MIT reports, The Future of Nuclear Power (2003), and The Future of Coal (2007).  Nuclear Science and Engineering  From 2009 to 2015 Lester served as Head of the MIT Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering, leading the Department through a period of rapid rebuilding, educational reform, and strategic renewal. Under his leadership, the Department implemented its ‚ÄòScience-Systems-Society‚Äô educational triad, which calls for the faculty to work with students to develop their knowledge and capabilities in each of these three intellectual domains. He also encouraged faculty, students, and outside investors to consider the opportunities for new business formation around innovative nuclear technologies, and several notable startups emerged from the Department during this period.  Global MIT  In 2015 Lester began serving as MIT's first Associate Provost for International Activities. In this role he led the development and implementation of a new MIT strategy for global engagement. His current responsibilities include overseeing processes to enable MIT to engage with the world effectively, with responsible management of risks, and in keeping with the values of the MIT community. He continues to conduct research on strategies for achieving decarbonization of the global energy system while providing adequate supplies of affordable energy to the world's population.  Consultancy and trusteeship  Lester serves as an advisor or consultant to corporations, governments, and private foundations and non-profit groups, and lectures frequently to academic, business and general audiences around the world. He recently completed a term as chair of the National Academies‚Äô Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy. He previously served as a trustee of the Kennedy Memorial Trust of the United Kingdom.  Personal  Lester and his wife Anne Columbia live in Brookline, Massachusetts. They have three children, Leo, Caroline, and Isabel.

Background and family Giolla Brighde Mac Con Midhe was hereditary Ollamh to the Cen√©l nE√≥gain. The Ceart U√≠ N√©ill, a late medieval document dealing with the rights and territories of the U√≠ N√©ill in Ulster, places the Mac Con Midhe (MacNamee) family in the area of Ardstraw. Prior to moving to Ardstraw, the Mac Con Midhes were known as Cinel Suibhne of Siol Ronain, the other half being Cinel Neachtain, the √ì Maolconaires, Ollamhs to the O'Connor Donn. Siol Ronain were located in County Westmeath near the ancient capital established by Conn of the Hundred Battles at the Hill of Uisneach, and were closely associated with Clonmacnoise. In 911 with the midlands under tremendous pressure from the Vikings, the O'Maolchonaires were given land by the √ì Conchobhairs and crossed the Shannon into Roscommon, and the Mac Con Midhes headed North with the √ì N√©ills. His mother was of the Cen√©l Conaill, so he addressed poems to the √ì Domhnaills as well as the √ì N√©ills. His closest patrons, however, were the √ì Gormlahaidhs of Ardstraw. Mac Con Midhe married and had children, all of whom died at an early age. The childlessness of himself and his wife led him to compose De√°n oram tr√≥caire, a Thr√≠onn√≥id, an anguished plea to God and the saints to grant them just one child. There is speculation that there was another poet of the same name who lived earlier in the 13th century Compositions and fame Diarmaid √ì Diobhlin (2000) has written of him as follows: > Giolla Brighde was highly regarded by his contemporaries and there are > allusions to his poems in the works of later bards and in the bardic tracts > ... Like much of the bardic poetry that has come down to us, Giolla > Brighde's verse is stately, precise and controlled and clearly the product > of a very sophisticated personality ... He composed poems for several notable Irish kings and chieftains, including: * King Domnall M√≥r of T√≠r Chonaill, died 1241 * Padraig Ua hAnluain of Airg√≠alla, died 1243 * King √Åed of Connacht, died 1247 * Gofraid √ì D√≥mhnaill, died 1258 * √ì Gormshleaghaigh of Ardstraw * Roalbh Mac Mathgamna of Airg√≠alla, fl. 1270 * King Domnall √ìg of T√≠r Chonaill, died 1282 Besides panegyrics, he composed a number of religious verses. Outstanding among them is De√°n oram tr√≥caire, a Thr√≠onn√≥id (Have mercy on me, O Trinity) in which he pleads for the Holy Trinity to grant him and his wife just one child, as all of their previous children have died. A theachtaire tig √≥n R√≥imh (O messenger who comes from Rome), which defends poets and poetry against attacks by the church, is ascribed to him. However, there is some doubt that he was its author. Giolla Brighde's death is mentioned in the poem Lenfat mo cheart ar Cloinn D√°laigh (I will claim my right from the sons of D√°lach), which states King Domnall Og plundered the √ì Gormshleaghaighs while they were burying Giolla Brighide. When Domnaill √ìg was told why they had not fought against him, he returned all that he had plundered as a mark of respect for the poet, who had addressed several poems to him. His poems have been preserved in a wide variety of manuscripts from the 15th to the 19th centuries.

Each of the country's regions is uniquely coloured. Norway is commonly divided into five major geographical regions (landsdeler). These regions are purely geographical, and have no administrative purpose. However, in 2017 the government decided to abolish the current counties of Norway (fylker) and to replace them with fewer, larger administrative regions (regioner). The first of these new areas came into existence on 1 January 2018, when Nord-Tr√∏ndelag and S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag merged to form Tr√∏ndelag. According to most definitions, the counties of Norway are divided into the following regions (these groupings are approximate): *Northern Norway (Nord-Norge/Nord-Noreg) **Troms og Finnmark **Nordland *Tr√∏ndelag (alt.

At least parts of M√∏re og Romsdal - particularly Nordm√∏re - identifies more with Tr√∏ndelag than with Vestlandet. The region Midt-Norge/Midt-Noreg (Central Norway) is often used as a synonym to Tr√∏ndelag, but also includes M√∏re og Romsdal (according to some definitions only Nordm√∏re and parts of Romsdal). The southernmost part of Nordland (Helgeland) is also sometimes considered to be part of Central Norway. Similarly, Rogaland, or parts of Rogaland, is sometimes grouped with Southern Norway instead of Western Norway. Svalbard is not a county and is not usually considered part of Northern Norway. The governor of Svalbard (sysselmannen) reports to the Department of Justice, whereas the county governors (fylkesmenn) report to the Department of Administration. Also Jan Mayen is an integrated geographical body of Norway. Since 1995 it has been administered by the county governor (fylkesmann) of Nordland.

A number of the pieces in the series are seminal examples of indeterminate music, others are happenings: performance pieces executed according to the score. The seriesVariations I (1958)= The first piece in the series is dedicated to David Tudor and was a belated birthday present. The score consists of six transparent squares: one with 27 points of four different sizes, five with five lines each. The squares are to be combined in any way, with points representing sounds, and lines used as axes of various characteristics of these sounds: lowest frequency, simplest overtone structure, etc. Said characteristics are obtained by dropping perpendiculars from points and measuring these perpendiculars. The piece is to be performed by any number of performers on any kind and number of instruments. =Variations II (1961)= This work is intended \\"for any number of players and any sound producing means.\\" The score consists of eleven transparent sheets: six with lines and five with points. The mechanism is the same as in Variations I: perpendiculars are dropped from points to lines to determine sound characteristics, except that the list of characteristics is different: frequency, amplitude, timbre, etc. =Variations III (1962)= The third in the series is intended \\"for one or any number of people performing any actions\\". It is the first entry in the series that does not make any references to music, musical instruments or sounds. The score consists of two sheets of transparent plastic, one blank, the other marked with 42 identical circles. Cage instructs the performers to cut the sheet with circles so that they end up with 42 small sheets, a full circle on each. These should then be dropped on a sheet of paper. Isolated circles are then removed, and the rest are interpreted according to complex rules explained in the score. The information derived includes the number of actions and the number of variables that characterize an action. Cage does not specify the performers' actions, but notes that these can include noticing or responding to \\"environmental changes\\". He also states that although some of the factors of a performance may be planned in advance, the performers should \\"leave room for unforeseen eventualities\\"; and that \\"any other activities are going on at the same time\\" as the work is performed. This last is not an instruction, but simply an observation. =Variations IV (1963)= This piece is the second in a group that included Atlas Eclipticalis as the first piece and 0'00\\" as the third. Variations IV is intended for any number of players producing any sounds by any means, \\"with or without other activities.\\" It is dedicated to Peter Pesic. The score consists of seven points and two circles on a transparent sheet. The sheet is cut into nine small sheets. One of the circles is then placed anywhere on a map of the area where the performance is to take place. Then the rest of the sheets are dropped anywhere on the same map, and straight lines are drawn from the first circle to the seven points; if a line intersects or is tangent to another circle, the same procedure is applied to that circle. The explanatory note in the score gives instructions on how to interpret the results. Cage also mentions that performers need not confine themselves to a performance of the piece during the entire performance and are free to engage in any other activities at any time. The popular phonograph records of the premiere (issued by Everest Records) of this work is generally misunderstood as a sound collage of classical music, sound-effects, and ambient noises, etc. While this is what the work sounds like the concept behind the work has nothing to do with the recordings and sounds that were employed in the performance as such. What the work actually embodies is the positioning of sound sources within a given interior space. In that regard the recording completely misrepresents the basis of the work. =Variations V (1965)= This work has a score which is simply a description of the first performance, which included electronics, dancers, and other elements. Part of the setup for the work included light beams which triggered sounds from the electronics when interrupted by the motions of the dancers. =Variations VI (1966)Variations VII (1966)Variations VIII (1967, revised 1978)=References * Published scores: Edition Peters 6767, 6768, 6797, 6798, 6799, 6802, and 66766.

The \\"Valentine's day massacre\\" of 1349 Starting in the spring of 1348, pogroms against Jews had occurred in European cities, starting in Toulon. By November of that year they spread via Savoy to German-speaking territories. In January 1349, burnings of Jews took place in Basel and Freiburg, and on 14 February the Jewish community in Strasbourg was destroyed. This event was heavily linked to a revolt by the guilds five days previous, the consequences of which were the displacement of the master tradesmen, a reduction of the power of the patrician bourgeoisie, who had until then been ruling almost exclusively, and an increase in the power of the groups that were involved in the revolt. The aristocratic families of Zorn and M√ºllenheim, which had been displaced from the council and their offices in 1332, recovered most of their power. The guilds, which until then had no means of political participation, could occupy the most important position in the city, that of the Ammanmeister. The revolt had occurred because a large part of the population on the one hand believed the power of the master tradesmen was too great, particularly that of the then-Ammanmeister Peter Swarber, and on the other hand, there was a desire to put an end to the policy of protecting Jews under Peter Swarber.  Causes  Anti-Semitism in the population = The causes of the increased anti-semitism are easy to make out. Its development found fertile territory in the religious and social resentments against Jews that had grown deeper over the centuries (with allegations such as host desecration, blood libel, deicide, and Jewish conspiracies for world domination). Through their role as money-lenders, one of the only roles available to Jews, who were forbidden by local and often canon law, to own land or to be farmers, the Jews took an important position in the city's economy. However, this brought serious problems. The chroniclers report that the Jews were criticised for their business practices: they were said to be so arrogant that they were unwilling to grant anyone else precedence, and those who dealt with them, could hardly come to an agreement with them. This supposed ruthlessness of the Jews did not, however, derive from any particular hard-heartedness, but was rather due to the huge levies and taxes that they were made to pay, mostly in exchange for protection. Formally, the Jews still belonged to the King's chamber, but he had long since ceded these rights to the city (the confirmation of the relevant rights of the city by Charles IV occurred in 1347). Strasbourg therefore took in the most part of the Jews' taxes, but in exchange had to take over their protection (the exact amount of the taxes was determined by written agreements). In order to satisfy the city's demands, the Jews therefore had to do business accordingly, but in doing so further increased the population's, and certainly the debtors', anti- Semitism. With the threat of Black Death, there were also accusations of well poisoning, and some who now openly called for the burning of Jews. = The government's policy of protecting Jews = Unlike the majority of the population, the council and the master tradesmen remained committed to the policy of protecting the Jews and attempted to calm the people and prevent a pogrom. The Catholic clergy had been advised by two papal bulls of Pope Clement VI the previous year (July and September 1348) to preach against anyone accusing the Jews of poisoning wells as \\"seduced by that liar, the devil.\\" = Tactical measures = At first the council tried to rebut the claims of well poisoning by initiating court proceedings against a number of Jews and torturing them. As expected, they did not confess to the crimes. Despite this, they were still killed on the breaking wheel. Furthermore, the Jewish quarter was sealed off and guarded by armed persons, in order to protect the Jews from the population and possible over-reactions. The master tradesmen wanted to maintain the legal process with respect to the Jews; in their situation in which they themselves increasingly came under attack, this was a matter of self-preservation and holding on to power. A pogrom could easily escalate and turn into an uncontrollable revolt of the people. How seriously this threat of revolt was taken is shown by a letter from the city council of Cologne on 12 January 1349 to the leaders of Strasbourg, which warned that such riots by the common people had led to much evil and devastation in other towns. Furthermore, this unrest could give the opponents the possibility of taking power themselves. The bourgeoisie had after all come to occupy the leading political positions in a similar way, when they had used the dispute between the Zorn and M√ºllenheim noble families to their advantage. = The duty to protect the Jews = As the de facto master over the Jews, the city had a duty to protect them, especially since they paid significant amounts of money in exchange for this. Peter Swarber also pointed to this: the city had collected the money, and had given in return a guarantee for their security‚Äîwith a letter and a seal. The city must fulfill this duty towards the Jews. He therefore could not and would not agree to an extermination of the Jews, a stance in which he was surely strengthened by the fear of the negative effects on the economic development of the city. A weakening of the city would also mean a weakening of the patrician bourgeoisie, that was reliant on stable political conditions and a healthy city economy for their long-distance trade. The Jews especially had an important role to play in this: people depended on their credit for large-scale investments, their supra-regional role as bankers ensured a positive balance of trade for Strasbourg, and they filled the city coffers through the taxes they paid. There were reasons enough, therefore, to remain attached to the policy of protecting the Jews. = Overthrow = The motivations of the master tradesmen were concealed from the people of Strasbourg. Instead, they thought another reason far more likely: there were rumours that the master tradesmen had allowed themselves to be bribed by the Jews, which was why they were protecting them so determinedly against the will of the majority. It was therefore seen as important to first remove the masters from power, which would allow the majority to push through the will of the people.  Rebellion of the artisans  The chronicles have delivered a detailed overview of the process of the displacement of the masters. On Monday 9 February, the artisans gathered in front of the cathedral and, in front of the crowd, informed the masters that they would not allow them to remain in office anymore, as they had too much power. This action appears to have been organised beforehand among the guilds, since they had their guild banners with them and also appeared organised by guilds. The masters attempted to persuade the artisans to break up the assembled crowd‚Äîwithout success‚Äîbut made no moves to comply with the rebels' demands. The artisans, after an exhaustive debate which involved not only the guilds' representatives but also the most eminent of the knights and citizens, decided to make a new attempt. It now became finally clear to the masters that they had no support any more, and so they gave up their posts. One craftsman became Ammanmeister, namely \\"Betscholt der metziger.\\" The guilds had thereby attained their goal: the last obstacle to their demand of destroying the Jews was pushed aside, and they now had increased possibilities of participating in town politics. This had previously been denied to them, although in 1332 they had helped the bourgeois patricians to get a position of power.  Organisers of the coup  The noble families of Zorn and M√ºllenheim, who had been forced from power at that time, tried to regain their old position of power, but in order to do this they had to cooperate with the guilds. In the chronicles, this cooperation comes across again and again: the noble families brought their weapons at the same time as the craftsmen when the latter assembled before the cathedral, they were involved with the debates during the rebellion, and it was noblemen who put the demands to the masters, in the name of the artisans. The nobles cooperated not only with the guilds, but also with the Bishop of Strasbourg. This is proved by a meeting which took place one day before the rebellion and which concerned the \\"Jewish issue.\\" This meeting can only have revolved around the method of getting rid of the Jews; the fact that they had to go had already been decided a month previously. On that occasion, the Strasbourg bishop, representatives of the cities of Strasbourg, Freiburg and Basel, and Alsatian local rulers met in Benfeld, in order to plan their actions towards the Jews. Peter Swarber was in fact aware of this agreement by the bishop and Alsatian nobles, which is why he warned: if the bishop and the nobles were successful against him in the \\"Jewish issue\\", they would not rest until they were also successful in other cases. But he was not able to dissuade from the anti-Jewish stance.  Result of the coup  Through the coup, the old noble families regained a great deal of their former power, the guilds regained their political participation, and many expected an anti-Semitic policy from the new political leadership (whereas between 1332 and 1349 not one nobleman had held the office of a master, now two of four town masters were nobles). The demand to reduce the power of the masters was also granted. The old masters were punished (the town masters were banned from election to the council for 10 years, the hated Peter Swarber was banished, his assets confiscated), the council was dissolved and reconstituted in the next three days, and the pogrom began a day later.  The pogrom  The new rulers of the city did not care about either the contract of protection with the Jews nor the financial losses for the city which resulted from the pogrom. The two deposed officials were left with the task of leading the Jews to the place of their execution, pretending to lead them out of Strasbourg. At this place, a wooden house had been built in which the Jews were burnt alive. Those Jews who were willing to get baptized as well as children and any women considered attractive were spared from the burning alive. The massacre is said to have lasted six days. = Result = After getting rid of the Jews, the murderers distributed the properties among themselves, which suggests another motive for the murders. By killing the Jews, the debtors had the opportunity to restore themselves, which they used consistently. Many of those who promoted the overthrow were in debt of the Jews, and this shows the connection between the overthrow of the master tradesmen and the pogrom. Apart from Strasbourg nobles and citizens, Bishop Berthold von Buchegg was also indebted to the Jews, as were several of the landed gentry, even some sovereign princes such as the Margrave of Baden and the Count of W√ºrttemberg. The cash of the Jews was divided among the artisans by decision of the council, maybe as a sort of \\"reward\\" for their support in overthrowing the master tradesmen. This had probably been promised to the craftsmen in advance, and the prospect of a share of the Jews' fortune may have motivated them even more to murder. = Securing Jewish property = After the distribution of the loot among the citizenry had been decided, they had to ensure that this would not be reclaimed by anyone. For King Charles IV started to play politics with the Strasbourg Jewish legacy, by granting large-scale debt repayments for Jews. It is possible that the few Strasbourg Jews who were still alive also wanted to redeem their rights to the property. Counter-measures were therefore decided. Strasbourg made an alliance on 5 June 1349 with the bishop and the Alsatian rural nobility: the city would offer aid in times of war and promised to give back all bonds, and received the assurance that the bishop and nobles would support Strasbourg against anyone wanting to hold it to account for the murder of the Jews and confiscation of their assets. The Strasbourg council demanded that its allies should also take action against the Jews. In fact, it even tried to force those towns and nobles who did not do so to take action via the Landfrieden. With these measures, Strasbourg managed to retain complete control of the Jewish assets. In a deed of 12 July 1349, Charles IV also gave up his claims.  Political dimension of the massacre in the Empire  In the Late Middles Ages, Strasbourg was the most important city on the Upper Rhine. Since it had rid itself of rule by the bishop in 1262, the city was autonomous and effectively enjoyed Imperial immediacy. Thus, the throne disputes between the House of Luxembourg (with Charles IV) and the House of Wittelsbach (with Louis IV (until 1347) and G√ºnther von Schwarzburg) also played out on the level of city politics, inasmuch as both sides tried to form alliances. The bourgeois-patrician leadership was on the Wittelsbachs' side until Louis' death, after which they supported Charles IV, the city's nobility on the other hand now supported G√ºnther von Schwarzburg. The contrasts of both groups are also reflected in the throne dispute. Through this, the Schutzjuden (\\"protected Jews\\") became a politically misused power instrument. The disputes brought huge costs, which and these were partly offset by selling of the royal rights concerning the Jews. Thus curious situation came about in Strasbourg that the kingdom's Jewish right had been given by the rivals to different individuals (Charles IV sold it on 12 December 1347 to the Count of √ñttingen, G√ºnther sold it on 2 January 1349 to the Counts of Katzenelnbogen). Therefore there was now legal uncertainty, as it was not clear who was responsible for protecting the Jews.

It received its name from the Senne, a landscape that it crosses in a north-south direction. The Senne-Bahn Regionalbahn service is part of Deutsche Bahn‚Äôs M√ºnster-Ostwestfalen (MOW) network of regional services, which has its headquarters in M√ºnster. The former Westf√§lische Landes-Eisenbahn‚Äòs Wiedenbr√ºck‚ÄìRietberg‚ÄìDelbr√ºck‚ÄìSennelager railway was also called the Senne- Bahn.  History  The northern section of the Senne Railway between Bielefeld and Schlo√ü Holte opened in early December 1901 and the southern part of the line to Paderborn opened on 1 July 1902. Liemke station was renamed H√∂velriege at the request of the municipality of H√∂velhof in 1907. Paderborn Kasseler Tor station was opened in Paderborn on the eastern edge of the central area on 1 July 1907. After the economic decline due to the hyperinflation, the railway division in Kassel closed the station on 20 May 1924 due to its alleged unprofitability, but the city of Paderborn successfully lobbied for its reopening, which occurred on 1 July 1926. In 1942, a 600 mm gauge Feldbahn (field railway) was opened from Hovelhof station, to the Stalag 326 prisoner of war camp, which was 5 km away. After the conversion of the camp into a refugee camp, the line remained in operation until 1952. On 15 May 1949, the legendary Heckeneilzug (‚Äúhedgerow express‚Äù) ran along the Senne Railway for the first time on the Bremen Hbf‚ÄìFrankfurt (Main) Hbf route. In the next few years, the pair of trains enjoyed great popularity and extra trains had to be run during the Easter and Christmas holidays. With the closure of passenger services on the Buren‚ÄìBrilon section of the Alme Valley Railway in 1974, the beginning of the end had come for these trains. First, the trains ran for some time via Warburg and from 1979 they ran only between Bremen and Paderborn with a stop in Hovelhof. In 1983, the operation of all express services on the Senne Railway ended. On 17 November 1964, the existing municipality of Liemke renamed itself Schloss Holte after its station. This was a consequence of the rapid, especially economic development in the area of the station, while Liemke‚Äôs original centre had stagnated since the opening of the line. Sennestadt station The name Windelsbleiche for the station in the former municipality of Senne I was a result of the successful advocacy of Windel, a local textile company. The station in the former municipality of Senne II was called Kracks until 1966 after Johann Krack, the owner of the farm on which the station was built, and is now called Sennestadt (\\"Senne town\\"). Schlo√ü Neuhaus station The former Schloss Neuhaus station was reduced in the early 1980s to a siding. This continues to be connected for rail freight to the Benteler works. A new Schloss Neuhaus station was opened on 30 October 2008 between Schatenweg and Hatzfelder Stra√üe with access to Schatenweg; the access from Hatzfelder Stra√üe has not yet been completed due to problems with land acquisition. Diverted InterRegio service in H√∂velhof, July 1993. Passenger services have no longer stopped at Brackwede S√ºd since the timetable change on 11 December 2011. Simultaneously, the closed Bielefeld Senne station, which was rebuilt in September 2011, was restored to operation.  Reconstruction of the line  Section of track built in 1928 in Sennestadt station The upgrade of the Senne Railway is one of the most pressing transport projects in the Detmold region. After fierce debate on the granting of appropriate state funds in February 2006, the regional council of Ostwestfalen-Lippe decided to give the upgrade project the first place of its list of priorities, so that the line is included in the integrated transport plan for the state of North Rhine- Westphalia. The regional council considered an extension of the Senne Railway to Paderborn Lippstadt Airport, partly using the route of a disused section of the Alme Valley Railway, but the idea has been dropped. In May 2011, the upgrading of the line began at H√∂velriege station, where a new platform was built on the opposite side of a level crossing. Train running in each direction now stop after this level crossing, so that the crossing barrier remains closed only for a short time. A new station called Bielefeld-Senne was built between September and the timetable change in December 2011. It replaces the station of Brackwede S√ºd, but it is planned to reopen this station later or to rebuild it closer to Brackwede as a barrier-free platform. There are currently discussions on locating it near the IKEA furniture store instead. ‚Ç¨34 million was allocated for modernising level crossings and replacing signalling equipment by December 2013. The platforms are to be renewed and brought to a uniform height of 76 centimetres. The journey time between the two regional centres would then be reduced to 54 minutes (13 minutes less than before) and the maximum speed will be raised to 100 km/h. It will be possible to run services at half-hour intervals. From 14 June 2014, the travel time between Bielefeld and Paderborn will be reduced by 9 and 14 minutes depending on the direction and an hourly service will run on Sundays; a half-hourly service will run the entire route during the peak hour. However, trains will no longer continue from Paderborn via Ottbergen to Holzminden as the RB 84 (Egge-Bahn).  Current operations  The Senne Railway in H√∂velhof station Aw Paderborn halt Regionalbahn services on the Senne Railway have been operated by NordWestBahn, which is based in Osnabr√ºck, since 15 December 2003. It uses Bombardier Talent railcars with a maximum design speed of 120 km/h. The average cruising speed is 42 km/h due to the maximum line speed of 60 km/h. The services on the line are operated as RB 74 (Senne-Bahn), hourly from Mondays to Saturdays and every two hours on Sundays. The train crossings usually occur on the symmetry minute in Sennestadt and also in Sennelager at hourly intervals. Because of the need to adhere to the timetable at the symmetry minute, some connections towards Osnabr√ºck and M√ºnster are missed in Brackwede. In Paderborn there is a through connection via the Egge-Bahn to Holzminden. Passengers on this route must therefore not change trains because the railcars only reverse before continuing as the Egge-Bahn service. In order to make the route more attractive for cycling tourism, the line was branded as the BahnRadRoute Teuto-Senne (Teuto-Senne railway-cycling route) from Osnabr√ºck via Bielefeld to Paderborn. Many passengers travel with bicycles, especially on weekends in the summer. Cyclists have become an important factor for the preservation of the rail link. The carriage of bicycles has, however, been limited due to lack of space since the change of the operator to NordWestBahn and reservations have general been required since 2009 (a booking is now recommended). Individuals with cycles will be carried without prior notice if possible. A special feature is Aw Paderborn station near Paderborn workshop (Ausbesserungswerk, AW). It is served by only one pair of trains from Monday to Friday (by a train from Paderborn in the morning and by a train to Paderborn in the afternoon). On Friday afternoon, however, an additional train stops there running towards Paderborn.  Fares  The northern section to Schloss Holte is covered by Zweckverband Verkehrsverbund OWL fares. The section from H√∂velriege to Paderborn is covered by the Hochstift-Tarif (fares) of the Nahverkehrsverbund (local transport association of) Paderborn-H√∂xter. For through trips on this route, there is a transition fare and trips can be made throughout North-Rhine Westphalia using NRW-tariff (fares).  Paderborn Nord‚ÄìBad Lippspringe  A line branches off in Paderborn Nord to Bad Lippspringe, which was opened on 8 October 1906. The station building in Bad Lippspringe was built with extensions of solid construction and a freight shed with three tracks of utilitarian design. Its loading tracks had a 40 m long ramp allowing loading from the side and the end. Six people were employed in at Lippspringe station for 50 years. Passenger traffic was only moderate. After 1945, passenger services never again reached the average of about six pairs of trains a day that prevailed between the line's opening and the beginning of the war in 1939. Three pairs of trains remained in 1949 and only a pair of mixed trains was left at the end of passenger traffic on 30 May 1965. A large proportion of passengers had been employees of the Paderborn workshop. They also used passenger trains from the workshop to Paderborn Hauptbahnhof until 1965. Between 1980 and 1987, there were still several special services using museum train between Bad Lippspringe and Paderborn. The station building in Bad Lippspringe was acquired by the city after the closure of passenger services and demolished in 1973 due to disrepair. The freight shed was initially leased as a warehouse, but after a fire in 1981 it was also demolished. With the sharp decline in freight traffic from the Benteler siding towards Bad Lippspringe, traffic ended on 30 January 1988. In 1990, the city bought the site of the former station building from the state development corporation and released it for development. The remaining section of the line was officially shut down on 30 April 2005 and sold to the Benteler company. This continues to operate as a private siding.

Markman contends that in order to learn the meaning of a word, children make use of three basic principles: the whole object assumption (words refer to an object rather than to its parts or features), the taxonomic assumption (labels should be extended to an object of the same kind rather than an object that is thematically related), and the mutual exclusivity assumption (another label can be used to refer to a feature or part of an object).

It originated in 1910, and follows a route linking Port Arthur and Fort William. The race draws about 700 runners, and is held annually on Victoria Day, a Canadian national holiday. This holiday occurs on the 3rd Monday in May.  History  The Ten Mile Road Race in Thunder Bay has a history that dates back to 1910. It is the oldest 10 mile road race in Canada, predating the Tely 10 mile road race held in St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador since 1922. The Fort William Daily Times-Journal, a local newspaper, announced in April 1910 that it would sponsor an annual road race with the purpose of promoting \\"healthy and clean sport at the head of the lakes\\". The streets were lined with spectators along the entire route. The inaugural race was won by J.E. Edwards of Port Arthur in a time of 57 minutes. The Times-Journal went on to provide sponsorship for the race until 1915 when World War I forced the cancellation of the event. It was reinstated in 1920. During the 1930s the race continually drew a great deal of public interest. The number of entrants was consistently higher than in previous years (an average of 30 runners in 1930s vs. an average of 12 runners in the 1920s). World War II caused the race to end for 10 years. On Victoria Day 1949, one decade after the last race, the Ten Mile Road race was revived and organized by Branch 6 of the Royal Canadian Legion. A mere seven runners toed the line in that race, the lowest turnout ever. In the 1950s the race was not held as interest waned. In 1963, Branch 6 revived the Ten Mile Road Race one more time. Competitors and the public demonstrated that there was renewed interest in the race. In 1966 Gary Young entered the ten mile race for the first time, even through he did not finish that first year he has surpassed the saying if you do not first succeed, try, try, try again. In 1967 Gary Young finished his first 10-mile race at the age of 15, placing 10th overall in a time of 67:42. The following year at the age of 16, Gary came 4th overall in a time of 58:53. In 1969 at the age of 17 he won in a time of 56:15. Since then Gary has won more awards in the annual road race than any other runner. In 1976 finishing second overall Gary ran his fastest time in 51:36. Gary has finished second twice and third twice. Gary Young has finished the ten mile race fifty two times plus in 1978 the 10 mile race committee added the Canadian 20 kilometer championship in which Gary finished 3rd overall in a time of 67:24, making 53 times finishing ten miles on Victoria day. Gary has finished the ten mile race under one hour thirty-one times. In 2004, Gary Young became the oldest Thunder Bay runner to finish the race under one hour at the age of 52, (3 days short of his 53rd birthday), Gary ran 59:18. Gary now holds the world record for most annual 10 mile races completed. Gary is still competing as of 2020. The world record for most annual road races is 58 held by marathon runner John Kelley (deceased). The world record for most annual races (cross country) completed is 67 by Jack Kirk (deceased). In 1968, the first female competitor ran in the Ten Mile Road Race: Frances Blanche of Marathon, Ontario. Awards and separate categories for female runners were not initiated until the late 1970s. The fastest time to date for a local female athlete is Sue Kainulainen (58:30 in 1984). She went on to win the women's division seven times. In 1970, the event took on a higher profile as it became the National 10 Mile Championship won by Robert Moore. In 1973 Thunder Bay\`s Bill Britten ran the 10 mile in 49:13 while living and training in the city of Thunder Bay. In 1975 Jim Trapp also a native of Thunder Bay came back to Thunder Bay after attending Northern Arizona University and ran in a winning time of 49:04. Bill Britton came 2nd in 1975 in a time of 49:26. In 1978 the 10 mile race committee added a second race,the Canadian 20 Kilometre Championship. This race started before the 10 mile. Bill Britten won in 63:47,Jim Fethers was second in 66:04 and Gary Young placed third in 67:24. Only one woman ran the 20 km. race, Marilyn Fraser ran 93:23. Unfortuntely most runners in Thunder Bay raced the 10 mile, and the 20 km. race was a big disappointment to the 10 mile road race committee. Since the 1978 race all 10 mile race committees and race directors up to 2016 have failed to recognize the Canadian 20 kilometre event on the Thunder Bay Fire Fighters 10 mile web site. In the 1970s many of the country's top runners traveled to Thunder Bay and provided some of the fastest and most competitive racing the event has ever seen. Some of these runners were Dan Shaughnessy, Brian Armstrong, Robert Moore, and Jerome Drayton (a past winner of Boston Marathon). The nature of the race gradually began to expand, from a highly competitive elite event to one encompassing runners of all ability levels. This took place with the beginning of the running boom in the 1970s. Up until this time, the largest number of participants was about 80. Into the 1980s, the numbers of participants increased to 300 or so runners taking on the 10 mile distance. In 1989 Lakehead University sponsored the race with the help of Branch 6 of the Royal Canadian Legion and other supporters. They continued their sponsorship for the next five years. Bell Canada came on board in 1992 and 1993. The torch was then passed to Shoppers Drug Mart who contributed financial and volunteer support for the next 10 years. In 2004, the 71st running of the 10 Mile Road Race welcomed the Thunder Bay Professional Firefighters Association as the next title sponsor. In 2009, Half Way Motors stepped forward to become a presenting sponsor with the Firefighters continuing as the title sponsors. In 1981, a pre-race pasta dinner was added to the venue. It has continued to attract runners, organizers, volunteers along with their families and friends to come together to dine and share stories of past races. In 2009 the race had 714 individual runners and 150 more for relays. Eighty-Six races started with a mass start and normal race procedures. On March 20th, 2020 because of the epidemic Covid-19 Virus the Firefighters, Fresh Air sponsored 10 mile road race was cancelled; but the next day a virtual Victoria Day 10 Mile was started by Gary Young. This 87th road race had 59 competitors who paid no entry fee and was raced under the toughest conditions runners had ever experienced in a road race. Runners who entered raced without all the following: bib number, race starter, timer, competitors beside them or in front of them or back of them, spectators, aid stations, closed streets, prizes and there was no one to help them if they had health problems while racing. Runners were racing alone and against the clock. This was a race in a pandemic. It was suggested that entries donate to the Thunder Bay Community Fund and many of the entries did donate. The first overall male runner was Connor Macintosh in a time of 54:45 followed closely by his brother Michael in 54:59. Third overall in the men\`s race was Scott Wiebe 57:49. The first overall female runner was Jennifer Pasiciel in 1:10:02 followed by Jodie Ferguson in 1:11:43 and third overall in the woman\`s race was Heidi McGee in 1:18:23. Gary Young finished in 1:35:34 for his 53 ten mile race ran on Victoria Day. The low turn out of runners for the virtual Victoria Day 10 Mile Road Race was because of the difficulty of letting runners know the race was actually going to be raced because with obeying strict health rules many runners were unaware of the event.  Course  The current race route is an out and back course and has runners running up and down an overpass bridge twice, making the course more difficult than necessary. Although there have been minor modifications in the course over the years, it continues the tradition of offering a route that connects the two former cities of Fort William and Port Arthur. The course is not a fast course and has never been certified. The race starts on Simpson Street near the intersection with Donald Street and follows Simpson Street as it turns into Fort William Road and then into Water Street. At this point the route turns onto Marina Park Drive and the runners experience a clear view from the top of the overpass of Lake Superior and the Sleeping Giant. The route goes a short distance into Marina Park where it reaches the mid way turning point. The roads along the course are closed to all vehicular traffic with barricades and volunteers at each intersection. Spectators have easy of access to all sectors of the route with sight lines of the runners on the outward leg and homeward leg of the race. The Columbus Centre at the corner of May and Arthur Streets serves as the race centre. It provides the venue for the race registrations, the pre-race pasta dinner, and change rooms and the awards event after the race. The race has and continues to be held on the Victoria Day holiday which occurs on the last Monday on or before May 24. It begins at 9:00 AM to ensure that the runners have a comfortable temperature for the run and the roads can be reopened to traffic before the busier part of the day. The Thunder Bay 10 Mile Road Race celebrated its 75th running in 2008. Records *Male Open - Pekka P√§iv√§rinta, Finland 47:09 1975 *Female Open - Erja Ervonen, Finland 57:16 1994 Four Thunder Bay athletes have excelled in this race. Sue Kainulainen has the record for the most victories (7) in the women's division. Jonathon Balabuck has posted 5 consecutive victories in the men's division. Gary Young has the most annual races competed with 53 and has won more awards than any other runner. Bill Britten has run four sub 50 minute ten mile races,1973,1974,1975,1976 and has the highest age graded performance of all Thunder Bay runners at 91.62 percent. In all previous races only one other Thunder Bay runner has raced under 50 minutes.  References  Times News Newspaper, Brodie Street Library 1973 tape 360.

She served as a member of Knesset for Yisrael Beiteinu between 2009 and 2013. During her Knesset term she received media attention for attempting to physically disturb an Arab representative's speech and for comments she made on the psychology of gays and lesbians. While in the Knesset she was active in the international arena as chairperson of several parliamentary friendship leagues (with the legislatures of Estonia, Austria and Switzerland) and represented the Knesset in official delegations to the European Union, France, Great Britain and Taiwan. BiographyEarly life and education = Michaeli was born Anastassia Mikhalevsky in Leningrad in the Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg in Russia) to a Christian ethnic Russian family. Gaining her education in a school focusing on the English language, she was able to help provide for her family by tutoring English to children. At this time, she headed the International Friendship Club active in her school and aimed at hosting foreign delegations and strengthening international relations between youth. In her teens she practiced various sports, such as cross country skiing. Michaeli studied for a year in a local university with a major in humanities. She holds a master's degree in electrical engineering and communications from the Saint Petersburg University of Telecommunications. During her studies she became Miss St. Petersburg in 1995, she took a year off of her university studies to live in Paris, where she worked as a model. She met Josef Samuelson, an Israeli businessman of Latvian-Jewish extraction at a technology exhibition in Saint Petersburg. At the time she met Samuelson, he was employed in Moscow by Tadiran, an Israeli electrical supplier. He is 10 years her senior, originally from Riga, Latvia, and immigrated to Israel in 1971, at the age of 11. They married and made Israel their home in 1997. Michaeli wed her husband twice. Having no Jewish background of her own, Michaeli has since then converted to Judaism, the couple remarried by practices of Halakha. In Israel, after the birth of her second son, she underwent an Orthodox Jewish conversion, culminating with the couple's remarriage, this time according to strictly religious rites in 2000. After studying in an ulpan, Michaeli graduated from Bar-Ilan University with a certificate in business administration. Her media career began in 1998. In 2002 she joined the new Israel Plus Russian-language television station, where she worked as a journalist and presenter of Life's Pleasures, and the daily Morning program. Michaeli, after having had an Orthodox conversion, keeps a kosher home and has enrolled her children in state religious schools. Michaeli adheres to a Zionist philosophy within her family as well as in her career, stating \\"Judaism is at the basis of why we have this country to begin with. It's not just a religion.\\" She lives in Rishon LeZion with her husband and their eight children. Her eighth child was born during her parliamentary term. Election to the 18th Knesset In 2005, major politicians began approaching Michaeli to join their party and run for office. She joined Ariel Sharon's Kadima party towards the 2006 elections but it failed to win enough votes to secure her with a Knesset seat. In December 2008, Michaeli accepted Avigdor Lieberman's offer to join his Yisrael Beiteinu party. She was placed ninth on its list for the 2009 elections. Michaeli became a member of the 18th Knesset when the party won 15 seats. =Attacks against Arab parliamentarians= Michaeli was reprimanded by the Knesset Ethics Committee for attempting to physically disturb Israeli-Arab MK Hanin Zuabi while Zuabi was delivering a speech about the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid. The Ethics Committee statement read, \\"The committee could not find a precedent in which an MK attempts to physically disturb another MK's speech by taking the stand without permission. A line was crossed that cannot be ignored.\\" In January 2012, Michaeli threw a cup of water on Israeli-Arab MK Raleb Majadele during an argument about an Arab high school principal who had taken students to the annual Human Rights Day march in Tel Aviv. On 10 January the Ethics Committee suspended Michaeli from the participation in the Knesset plenum or committees for four weeks, but still allowed her to take part in house votes during that period. Labor party leader Shelly Yachimovich attacked Michaeli's \\"wild and violent\\" behavior and said it must have had a racist motivation. =Statements on gay and lesbian people= Speaking at a Knesset committee meeting in June 2012, Michaeli stated that most gay people had suffered sexual trauma at a young age and committed suicide by age 40. Specifically, Michaeli said: \\"I think that most gays are guys that suffered very difficult experiences of sexual harassment at a very young age and it just gets worse. ... In the end they commit suicide when they reach the age of 40 and it's those same guys that want to be women. I hope our awareness will rise too ... This is a campaign that needs to be done with professionals, also with psychologists.\\" LGBT groups were outraged by the statements, and 300 protested in a gay pride march in Tel Aviv. In an interview a week after the first controversial comment, Michaeli said that \\"Young girls become pregnant and have abortions that hurt their chances to get pregnant in the future, and in the end they become lesbians.\\" The statements were made in connection with her work to ask television broadcasts to be regulated for violent and sexual content. At the same interview, Michaeli refused to apologize for the earlier statement on gays and sexual trauma. She said, \\"If a man would say the same things instead of me, there wouldn't have been such a wide and robust response to it. I expressed my opinion and it should be respected. A sexual preference forms because we don't have enough advertising for normative family values and proper sexual education.\\" As 2013 elections approached Michaeli decided to withdraw her name from the list of candidates.

It is sometimes called an \\"anti-play\\" because of its renouncements of theatricality. It was originally published in German under the title Publikumsbeschimpfung (which better translates as \\"Insulting the Audience\\")Ronald Hayman, Theatre and Anti-Theatre: New Movements Since Beckett. in 1966. It premiered in June 1966 at the in Frankfurt as part of the \\"Experimental Theatre Week\\". The play was first produced in London in 1970 at the Almost Free Theatre in Soho by the Interaction Arts Cooperative's TOC (The Other Company) directed by Israeli writer and theatre director Naftali Yavin; the cast included Andrew Norton, Judy Monahan, Jane Bond, Robert Walker and Jan Chappell. Contextual information In a 1970 interview Handke said that the idea behind his plays was \\"making people aware of the world of the theatre--not of the outside world.\\" He goes on to say that specifically in the case of Offending the Audience, his \\"point was to use words to encircle the audience so they'd want to free themselves by heckling; they might feel naked and get involved.\\" He further goes on to explain his intentions: Plot synopsis In Offending the Audience there is no plot. No story is being told at all. Instead, the audience is made aware that what they see is not a representation of anything else, but is in fact quite literal. The actors continuously repeat the point that this is not a play, and that nothing theatrical will happen. The first lines of the performance are \\"You are welcome. This piece is a prologue.\\"Peter Handke Offending the Audience and Self-Accusation, (translated by Michael Roloff), Methuen, 1971, p.13 A prologue, that is, to all future theatrical performances. Plot analysis Handke used this rejection of traditional play structure to reinforce his anti-theatre intention. His point was to get the audience to consider what exactly theatre does, in particular, the role of language in the theatre. Character guide The only cast the play calls for are 'Four Speakers'. However, this has been performed with a cast of upwards of twenty actors.Jason Zinoman \\"What Were You Expecting, Mr. Milquetoast, a Plot?\\" The New York Times, 5 February 2008 Rather than placing the focus on themselves, the actors instead turn the audience into the main point of interest by making them aware of how they are breathing, sitting, thinking, etc. They draw attention to what they are wearing and how they have gone through the motions of \\"going to the theatre.\\" Character analysis Four Speakers, a mixed group of men and women. The four characters in this play do not assume a ‚Äúrole‚Äù in any traditional sense. The speakers remain merely anonymous actors who address the audience in the author's words. They are also largely indistinguishable from one another and even from the members of the audience. Their clothing is ordinary casual dress. It is expected that the men, in both the audience and on stage, will be wearing dark jackets and white shirts with plain ties. Women are expected to be dressed in subdued colors. During their time onstage, the four speakers address the audience directly without singling out any specific individuals. They speak in a bland litany, free of emotion, vocal inflection, or any significant gestures. Nor are any specific lines assigned to the individual speakers. The characters merely pick up and leave off the discourse in a random order, speaking for varying lengths of time. Frequently, and without explanation, they contradict themselves and one another. In doing so, however, they give no indication of their own feelings about what they are saying beyond a general statement to the audience that their opinions may (or may not) be the same as those of the author. At the end of the performance, the four speakers react to the audience in exactly the same manner regardless of whether the audience's response to their work has been favorable or unfavorable. Since there are no actual characters, the actors' job is merely to recite the lines to the audience. The more objective they are, the closer they are to Handke's intention of isolating the actors from the audience in order to emphasize the language. Handke listed some \\"Rules for the actors\\" at the beginning of the script including such things as watching \\"the behaviour of tramps and idlers as they amble on the street and play the machines in the penny arcades.\\"Offending the Audience and Self- Accusation Genre It is difficult to classify such a non-play play into a specific genre. In some ways Offending the Audience could be considered a dark comedy since it utilizes irony so heavily. However, Handke's intention was for it to be unclassifiable as anti-genre and anti-form. Style Offending the Audience falls under the style of epic theater as established by dramatist Bertolt Brecht. A major characteristic of epic theater is alienation, which is used to prevent the audience from becoming emotionally involved and distracted from the underlying issue of the play. In this particular case, the fact that the actors are not pretending to be other characters and are instead speaking straightforwardly to the audience is an alienation effect. Some other aspects of epic theater are minimal staging, anti-illusionment, and telling what is to come‚Äîall of which are seen in Offending the Audience. Language Handke wished to challenge the relationship of language and reality and to make the audience \\"intensely, unbearably conscious of the fundamentally arbitrary connections between words and things, until the linguistic mucilage that holds the world and our minds together crumbles.\\"Richard Locke \\"A Literary Troublemaker\\", The New York Times, 8 June 1972 The most prominent way of how Handke challenged the meaning of language is found at the very end of the play. The actors first begin to compliment the audience on how perfect they were and then proceed to call them various insults. The names the actors call the audience seem to become more and more random. The point here is to create acoustic patterns in the words so that they eventually become meaningless. Theme As is evident from the name, the whole show leads up to the point at the end where the audience gets \\"offended.\\" The significance of the insults at the end is questioned‚Äî-what exactly makes these words (any words for that matter) more than just noise, but items which hold meaning. Handke wanted to take the ideas of language and theatre‚Äîtwo subjects which were often accepted as they were without question‚Äîand point out why they didn't get questioned or challenged very often. Spectacle In theme with the whole anti-theatre idea, Offending the Audience has very minimalistic production values. The stage is usually bare, but there could be a false set in order to deceive the audience into thinking that it will be a conventional play. Music Handke was influenced and inspired by the music of the time. One of his \\"Rules for the actors\\" is to listen to \\"Tell Me\\" by the Rolling Stones. He was especially influenced by the Beatles. Two more of his rules are to see the Beatles' movies and \\"watch Ringo's smile\\" in \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\" Sample production history Offending the Audience has been performed all over Europe since its German premiere in 1966, and after its translation was published in English in 1970. The first performance was by Michael Locascio's troupe at various locations in New York City in 1969. Subsequently, it was produced at numerous locations, especially colleges, in the U.S., Australia, China, South Africa and the UK. It was revived in 2008 at The Flea Theater in New York City.

The township was the eventual destination of Loyalists fleeing the Siege of Ninety Six during the American Revolutionary War. In 1861, along with the township of Douglas, Nova Scotia, the Rawdon township became part of the newly-formed Municipal District of East Hants, along with neighbouring townships. The township is the site of the present-day communities of Upper Rawdon, Centre Rawdon and South Rawdon, as well as Rawdon Gold Mines. History Lord Rawdon by Joshua Reynolds (c.1812) The first European settlers in the Rawdon Township, Nova Scotia were United Empire Loyalists who had to flee their homes in Ninety Six, South Carolina. They first went east, taking refuge behind British lines in Charleston. About 501 Rawdon loyalists, as well as members of the 2nd American Regiment, were relocated from South Carolina to Nova Scotia in 1782 after the American Revolution. They named their community after Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings or \\"Lord Rawdon\\", who had rescued them from the 1781 Siege of Ninety-Six. The British had garrisoned a fort in this settlement because of its strategic location in western South Carolina, and as support for the many Loyalists in the area, most Scots-Irish immigrants. Stationed in Charleston after its fall, Lord Rawdon and his regiment, the Volunteers of Ireland (also known as The 2nd American Regiment), rescued the Rawdon Loyalists, who were severely outnumbered by about 1500 American Patriots. One of the most prominent Loyalists to survive the siege and settle in Rawdon was Captain John Bond, who was then part of the militia.Troxler, Carole W. \\"A Loyalist Life: John Bond of South Carolina and Nova Scotia\\", Acadiensis XIX, 2 (spring/printemps 1990): 72-91 Some of the troops who assisted Lord Rawdon in the Siege of Ninety-Six were from the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants), as well as the 2nd American Regiment. After the American Revolution, many of the troops of the 84th Regiment and 2nd American Regiment settled in the neighbouring Township of Douglas (i.e., Kennetcook, Nova Scotia and the surrounding area).

Serbia is divided into five statistical regions which are chiefly used for statistical purposes, such as census data. The regions encompass one or multiple districts each.  Introduction  In 2009, National Assembly of Serbia adopted the Law on Equal Territorial Development that formed seven statistical regions in the territory of Serbia. The Law was amended on 7 April 2010, so that the number of regions was reduced to five. The previously formed region of Eastern Serbia was merged with Southern Serbia and the region of ≈†umadija was merged with Western Serbia. The five statistical regions of Serbia are: * Vojvodina * Belgrade * ≈†umadija and Western Serbia * Southern and Eastern Serbia * Kosovo and Metohija Statistical regional classification In a bylaw from 2010, the Government of Serbia specified a nomenclature of statistic territorial units in the country. The act was an attempt to synchronize the existing statistical division of the country with the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics of the European Union. According to the act, an additional top level of grouping was introduced, with the territory of Serbia divided into two NUTS 1 regions: *Serbia-North, comprising **Vojvodina **Belgrade, and *Serbia-South, comprising **≈†umadija and Western Serbia **Southern and Eastern Serbia **Kosovo and Metohija The five statistical regions would therefore become NUTS level 2 regions, while the Districts of Serbia would correspond with NUTS level 3. However, the classification has remained largely in internal, and limited, use within Serbia. , it has not been sanctioned by the European Union. According to a 2011 whitepaper by ESPON, which discusses the possibility to include Albania, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina into NUTS nomenclature, \\"the statistical NUTS1 and NUTS2 regions created by the government in order to meet the NUTS criteria as well as the requirements of the EU regional policy, do not have actually a considerable administrative power; also, they are not self-governed entities. The political criterion prevailed for their creation.\\" Officially, NUTS regions only exist for EU Member States. For EFTA, EU candidate and potential candidate countries, the European Commission agrees with the countries concerned on a nomenclature referred to as \\"Statistical regions\\".

During World War I, he built the 27th Royal Prussian J√§ger Battalion, later the core of the Finnish army. Life Bayer was the first of two children born to Major General Stephan Bayer (1816‚Äì1893) and his second wife, Julie Henoch (1839‚Äì1888). During his early life the family moved often between Italy and Germany, living in Pisa, Florence, Bagni di Lucca, Viareggio, Baden-Baden and Gotha. While living in Baden-Baden, the nine-year-old Bayer suffered from a severe case of diphtheria of the eye. The family moved to Italy again between 1883 and 1886, and it was during this time living in Capri and Venice that he became familiar with Italian language and culture. His grave in Mannheim In 1887, at the age of 14, he continued his family's military tradition by enrolling as a cadet in a Berlin military academy. His mother died the next year. Bayer graduated from the school - the main military academy for the Prussian army - as a second lieutenant in 1891. Bayer continued his career in the Prussian army and volunteered during the Herero and Namaqua Genocide in German South-West Africa in 1904.

His remains were not identified until 6 months later and he was originally buried in the soldier's cemetery in Metz. In 1926, Bayer's remains were moved to his family's burial place in the main cemetery in Mannheim.  Founding of the German Scouting movement  In late 1908, Bayer met Alexander Lion at a meeting of the German Colonial Society. Lion had served as a medical officer during the war in German South-West Africa. At the time, Lion had been in correspondence with Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the worldwide Scouting movement, and was devoting much of his free time to the establishment of Scouting in Germany. Bayer agreed to work with Lion to edit and publish a German translation of Baden-Powell's \\"Scouting for Boys.\\" The book was first published as \\"Das Pfadfinderbuch\\" (The Scout Book) in May 1909. On 20 January 1909, the first German Scout troop, \\"Jugendsport in Wald und Feld\\" (Youth Sport in Woods and Fields) was formed in Berlin. Its first chairman was the well respected General Counsel Georg Baschwitz. Bayer was elected to the board. There was much opposition to the organization, however. Lion, Bayer, and their colleagues were faced with opposition from military, civilian, and church leaders, who objected to Scouting on the grounds that it was anti-patriotic. Opponents observed that Scouting originated in England, which was one of Germany's greatest political rivals at the time. A wave of attacks in the press followed shortly thereafter, in March 1909, and the founders of the organization faced social exclusion over their participation in Scouting. As a result of these pressures, Bayer resigned from the organization in May of that same year and his name was removed from the title page of later editions of \\"Das Pfadfinderbuch\\". However, Bayer had contributed much essential material to the book, including the sections on nature, Scouting techniques, and patriotism. When the German Scout Association (DPB) was founded in 1911, Bayer was elected \\"First Reich Field Master,\\" a post which he would hold until his death. He also took an unpaid leave that year due to ongoing heart problems and to devote himself to the design of the German Scouting movement. In May, the second edition of the Scout Book was published. This version, which again featured Bayer's name on the title page, was a completely revised edition. In an attempt to find compromise with Scouting's many critics, it distanced itself from much of Baden-Powell's original thought. The book was to become the model for the first German Scouts. In the spring of 1912 Emmerich Teuber, founder of the Vienna Boy Scouts Corps, visited Bayer in Berlin. Teuber was disappointed, however, that Bayer's efforts to establish Scouting in Germany had been met by such massive resistance. It appeared that the only viable compromise would be a unilateral pre-military youth training. Between October and November 1912, Bayer, Lion and Carl Freiherr von Seckendorff were subject to attack from General Alban von Jacobi, who accused them of, amongst other things, lacking in support for their country, King and religion. Jacobi created an anti-Semitic cartoon lampooning Lion, playing on Lion's Jewish birth, changing \\"Jungensport in Feld und Wald\\" (youth sports in field and forest) to \\"Judensport in Wald und Feld\\" (Jews' sports in forest and field), and calling Scouting supporter General Baschwitz a \\"vain Jewish man\\". In February 1912, Bayer, Lion, and von Seckendorff assisted Elise von Hopffgarten in authoring \\"Pfadfinderbuch f√ºr junge M√§dchen\\" (A Scout Book for Girls). In its effort to make young women more independent, it was free from patriotic or religious sentiment, and contained references to the women's movement.

It was first published in 2005 by Henry Holt and Company Publishers. The novel is about a teenage girl entering the social welfare system. She is taken away from her mother and placed in a group home. Plot introduction Cal Lavender is perfectly happy living her anonymous life, even if she does have to play mother to her own mother a whole lot more than an eleven-year-old should have to do. But when Cal's mother has one of her ‚Äúunfortunate episodes‚Äù in the middle of the public library, she is whisked off by the authorities, and Cal is escorted to a seat in the back of a police car. On ‚Äújust a short, temporary detour from what I call life,‚Äù Cal finds herself in a crazy group home with four other girls, watched over by a strange old stuttering woman that everyone refers to as the Knitting Lady. At first, Cal can think of nothing but how to get out of this nuthouse. She knows she does not belong there. It turns out that all the girls, and even the Knitting Lady, may have a lot more in common that they could have imagined. Cal is constantly thinking that her mother is coming to get her quite soon, but, as it turns out, it takes quite a while for her mother to come and \\"free\\" Cal from the group home. The four other girls at the group home are: Amber- The quiet, and almost bald, shy one who does not talk for the whole beginning of the book; Monica- The whiny, annoying one; Fern- The one who laughs at almost anything Whitney says; and Whitney- the girl who has had so much done to her, she made a list. For example, # 14.: Got dropped on head by Santa at a group home party. Whitney is probably the most important girl living in the group home with Cal. The five of them go off to find Whitney's sister, but, in the end, Cal discovers that this \\"sister\\" doesn't exist at all, and the only other ones who know about it are Amber & Whitney herself. Whitney also has a pet pill bug named Ike Eisenhower the 5th, whose brother, Mike the 5th, died already. Throughout the book, the Knitting Lady (whose name is revealed at the very end) tells them a story about a young girl named Lillian who went on an \\"Orphan Train\\" in the early 1900s. She finally tells them that, when Lillian grew up, she had a daughter named Brenda who was dropped off at a group home, just like Cal. Eventually, Betty (Cal's mother) comes and takes Cal back home.

The 1957 date is from Hajnal's cv; the mathematics genealogy site lists the date of Hajnal's Ph.D. as 1956. and his Doctor of Mathematical Science degree in 1962. From 1956 to 1995 he was a faculty member at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University; in 1994, he moved to Rutgers University to become the director of DIMACS, and he remained there as a professor until his retirement in 2004. He became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1982, and directed its mathematical institute from 1982 to 1992. He was general secretary of the J√°nos Bolyai Mathematical Society from 1980 to 1990, and president of the society from 1990 to 1994. Starting in 1981, he was an advisory editor of the journal Combinatorica. Hajnal was also one of the Honorary Presidents of the European Set Theory Society. Hajnal was an avid chess player.The announcement for the 2001 conference in honor of Hajnal and S√≥s calls him ‚Äúthe great chess player‚Äù; the conference included a blitz chess tournament in his honor. Hajnal was the father of Peter Hajnal, the co-dean of the European College of Liberal Arts. Research and publications Hajnal was the author of over 150 publications.List of publications from Hajnal's web site. Among the many co-authors of Paul Erd≈ës, he had the second largest number of joint papers, 56.List of collaborators of Erd≈ës by number of joint papers, from the Erd≈ës number project web site. With Peter Hamburger, he wrote a textbook, Set Theory (Cambridge University Press, 1999, ). Some of his more well-cited research papersAccording to citation counts from Google scholar, retrieved March 1, 2009. include *A paper on circuit complexity with Maas, Pudlak, Szegedy, and Gy√∂rgy Tur√°n, showing exponential lower bounds on the size of bounded-depth circuits with weighted majority gates that solve the problem of computing the parity of inner products. *The Hajnal‚ÄìSzemer√©di theorem on equitable coloring, proving a 1964 conjecture of Erd≈ës: let Œî denote the maximum degree of a vertex in a finite graph G. Then G can be colored with Œî + 1 colors in such a way that the sizes of the color classes differ by at most one. Several authors have subsequently published simplifications and generalizations of this result.; ; ; *A paper with Erd≈ës and J. W. Moon on graphs that avoid having any k-cliques. Tur√°n's theorem characterizes the graphs of this type with the maximum number of edges; Erd≈ës, Hajnal and Moon find a similar characterization of the smallest maximal k-clique-free graphs, showing that they take the form of certain split graphs. This paper also proves a conjecture of Erd≈ës and Gallai on the number of edges in a critical graph for domination. *A paper with Erd≈ës on graph coloring problems for infinite graphs and hypergraphs. This paper extends greedy coloring methods from finite to infinite graphs: if the vertices of a graph can be well-ordered so that each vertex has few earlier neighbors, it has low chromatic number. When every finite subgraph has an ordering of this type in which the number of previous neighbors is at most k (that is, it is k-degenerate), an infinite graph has a well-ordering with at most 2k ‚àí 2 earlier neighbors per vertex. The paper also proves the nonexistence of infinite graphs with high finite girth and sufficiently large infinite chromatic number and the existence of graphs with high odd girth and infinite chromatic number. Other selected results include: *In his dissertation he introduced the models L(A) (see relative constructibility), and proved that if Œ∫ is a regular cardinal and A is a subset of Œ∫+, then ZFC and 2Œ∫ = Œ∫+ hold in L(A). This can be applied to prove relative consistency results: e.g., if 2‚Ñµ0 = ‚Ñµ2 is consistent then so is 2‚Ñµ0 = ‚Ñµ2 and 2‚Ñµ1 = ‚Ñµ2. *Hajnal's set mapping theorem, the solution to a conjecture of Stanis≈Çaw Ruziewicz. This work concerns functions ∆í that map the members of an infinite set S to small subsets of S; more specifically, all subsets' cardinalities should be smaller than some upper bound that is itself smaller than the cardinality of S. Hajnal shows that S must have an equinumerous subset in which no pair of elements x and y have x in ∆í(y) or y in ∆í(x). This result greatly extends the case n = 1 of Kuratowski's free set theorem, which states that when ∆í maps an uncountable set to finite subsets there exists a pair x, y neither of which belongs to the image of the other. *An example of two graphs each with uncountable chromatic number, but with countably chromatic direct product. That is, Hedetniemi's conjecture fails for infinite graphs. *In a paperP. Erd≈ës, A. Hajnal: On a property of families of sets, Acta Math. Acad. Sci. Hung.., 12(1961), 87-123. with Paul Erd≈ës he proved several results on systems of infinite sets having property B. *A paper with Fred Galvin in which they proved that if \\\\aleph_{\\\\omega_1} is a strong limit cardinal then *:2^{\\\\aleph_{\\\\omega_1}}<\\\\aleph_{(2^{\\\\aleph_1})^+}. :This was the result which initiated Shelah's pcf theory. *With James Earl Baumgartner he proved a result in infinite Ramsey theory, that for every partition of the vertices of a complete graph on œâ1 vertices into finitely many subsets, at least one of the subsets contains a complete subgraph on Œ± vertices, for every Œ± < œâ1.. For additional results of Baumgartner and Hajnal on partition relations, see the following two papers: ; This can be expressed using the notation of partition relations as *:\\\\omega_1\\\\to(\\\\alpha)^2_n. *With Matthew Foreman he proved that if Œ∫ is measurable then the partition relation \\\\kappa^+\\\\to(\\\\alpha)^2 holds for Œ± < Œ©, where Œ© < Œ∫+ is a very large ordinal. *With Istv√°n Juh√°sz he published several results in set-theoretic topology.

The BJ2022 has been in production since 2005. The Beijing BJ2022 is a Chinese light utility vehicle. It is also referred as \\"Yongshi\\" or Brave Warrior. It was jointly developed by Beijing Auto Works and Chrysler. A concept vehicle was revealed in 2002. Chinese Army got very interested in the project, as it was looking to replace the ubiquitous BJ212 and BJ2020 light utility vehicles. So a couple of prototypes were made specially for the Chinese army. Eventually it has been adopted. Production of the BJ2022 began in 2005. Deliveries to the Chinese Army began in 2007. In 2009 due to financial troubles in the US the Chrysler left the joint venture and granted Beijing Auto Works the rights to continue production of this vehicle under its own name. Currently the BJ2022 is being produced in large numbers. It is the most widely used 4x4 vehicle in the Chinese army. It is also used by some paramilitary and law enforcement units. The BJ2022 is based on a Jeep Cherokee, but is longer and wider. The new vehicle is larger and more spacious than the older BJ2020. It is used as a troop and cargo transport, command vehicle or reconnaissance vehicle. A baseline BJ2022 has a fully enclosed 4-door body. This vehicle has a 500 kg payload capacity. It carries 5 soldiers, including the driver. Windscreen can be folded over the bonnet and top and side windows removed in order to reduce vehicle height. It has a trailer hitch and can tow light trailers or artillery pieces with a maximum weight of 500 kg. Other body types are also available. There are 4-door vehicles with open top, 2-door vehicles with hard top, 2-door pickup, and possibly some other. Some of them can carry up to 8 men, including the driver. These vehicles have 500 kg or 750 kg capacity, depending on the version. Payload capacity corresponds with the towed load. A lightly armored version has also been developed. This vehicle is powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged diesel engine, sourced from Nissan. It developed 140 hp. Civil versions are also available with a 2.7-liter petrol engine, also sourced by Nissan. Vehicle is fitted with a front-mounted self-recovery winch.

Founded in 1995 by Molly and Christopher Barnes, HMI focuses on educating teenagers through interaction with the natural world of the American West and Patagonia, South America. The school offers semester and summer programs for high school students, gap year programming for high school graduates, and short programs for middle school students and adults.  History  The High Mountain Institute was founded in Leadville, Colorado in 1995 by Christopher Barnes and Molly Peterson--soon to be Molly Peterson Barnes. The couple had met as wilderness instructors at Deer Hill Expeditions and spent the early 1990s working in independent schools including the Orme School and outdoor education organizations including the National Outdoor Leadership School. Over that period, Barnes and Peterson conceived of what would become HMI--a college preparatory semester school that incorporates community and wilderness pedagogy central to the outdoor education industry. Encouraged to act sooner rather than later by Peter Neill, who went on to become the founding Chair of the Board of HMI, the Barneses incorporated HMI as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, purchased land in Lake County, CO, and broke ground on their new school in 1997. The High Mountain Institute officially opened its doors in fall 1998 with a cohort of 21 students forming the inaugural HMI Semester--then called the Rocky Mountain Semester. HMI Semester enrollment grew steadily in the following years, reaching 48 students in 2014 where it has held since. The HMI campus has also grown, doubling in size from 40 to 80 acres in 2011, and increasing in number of academic, facilities, and residential buildings. The school has also added new programming including gap semesters for high school graduates, summer programs for middle and high school students, and avalanche safety and wilderness medicine courses for adults. After co-leading the school together for fifteen years, Molly and Christopher Barnes departed HMI in 2013 and proceeded to sail around the world for three years with their two sons. HMI Semester The HMI Semester is the founding program of the High Mountain Institute and has operated continuously since fall 1998. The program is a single-semester boarding school experience for high school juniors and seniors that combines college preparatory academics with extended backpacking and backcountry skiing expeditions. The student body, composed of 48 students, turns over every semester as graduating students return home to their four- year high schools and a new cohort arrives. Students enroll from various educational backgrounds including public schools, private schools, and boarding schools. As with all semester schools, the purpose of the HMI Semester is to offer a high school study away experience akin to a college study abroad semester where students learn by \\"stepping outside of their comfort zones\\". Students enroll in classes that largely align with the typical junior year curriculum. Admission to the HMI Semester is selective as the program receives approximately twice as many applications as spots. The HMI Semester is accredited by the National Association of Independent Schools and is a member of the Semester Schools Network, an affiliation of eleven established high school semester schools. = Wilderness = HMI Semester students partake in two or three wilderness expeditions in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and the canyons of Utah, specifically Bears Ears National Monument. Expeditions last from ten to eighteen days; students spend a total of five weeks in the wilderness over the course of the seventeen-week semester. Students backpack while on expedition, carrying their gear and food on their backs and covering three to seven miles on foot on any given day. Spring semester students participate in a twelve-day winter expedition on telemark skis. During this trip, students pull sleds behind them as they ski and construct quinzhees for shelter. While on wilderness expedition, students complete academic assignments, learn backcountry survival skills, and study leadership theory and ethics. =Academics= Classes at HMI are taught at the honors and AP-level, in line with the rigor of a top public or independent school. Class offerings include Literature of the Natural World, Natural Science, Spanish, United States History, Algebra 2, Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. Most of courses taught at HMI have a place-based emphasis that encourages students to learn more about the intellectual, physical, and historical underpinnings of the Rocky Mountain region. The hallmark class of the HMI Semester is Practices and Principles: Ethics of the Natural World. This course combines backcountry \\"hard skills\\" instruction with contemporary environmental philosophy. According to the school's website, the most frequently attended colleges and universities for HMI alumni are Colorado College, Middlebury College, Bowdoin College, University of Colorado Boulder, St. Lawrence University. The HMI Semester uses standards-based grading to evaluate students during the program, but issues final transcripts with letter grades on the A-F scale. =Residential Life= HMI students live in off-the- grid cabins with solar-powered lights and wood-burning stoves. In keeping with the school's philosophy of collective responsibility, students are expected to complete daily chores that include cooking, cleaning, and chopping wood. Students participate in daily morning exercise and train to run ten miles at the end of the semester. Students visit the nearby town of Leadville regularly and participate in volunteer trail maintenance on a local fourteener. Parque Patagonia HMI Summer Term Created in 2011, the HMI Summer Term is a five-week summer program for high school students. The program combines extended wilderness expeditions with field studies based on HMI's campus. About 30 students participate each summer. HMI Gap Semesters The High Mountain Institute offers gap semesters for high school graduates, ages 17-22. These programs take students on a three-month experiential and expeditionary semester through Patagonia and the American West. Students can earn college credit through Western State Colorado University and Colorado Mountain College.

W. Jeffrey, A Forgotten College of Oxford. It is not to be confused with the two other colleges also named \\"St. Mary's\\", more commonly known as Oriel College and New College. In the 15th Century, the canons of Oseney Abbey attended lectures at Oxford University. Sometimes other Augustinian canons were allowed to stay at Oseney for the same purpose. However, this was by favour rather than by right. Therefore, in 1421, at a meeting of the Augustinian order in Leicester, a petition was sent to King Henry V to found a college for the order in Oxford. A site was found at the eastern end of what is now the modern frontage of Balliol College. However, this scheme was abandoned because the King died in 1422. Later, in 1435, Thomas Holden and his wife Elizabeth founded St Mary's College, donating land in the parishes of St Michael's North, and St Peter le Bailey, and also building a chapel. Rules were created by the Abbot of Oseney in 1448. Secular clerks could also be admitted, but had to pay for their accommodation. The college was headed by the prior studentium. The College was located on the east side of New Inn Hall Street and a gateway still remains. The rebuilt buildings are known as Frewin Hall, named after Richard Frewin (or Frewen), a scholar at Christ Church, Oxford (matriculated in 1698) and later a Professor of Chemistry. On 1 October 1789, Brasenose College let the house and for many years the house was the official residence of the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University. In 1860, Edward, Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, was briefly in residence at Frewin Hall with his tutors. The surviving buildings of the medieval college and the Norman town house that preceded it, have been studied by Professor John Blair, who has reconstructed the plan of the site. W.J.

A convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Forscutt broke with that denomination for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the practice of plural marriage. Forscutt went on to serve in leadership positions in the Morrisite sect and later in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church). Forscutt was born in Godmanchester, England.Some early sources state that he was born in Bath. When Forscutt joined the LDS Church as a 19-year-old in 1853, his father disowned him and insisted that he move out of his childhood home. From 1855 to 1860, Forscutt was a missionary for the LDS Church in England. Forscutt was married in March 1860 to fellow Latter-day Saint Elizabeth Unsworth. On their marriage day, Forscutt and his wife began their emigration to Utah Territory with the intention of joining the gathering of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City. Upon arriving in Utah, he became a secretary to Brigham Young, the president of the LDS Church. Shortly after his arrival, Forscutt began to learn about the LDS practice of plural marriage, which he had not been aware of previously. This discovery, combined with other disagreements with Brigham Young, led Forscutt to disassociate himself from the LDS Church. Forscutt became affiliated with a group led by Joseph Morris; he was an apostle in the Morrisite organization and was involved in the 1861 Morrisite War. After these incidents, Forscutt joined the United States Army unit at Fort Douglas in Salt Lake City and was stationed in Ruby Valley (now Nevada) before returning to Salt Lake City. In 1865, Forscutt joined the RLDS Church in Salt Lake City. He soon left the territory. Forscutt became a close personal friend of Joseph Smith III. Forscutt later served as a full-time missionary for the RLDS Church in England and the Society Islands. He was a copyist in the process that led to the publication of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible in 1866. Forscutt composed a number of hymns and was the editor of Saints' Harmony, an RLDS Church hymnal published in 1889. Forscutt was a preacher in the RLDS Church until his death. On 2 May 1879, Forscutt preached the sermon at the funeral of Emma Smith Bidamon, the widow of Joseph Smith, Jr. and mother of Joseph Smith III. Mark and Elizabeth Forscutt were the parents of three children Amy Forscutt Parr, Ruby Forscutt Faunce, and Mark Zenas Forscutt. They divorced in 1867.

In contrast to most antibodies generated by exposure to influenza, which can only neutralize a few strains from within a single virus subtype, CR6261 neutralizes numerous strains from multiple subtypes. CR6261 recognizes a highly conserved helical region in the membrane-proximal stem of hemagglutinin, the predominant protein on the surface of the influenza virus. Based upon the conservation of the amino acid sequence on this part of hemagglutinin, CR6261 is predicted to neutralize roughly 50% of all flu viruses.

MS 72.2.3. It was previously held in the Advocates Library, Edinburgh, where it was classified as MS 53. The compilation contains Scottish Gaelic literary texts dealing with matter of the Ulster Cycle, such as the T√°in B√≥ Flidhais and Oided mac nUisnig (the latter a version of Longas mac nUislenn). Date and provenance The manuscript takes its name from an entry on the front leaf, which appears to state that the original compilation was completed at Glenmasan (Glen Mas√°in, on the Cowal peninsula in the parish of Dunoon, Argyll) in the year 1238. Based on the alternation of the spelling ao and ai for the same diphthong, Donald MacKinnon assigns a date no later than the end of the 15th century and suggests that the manuscript may well have been a first-hand copy of this early 13th-century exemplar. The presence of older linguistic features in the texts points to even earlier strata of writing. MacKinnon therefore proposes the scenario that an early Irish manuscript may have reached Argyll before c. 1238, that about this time, a reworked version was produced, and that the surviving manuscript represents a transcript of the latter made sometime before 1500. A late, anonymous hand on folio 19 wrote Leabhar Echdra ata ann so ar a scriobha le Eoin M'Tavis, \\"This is a book of adventures written by John M'Tavish\\", a name which recurs a few times elsewhere in the manuscript and fits the Argyll provenance of the text. He may have been the principal scribe, although there is no way of verifying this claim. History The earliest history of the manuscript is unknown, although later evidence suggests that it may never have circulated outside of Argyll. Marginal notes rather than external documentation shed some light on its earliest known stages. At the bottom of folio 9 occurs the name of one 'Robert Campbell at Glensluan' (Argyll), who has been identified as a forester in Cowal (Argyll) and a poet, who composed an ode to congratulate Edward Lhuyd on his Arch√¶ologia Britannica (1707, printed there). William Campbell, Robert's probable great-nephew and minister of Kilchrenan (since 1745) and Dalavich, is named on folio 15 as having been the one-time owner of the book and so may have acquired it through his grand-uncle. Another explicitly named owner (before 1782) is James McIntyre of Glenoe. The manuscript appeared in a brighter light in the late 18th century, when the Committee of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland requested proof that the Ossian published by James Macpherson was a translation from genuinely ancient Scottish Gaelic poetry.MacKinnon, \\"The Glenmasan manuscript.\\" p. 5. Rev. John MacKinnon of Glendaruel claimed to have received the manuscript from local countrymen, who told him that it was originally kept in the Kilbride Collection. The lawyer Lord Bannatyne acquired the MS from him and passed it on to the Highland Society. MacKinnon suggests that were it not for the controversy over MacPherson, the manuscript might never have come to light. A transcript was first made by Ewen MacLachlan (1773‚Äì1822) in his Leabhar Caol (\\"Narrow Book\\"). His work was superseded by Donald MacKinnon, who published a diplomatic edition with facing translation in the first four volumes of The Celtic Review (1904‚Äì1908). Features The manuscript contains 27 leaves in large quarto format, including the two forming the cover. The pages are written in double columns of 38, sometimes 39 lines each. The binding is anomalous at the beginning: the folio which now comes 3rd should have been the 5th, while a gap exists between the 4th and 5th leaf, possibly between the 5th and 3rd and possibly also between the 3rd and 6th folios.MacKinnon, \\"Glenmasan.\\" p. 8.

He was also a survivor of the Buchenwald concentration camp in Nazi Germany. Brand carried with him the first visa ever issued by the Government of Israel. Immigration Before the establishment of the state, Jewish immigration to Israel had been severely restricted by the then-governing British authorities of the Mandate of Palestine. There were rigid quotas and certificates required. Tens of thousands of Jews who arrived without certificates were regarded as illegal immigrants and chased by British police. Even after the end of the Second World War and the discovery of the full extent of the Holocaust, Jews were restricted from migrating to Palestine. As a result, Jews launched a major organized operation called the Berihah to bring Holocaust survivors to Palestine.Berihah - Yad Vashem After the Israeli Declaration of Independence was proclaimed on 14 May 1948, the newly formed Government of Israel ended all restrictions to immigration. The Law of Return was passed in 1950, granting automatic citizenship to Jewish immigrants.The Law of Return: An Introduction Biography Samuel Brand survived the Holocaust in the Buchenwald concentration camp, which was the largest on German soil. Although an old man by 1948, Brand chose to emigrate from post-war Germany to the newly created Jewish homeland. He traveled on the Greek ship SS Teti, which arrived at the port of Tel Aviv, Israel's largest city, on 14 May. He was the first person from the ship to set foot on Israeli soil.

Lviv, Ukraine Russian Christmas postcard. 1910s Koliada or koleda (Cyrillic: –∫–æ–ª—è–¥–∞, –∫–æ–ª–µ–¥–∞, –∫–æ–ª–∞–¥–∞, –∫–æ–ª–µ–¥–µ) is an ancient pre-Christian Slavic winter festival. It was later incorporated into Christmas.Encyclopedia of Ukraine Terminology The word is still used in modern Ukrainian (\\"–ö–æ–ª—è–¥–∞\\", Kolyad√°), Belarusian (–ö–∞–ª—è–¥–∞, Kalada, Kaliada), Russian (–ö–æ–ª—è–¥√°, Kolyada), Polish (Szczodre Gody kolƒôda ), Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbo- Croatian (–ö–æ–ª–µ–¥–∞, –ö–æ–ª–µ–¥–µ, koleda) Lithuanian (Kalƒódos, Kalƒóda) and Czech, Slovak, Slovene (koleda). The word used in Old Church Slavonic language (–ö–æ–ª—ß–¥–∞ - Kolƒônda) sounds closest to the current Polish language pronunciation, as Polish is one of two Slavic languages which retains the nasal vowels of the Proto-Slavic language (the other is closely related Kashubian). One theory states that Koliada is the name of a cycle of winter rituals stemming from the ancient calendae. Some claim it was named after Kolyada, the Slavic god of winter or Koliada, the goddess who brings up a new sun every day. In modern Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian (koliada), Czech, Slovak, Croatian (koleda), Kashubian (k√≤l√£da [kw…õl√£da]), Romanian (colindƒÉ) and Polish (kolƒôda , Old Polish kolendaBiblioteka warszawska. 1858 s. 318, Materya≈Çy antropologiczno-archeologiczne i etnograficzne 1826 s. 186) the meaning has shifted from Christmas itself to denoting the tradition of strolling, singing, and having fun on Christmas Eve, same in the Balkan Slavs. It specifically applies to children and teens who walk house to house greeting people, singing and sifting grain that denotes the best wishes and receiving candy and small money in return. The action is called kolyadovannya () in Ukrainian and is now applied to similar Old East Slavic celebrations of other old significant holidays, such as Generous Eve (, ) the evening before New Year's Day, as well as the celebration of the arrival of spring. Similarly in Bulgaria and North Macedonia, in the tradition of koleduvane (–∫–æ–ª–µ–¥—É–≤–∞–Ω–µ) or koledarenje (–∫–æ–ª–µ–¥–∞—Ä–µ—ö–µ) around Christmas, groups of kids visiting houses, singing carols and receiving a gift at parting. The kids are called 'koledari' or rarely 'kolezhdani' who sing kolyadki (songs). Koleda is also celebrated across northern Greece by the Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia, in areas from Florina to Thessaloniki, where it is called Koleda (ŒöœåŒªŒπŒΩœÑŒ±, ŒöœåŒªŒπŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±) or Koleda Babo (ŒöœåŒªŒπŒΩœÑŒ± ŒúœÄŒ¨ŒºœÄœâ) which means \\"Koleda Grandmother\\" in Slavic. It is celebrated before Christmas by gathering in the village square and lighting a bonfire, followed by local Macedonian music and dancing. Croatian composer Jakov Gotovac wrote in 1925 the composition \\"Koleda\\", which he called a \\"folk rite in five parts\\", for male choir and small orchestra (3 clarinets, 2 bassoons, timpani and drum).

Designed by Donald Ross in 1929, it is consistently ranked as one of the top 100 courses in the United States. Before the COVID-19 pandemic began, Seminole had never hosted a live televised event in its over 90 year history. The TaylorMade Driving Relief Skins Match, played on May 17th, 2020, marked the first time the club opened its doors to the public, with Seminole, traditionally an extremely private club, serving as the venue for the first televised golf since mid-March, when the 2020 edition of The Players was halted. Seminole was set to make its televised debut in 2021, when it is scheduled to host the 2021 Walker Cup. History Investment banker Edward Francis Hutton began development of the private, Seminole Golf Club in 1929 on land previously owned by Harry Kelsey. The site chosen for the course featured a number of sand dune ridges that were carefully brought into play with some fairways directed towards elevated green sites while others drop down from sandy peaks to flatter terrain. Both nines set out from the clubhouse on level ground before veering into the 40-foot dune ridge that runs alongside the western edge of the property. The greens at Seminole are the main line of defense for the course and many of them are cleverly angled, narrowing towards the back which makes rear pin positions extremely tough. Fairway bunkers are generally shallow but sand traps adjacent to the putting surfaces are often deep and troublesome. The course is most noted for its clever routing on a fairly rectangular site, which results in a new wind direction on each hole. The layout occupies a flat-bottomed bowl set between a high ridge of dunes to the west and the dunes along the Atlantic Ocean to the east. In the middle lie the necessary ponds to handle the drainage. Ross' layout managed to have 14 of the 18 holes touch these two lines of dunes (the 1st, 8th, 9th and 10th holes do not). To reflect and complement the sweep of the sandy property, Ross also used bunkering that was not typical of his other work. Instead of the more standard low-profile bunkering, Ross used flashed-face sand traps that are reminiscent of a George Thomas course rather than a Donald Ross work. Throughout its history, the club has long been known as a golf club for the corporate elite. In 1947, the club's members included Joseph P. Kennedy, Henry Ford II, Jack Chrysler, Paul Mellon, Phillip Armour, John Pillsbury and Robert Vanderbilt. The club has also hosted kings and presidents: President Dwight D. Eisenhower was an honorary member, Presidents Gerald Ford and John F. Kennedy played it often; and the Duke of Windsor was a member. Henry Picard, winner of the 1938 Masters Tournament, was the professional at Seminole for 26 years and Ben Hogan spent a significant amount of time here playing and practicing. More recently, several media outlets reported in April 2020 that NFL great Tom Brady had joined the club, shortly after he moved from his longtime team of the New England Patriots to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Following a period of relative neglect during and after World War II, Dick Wilson was commissioned to restore the course to its former glory. The original Ross greens were re- grassed and new bunkers were installed, which were intended to mimic the crests of waves on the adjacent Atlantic. In 2016, Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw were tasked to carry out a three-year renovation of the course, which focused on the rebuilding of over 100 bunkers and exposed sandy expanses in the rough. The extent of the renovations over the years has remained relatively minor, and Seminole Golf Club, along with Pinehurst #2, are both considered by many to be Donald Ross' two masterpieces. The club is scheduled to host the 2021 Walker Cup.

Scalds are the most common type of thermal burn suffered by children, but for adults thermal burns are most commonly caused by fire. Burns are generally classified from first degree up to fourth degree, but the American Burn Association (ABA) has categorized thermal burns as minor, moderate, and major, based almost solely on the depth and size of the burn. CausesHot liquids and steam= Scalding is a type of thermal burn caused by boiling water and steam, commonly suffered by children. Scalds are commonly caused by accidental spilling of hot liquids, having water temperature too high for baths and showers, steam from boiling water or heated food, or getting splattered by hot cooking oil. Scalding is usually a first- or second-degree burn, and third-degree burn can sometimes result from prolonged contact. Nearly three quarters of all burn injuries suffered by young children are scalds. =Fire= Fire causes about 50% of all cases of thermal burns in the United States.National Burn Repository Pg. i The most frequent event where people get burned by fire is during house fires encountered by firefighters and trapped occupants, where 85% of all fire deaths take place. Fireworks are another notable cause of fire burns, especially among adolescent males on Independence Days. The most common cause of injury by fire or flame in children is touching candle flame. In some regions, such as the western United States, wildfires are responsible for an increase in burn injuries. Wildfires can suddenly shift due to changing wind directions, making it harder for firefighters and eyewitnesses to avoid getting burned. If clothing catches fire, third-degree burn can develop in a matter of just a few seconds. =Hot objects= Solid objects that are hot can also cause contact burns, especially in children, who may intentionally touch things they don't know are too hot to touch. Such burns imprinted on the skin usually form a pattern that resembles the object. Sources of burns from solid objects include ashes and coal, irons, soldering equipment, frying pans and pots, oven containers, light bulbs, and exhaust pipes. Pathophysiology Picture depicting Jackson's Burn Zones. There are three (or sometimes four) degrees of burns, in ascending order of severity and depth. For more information, see Signs and symptoms. According to Jackson's thermal wound theory, there are three zones of major burn injury. *Zone of coagulation is the area that sustained maximum damage from the heat source. Proteins become denaturated, and cell death is imminent due to destruction of blood vessels, resulting in ischemia to the area. Injury at this area is irreversible (coagulative necrosis & gangrene) *Zone of stasis surrounds the coagulation area, where tissue is potentially salvageable. This is the main area of focus when treating burn injuries. *Zone of hyperemia is the area surrounding the zone of stasis. Perfusion is adequate due to patent blood vessels, and erythema occurs due to increased vascular permeability. =Factors= The minimum temperature that can cause a burn in a finite amount of time is 44 ¬∞C (111 ¬∞F) for exposure times exceeding 6 hours. From 44¬∞ to 51 ¬∞C (111¬∞ to 124 ¬∞F), the rate of burn approximately doubles with each degree risen. The burn would develop in less than a second if the exposure temperature is at least 70 ¬∞C (160 ¬∞F). There are skin factors that offer resistance to burns. A person who is more burn resistant would require higher temperature and longer exposure to burn as badly than a less resistant person. Thick skin is more prone to superficial burns because of the simple fact that there's more to burn before it gets deep. Skin thickness varies throughout the body, from 0.5mm of the eye lids to 6mm in the soles of the feet. Skin thickness overall varies with age, being thinner at extremes of age. External factors on the skin like hair, moisture or oils can also help ease and delay the burn. Another factor is skin circulation, which is used to dissipate heat imprinted on the skin. Prevention It is important to teach children how to avoid fire and scalding. Firefighters and community leaders often lead such programs in schools and clinics. Smoke alarms installed in homes can reduce deaths resulting from fire by half. Homeowners should change batteries at least once a year and replace smoke alarms every decade. Before fire occurs, a family should practice evacuating the home, and when fire occurs the family must leave the residence immediately (within two minutes). Sources of flame, like matches, should be kept out of children's reach. Stoves, ovens, space- heaters, and candles must not be left unattended, and flammable objects must be kept at least 30 cm away from open flames. Fire extinguishers should be stored in the kitchen, where most house fires start. To prevent children from getting burned, water temperature must not be set too high when taking baths or washing hands, nonflammable sleepwear should be worn, back burners should be used when cooking something on the stove, and hot foods, drinks, and irons should be kept away from the edge of counter and table. Oven mitts and potholders must be used in handling hot containers. Care should be taken when taking hot foods out of microwave ovens, and covers should be opened gently to reduce the risk of steam burns. Treatment The most important first action is to stop the burning process. The source of the burn should promptly be removed (or the patient removed from the source). If the person is on fire, he/she must be told to stop, drop and roll, or extinguish the fire by covering them with heavy blanket, wool, coat, or rug. Burning clothing should be removed as should all jewelry that could act as a tourniquet as swelling occurs, but burned clothing stuck to the skin must not be removed. Cooling the burn with cold running water has been shown to be beneficial if accomplished within 30 minutes of the injury.http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopicSeg&topic;_id=186&seg;_id=3853 The pain or inflammation can then be effectively treated using acetaminophen (paracetamol), or ibuprofen. Ice, butter, cream and ointment cannot be used since they can worsen the burn. Severe burn patients are often treated through trauma resuscitation, airway management, fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion, wound management, and skin grafting, as well as the use of antibiotics. Outcome 95% of people hospitalized for thermal burns survive. Survival rates have increased steadily over the last half century due to advances in treatment and better burn centers. Patients with uncomplicated burns have a 99.7% survival rate. Three risk factors‚Äîpatient age above 60, burns covering more than 40% of the body, and inhalation injury‚Äîgreatly reduce the odds of survival, which decline to 97% with any one of these complications, to 67% with any two, and to only 10% in cases with all three. Epidemiology In the United States, over two million people required medical attention for thermal burns every year. About 1 in 30 of those victims (75,000) are hospitalized for thermal burns every year, with a third of those patients staying in the hospital for more than two months. About 14,000 Americans die each year from burns. =Children= Thermal burns are one of the most common early childhood injuries. In the United States, burns are the third most common cause of accidental death among children. Nearly 96,000 children around the world died as a result of thermal burns in 2004, and 61,400 died in 2008 from thermal injuries. Deaths from burns dropped by 55% from 1999 to 2011. Burns are the only mode of unintentional injury which more girls suffer from than boys worldwide, including by fire.

Thompson (born April 1953) is the founder and president of Family Harvest International, a worldwide network of Christian congregations. He is the founder of Family Harvest Church in Tinley Park, Illinois, a racially diverse church with over 4,000 members. Early life Thompson grew up in Oak Lawn, Illinois where he was raised a Roman Catholic and worked for United Parcel Service for the majority of his early adulthood. He moved to Homer Township, Illinois, where he sought \\"practical answers to life's problems and a real personal relationship with Jesus Christ\\", and began considering other denominations. He stated that he had a transformative experience on October 28, 1975 where he was \\"unplugged and reengineered and then plugged in again to Christ\\" and became a Baptist for several years. Thompson was given an honorary doctoral degree from Life Christian University, an unaccredited institution and diploma mill, based in Tampa, Florida. Church leadership As an ordained minister, Thompson founded Midwest Christian Center in 1983, which later grew into a large worship center. He remained the pastor of the center through the late 1990s. He also pastored the House of Glory church in the 1980s, in Orland Park, Illinois, and held regular Bible study groups. It was during these study groups in 1999 where the name \\"Family Harvest\\" was conceived. Thompson is the founder of the nondenominational Family Harvest Church in Tinley Park, Illinois, a member of the Family Harvest International network. Family Harvest Church, which can hold over 3,000 congregants in one service, has been called a megachurch, noted for its theater chairs, projection screens, polished singing performances, stage lighting, amplified sound, and TV and web shows. In 2004, the church had nearly $10 million in assets. Church activities In 1986, in an effort to promote that Halloween is \\"historically evil\\" and harmful to children, Thompson's church scheduled a \\"Hallelujah Party\\" in its place on October 31. The church has made it an annual tradition ever since. Family Harvest Church's ministers preached regularly about the risk of a \\"Y2K apocalypse\\" during 1998, relating it to Thompson's published interpretation of the Bible. On January 2, 2000, with Y2K essentially a nonevent, pastor Rev. Doug Boettcher's message was about not letting go of one's preparations, urging members of the Family Harvest Church to be prepared \\"for any kind of natural disaster\\" and to help their neighbors in such a situation; but many locals had already returned generators and space heaters the day before. In 2005, Family Harvest Church opposed Tinley Park's decision to zone an off-track betting facility, as destructive of local ideals. For Christmas 2005, Thompson arranged the donation of over 100,000 articles of clothing, toys, and other goods to Miracle Centre Cathedral, a Ugandan cathedral run by senior pastor Robert Kayanja that is claimed to be the biggest auditorium in East Africa. The items were distributed to displaced persons' camps and orphanages in northern Uganda. In 2009, Thompson founded \\"City Harvest\\", a Family Harvest Church ministry in northwest suburban Chicago. In early 2011, the Robb Thompson Ministries hosted the \\"Dancing for the Stars\\" dinner-dance fundraising event in Orland Hills, Illinois. The proceeds of the event were to go to underprivileged children around the world and to funding Family Harvest's global missions. Over 400 attended the event which helped raise $25,000. With these funds, two medical and dental trips are being organized in 2011, to the Pet√©n Jungle in Guatemala and later to Haiti, where children, orphans and adults will be offered free medical and dental checkups and treatment. The ministries also announced that a portion of the funds will be donated to help Japan after the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.

She is the oldest surviving steam trawler in the world. During her long career, she was known as HMT Viola, Kapduen, and Dias. She is currently beached at Grytviken in South Georgia, though there are currently plans afoot to return her to Hull.  History  Cook, Welton & Gemmell of Beverley built Viola for the Hellyer Steam Fishing Company in 1906. After launching, she was floated down the River Hull to Hull where the engineering firm of Amos & Smith fitted her with steam engines. She burnt coal until 1956 when she was converted to oil. She was part of the Hellyer Steam Fishing Company's North Sea fleet, and like much of Hellyer's fleet was named after a Shakespearean character. Hellyer trawlers stayed out at sea for weeks at a time, transferring their catch to a fleet of five fast steam cutters that commuted between the fishing grounds and the fish markets of eastern England. Viola was regularly at sea for more than 310 days a year.  Viola at war  In September 1914, Viola was requisitioned by the Admiralty (FY 614) armed with a 3 pounder gun and moved to Shetland, patrolling the waters out as far as Fair Isle looking for U-boats and escorting other vessels. Later in the war, Viola was armed with a 12-pounder gun, and transferred to the Tyne for minesweeping duty. She was one of the first vessels to use depth charges. She was also fitted with hydrophones. Along with other armed trawlers she was involved in actions resulting in the sinking of at least two U-boats: the UB-30 off Whitby on 13 August 1918, and the UB-115 off the Northumberland coast on 29 September.  Kapduen and Dias - whaling  Dias as whale catcher Many vessels from Hellyer's North Sea fleet were lost during the war. After the war Hellyer decided to concentrate on the distant fishing grounds off the coast of Iceland and the Barents Sea. Consequently, in 1918 they sold-off the remaining North Sea trawlers, including sold Viola, which they sold to Massey & Sons. In the following year Massey sold her to L. Thorsen of Norway, who renamed her Kapduen. The whaling firm of Nils Torvald Nielsen Alonso acquired Thorsen and converted Kapduen for whaling, fitting her with a new bridge forward of the funnel. She was renamed Dias in 1924 and over the next few years whaled off the coast of Africa. By 1927 she was laid up at Sandefjord.  Dias - sealing and expeditions  Dias was then sold to Compa√±√≠a Argentina de Pesca, who moved to Grytviken in South Georgia for sealing. She also served as a support vessel for expeditions in the South Atlantic, supporting the Argentine weather station at Laurie Island, the Kohl-Larsen Expedition of 1928/9, the British South Georgia Expedition of 1954/55, the topographical surveys carried out by Duncan Carse between 1951 and 1957, and the Bird Island Expedition of 1958.  Retirement and decay  left In 1964 the whaling station at Grytviken closed, and Dias, along with another sealer, Albatros, was laid up. A caretaker was responsible for maintenance, painting, and running the engines, but he left in 1971. Over the next few years snow and ice built up on the superstructure and Dias foundered at her mooring in the winter of 1974. Albatros sank the following year.  Rescue campaign  In 2004, as part of a project to restore and conserve Grytviken, Dias and Albatros were refloated and cleared of all remaining oil. Both ships have now been beached. An organisation, the \\"Friends of Viola/Dias\\", seeks to preserve the ship, either in situ or by bringing her back to Hull. The \\"Friends of Viola/Dias\\" estimate the cost of repatriating Viola at ¬£1 million, and restoration costs at ¬£5 million. In 2006 Viola's original bell was discovered on a farm at Sandefjord. Hull Maritime Museum purchased it and in 2008 returned the bell to the ship. In 2016 the Viola was surveyed to determine its condition and whether or not it could be refloated and restored.

It operates the nation's most crowded prison system. In 2015 it housed more than 24,000 inmates in a system designed for 13,318. In 2015 it settled a class-action suit over physical and sexual violence against inmates at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka.Bryan Lyman, \\"U.S. Justice Department to probe Alabama men's prisons\\", Montgomery Advertiser, 6 October 2016; accessed 11 March 2017 The department also spends the least of any state on a per-prisoner basis. In 2019 the U.S. Department of Justice found conditions in Alabama prisons to be unsafe and unconstitutional, as result of a long civil rights investigation prompted by numerous deaths from violence in Alabama lockups. Prisoners routinely face prisoner-on-prisoner violence and sexual abuse, unprotected by the State. The DOJ notes \\"a high level of violence that is too common, cruel, of an unusual nature, and pervasive.\\" The detailed report outlines cases of inmate deaths, rapes, extortion of prisoners' families and rampant contraband weapons and drugs. It says facilities violate the constitution, by not providing \\"adequate humane conditions of confinement.\\" Additional lawsuits against ADOC allege that men also face physical and sexual violence in the overcrowded prisons. In October 2016, the US Department of Justice announced that it was conducting a statewide review and investigation of Alabama's men's prisons to evaluate conditions. In his February 2017 State of the State address, Governor Robert Bentley proposed a three-faceted approach to overhaul the Department by upgrading and replacing outdated facilities, as well as creating centers to prepare inmates for re-entry to their communities. In June 2017, a federal court pointed out the Department provided inadequate psychotherapy, unsafe crisis cells, inadequate monitoring of suicidal inmates, inappropriate discipline and that it placed inmates in \\"dangerous and harmful settings.\\" By mid-2018, the system was operating with about half the number of corrections officers needed. Proposals were made to increase the hourly wage for corrections officers in maximum security facilities from about fourteen to about fifteen dollars. Alabama has the 5th highest incarceration rate under state prison or local jail jurisdiction per 100,000 population in the U.S. History Alabama prisoners in both the county jails and state penitentiaries have been required to work at farming and cotton plantations since the 1840s. By the 1878, convict labor rented from the state was used most commonly in the coal mining industry, often as strike breakers. In 1894 one coal company employed 1,138 convicts, another used 589. In late 1883, a state inspector discovered a prisoner working in a mine eight years after the end of his sentence. At the Banner Mine disaster in 1911, most of the 128 killed were Black convicts. The state ceased renting prisoners to mines in about 1900, although county sheriffs continued the practice until 1927. In the 1970s, Alabama prisons were ordered to undertake major reforms by a Federal judge who described some conditions as \\"barbaric.\\" Among other things, the judge ordered the closing of \\"dog houses,\\" the name for hot, dark and filthy cells jammed with inmates being punished.https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/us/inmates-fight-work-or-be- shackled-policy.html?_r=0 In 2007 the prison system ended its farming programs, rendering many prisoners idle.Baggett, Connie. \\"Prison farms are up for sale .\\" Press-Register.

This program would allow the state to close an unspecified number of older facilities. Press reports indicate the troubled Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women would be the first to be replaced; a federal class-action suit was settled in 2015 over abuse of women at that facility. In October 2016, the US Department of Justice announced that it was conducting a review and investigation of Alabama's men's prisons to evaluate conditions as the Constitution promises humane treatment. \\"The investigation will focus on whether prisoners are adequately protected from physical harm and sexual abuse at the hands of other prisoners; whether prisoners are adequately protected from use of excessive force and staff sexual abuse by correctional officers; and whether the prisons provide sanitary, secure and safe living conditions.\\"\\"Justice Dept.

In addition, it has ruled that persons convicted of crimes committed as children cannot be sentenced to life in prison without parole (LWOP), saying that both kinds of sentences are unconstitutional.

Its last assignment was with the 6th Fighter Wing, based at Howard Field, Canal Zone. It was inactivated on 15 October 1946. History Activated on 1 January 1941 as one of the three squadrons assigned to the 32d Pursuit Group as part of the United States buildup of forces after the eruption of World War II. This unit was organized, initially, to train new pilots sent directly from flight schools in the United States. The squadron was equipped with Curtiss P-36A Hawks and Boeing P-26A Peashooters drawn from the 16th and 37th Pursuit Groups. After being formed at Albrook Field, Panama Canal Zone, the squadron was moved to R√≠o Hato Army Air Base, Panama. After the Japanese Pearl Harbor Attack, the squadron x was moved to Howard Field near the Panama Canal to provide air defense of the Pacific side. At Howard, the squadron received more capable Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, with the squadron being moved to France Field. Just as soon as the squadron settled into France Field, a detachment was sent north to Guatemala City Air Base to perform air defense and coastal patrols. As the war threat to the Panama Canal diminished during 1942, the squadron was transferred to Seymour Island Army Airfield in the Galapagos Islands. In addition, a detachment was sent to Salinas Airport, Ecuador (\\"C\\" Flight); Talara Airport, Peru (\\"D\\" Flight) however the detachment at Guatemala City, Guatemala remained and was designed as \\"E\\" Flight. The aircraft in the Galapagos were transferred from the 52d Fighter Squadron and flown from Salinas Airport, Ecuador with external fuel tanks, being escorted by a B-24D Liberator for navigational purposes. This was the first time Seymour Field had been equipped with fighters for air defense. It became apparent very quickly, however, that the dispersion wasn't a very good idea and, between 10 and 19 March 1943, the outlying flights were consolidated at Albrook Field. The personnel at Seymour were re-designated as the 51st Fighter Squadron. By October 1943, the squadron began transitioning to Bell P-39Q Airacobras. In November, its parent 32d Fighter Group was disbanded and the squadron was assigned directly to the XXVI Fighter Command. Moved to Howard Field in November 1944, the 51st began receiving Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. With the end of the war in Europe, the entire complement of P-38s was hangared and the unit activities ran down. The squadron ceased all flying activities in June, and the P-38s were stored in a hangar at Howard. By October 1945, the squadron was reduced to a non-operational administrative organization.

Being that one is constantly in the center of one's own world, an accurate evaluation of how much one is noticed by others is uncommon. The reason for the spotlight effect is the innate tendency to forget that although one is the center of one's own world, one is not the center of everyone else's. This tendency is especially prominent when one does something atypical. Research has empirically shown that such drastic over-estimation of one's effect on others is widely common. Many professionals in social psychology encourage people to be conscious of the spotlight effect and to allow this phenomenon to moderate the extent to which one believes one is in a social spotlight.  History  The term \\"spotlight effect\\" was coined by Thomas Gilovich and Kenneth Savitsky. The phenomenon made its first appearance in the world of psychology in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science in 1999. Although this was the first time the effect was termed, it was not the first time it had been described. There were other studies done before 1999 that had looked at phenomena similar to the spotlight effect that Gilovich and Savitsky described. Thomas Gilovich had been studying this phenomenon for many years and wrote other research papers in the years leading up to his work with Savitsky. In his study with Savitsky, he combined the different effects he had observed previously to describe the spotlight. Gilovich was not the only one who had noticed this occurrence of the spotlight effect. David Kenny and Bella DePaulo conducted a study that looked at whether or not people knew how others view them. Kenny and DePaulo thought that individuals would base what others thought of them using their own self-perceptions rather than other feedback given to them. The study found that individuals' views of what others think of them is variable compared to what is actually thought of them. = Ties to other psychological concepts = The spotlight effect is an extension of several psychological phenomena. Among these is the phenomenon known as anchoring and adjustment, which suggests that individuals will use their own internal feelings of anxiety and the accompanying self-representation as an anchor, then insufficiently correct for the fact that others are less privy to those feelings than they are themselves. Consequently, they overestimate the extent to which their anxiety is obvious to onlookers. In fact, Clark and Wells (1995) suggest that socially phobic people enter social situations in a heightened self-focused state, namely, from a raised emotional anchor. This self-focused state makes it difficult for individuals to set aside public and private self-knowledge to focus on the task. Another related phenomenon is called the false-consensus effect. The false-consensus effect occurs when individuals overestimate the extent to which other people share their opinions, attitudes, and behavior. This leads to a false conclusion which will increase someone's self-esteem. The false-consensus effect is the opposing theory to the false uniqueness effect, which is the tendency of one to underestimate the extent to which others share the same positive attitudes and behavior. Either of these effects can be applied to the spotlight effect. The self-as-target bias is another closely linked phenomenon with the spotlight effect. This concept describes when someone believes that events are disproportionately directed towards him or herself. For example, if a student had an assignment due in class and did not prepare as well as they should have, the student may start to panic and think that simply because they did not prepare well, the teacher will know and call on them for answers. Also relevant to the spotlight effect is the illusion of transparency (sometimes called the observer's illusion of transparency), which is people's tendency to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others. Another manifestation of the illusion of transparency is a tendency for people to overestimate how well they understand others' personal mental states. This cognitive bias is similar to the illusion of asymmetric insight, in which people perceive their knowledge of others to surpass other people's knowledge of themselves. Other related concepts are egocentric bias, self- referential encoding, self-reference effect and Ideas of reference and delusions of reference.  Research  The spotlight effect plays a significant role in many different aspects of psychology and society. Primarily, research on this phenomenon has been pioneered by four individuals: Thomas Gilovich, Kenneth Savitsky, Victoria Medvec, and Thomas Kruger. The main focuses of their research center around social judgments, salience of individual contributions, actions of individuals, and how individuals believe others perceive them. = Social judgment and salience = In social judgment, embarrassment plays a considerable role in the degree to which the spotlight effect is manifested. Research by Gilovich, Kruger, and Medvec indicated that certain situations in which perceivably embarrassing items are factors, such as an embarrassing t-shirt, increase the extent to which the spotlight effect is experienced by an individual. The timing of the exposure during a perceivably embarrassing situation also plays a role in the severity of the spotlight effect. If the exposure is immediate, the spotlight effect significantly increases in decision making scenarios. Delayed exposure, however, decreases spotlight effect intensity. Salience of ideas and important contributions within a group are additional aspects of social judgment that are affected by the spotlight effect. Individuals tend to overestimate the extent to which their contributions make an impact on those around them. In a group setting, those contributions are thought of by the individual as being more significant than the contributions of their group members and that the other members believe the same about that individual's contributions. = Actions and perceptions = Actions of individuals and how they believe others perceive their performance also plays an important part of spotlight effect research. Gilovich, Medvec, and Savitsky further explored this idea. In situations that involve large, interacting groups, a common detail identifies the reason attention of others is not solely focused on the individual. In these settings, like a class lecture or athletic competition, attention is divided between focusing on the individual and on the actions of the group. The inability to identify the split attention leads individuals to overestimate the likelihood that their peers will perceive them poorly. Similarly, Gilovich, Medvec, and Savitsky further elaborated upon their research and concluded that in situations involving an audience member whose sole purpose is to observe, the severity of the spotlight effect is not overestimated because the focus of an audience's attention is centered upon the individual performing.

The Haunted House is a dark ride and one of the flagship attractions at Trimper's Rides & Amusements, in Ocean City, MD. Built by Bill Tracy in 1964, and expanded in 1988, it has resided on the southern end of Ocean City's boardwalk strip ever since.  History  In 1961, Granville Trimper was intrigued by a dark ride at Glen Echo park near Washington DC. He attended an amusement convention not long afterward, where he met Bill Tracy (at the time, the best dark ride builder in the industry) and discussed building a dark ride on the site of the former Windsor Theater. After numerous proposals, Granville settled for the one-level \\"Haunted House\\" dark ride package. Construction began in 1963, and the ride was ready for the 1964 season. The ride was a hit, and Granville added to his new dark ride whenever possible. During the 1988 season the ride was given a major overhaul, adding a second floor to accommodate gags and tricks from a ride called \\"Ghost Ship\\" at Playland Park, which had closed. The ship was a Tracy-built ride also, and the stunts fit in perfectly with the ones from 1964. The addition required an enlarged loading area (to make room for some extra cars) and added a balcony, which the cars would travel across during the trip. In current years, the park has been gradually phasing out the Tracy tricks, which consist of wood, papier-m√¢ch√©, and day-glow paint. This fragile building has led to numerous incidents, including being the target of vandalism, and constant repairs. The park has been adding newer, modern dark ride stunts to replace the older ones.

The ship was built in 1897 by Furness Withy and Company, Ltd. at West Hartlepool, England as the cargo ship Maylands of J. F. Wilson & Company. The ship went through a progression of names and owners, becoming Veerhaven in 1905, and Djursland in 1915. Later in 1915, the ship was renamed Maumee after her purchase by the American Transatlantic Company. After the United States' entry into World War I, Maumee was acquired by the United States Navy on 9 January 1918 and commissioned the same day. Maumee was initially assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, but reassigned to the Destroyer Force on 18 April 1919. The details of Maumees decommissioning and subsequent release from U.S. Navy control are unknown. By 1923, she was operating under the name of Dorte Jensen for H. Jenson. According to ship registries, she was broken up on 22 January 1924 at Genoa.

She competed for the Federal Republic of Germany in the 1972 Olympics.Christel Frese at Sports Reference She won one silver and one bronze medal at European Championships with the 4x400-meter relay of the Federal Republic of Germany. In the years 1975-1977 she played in women's football for the SSG 09 Bergisch Gladbach and made her best at the German women's football championship in 1977. Career Christel Frese grew up in Meggen and was initially a member of the TV Meggen, where she trained under Gerd Manke. In 1964, she came to Cologne to study sports and joined the local Armeesportvereinigung Vorw√§rts. Her coach was Fredy Wehrmann, who supervised Frese at 49 German championships. Frese began her athletic career as a sprinter over 100 and 200 meters. She had her first medal in 1966, when she came in second place at the German Championships in the 4 x 100-meter relay with the ASV behind the representation of Hamburger SV. Then she switched to the 400-meter track. In 1968, she played her first international match in Buxtehude. Besides, the years 1969 and 1970 were the most successful years in Frese's career. In 1969, she won her first German championship over 400 meters and a bronze medal at the European Championships in Athens as the final runner of the 4 x 400 -meter relay. In 1970, for three times she affirmed the German record over 400 meters and on 22 August 1970 won at the European Cup in Budapest, the silver medal. Also she became vice European champion in the hall. Another second place behind Marilyn Neufville she achieved at the open AAA Championships in London. Christel Frese failed twice with her single medal at open air European Championships: In 1969 , the West German team proclaimed the refusal to start for J√ºrgen May in the individual competitions and in 1971, in Helsinki Frese came only to the semifinals due to an injury-related training backlog. In 1971, she won the Internationales Stadionfest in Berlin. She took part in the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, after she had recently improved the German record, but injured in the 400-meter interlude and thus could not compete for the season. Throughout her career, Christel Frese won 9 German and six European Championship titles and has run 15 German, 4 European and 3 world records. Totally she won 26 country battles. Personal achievements of Christel Frese: *100 m: 11.84 s, October 7, 1973, Bonn *200 m: 24.13 s, October 7, 1973, Bonn *400 m: 52.2 s, May 20, 1972, Bonn *Hall: 53.1 s, March 14, 1970, Vienna In 1975, Christel Frese ended her career as an athlete and became a footballer. She played one after another for the following clubs: *SSG 09 Bergisch Gladbach (until 1977) and became German women's football champion in the same year *SC 07 Bad Neuenahr *VFL Euskirchen She also worked as a trainer for VFL. Later, she went to TuS Halberbracht, a village club in Lennestadt, where she led the first goalkeeper training and later the training of the girls' football team. Personal life From 1968 to 2007, Christel Frese worked as a teacher of sports, mathematics and biology at the Marienschule. Among her students was Silke Rottenberg. She is a member of the Breed Breeding Association under the name Christel Frese-Gerber. Sport achievementsRecords=World records *In the limelight of the public, Christel Frese set a world record, which she ran on 19 September 1969 at the European Athletics Championships in Athens with the 4 x 400-meter relay (Team: Christa Czekay, Antje Gleichfeld, Inge Eckhoff and as final runner Christel Frese). The achieved time of 3: 33,9 min, however, was undercut the next day by the British and the French squadron. *Christel Frese set another world record at the European Indoor Championships in Vienna on March 14, 1970, when she had reached the top of the 400m mark, the previous unofficial indoor best time of 55.29s, run by Natalya Petschonkina from the Soviet Union in 1968 , at 53, 7s improved. However, this world record had an even shorter duration than that of Athens: already one and a half hours later, Marilyn Neufville starting for the Great Britain won the final race in the world record time of 53.0 s ahead of Christel Frese in 53.1 s. German records *Her first German record ran Christel Frese on June 15, 1969 in Copenhagen as a member of the 4 x 400-meter relay (cast: Eckhoff, Gleichfeld, Dannenberg and Frese) in 3: 48,4 min *In 1970, Christel Frese won three times German record over 400 meters (held by Helga Henning): 52.7 s, scored on 16 July at the international match Germany- USA in Stuttgart 52.6 s, scored on August 8 in Berlin 52.4 s, scored on the 11th of October. With this achievement, she took the third place in the annual world best list. *In 1972, Christel Frese set a new achievement: 52.2 s, scored on May 20 in Bonn. However, this record no longer appears in the lists of the German Athletics Association, as the GDR athlete Helga Seidler had already run 400 meters in 52.2 s the previous year and the record lists of the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR were merged. =Olympic Games = *1972 Olympic Games in Munich. *Christel Frese won her first run with 52.89 s and was then able to knock out Mexico's Olympic champion Colette Besson as fourth in the 53.01 s in the interlude. But then she suffered in the semifinals the injury pitch. However, to qualify for the final, she would have run under 52 seconds, as the fourth-placed, the eventual bronze medalist Kathy Hammond, scored 51.92. =European Championships=400 m open air *1969 Athens: Not started (boycott of the German team because refusal to start for J√ºrgen May) *1971 Helsinki: 1st run (54.4 s), 6th run (54.1 s) 400 m hall *1969 in Belgrade: silver (54.8 s), behind Besson (54.0 s) and before Stirling (54.2 s) *1970 in Vienna: silver (53.13 s), behind Neufville (53.01 s) and before Besson (53.63 s) *1972 in Grenoble: Gold (53.36 s), before B√∂dding (54.60 s) and Weinstein (54.73 s) *1973 in Rotterdam: 4th (53.78 s) 4 √ó 400 m *1969 Athens Bronze (3: 32.7 min), Team: Czekay, Gleichfeld, Eckhoff, Frese.

The term arose from the fact that much of the theory and research supporting nativism, modularity of mind, and computational theory of mind originated at several universities located on the East Coast, including Harvard University, the University of Michigan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Tufts University. Conversely, much of the research and theory supporting empiricism, emergentism, and embodied cognition originated at several universities located on the West Coast, including the University of California, Berkeley, the Salk Institute, and, most notably, the University of California, San Diego. In reality, the divide is not so clear, with many universities and scholars on both coasts (as well as the Midwest and around the world) supporting each position, as well as more moderate positions in between the two extremes. The phrase was coined by Jerry Fodor at an MIT conference on cognition, at which he referred to another researcher as a \\"West Coast theorist,\\" apparently unaware that the researcher worked at Yale University. Very few researchers adhere strictly to the extreme positions highlighted by the East Pole‚ÄìWest Pole debate. That is, there are very few empiricists who believe in the Lockean ideal of the tabula rasa (namely, that children are born with no innate knowledge or constraints), and there are very few nativists who agree with Fodor's assertion that all concepts that are learned over the course of life are present in the mind prior to birth. Nevertheless, most scholars within the fields of cognitive science and developmental psychology affiliate themselves with one of the two positions through the means of their research. The two books best known for espousing the empiricist and nativist positions within the context of cognitive psychology are Rethinking Innateness by Jeffrey Elman et al. and The Modularity of Mind by Jerry Fodor, respectively. Incidentally, the authors are affiliated with the two institutions on which the East Pole‚ÄìWest Pole metaphor is based, UCSD and MIT, affirming the relevance and pervasiveness of this moniker for the intellectual divide.

Plot The movie opens with a horse grazing in a small clearing in the middle of the forest. He is alerted by an unknown and unseen presence stalking him, which causes him to gallop for the protection of the trees. He is followed by some unknown enemies who are chasing him, before they surround him and prepare to attack. Meanwhile, a boy and his parents, the last of the summer tourists, leave their dog behind, believing that to be better than taking him to the dog pound. Later that day, he is found by a pack of feral dogs, most of whom were abandoned pets also belonging to summer tourists. Their leader, a massive golden-haired mongrel, immediately accepts the dog into the pack. Jerry (Joe Don Baker) has moved to Seal Island with his new wife, Millie (Hope Alexander-Willis), and their two sons. They also brought along their family dog, a German Shepherd named Riley. While dropping off some garbage at the island junkyard, Jerry's dog chases after a rabbit into the trees, but is attacked by an unknown creature and is injured. When Jerry goes back to see what it was that attacked Riley, he discovered that it was a feral dog, who had apparently also stole the rabbit that his dog was chasing. He immediately sent word to the other residents on the island, including the old hermit Mr. McMinnimee (Delos V. Smith Jr.), to keep a watchful eye out for the dog and kill it if they ever see it again. McMinnimee, who lives in a cabin alone with his German Shepherd Shazah, soon learns of the wild dog and returns to his home. When a storm hit the island one evening, Shazah starts up a riot and tries to break out. Armed with his rifle, the old man opens the door to his cabin and tries to find out who is intruding onto his property. Shazah bolts out into the front yard, but is suddenly attacked by the golden-haired mongrel and several other feral dogs. McMinnimee is too late to save his dog from the pack, though he manages to shoot and kill a collie, one of the pack members. As he tries to secure the door and windows to his house, the dogs break through one of the windows and attack the old man, killing him. The following morning, while relaxing in her new house that Jerry had built for her, Millie notices that something is scaring their poultry. She goes outside and discovers the same mongrel that Jerry saw the other day lurking near the poultry yard. She tries to drive it off, but the dog growls at her and attacks, forcing Millie to seek refuge in her Volkswagen car. As the rest of the pack surround the car and try to break in, Jerry arrives and drives the dogs off, killing a Labrador Retriever with his shotgun. He takes Millie to town, drops her off at one of the abandoned houses, and warns his neighbor Hardiman (Richard B. Shull) of the pack. While Hardiman leaves to warn the other islanders of the dogs, Jerry picks up his sons and takes them back to the house. Meanwhile, Jim Dodge (Richard O'Brien) moves to the island with his son, Tommy (Paul Willson), a cook, Lois (Sherry E. DeBoer) and his wife, Marge (Bibi Besch). The day after their arrival, Dodge urges his son Tommy to go for a walk and Lois goes along with him. During their walk through the forest, Tommy hears the pack of dogs howling nearby and starts running for his life. Lois chases after Tommy, but quickly loses him and is forced to seek refuge in an abandoned barn where the dogs sleep. Tommy runs through the forest, the pack in close pursuit, but soon trapped at the edge of a cliff towering above the ocean. With the savage dogs closing in, he jumps off the cliff and falls to his death. Lois seeks refuge in the abandoned barn just as a storm hits the island. She lays down in one of the stalls and falls asleep, but when she wakes up, she discovers that the dogs have returned. The dogs growl menacingly before they attack Lois and kill her. Meanwhile, Jerry and Hardiman manage to warn Walker, Dodge and Marge about the dogs roaming the island and bring them back to the house. But when Jerry arrives at McMinnimee's cabin to warn him, he believes something is wrong when the old man does not respond. He then discovers the dead bodies of Shazah and the collie. After searching the side of the cabin, he finds the old man's lifeless body inside, having already been attacked and mauled by the pack. Jerry then leaves McMinnimee's cabin, just managing to avoid the pack who had been stalking him. He returns to the house and tells the others of what had happened. He even states that most of the dogs were once tourists' pets, but were abandoned to survive on the island a few weeks earlier. Concerned and outraged that his son Tommy is still out lost on the island, Dodge persuades Jerry to find him. Jerry, accompanied by Dodge and Hardiman, head out to the abandoned barn and find the dogs running away. Dodge, armed with a rifle, shoots and kills a Dalmatian as the pack runs off. Inside the barn, the men find Lois' mangled body lying in a corner, but do not find Tommy. Believing that his son is dead, Dodge steals Jerry's Jeep and drives off in pursuit of the dogs, with Jerry and Hardiman following him in Hardiman's truck. Dodge soon encounters the pack near one of the abandoned houses, but before he can even shoot at them, the dogs attack him and tear him to shreds. Jerry and Hardiman soon find Dodge and drive off the dogs with their truck, but Dodge succumbs to his injuries and dies the next day. After failing to send a signal out to the Coast Guard on the radio, Jerry orders Millie, Walker and Hardiman to find whatever weapons they can use against the pack, but the only weapons they can find are Jerry's shotgun and a handful of cartridges, a couple of sticks, an umbrella and a few knives. Later that same day, Jerry, his family, and the few remaining inhabitants find themselves under siege by the pack. Later that afternoon, the mongrel and four other dogs from the pack launch an attack on the house, trying to break in through the windows. Jerry, Millie, their sons, and Hardiman struggle to hold them off. Two of the dogs, a Doberman Pinscher and an Irish Setter, manage to break inside the house, but Jerry kills the Setter with his shotgun and Walker and Jerry's dog Riley drive the Doberman out of the house. The rest of the dogs flee after failing to break through the windows. Realizing that the dogs will return for another assault, Jerry tells his family, Marge, Hardiman and Walker to board up the windows and doors of the house. Later that night, the group carries Dodge's body down to the docks and place him in a boat, pushing it out to sea to prevent the pack from trying to get to it. Knowing that the dogs will be back, they quickly return to the house and lock themselves inside. The following morning, Walker wakes up and hears the sound of a motorboat near the docks. He grabs Jerry's shotgun and runs down to the docks to find a small group of people in a motorboat several yards out at sea. He fires a shot in the air, trying to signal them to land at the docks, but the people believe he is messing around and they laugh and drive away. Walker turns around, only to find the dogs standing in his way. He fights them off with the gun, but the mongrel and two other dogs quickly overpower him and knock him off the deck into the water. Meanwhile, Jerry, having heard the sound of the shotgun being fired and realizing that Walker has headed down to the docks, takes his Jeep and drives down there, only to find him surrounded by the pack. As Jerry drives his vehicle onto the dock, the dogs turn their attention towards Jerry and charge him. The moving Jeep runs over the majority of the pack, killing a gray terrier mongrel and forcing the rest of the dogs to retreat into the forest. Jerry pulls Walker out of the water and drives him back to the house. Tired of waiting for help, Jerry orders Millie to take Marge, Riley, Walker and their sons out to the docks, while he and Hardiman will try to finish off the pack. While Hardiman waits quietly in Jerry's Jeep, Jerry lures the mongrel and the remainder of his pack into the house. As soon as the dogs are all inside, Hardiman closes the door behind them, pours several bucketloads of gasoline on the walls and sets the house on fire with a torch. Jerry then climbs up the ladder to the attic and tries to raise it to prevent the dogs from following him, but the mongrel leaps on top of the ladder and manages to reach the top. Jerry holds him off for a short while, but as the flames reach the floor of the attic, he pushes the dog back and jumps through a window, sliding off the roof and landing on the grass below. The mongrel leaps out of the same window and springs at Jerry, but he misses and is impaled on the sharpened end of a broken pipe. Millie and the others return to the house and watch as the burning building explodes and collapses, killing all of the dogs inside. They soon discover that one of the dogs, the same dog that was abandoned and had joined the pack a few days earlier, apparently did not join the fate of his comrades because the rope he was tied to had been caught and tangled in a heavy branch. Realizing that the dog was apparently afraid and not as savage and aggressive as the other dogs, Jerry decides to try to tame it. Using some crackers, he feeds them one by one to the dog. The film ends as the dog starts licking Jerry's hand, apparently winning the trust of the man and becoming a pet again. Release The film was released theatrically in the United States by Warner Bros. in November 1977. The film was released on VHS by Warner Home Video in 1983. As of 2012, the film is available on MOD (Manufacture on Demand) DVD and as a digital download from Warner Archive. Reception Critical reception for The Pack has been mixed to negative. TV Guide awarded the film 2 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"A cut above the usual exploitative revenge-of-nature films\\" but criticizing the film's cataclysmic climax. Variety gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"The Pack is a well- made and discreetly violent story of a pack of wild dogs menacing residents of a remote island.\\" Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2 1/2 out of a possible 4 stars, calling it \\"predictable\\" but also noted that the film was well made.

An obituary in The Times, noting that choral music, and particularly the music of the Anglican liturgy, remained one of his greatest loves,\\"Obituary ‚Äì John Steane\\", The Times, 25 March 2011, p. 30 observes, \\"his beautifully observed and straightforwardly expressed views about the art of singing brought him to the attention of the EMI record producer Walter Legge, who suggested to the editors of Gramophone magazine that he would be a useful adornment to its panel of contributors.\\" Steane began writing for Gramophone in 1972. In 1974 he took over from Desmond Shawe-Taylor the long-running quarterly feature, \\"The Gramophone and the Voice\\", giving a second opinion on vocal issues reviewed in recent issues of the magazine. An editor of the magazine commented that Steane's views were \\"beautifully judged, invariably generous and always elegantly crafted\\".Jolly, James. Obituary, John Steane, Gramophone, March 2011 In 1999, the magazine published in book form a collection of these articles from the previous 25 years. In 1974 Steane published his book The Grand Tradition: Seventy Years of Singing on Record, 1900‚Äì1970 which covered the history of recorded singing. It was enthusiastically received by the critics. The TLS wrote that singers had found in Steane \\"their Keats or Baudelaire, the poet of the sensations they create.\\" The reviewer praised his ability to characterise a singer with phrases of \\"poetic refinement\\", though not eschewing humour, quoting his description of Nellie Melba changing in the course of one song \\"from Juliet at the ball to a knees-up-mother-Brown pearly- queen\\".\\"Analogies for the voice\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 26 July 1974, p. 788 In The Musical Times, Harold Rosenthal vigorously dissented from some of Steane's opinions, but he too praised his gift for the \\"apt choice of a word or phrase to sum up a singer's art or voice\\".Rosenthal, Harold. \\"Vocal Tradition\\", The Musical Times, October 1974, p. 846 Music & Letters called it \\"a book for the connoisseur\\".Halford, John.\\"The Grand Tradition: Seventy Years of Singing on Record, by J. B. Steane\\", Music & Letters, April 1975, pp. 215‚Äì216 American Record Guide called Steane's erudition \\"formidable\\" and the book \\"essential\\". In the 1980s Steane began writing articles and reviews in The Musical Times. Many of his contributions were about famous singers of the past, or reviews of books about them. These included Claudia Muzio, Beniamino Gigli, Lauritz Melchior, Enrico Caruso, and Margaret Burke Sheridan.The Musical Times, February 1989, pp. 72‚Äì75; March 1990, pp. 138‚Äì140; July 1989, pp. 415‚Äì416; and April 1990, p. 203 His literary expertise was employed in a piece about the poets whose music Britten chose to set.The Musical Times, June 1995, p. 309 Other articles drew on his long and wide experience of opera and song, from Puccini to Hugo Wolf.The Musical Times, Summer, 1998, p. 73; and Winter, 2000, pp. 73‚Äì74 He also contributed many reviews and articles to Opera (from 1981), Opera Now (from 1989), and Classic Record Collector. Steane contributed numerous entries in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and the New Grove Dictionary of Opera. The online combined edition of Grove at May 2011 listed 359 articles by him, mostly about singers, but with some about other subjects such as the conductor Tullio Serafin and the pianist Graham Johnson.List of contributions by J.

Who is preparing for the elections of Klitschko, Prytula and Vereshchuk, Ukrayinska Pravda (30 September 2020), Hungarian campaign against financier George Soros In January 2019, several Swiss newspapers published an article called \\"Der b√∂se Jude\\" (\\"The Evil Jew\\") by The Magazin reporter Hannes Grassegger, about the origins of the world-wide campaign against Hungarian-born financier George Soros. A week later it was published in English as \\"The Unbelievable Story Of The Plot Against George Soros\\". In it, Grassegger draws on an interview with Birnbaum in which he describes how Soros was turned into a pariah in Hungary and a number of other countries due to efforts conceived by Arthur Finkelstein and himself. The article quotes Birnbaum saying \\"Soros was the perfect enemy... It was so obvious.\\" Ahead of the 2014 Hungarian election, several right-leaning Hungarian newspapers published articles alleging a Soros-led international conspiracy against Hungary. Shortly afterward, the Hungarian authorities took legal action against the environmental NGO √ñkot√°rs, claiming it was Soros-controlled. Although nothing tangible against the organisation was found, this helped to cement the impression in Hungary that Soros was controlling NGOs and meddling in domestic Hungarian affairs. From 2015, the campaign against Soros intensified, culminating in a billboard campaign by the Hungarian government against Soros and the Open Society Foundations funded by him. In 2018, both the foundation and the Soros-funded Central European University decided that they would leave Hungary and move their offices to Berlin and Vienna respectively.

It is the town‚Äôs third court house. It was designed in the inter-war classical style by the Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built in 1939 by day labour. The current court house is a two-storeyed brick building with a corrugated-iron roof. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995.  History  Opened in March 1940, this was the third court house to be built in Innisfail, replacing the Second Innisfail Court House, a timber building erected in 1888. The building was designed in the office of the Department of Public Works; Andrew Baxter Leven was the Queensland Government Architect at the time. The Johnstone River area was settled by cedar-cutters, with the first major planting of sugar cane by occurring in 1880. TH Fitzgerald is generally credited with planting the first sugar cane, and was responsible for the erection of the first mill in the area, late in 1881. Also in 1881, a town was laid out at the junction of the South Johnstone and North Johnstone Rivers, known reputedly as the Junction. The name Geraldton was given to the town in 1883. Geraldton's first official building was erected , probably on the police reserve, accommodated a police station, court house, unofficial post office, lands office, customs office, an office for the Clerk of Petty Sessions and a gaol. Tenders for a new court house was called in late 1887, and plans for the building indicate the location of the building as on the corner of the police reserve bounded by Edith and Rankin Streets. The name of the town was changed to Innisfail in 1910. By the late 1900s-early 1910s, the Innisfail district was attracting attention from both land speculators and settlers. The Queensland Government had expressed its intention of opening up the Mourilyan Harbour, and of resuming and extending the local tramline inland from the coast, giving further impetus to the development of the district. Innisfail was devastated by a record flood in 1913, then by a cyclone in 1918, which destroyed many of the town's timber buildings. Despite these setbacks, the town prospered and opened its third sugar mill in 1916. Soldier settlement was established in Johnstone Shire around 1918, and in 1922, a number of blocks were made available to returned soldiers for growing sugar cane. Completion of the North Coast railway from Brisbane to Cairns in 1924, gave further impetus to the development of the district. By the 1920s, the Innisfail sugar industry was producing vast quantities of sugar cane and record yields of sugar, and the prosperity thisbought to the town was reflected in the many substantial buildings erected in the twenties and thirties. These include important civic buildings such as the first wing of the hospital, the Roman Catholic Church, the Commonwealth Bank and other commercial premises. Also important in the town's development were the opening of the Jubilee Bridge in 1923, linking the town with East Innisfail and Mourilyan, and the Dardgee Railway Bridge in 1924. Although consideration was given to the likely need for expanded court house facilities to cope with an increasing amount of official and legal business, it was not until 1937 that plans for the erection of a new court house were drawn up, including the erection of a new two-storeyed brick court house on the site of the timber court house, and relocation of the timber court house to the east of the new court house, for use as the police office and barracks. During the 1930s Great Depression, Labor Premier William Forgan Smith established a government initiated works scheme under the Income (Unemployment Relief) Act (1930) to create employment. This involved the employment of architects, foremen, labourers and the use of local materials in the design and construction of government buildings such as court houses, government offices and state schools. The Innisfail and Mackay court houses are two fine examples of the substantial brick buildings erected through this work scheme. The new building was completed in late 1939. Offices for a number of Government Departments were provided on the ground floor, with the court room and court facilities located on the first floor of the building. Minor alterations have been undertaken to the building in recent years, including the addition of a small air conditioning enclosure at the south east end of the court house. The court house served as a coordinating point for the Cyclone Larry relief effort in 2006.  Description  Courthouse, 1940 Innisfail Court House, designed in the inter-war classical style, is a two-storeyed brick building with a corrugated-iron roof and rendered details to the gables and verandahs. A curved portico forms the entrance to the building and addresses the corner through two columns with Ionic capitals. A double-height verandah runs down each street facade. The gables are embellished with broken pediments and Venetian windows.  Heritage listing  The court house was listed on the former Register of the National Estate. Innisfail Court House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Completed in 1939 as the third court house in Innisfail, this building survives as an example of the development of Innisfail as a commercial and official centre for the surrounding district from the late nineteenth century, and of the prosperity accompanying the expansion of settlement and the sugar industry in the Johnstone area during the early twentieth century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Innisfail Court House is a good example of a substantial brick court house which reflects the high standard of Government buildings in Queensland designed by the Department of Public Works during the early-mid 20th century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The form of the building in relation to its prominent corner location, scale and materials, contribute to the Edith and Rankin Street streetscapes and Innisfail townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Designed and constructed as part of a Government initiated Works scheme created to generate employment throughout Queensland during the 1930s, the Innisfail Court House is also a fine example of the work completed under this scheme.

Dubbed \\"Judgement day\\", it pitted long-time WBO champion Calzaghe against up and coming IBF champion, American Jeff \\"Left Hook\\" Lacy. Build-up Joe Calzaghe had been WBO super middleweight champion for over eight years having beaten Chris Eubank for the vacant title in 1997. He had held onto his belt for 17 defences and was considered on the fringes of being one of the best fighters of the world. Jeff Lacy was an American champion who had been compared to Mike Tyson in size and was considered one of the hottest prospects in American boxing. In 2004 he won the IBF title against Syd Vanderpool by TKO in the eighth round. Most American journalists wrote off Calzaghe's chances of victoryhttp://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id;=3266 and the odds were against Calzaghe despite having an equally perfect record, and even people in the UK doubted him. Prior to the fight, Calzaghe was worried about his left hand after breaking it against Evans Ashira. He contemplated pulling out of the fight only for his father Enzo and Frank Warren to persuade him to take a potentially life-changing fight. The fight was staged at 2.00am local time at the MEN Arena in Manchester and topped the bill on Frank Warren's Sport Network and was live on ITV in the UK and Showtime in the United States. The Ring announcer was Jimmy Lennon, Jr. and the referee was Raul Caiz. The Fight The fight was a one-sided beating of Lacy that involved him being rocked on several occasions and being knocked down for the first time in his career in the 12th round. In round one, Lacy had a bloody nose. By round four he was cut and his eyes were puffed up at the end of the fight. Lacy failed to land any of his trademark left hooks and the only thing that prevented Calzaghe from a shutout was a deducted point for punching round Lacy's back at the break in the 11th. The number of blows was 351/948 for Calzaghe and 116/444 for Lacy. The three ringside judges scored the bout 119-105, 119-107 and 119-107, all for Calzaghe. The decisive victory for Calzaghe cemented his place at the top of the super middleweight ranks. Aftermath Jeff Lacy was never the same fighter again. He won his next 3 fights, but then lost again to Jermain Taylor. Calzaghe, however, was propelled into the limelight, going on to have a successful career and be recognised in the pound-for-pound lists before retiring unbeaten. Calzaghe said: \\"Eight years I've been champion and I've been written off by a lot of people. This fight has been on my mind morning, noon and night. I demolished him and outclassed him. His punches didn't trouble me in the slightest. I was expecting more. I saw them coming from miles away. I knew I was going to win the fight. How's that for a slapper? Those slaps had his legs going all over the place.\\" Boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard, who admitted to knowing little of Calzaghe before the fight, said: \\"Within two rounds I was a Calzaghe supporter. I stood up in front of the TV shouting, 'Wow, look at this guy!'BBC  Calzaghe's Top 10 career highs.

When she died on September 26, 1970, the bulk of her estimated $42 million estate, one of the largest in Florida history, became the Jessie Ball duPont Religious, Charitable and Educational Fund. Jessie Ball DuPont Fund, History The beginning Portrait of Jessie Ball When Jessie Ball was a teacher in San Diego, California, she used her savings to award college scholarships to needy students, eventually managing more than 100 scholarships. [2] Jessie Ball DuPont Fund, History After her marriage to Alfred I. duPont in 1921, she continued making charitable gifts, but on a larger scale. When her husband died in 1935, she was his primary beneficiary and became president or board member to many groups and foundations. However, she turned over most of those responsibilities to her brother, Edward Ball. She preferred to spend her time on philanthropy and let Edward handle the business dealings, which he did for the next 35 years. Her personal generosity lasted for half a century, during which she provided scholarships for hundreds of college students (mostly in the southeast), made gifts to colleges and universities (numerous libraries were built), assisted hundreds of churches (all denominations), major charities, children's homes, historic buildings and art museums. The Jessie Ball duPont Fund continues to assist those organizations and communities that received financial support from Jessie Ball duPont during the first half of the 1960s. The entities include names familiar to everyone as well as groups in small towns known only to local residents. Among the colleges & universities, churches, religious entities, schools, social service agencies, youth organizations, preservation associations, medical, cultural and civic groups. The recipients are located all over the United States. [3] Jessie Ball duPont Fund, Organizations = Grantees List =Fund established More than six years passed between Jessie Ball duPont's death and her estate being settled. The fund was granted tax-exempt status in April, 1973, but the first meeting of the trustees was not until January, 1977. Those four individuals were: Edward Ball, Jessie's brother; William Mills, Jessie's charitable advisor; Rev. \\"Sandy\\" Juhan, the Episcopal Bishop's son; and Irvin Golden from Florida National Bank, the corporate executor. Hazel Williams, Jessie's personal secretary, was invited because of her knowledge of the way Jessie determined who received gifts and the amount of the gift. That first year, Miss Williams suggested 113 grants for a total of $4.2 million, which the trustees approved. One of the will's provisions specified that the clerical trustee would be appointed by the acting bishop from the Episcopal Diocese of Florida. Another rule required trustees to retire from the board at age 70.Kerr, Jessie-Lynn: Florida Times-Union, September 19, 2003-Retiring bishop is new duPont trustee Current operation The present Jessie Ball duPont Fund has changed significantly. In order to diversify the composition of the board, the trust received judicial permission in 2003 to increase the number of trustees to seven instead of the original four.

Conservation status Neosalanx tangkahkeii is a widespread species and among others found in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins. In some parts of its range it is a relatively low-density species and in a survey of the five freshwater icefish species in the Yangtze, it was the least widespread and frequent. In some regions it has declined due to habitat loss, pollution and overfishing. Despite this the species is not considered threatened overall, being rated as least concern by the IUCN.

Her portrait hangs today at Mount Airy Mansion in Rosaryville State Park, Maryland.Mt Airy Mansion at Wildnet.com. Retrieved September 2010 Early life Eleanor Calvert was born in 1758 at the Calvert family's Mount Airy plantation near Upper Marlboro in Prince George's County, Maryland. Eleanor was the second-eldest daughter of Benedict Swingate Calvert, illegitimate son of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, and Benedict's wife Elizabeth Calvert Butler. She was known to her family as \\"Nelly.\\" As a teenager, Eleanor was an exceptionally pretty girl and well-mannered. Marriage and children Painting of Eleanor Calvert by John Hesselius, 1728-1778, 1761. Eleanor married John Parke Custis, son of the late Daniel Parke Custis and Martha Dandridge Custis Washington (and stepson of George Washington), on February 3, 1774 at Mount Airy. When \\"Jacky\\", as he was known by his family, announced his engagement to Eleanor to his parents, they were greatly surprised due to the couple's youth. After their marriage, the couple settled at the White House plantation, a Custis estate on the Pamunkey River in New Kent County, Virginia. After the couple had lived at the White House for more than two years, John Custis purchased the Abingdon plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia (now in Arlington County, Virginia), into which the couple settled during the winter of 1778‚Äì1779. Eleanor and John had seven children: * unnamed daughter (1775 - 1775), died shortly after birth * Elizabeth Parke Custis Law, \\"Eliza\\" (1776‚Äì1831), married Thomas Law * Martha Parke Custis Peter, \\"Patsy\\" (1777‚Äì1854), married Thomas Peter * Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis, \\"Nelly\\" (1779‚Äì1852), married Lawrence Lewis * unnamed twin daughters (1780 - 1780), died three weeks after birth * George Washington Parke Custis, \\"Wash\\" (1781‚Äì1857), married Mary Lee Fitzhugh In 1781, John died of \\"camp fever\\", believed to be typhus, following the Siege of Yorktown. Eleanor's two elder daughters, Elizabeth and Martha, continued to live with her at the Abingdon plantation. She sent her two younger children, Eleanor and George, to Mount Vernon to live with their grandmother, Martha Washington, and her husband George Washington, future president. John died intestate, so his widow was granted a \\"dower third\\", the lifetime use of one-third of the Custis estate assets, including its more than 300 slaves.Slavery by the Numbers, US History- President's House The balance of the Custis estate was held in trust for their children and distributed as the daughters married and the son reached his majority. Eleanor's \\"dower third\\" was distributed among their children following her death. In 1783, Eleanor married Dr. David Stuart, an Alexandria physician and a business associate of George Washington. Eleanor and David had sixteen children together, including: * Ann Calvert Stuart (born 1784), married William Robinson * Sarah Stuart (born 1786), married Obed Waite * Ariana Calvert Stuart * William Sholto Stuart * Eleanor Custis Stuart (born 1792) * Charles Calvert Stuart (1794-1846), married Cornelia Lee * Rosalie Eugenia Stuart (1796-1886), married William Greenleaf Webster Later life In 1792, Eleanor, David and their family left Abingdon and moved to David's home at Hope Park in Fairfax County.

He was consul in 129 BC.  Biography  Early life = Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus was a member of the plebeian gens Sempronia. His father had the same name and was senator and in 146 BC member of a commission of ten men who had to reorganize the political conditions in Greece.Base of a statue in Olympia, Greece: Inscriptions of Olympia, No. 323; Cicero, ad Atticum 13.4.1; 13.6.4; 13.30.2; 13.32.3 The Roman orator and politician Cicero confused several times the younger Tuditanus with his father and was informed of his mistake by his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus in May 45 BC. = Career = Probably the younger Tuditanus is first attested in 146 BC as officer of Lucius Mummius Achaicus in his war in Greece.Cicero, ad Atticum 13.33.3 In 145 BC Tuditanus was Quaestor.Cicero, ad Atticum 13.4.1 Probably because he was an adherent of the Scipiones he could pass the curule offices within the legally allowed periods without any problems.Cicero, ad Atticum 13.32.3 In 132 BC he was Praetor.Cicero, ad Atticum 13.30.2; 13.32.3 Tuditanus achieved the peak of his career in 129 BC when he became consul together with Manius Aquillius.Cicero, ad Quintum fratrem 3.5.1; de re publica 1.14; de natura deorum 2.14; Velleius, Roman history 2.4.5 He had to govern the province of Italy and was ordered by a resolution of the senate to decide on the legitimacy of the accusations of dispossessed Roman allies whose estates had been annexed by the Gracchian commission for the allocation of fields. However, Tuditanus did not want to fulfill his task. Instead he went to Illyria, allegedly because of an imminent war. In this way he also prevented the allocation of additional fields.Appian, Civil wars 1.80 According to Livy, \\"Consul Gaius Sempronius at first fought unsuccessfully against the Iapydians but the defeat was compensated by a victory won through the qualities of Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus (the man who had subdued Lusitania).\\"Livy, Periochae. 59.20 However, according to Appian, \\"Sempronius Tuditanus and Tiberius Pandusa waged war with the Iapydes, who live among the Alps, and seem to have subjugated them.\\" Appian, Illyrica 10 Tuditanus was granted a triumph. He immortalized his victories over the Iapydes with a dedication to the river god Timavus in Aquileia which bore a victory inscription in Saturnian verse and of which were found two fragments in 1906.Dessau 8885 = CIL I¬≤ 652 Probably the Roman poet Hostius celebrated his deeds in the poem Bellum Histricum. Pliny the Elder, in his geographical work, quoted an inscription on the statue of Tuditanus (whom he called the conqueror of the Istrians because the Iapydes lived in Istria) which listed the Roman towns in Istria, gave the river Arsa as the border with Italy and stated that the area was 400 kilometres wide.Pliny the Elder, Natural History 3.19  Personal life  He may have been the father of Sempronia; she married Decimus Junius Brutus who was the son of Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus.  Works  Tuditanus was also an author but only a few fragments of his works have been preserved. Cicero emphasized his elegant style.Cicero, Brutus 95. In the internal Roman power struggles Tuditanus belonged to the Optimates and wrote a tendentious treatise on Roman constitutional law (libri magistratuum) in at least thirteen books for the political support of his party.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.13.21; Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 13.15.4 On the other side Marcus Junius Congus Gracchanus was the author of a similar work, De potestatibus, at least seven books in length, that served the purposes of the party of the Gracchi. Both works were the earliest of their kind in the Roman literature. The libri magistratuum dealt with the intercalation, the appointment of the Plebeian Tribunes, the nundinae (market and feast days of the old Roman calendar), etc. Because some quotations (e.g., about the original inhabitants of Latium called Aborigines, about the discovery of books, that allegedly belonged to the legendary Roman king Numa Pompilius, etc.) do not seem to fit into a work about constitutional law, some scholars attribute to Tuditanus another work dealing with the history of Rome from its foundation to the 2nd century BC.Sempronius [I 22]. In: Der Neue Pauly, vol. 11, col. 396. It was probably the Roman universal scholar Marcus Terentius Varro who found out that Tuditanus used the annalists Cato the Elder and Lucius Cassius Hemina as sources for his works, as well as the fact that his account corresponded with that given by his contemporary Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi, but differed (because of the above-mentioned) from that by Junius Gracchanus. And it was again Varro who delivered the most preserved quotations of Tuditanus by later authors (Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Pliny the Elder, and Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius). But two quotations by Aulus Gellius (Attic Nights 7.4.1 and 13.15.4) go back to the historian Quintus Aelius Tubero (whose son of the same name was consul in 11 BC) and the augur Messalla respectively.Friedrich M√ºnzer, Realencyclop√§die, vol.

The fort was used as a base against the Chickasaw in the unsuccessful Indian-removal Campaign of 1739. History In 1739, Jean- Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville led an army of 1,200 Frenchmen into the area of what is modern day Shelby County, Tennessee to eradicate the native Chickasaw Indians in order to secure and prepare the land for settlement by the French. He had roughly 2,400 black and Native soldiers in his army as well. As a base for the operation he chose the fourth Chickasaw Bluff because of Its strategic position on high-ground overlooking the Mississippi River and ordered the construction of a fortification on top of the bluff. On August 15, 1739, the day of the Feast of the Assumption, the fort was finished and named Fort Assumption in commemoration of the holy day. The French stronghold consisted of three bastions facing the land and two bastions fronting the Mississippi River. On the slope from the river to the top of the Bluff seven wide terraces protected from attacks. During the winter of 1739/40, the garrison was plagued by \\"weather, disease, desertion and drunkenness\\". The Chickasaw had taken French hostages during the eradication campaign, the hostages were released on March 20, 1740 after negotiations. On March 31, 1740 the discouraged and exhausted French troops were withdrawn and the fortification was abandoned by the French army. Although the French presence on the fourth Chickasaw Bluff only lasted for a few months, the area was claimed by France for eighty years. Some historical research indicates that Fort Assumption could have been built on or near the site of an earlier French stockade fortification, Fort Prudhomme. Cavelier de La Salle's canoe expedition of the Mississippi River Delta constructed Fort Prudhomme in 1682. Location Fort Assumption was located at 35.122¬∞N 90.074¬∞W, on the banks of the Mississippi River in what is now downtown Memphis.  Significance  The fort was destroyed in the spring of 1740 after the campaign was deemed a failure. Bienville's activity there was the first recorded European presence on the land that Memphis occupies today. Fort Assumption was also the first structure built by Europeans in what is now Shelby county, and the third European building in all of Tennessee. Bienville's failure was also a contributing factor that led to French king Louis XV to sign the Treaty of Fontainebleau, in which France forfeited their territory in Louisiana to Spain, as Louis XV was frustrated with the country's inability to rid the area of its native inhabitance.

The film tells the story about a young teacher in the first seventeen years of the People's Republic of China who approaches the teaching of her students with a humanistic philosophy, an approach which leads to problems with authorities. Production September was based on a screenplay by the writer Yan Tingting who was contracted with the Kunming Film Studio. After seeing some of Tian's work (notably 1982's Red Elephant, which Tian had co-directed), Yan sent his screenplay to the director, who at the time was working with Ling Zifeng as an assistant director on the older man's film, The Border Town. Tian liked the story and particularly its humanistic portrayal of the years in which Tian himself had grown up, but he was immediately turned off by the film's second half, which glorified the Communist Party of China. Taking on the project, Tian changed parts of Yan's screenplay, including the ending. These changes, however, were seen by the film's producers as a negative portrayal of the People's Republic's earliest years. As a result, Tian's inserted scenes were cut leading the director to feel that much of his vision was ultimately compromised.Berry, p. 60.

After completion of his M.Sc in 1956, he joined Punjab Police as an Inspector and started playing from Punjab Police. In 1958, he played in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Zanzibar and part of the Indian national field hockey team. In 1959, he participated in the Munich festival held in Germany where he was judged the best full back player in the world. The same year he toured the all the European countries. During the Rome Olympics held in Rome in 1960, Singh carried out two hat tricks in the matches against Denmark and the Netherlands. He remained the top scorer in the Olympics and was also judged the best full-back player. In the international hockey tournaments played in Ahmdabad in India, in the final match with Germany, Singh scored the clinching goals and thus defeated West Germany. He represented Indian Wanderers Hockey in 1961 that toured New Zealand and Australia and participated in the Asian games held in Indonesia in 1962. He had to resign from Punjab Police in 1963. He joined the Indian Railways Police and started playing for their team. Within two years, he was awarded the Railway Minister's Medal for being the Best Railway Sportsman. Politics dictated the IHF selection committee which excluded Singh from the Indian field hy team in 1963. There was loud uproar in the Indian press which protested in unison: \\"Has Prithipal become so bad (unwanted player) after resigning from the Punjab Police?‚Äù The Indian Railway Police, however, began winning national tournaments. While playing for Indian Railways, Singh won a vital link under the leadership of Charanjit Singh. He was included in the Indian field hockey team headed for the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, which regained the Olympic title at Tokyo after defeating their arch-rivals Pakistani team. Commenting on the performance of Indian team at Tokyo, Melville de Mellow wrote: \\"All played brilliant hockey, but as always some were superb: Prithipal Singh, who scored 11 of India's 22 goals in the tournament will be remembered particularly for he was like the Rock of Gibraltar\\".Victory Among the Chrysanthemums, From 'Story of the Olympics', Melville de MellowTokyo, 1964. www.bharatiyahockey.org Singh participated at Asian Games held in 1966 in Bangkok as a team member of the Shankar Laxman squad. This squad won the Gold Medal at the tournament. In 1967, Singh skippered India against the visiting German and Dutch teams. In the same year Singh captained the Indian team to Madrid, Spain and won the tournament and the gold medal for India. In 1968, Singh was selected as the Captain with Gurbakash Singh as the joint captain for the 1968 Olympics held in Mexico.The Hindu, 16 September 2000. At that tournament, India won the bronze medal, although Prithipal Singh again remained the top scorer in the Olympics. =Tokyo Olympics= In the first half of the final match between India and Pakistan at Tokyo Olympics, the scoreline was 0-0.In the 6th mnt of second half the thunderous penalty shot of prithipal Singh was taken on foot by Pakistani defender. Mohinder pal scored from the resultant penalty stroke and India took the lead. In later half, the Pakistani team started resorting to rough game and show of force to scare the Indian players in order to win the match. Around the middle of second half, there was a free wielding of hockey sticks. One Japanese newspaper published a picture on its front page showing one Pakistani player swinging his stick towards his Indian opponent. In the same picture, Singh was shown as holding one Pakistani player by the throat and striking his stick into his ankle with right hand. One Pakistani forward nicknamed 'Bola' who was notorious for his rough game and greatly feared by the European players feared Singh and ceased approaching him. Pakistani player Munir Dar shouted at 'Bola' urging him to be aggressive and neutralize the Indian goal, but 'Bola' is reported to have shot back at Munir Dar: \\"Can‚Äôt do it now man, your dad Prithipal is pitched ahead!\\". Thus, India defeated its rival and won the gold medal. Of India's total 22 goals scored in the Tokyo Olympics, Singh scored 11. Awards and recognition From 1950 to 1956, Singh represented Agricultural College Ludhiana Hockey team and was awarded ‚ÄúRoll of Honors‚Äù for his all-round achievements in sports and education in 1955. The Indian Government acknowledged his prominence in the field of Hockey and the first-ever Arjuna Award to a hockey player was conferred to him in 1961 by the Indian President, Rajendra Prasad.The sports writers for various Newspapers and Sports Magazines declared him the all-time best full-back hockey player. In 1963, Singh resigned from Punjab Police and joined the Indian Railways Police. Indian Railway Police acknowledged his talent and performance in hockey field. Singh was awarded the Railway Minister's Medal in 1965 for being the Best Railway Sportsman. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1967 by the Indian President Zakir Hussain for his meritorious contributions to world hockey. Other achievements Singh retired from active hockey after 1968 after the Mexico Olympics. For some time he was made chairman of IHF selection committee. In 1974, he was as an observer with Indian Hockey team to Malaysia to participate in Malaysian World cup Tournament. The Indian team won the World Cup for India. Singh also was member of the National Institute of Sports Patiala and also member of the governing body of Lakshami Bai College of Physical Education Gwalior. He was appointed the Director of Sports, Punjab Agricultural University Ludhiana as well as the Director of Student Welfare since 1968. He had actively participated in all activities relating to Student Welfare till his death in 1983. He was also the Director of Sports, PAU. Many believe that Singh coached the secrets of an iron grip and was the inspiration behind four times World Armwrestling champion and two times World Martial Arts Breaking Champion Jay Ranade, when he worked for Singh at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, in weight lifting coaching. Death Singh was shot dead by Nexalite students in the campus of the Punjab Agricultural University. Others claim he was shot by political rivals or deep conspiracy of hockey competitors as still his murder mystery is unsolved, he died on 20 May 1983 in Ludhiana.

Another reason was that they did not see any serious effort in real social development, only some subsidies for cement, tin roofs, chickens, and crops. They suspected that the state of Chiapas and the European Union had hidden interests in the region, and a certain kind of relationschip with its inhabitants.

It was formed in 1957 following a meeting convened by the City of Greater Wollongong Council, with a charter to maintain the safety and the welfare of the community through aerial observation and support. The Aerial Patrol is available to respond to emergencies 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Services The Aerial Patrol operates regular shark spotting and beach safety patrols along the coastline between Palm Beach (north of Sydney) and Mollymook on the New South Wales South Coast. The patrols take place on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays from October to April and provide recreational safety for swimming, surfing, boating, fishing, bushwalking and other activities, as well as monitoring potential bushfire hazards. In recent years, the Aerial Patrol has expanded its service to the south east region of New South Wales and, through its affiliation with the NSW Volunteer Rescue Association, to inland regions of the territory. The patrol is accredited as a specialist agency in accordance with the State Rescue Manual, administered by the NSW Rescue and Emergency Services Board, to assist and support all land- and marine-based emergency services. In 1993, the Australian Aerial Patrol was accredited by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as a Search and Rescue (SAR) Unit, which was expanded between 2001 and 2007 to a Tier 1 SAR capability ‚Äì the highest level of civilian fixed-wing SAR in the Commonwealth and only one of three such organisations at that time. Parallel to that, a working agreement was reached in 1993 between the Aerial Patrol and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard by the Minister for Emergency Services, the only such agreement between a marine agency and an aerial support agency in Australia. Funding and personnel The Aerial Patrol, as a Registered Charity, relies entirely on community fundraising programmes to pay for its operational costs, the most successful of which is the promotion of annual raffles over a 20-year period. Four local government bodies within Illawarra and Shoalhaven provide funding towards the operations, as well as a regional sponsorship by the Bendigo Bank and support from various clubs and local companies. Furthermore, a number of fundraising campaigns are conducted throughout the year, which together raise the half a million dollars a year required to ensure the continued operation of the service. Aerial Patrol personnel are volunteers, rostered for duty 365 days a year, during daylight hours only. The air crew consists of commercial pilots, airborne observers, accredited dropmasters / dispatchers, and any time ERS and radio communications officers. To support its emergency operations, the Aerial Patrol has introduced a commercial department that includes pilot training and aircraft engineering division under the name NSW Air. These have generated successful revenue streams for its community operations. Additionally, the pilot training has streamlined various aspects of the emergency operations through specialised techniques provided via a Commercial training syllabus. The Aerial Patrol is based at the Illawarra Regional Airport at Albion Park south of Sydney.

By featuring artists such as Jill Scott, Buju Banton, The Roots, Beenie Man, and Stephen Marley, as well as unique opportunities to experience new ethnic foods, crafts and cultures, the event has been highly acclaimed by the press, artists, and the Los Angeles community as one of California's premiere concerts in jazz and reggae. The 2015 festival has been shortened to one day and will be held at the Los Angeles Tennis Center due to construction at the UCLA Intramural Field and budget issues.Joseph Vescera, JazzReggae Festival to be shortened in face of budget deficit, UCLA Daily Bruin, January 12, 2015  History  Despite the festival's current reputation as one of Los Angeles' essential yearly events, the concert began in 1986 with humble intentions. Originally held at the UCLA Sunset Canyon Recreation Center, the one-day Jazz Festival at UCLA was created to provide more avenues for student musicians to perform in front of the public. As time moved on and interest in the event increased, a shift in focus occurred, and the festival began to pursue hiring professional musicians. Soon afterwards, a second day featuring Reggae music was added to the annual festival, and it was moved to its current location at the UCLA Intramural Field, where a much larger audience could be accommodated. After many years of maintaining this format, 2007 marked the most recent structural change to the festival. Instead of limiting day one of the festival to jazz music alone, Jam Day was created to incorporate the tremendous spectrum of music that has also been strongly influenced by the jazz genre. This has allowed the festival to continue hiring premier jazz musicians such as Dr. Lonnie Smith, while also giving opportunities to up and coming stars such as Lupe Fiasco.  Going green  Since 2007 the festival has run the stage with bio-diesel fuel, partnered with Eco Limo, printed their flyers and other promotional material on recycled paper, and included an informational booth on site in which audience members can learn more about ways to be environmentally responsible.  Producers  The JazzReggae Festival @ UCLA is entirely produced by UCLA students, predominately through the Undergraduate Student Association Council's Cultural Affairs Commission, making it one of the largest student-produced festivals in the nation.  Art  Each year, the JazzReggae Festival also incorporates a great deal of live art into the day‚Äôs various amusements. Past festivals have included live interactive painting, sustainable art installations, realtime graffiti art, sculptures, and a gallery for all to browse and purchase works from LA artists. The visual art is another key component to the festival‚Äôs status as a cultural constitute of LA, showcasing LA‚Äôs art scene, further educating the community about music, art, and sustainability.  Vendors  For the past 26 years, the JazzReggae Festival has teamed up with local restaurants and businesses throughout greater Los Angeles area. With over 70 diverse vendors, the festival is dedicated to working with the men and women responsible for helping continue the city‚Äôs tradition of culturally diversity that it celebrates. Additionally, in accordance with its mission to promote sustainability, the festival includes monetary incentives for its food vendors to provide biodegradable and compostable food service items.  25th anniversary documentary  In 2011, the JazzReggae Festival celebrated its 25th year, continuing on as the largest solely-student run event in the nation. Both days of the festival quickly sold out, with the show itself yielding a large amount of attendees. The Wailing Souls, Little Dragon, Lupe Fiasco, Talib Kweli, Steel Pulse, and Gyptian came together in this celebration of jazz, jam, and reggae music. Coming to represent jazz, reggae, neo-soul, and hip-hop artists alike, the reggae and jam days both showcased an array of music, live art, sustainability, and culinary vendors.

They are ‚Äî along with the nearby and more celebrated Seneca Rocks ‚Äî the most imposing examples in eastern West Virginia of several formations of the white/gray Tuscarora quartzite and are a popular challenge for rock climbers.

Champe Rocks are named for Sergeant Major John Champe (1752‚Äì1798), a Revolutionary War soldier who became a double agent in an attempt to capture the American traitor General Benedict Arnold. Commanded by Major Henry \\"Light-Horse Harry\\" Lee and handpicked by George Washington for the mission, Champe \\"defected\\" to the British side and came very close to succeeding, but at the last moment, Arnold changed plans and the whole endeavor had to be called off. Champe, who was born in Loudoun County, Virginia, settled near the Rocks after the War. Access Although Champe Rocks lie within Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area and are clearly visible from West Virginia Route 28, there is no direct access to the formation from the public road without trespassing through private property.

Most of its users concentrate between Lleida and Balaguer, where a frequent service is offered, with few trains continuing to La Pobla de Segur. Since 2009, a heritage railway service branded Tren dels Llacs (English: \\"Lakes Train\\"), in reference to the number of reservoirs skirted by the line north of Balaguer, has been running on the railway. The line is part of the ATM √Ärea de Lleida fare-integrated public transport system between Lleida and √Äger. On 3 February 1924, the line's first stretch opened between Lleida and Balaguer, initially as part of a planned international rail line through the Pyrenees mountains between Lleida and Saint-Girons in France. Between 1949 and 1951, it was extended to the current northern terminus in La Pobla de Segur. The line was targeted for closure by the Spanish government in the 1980s, with great opposition from regional and local administrations. This led to the eventual transfer of the line to the Catalan government in 2004, though operations continued to be carried on by the national rail operator Renfe Operadora. In 2016, the line's operation was fully taken over by the regional company Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) following the introduction of new rolling stock and service improvements.

There are two known manuscripts for the poem, one Harleian 5306 (H), 1456 in the British Library and the other Ff. II 38 (c), 1431 in the Cambridge University Library. The dialect has been identified as Northern English. The line is alliterative, either emulating or parodying older Germanic metrical styles. The author is unknown. Plot The story is set in Tottenham, at that time a rural community north of London. During a drinking fest, Perkyn (a potter) boasts to Rondal, the local reeve, that he is the most worthy among the men to marry Tyb, Rondal's attractive daughter. The boast brings about responses from the others, who equally boast of their worthiness, whereupon Perkyn challenges anyone to a joust to settle the issue. Rondal elects to settle the matter by agreeing with Perkyn's idea of a joust, and schedules a jousting tournament to be held seven days later, open to any and all potential suitors. The winner of the tournament will be granted Tyb's hand in marriage (subject to her assent) as well as a \\"dowry\\" (the first of several humorous elements of the joust; it consists of one old gray mare and one spotted sow). At the tournament, the suitors arrive riding old mares as horses, brandishing farm implements for jousting lances, and wearing bowls and pottery as armor. Tyb arrives at the tournament and watches the proceedings on a mare, with a feather-filled bag for a saddle and a hen on her lap. After each worker makes his overblown boast of bravery (Perkyn going last), the \\"tournament\\" commences. Notwithstanding the lack of professional jousting attire, the participants engage in a lively battle which results in several serious injuries and one attempt (by \\"Tyrry\\") to prematurely end the battle by abducting Tyb (his attempt is stopped by Perkyn). At the end of the tournament, the women of Tottenham and the nearby communities arrive to drag them home. Perkyn ends up being the last combatant standing and is thus declared the winner and given Tyb. After they spend the night together, she agrees the next day to marry him. Upon the announcement of the marriage, the warriors gather for a feast. (The feast is described in more detail in another shorter poem, \\"The Feast of Tottenham\\", the author of which is unknown, but it is believed that both poems were written by the same person.) Criticism The poem is evidently meant to be humorous, as the weapons are totally unsuited to war; the combatants fight with farm tools on old horses more given to passing wind than battle. The martial seriousness of the men's vows is immediately undermined by comic touches such as the banners made from old hides and a trumpet made of wood, fighting for a dowry of an old horse and a spotted pig. The poem does not explain why some of the warriors are fighting for Tyb's hand in marriage when they currently have wives (who arrive to drag home their injured men in wheelbarrows). Critics do not agree on the subject of or audience for the parody. The poem may be satirizing knightly conventions such as the jousting tournament, or it may be mocking the country bumpkins who try to imitate these courtly rituals. Or, as with Chaucer's Reeve's Tale, the poet may be making fun of speakers of northern English, who were often stereotyped by southerners as backward.

They are found worldwide in tropical to temperate marine waters, and a number of species have also penetrated into fresh water in Africa, Asia, and Australia. Members of this family have flattened pectoral fin discs that range from oval to diamond-like in shape. Their common name comes from their whip-like tails, which are much longer than the disc and lack dorsal and caudal fins. All whiptail stingrays, except the porcupine ray (Urogymnus asperrimus), have one or more venomous stings near the base of the tail, which is used in defense. They range in size from or more across. Genera The taxonomy of Dasyatidae was revised by Peter Last, Gavin Naylor, and Mabel Manjaji-Matsumoto in 2016, based on morphological and molecular phylogenetic data.

It was planned as Wallace's third novel, and the first since Infinite Jest in 1996, but it was not completed at the time of his death. Before his suicide in 2008, Wallace organized the manuscript and associated computer files in a place where they would be found by his widow, Karen Green, and his agent, Bonnie Nadell. That material was compiled by his friend and editor Michael Pietsch into the form that was eventually published. Wallace had been working on the novel for over a decade. Even incomplete, The Pale King is a long work, with 50 chapters of varying length totaling over 500 pages. The novel was one of the three finalists for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, but no award was given that year. Overview Like much of Wallace's work, the novel defies straightforward summary. Each chapter stands almost alone, with text ranging from straight dialogues between coworkers about civics or cartography to snippets of the 1985 Illinois tax code to poignant sensory or character sketches. Many of the chapters relate the experiences of a handful of employees of the Internal Revenue Service in Peoria, Illinois in 1985. One of the characters, one of two who narrate their chapters, is named David Wallace, but he is a largely fictional counterpart of the author and not the focal point of the novel. Pietsch called the organization of the manuscript \\"a challenge like none I've ever encountered\\".. The fictional \\"Author's Foreword\\" is chapter 9 and is the place in the novel where Wallace's trademark footnotes run most rampant. In this chapter, he introduces the \\"irksome paradox\\" that the only bona fide fiction in the book is the copyright page's disclaimer that states \\"The characters and events in this book are fictitious,\\" while at the same time acknowledging that this foreword itself is defined by that disclaimer as fictional. He further states, in the context of the same self-referential paradox, that \\"The Pale King is a kind of vocational memoir\\" and that \\"the very last thing this book is is some kind of clever metafictional titty-pincher.\\" Other primary characters include Lane Dean Jr., Claude Sylvanshine, David Cusk, and Leonard Stecyk, men drawn for vastly different reasons to a career in the IRS. Writing, editing, and publication Wallace began research for The Pale King in 1997, after the publication of Infinite Jest. He started writing the book around 2000. The novel (or \\"long thing\\", Wallace's usual term for it) had numerous working titles throughout this period, including Glitterer, SJF (Sir John Feelgood), Net of Gems, and What is Peoria For? In 2007, Wallace estimated that the novel was about one-third finished. One of his notebooks found by his widow, Karen Green (who designed the American edition's cover art), suggested a possible direction for the novel's plot: \\"...an evil group within the IRS is trying to steal the secrets of an agent who is particularly gifted at maintaining a heightened state of concentration.\\" The author's ultimate intention for the plot, however, is unknown. Wallace in his final hours had \\"tidied up [his] manuscript so that his wife could find it. Below it, around it, inside his two computers, on old floppy disks in his drawers were hundreds of other pages‚Äîdrafts, character sketches, notes to himself, fragments that had evaded his attempt to integrate them into the novel.\\" On her blog, Kathleen Fitzpatrick reported that the Pale King manuscript edited by Michael Pietsch began with \\"more than 1000 pages... in 150 unique chapters\\". The published version is 540 pages and 50 chapters. (The paperback edition includes four additional scenes totalling 23 pages.) On September 14, 2010, Pietsch announced the novel's publication date and provided further information about its plot, saying that the book \\"takes agonizing daily events like standing in lines, traffic jams, and horrific bus rides‚Äîthings we all hate‚Äîand turns them into moments of laughter and understanding\\", a theme Wallace addressed in his 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College. Pietsch added that \\"although David did not finish the novel, it is a surprisingly whole and satisfying reading experience that showcases his extraordinary imaginative talents and his mixing of comedy and deep sadness in scenes from daily life.\\" Although Little, Brown and Company set The Pale Kings publication date for April 15, 2011 (Tax Day), Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble were allowed to sell copies of the novel through their websites as early as March 22, 2011. That elicited protest from many bookstore owners, who felt it put them at an unfair disadvantage. Little, Brown defended the split dates, maintaining it was common practice. Themes Richard Rayner wrote in the Los Angeles Times that The Pale Kings subjects are \\"loneliness, depression and the ennui that is human life's agonized bedrock, 'the deeper type of pain that is always there, if only in an ambient low-level way, and which most of us spend nearly all of our time and energy trying to distract ourselves from' [quoting Wallace]... The Pale King dares to plunge readers deep into this Dantean hell of 'crushing boredom,' suggesting that something good may lie beyond.\\" The story's central theme reflects that of Wallace's noted 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College, in which he encouraged his audience to be \\"conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience.\\" Reception Jonathan Segura wrote in Publishers Weekly that The Pale King \\"isn't the era-defining monumental work we've all been waiting for since Infinite Jest altered the landscape of American fiction\\", but added that it is \\"one hell of a document and a valiant tribute to the late Wallace.\\" In Esquire, Benjamin Alsup wrote that The Pale King is an \\"incomplete and weirdly fractured pseudo memoir\\" that is \\"frustratingly difficult in places\\" and \\"potholed throughout by narrative false starts and dead ends.\\" Despite that, Alsup stated, \\"you should read The Pale King.\\" While conceding that the novel is not conventionally gripping in terms of narrative, the reviewer asserted, \\"If it keeps you up at night, it won't be because you've got to know what happens next. If you're up, you'll be up because DFW writes sentences and sometimes whole pages that make you feel like you can't breathe.\\" Lev Grossman, in Time, wrote that \\"if The Pale King isn't a finished work, it is, at the very least, a remarkable document, by no means a stunt or an attempt to cash in on Wallace's posthumous fame. Despite its shattered state and its unpromising subject matter, or possibly because of them, The Pale King represents Wallace's finest work as a novelist.\\" In The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote that \\"[The Pale King] feels less like an incomplete manuscript than a rough-edged digest of the themes, preoccupations and narrative techniques that have distinguished [Wallace's] work from the beginning.\\" She described the novel as both \\"breathtakingly brilliant and stupefying dull ‚Äì funny, maddening and elegiac,\\" and predicted that \\"The Pale King will be minutely examined by longtime fans for the reflexive light it sheds on Wallace's oeuvre and his life\\" and will also \\"snag the attention of newcomers, giving them a window ‚Äì albeit a flawed window ‚Äì into this immensely gifted writer's vision of the human condition as lived out in the middle of the middle of America.\\" Kakutani claimed that it is Wallace's \\"most emotionally immediate work.\\" John Jeremiah Sullivan wrote a long, admiring appreciation of the novel in GQ Magazine. David Hering's book David Foster Wallace: Fiction and Form features a lengthy section on the novel's evolution from its genesis to the final version by Michael Pietsch. Part of this section was excerpted in the Los Angeles Review of Books in September 2016.

The United States Shipping Board acquired her on 18 March 1918 for World War I service and transferred her to the U.S. Navy at New York City the same day. Assigned the Naval Registry Identification Number (ID. No.) 1354, she was commissioned as USS Texan on 23 March 1918. Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service after being refitted for naval service, Texan loaded general military supplies and departed on 9 April 1918 in a convoy for France. Texan arrived at Brest, France, on 24 April 1918 and, after discharging her cargo, began the return voyage to New York on 19 May 1918. Upon her arrival there, she underwent voyage repairs and then loaded supplies, including 405 tons of ammunition and 10 locomotives destined for Marseilles, France. Texan departed with a convoy on 18 June 1918 and arrived at Marseilles on 7 July 1918. Texan made another round-trip voyage to Marseilles in September 1918. On 23 October, 1918 she sank the American sail Barge in a collision in the North River. She made anouther round trip to Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France, in November and December 1918 before returning to New York on 4 January 1919. On 18 January 1919, Texan was transferred to the Cruiser and Transport Force and began operating as a troop transport, bringing troops of the American Expeditionary Force home to the United States from France until 7 August 1919, when she was reassigned to the 5th Naval District. Texan was decommissioned on 22 August 1919 and returned to the United States Shipping Board for return to the American Hawaiian Steamship Company. Texan returned to commercial service as SS Texan. During World War II she was on a commercial voyage when German submarine U-126 torpedoed, shelled and sank her off Cape San Antonio, Cuba, on 11 March 1942. Nine men were lost, and 38 survived.

Serving in the Royal Navy between 1755‚Äì1790, he died in Lille, France, in 1803. He entered the Royal Navy in 1755 as a midshipman and served under Admiral Boscawen off Newfoundland, under Admiral Byng off Minorca and under Admiral Rodney in the West Indies. Promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1763, he was engaged in the transport service between England and America. He commanded a transport fleet taking reinforcements to the relief of Gibraltar in 1782 and after returning with troops from Halifax in 1786, he was appointed naval agent to the transports of the First Fleet. A large part of the credit for the success of the First Fleet voyage was due to the vigilance and efficiency with which Shortland discharged his responsibilities as Governor Arthur Phillip was detained in London until 11 May 1787, two days before the fleet sailed. He had also procured appointments on the expedition for his sons, John Shortland and Thomas George Shortland. Shortland after leaving the Cape of Good Hope, with Phillip on with three of the fastest transports, Alexander, Friendship and Scarborough, sailed ahead of the rest of the fleet as an advance party arriving at Botany Bay, Australia, on 17 January 1788. After remaining in Australia until 14 July, he sailed for England in the Alexander, carrying the first dispatches of Governor Phillip to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Francis Osborne, accompanied by the Borrowdale, Prince of Wales and Friendship. During the voyage via Batavia, Shortland discovered and charted many islands and reefs. He named the Treasury Islands, named a strait Shortland Strait, an island Shortland Island, and island group Shortland Islands after himself. During the trip to Batavia, the Friendship was scuttled near Borneo after crew numbers were reduced by scurvy. Shortland arrived back in England in May 1789. He strongly urged the Admiralty to have the eastern coast of Australia properly charted, and as a result the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs dispatched Matthew Flinders in . Shortland was promoted to commander in 1790 and, after further active service, retired to Lille, France, where he died in 1803. He was survived by his widow, two sons and two daughters. John Shortland is often confused with his son John Shortland, also a fine seaman. One mistake occurred on the celebration of the son's discovery of the Hunter River, and a second, on the 150th anniversary of the same event, when Australia Post issued a stamp that showed the face of the father instead of the son.

As a young child living in Virginia, Alder was kidnapped by Shawnee Indians, and later adopted by a Mingo chief in the Ohio Country. He lived with the Native Americans for many years before returning to the white community. Alder settled near present-day Plain City, Ohio, where he became a farmer. He was reunited with his birth family, which moved to Ohio with him, and also had a short career as a military officer during the War of 1812. A middle school, high school, and school district in Plain City all bear his name. Early life Example of running the gauntlet Alder was born September 17, 1773, in Gloucester, New Jersey, to Bartholomew Alder and Hannah Worthington. The family moved in 1775 to Wythe County, Virginia, where Alder's father died about a year later. In May 1782,May 1782 is the date stated in Nelson's book, which claims to be a direct re-telling of Alder's own tale. The date of the kidnapping has also been stated as 1781 (Foster) and March 1782 (Howe) Jonathan, at eight years old, was sent out with his brother David to search for a couple of horses that ran away. They were attacked by a small group of Shawnee Indians from Ohio. David saw the Indians first and tried to escape, but he was chased down, killed, and later scalped. The Indian group also captured Alder's neighbor, Mrs. Martin, and her young child. The group travelled north, passing present- day Chillicothe, Ohio, on the way to a Mingo village on the north side of the Mad River, somewhere near present-day Logan County, Ohio. During the trip the Indians killed and scalped Martin's child, which they found burdensome. Martin responded by screaming in grief; when the Indians' threats to scalp her did not quiet her screams, they whipped her until she was silent. Alder's life was spared due to his appearance. His captors thought his black hair would allow him to pass as an Indian. When the group reached the village, Alder learned why his life had been spared. One of the Mingo chiefs, Succohanos, and his wife, Whinecheoh, were an aging couple who had lost their son, and planned to adopt Alder as a replacement. Alder was forced to run the gauntlet, as a rite of passage, and after he exhibited bravery during the trial, he was adopted and cared for by Whinecheoh. The Indian's other prisoner, Mrs. Martin, had been promised to a man in another village, and was taken away during Alder's adoption ceremony. Native American life The first few years that Alder lived with the Indians he was very ill, a condition Alder attributed to the Indians' diet. The other children in the village were friendly towards Alder, and worked together to teach him their language, customs, and traditions. In time, Alder fully adopted the Mingo way of life; he lived, hunted, and fought as an Indian. When he was old enough he was given an English musket, which he used to hunt mud turtles, wild turkeys, and raccoons. He was praised in the village for his hunting skills. He grew attached to his new life and when, in 1783, a trader from Kentucky offered to exchange him for a Shawnee prisoner, Alder refused. Alder was living in the Indian village of Mack-a-chack when it was destroyed by Benjamin Logan during his raid into Ohio Country in 1786, and he accompanied the Indians on raids into Kentucky to steal horses from white settlers. In 1790, Whinecheoh died at the age of eighty, and Succohanes died in 1792 at the age of ninety. After their deaths, Alder wandered from village to village, and began courting an Indian woman from Upper Sandusky named Barshaw. In the fall of 1793, during the peak of the Northwest Indian War, he joined Shawnee chief Blue Jacket to defend against Anthony Wayne's attacks in the Ohio Country, and also took part in the attack on Fort Recovery on June 30, 1794. Alder was asked for advice on the 1795 Treaty of Greenville on land reservations, and urged by the Indians to attend its signing. Alder, not realizing the treaty's importance, chose not to attend. Life as settler Alder's gravestone In the summer after the signing of the Treaty of Greenville, which restored peace between Indians and settlers, Alder decided to return to the white community. He married Barshaw, and settled in Pleasant Valley, in the area of Jerome Township, about north of present-day Plain City, Ohio.Curry, W.L., History of Jerome Township, Union County, Ohio, Heritage Books, Inc., Columbus, Ohio, 1913 He built a cabin, took up the lifestyle of a farmer, and raised hogs, cows and horses. He sold milk and butter he made to the Indians, and pork and horses to the whites. Alder began adopting the white community's habits, and learned English from the other white settlers. While living in Pleasant Valley, Barshaw struggled to integrate with settler life. She gave birth to two of Alder's children, but both died in infancy. The couple decided the Great Spirit was opposed to their marriage, and separated. Alder gave Barshaw most of the couple's property, including the cabin, all of the cows, seven horses, and about $200 in silver. Alder kept only two horses and the hogs. Alder's cabin After some time Alder developed interest in his original family in Virginia. A companion, John Moore, learned that Alder had been taken prisoner near Greenbrier, and traveled to Wythe County to search for Alder's family. Initial inquiries were unsuccessful, but one of a series of advertisements Moore placed in the district was seen by Alder's surviving brother Paul. Paul then wrote Jonathan to inform him that the family was still alive. Alder left for Paul's house, with Moore, in November 1805. He and Moore arrived in Virginia the Sunday after New Year, and Alder was reunited with his biological mother and siblings. Alder stayed with his family in Virginia for over a year, and while visiting his family he met and fell in love with Mary Ann Blont, a woman from Virginia. The couple were married on January 6, 1806, and in August 1806, Alder, Blont, and the rest of Alder's family returned to Pleasant Valley. Alder built another log cabin along the Big Darby Creek in 1806, and he and Mary had 12 children between 1808 and 1830. Military career During the War of 1812, during the summer of 1812 or 1813, Alder was elected captain of a company of 70 men formed in Plain City. With Frederick Loyd as his lieutenant, Alder's company was ordered by the Governor to march about twenty miles north and build a blockhouse at Mill Creek, about three miles north of Marysville, Ohio, to protect the Darby settlements. The company built and garrisoned the blockhouse for a few weeks, but when a false alarm was sounded regarding Indians attacking the settlements, the men returned to their homes. This was the only fort ever constructed in Union County, and some of the foundation is still visible today. After the war ended, Alder returned to the life of a farmer. He continued to visit the other former captives with whom he had become friends. In the fall of 1818, Alder received a visit from Simon Kenton, to share and compare stories. The two discovered that they had much in common, and had been at many of the same battles, even if they had been on opposite sides. They met several times up until 1828. Legacy Living out the rest of his days as a farmer, Jonathan Alder died on January 30, 1849, in Canaan Township, Madison County, Ohio, at the age of 75. He had become a well-known figure in the region, and is still remembered today with a school district, high school, and middle school named after him. A historical marker was erected by Ohio in front of Foster Chapel Cemetery at , near West Jefferson, where he is buried. The cabin Alder built in 1806 is now located at the Madison County Historical Society Museum in London.

Designed by James Renwick, Jr. in 1850, Oak Hill Cemetery Chapel is the architect's only known example of Gothic Revival church architecture in Washington, D.C. It is located on the highest ridge in Oak Hill Cemetery, near the intersection of 29th and R Streets NW. The chapel is one of two structures in Oak Hill Cemetery listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the other being the Van Ness Mausoleum. The chapel, mausoleum, and cemetery are contributing properties to the Georgetown Historic District, a National Historic Landmark.  History  On June 7, 1848, businessman and philanthropist William Wilson Corcoran (1798-1888) purchased Parrott's Woods, a forest overlooking Rock Creek Park, from Lewis Washington, great-grandnephew of President George Washington. Corcoran organized a company to establish a cemetery, and on March 3, 1849, the Oak Hill Cemetery Company was chartered by an Act of Congress. Architect James Renwick, Jr. (1818-1895) was chosen to design a small chapel for the new cemetery. Renwick, whose best known works include Grace Church, St. Patrick's Cathedral and the Corcoran Gallery of Art (currently the Renwick Gallery), began designing the chapel soon after he had finished the plans for the Smithsonian Institution Building. The cost of constructing Oak Hill Cemetery Chapel was $9,400, which was paid by Corcoran. On March 16, 1972, the National Park Service added Oak Hill Cemetery Chapel to the National Register of Historic Places.  Architecture  Oak Hill Cemetery Chapel is considered an excellent example of Gothic Revival architecture, and often called a \\"miniature Gothic gem\\". It features a steeply designed pitched roof, buttresses, and stained glass lancet windows accented with tracery. The chapel is a one-story, rectangular building measuring high and long. The building materials consist of Potomac gneiss, sandstone, and wood. A cornerstone, inscribed with the date \\"1850\\", is located in a buttress on the chapel's northwest corner. The chapel is accessible by a large, painted door on the west side. The door is protected by a padlocked, wrought iron gate; the padlock bears the inscription: \\"Presented/Oak Hill Cemetery Co./By/James L. Norris/March 19, 1895.\\" A rose window with wooden mullions is located above the door.  Influence  The design of Grace Episcopal Church, a Gothic Revival church built in 1867, is very similar to that of the nearby Oak Hill Cemetery Chapel. Although the architect of Grace Episcopal Church is unknown, there is reason to believe Renwick may have designed the building. If this isn't the case, the person who designed the church was greatly influenced by Renwick's work. See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in western Washington, D.C.

Career and replacement After being tasked with building and organising the Olympic village, F√ºrstner was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Werner Freiherr von und zu Gilsa in June 1936. F√ºrstner was demoted to local vice-commander. Officially, the demotion was because \\"F√ºrstner did not act with the necessary energy\\" since 370,000 visitors had poured through from the opening on 1 May to 15 June and caused damage. The explanation was a pretext to disparage F√ºrstner because his background. F√ºrstner, along with fencer Helene Mayer and Ice hockey star Rudi Ball, was one of the few people with Jewish ancestry connected with the 1936 Olympics.Lehrer, Steven. The Reich Chancellery and F√ºhrerbunker Complex. An Illustrated History of the Seat of the Nazi Regime. McFarland. Jefferson, NC 2006 pp 47-48.

Death and cover-up F√ºrstner committed suicide with a pistol shot on 19 August 1936, three days after the end of the games. He had been awarded the Olympic Medal First Class and had attended a banquet for his successor, Gilsa, but F√ºrstner, a career officer, had learned that according to the Nuremberg Laws, he was classified as a Jew and was to be dismissed from the Wehrmacht.Susan D. Bachrach, The Nazi Olympics. NY: Little, Brown, p. 109. (His grandfather Dr. Karl F√ºrstner was a Jewish convert to Christianity.) To cover up F√ºrstner‚Äôs suicide and to protect the international reputation of Germany, the Nazis said that F√ºrstner had died from a car accident. However, word of the cover up leaked out to foreign journalists, who reported that he had shot himself. For example, The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia, reported he had been found dead with a gun by his side.The Sydney Morning Herald, 21 August 1936 pp. 12. He was buried in the Invalidenfriedhof, section F, alongside the honoured dead of Germany\\"s wars.

Overview Birbhum district is physiographically a part of the ancient Rarh region. The western portion of the district is basically an extension of the Chota Nagpur Plateau. The area has mostly loose reddish lateritic low fertility soil. In the east, the flood plains of the major rivers, such as the Ajay, Bakreshwar, Mayurakshi and Brahmani, have soft alluvial soil. The forest cover is only 3.5% of the total district. Although coal is found in the district and Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station has a capacity of 2,010 MW, the economic condition of Birbhum is dominated by agriculture. From 1977 onwards majorland reforms took place in West Bengal. Land in excess of land ceiling was acquired and distributed amongst the peasants. In Birbhum district, 19,968 hectares of vested agricultural land has been distributed amongst 161,515 beneficiaries, till 2011. However, more than 38% of the operational land holding is marginal or less than 1 acre. The proportion of agricultural labourers amongst total workers in Birbhum district is 45.9%, the highest amongst all districts of West Bengal. Culturally rich Birbhum, with such traditional landmarks as Jaydev Kenduli and Chandidas Nanoor, is home to Visva-Bharati University at Santiniketan, having close association with two Nobel laureates ‚Äì Rabindranath Tagore and Amartya Sen.

The river is located within the boundaries of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve about east of Albany. The river rises to the North of Reservoir Hill and flows in a southerly direction until it discharges into Moates Lake. This lake drains into Gardner Lake and eventually onto Two Peoples Bay. The average rainfall in the catchment area is with most falling in the winter months. The catchment mostly consists of Albany Blackbutt and Sheoak forest. Approximately one third of the catchment has been cleared for agriculture. The name was first recorded in 1913 by a surveyor and is thought to be of Aboriginal origin. A weir was built along the river in 1964 to measure stream flow, a fish way was built in 2000 to allow fish to migrate upstream of the weir. The river is home to the endangered fish, the Trout Minnow (Galaxias truttaceus) which only occurs between the Goodga and the Angove River.

Both players participated in Super Bowl XLIII. On the Wii version of the game, several Cardinals players can be noticed in the background. In the NFL Kickoff game against the Tennessee Titans, Polamalu sprained his MCL while blocking a field goal attempt, causing him to miss a majority of the season. Polamalu's injury has been linked to the continuation of the popular Madden Curse that plagues players immediately after gracing the cover of Madden. Fitzgerald, however, had a strong season, posting a career-high 13 touchdowns and earning Pro Bowl honors. Roster updates Roster updates were released almost every week during the 2009 football season and are required to play online.

In order to receive the characters, the user must have an internet connection and update their rosters online with their specific console, either Xbox Live or PlayStation Online Network. For Xbox users, it is not needed to have a paid online Gold account, one can still get the roster updates with the free online Silver account. AFL Legacy Pack In light of the 50th Anniversary celebration of the American Football League, on September 24 the AFL Legacy Pack became available as downloadable content on the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Network. The pack includes throwback uniforms for the Buffalo Bills, New England Patriots (Boston Patriots), Tennessee Titans (Houston Oilers), San Diego Chargers, Oakland Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs (Dallas Texans), Denver Broncos, and New York Jets (Titans of New York), In addition, games can be played in a classic AFL film grain broadcast camera, referee uniforms are AFL- style orange throwbacks and the team logos on field are old-school. The AFL Legacy Pack also provides a new set of AFL specific Madden Moments and AFL Legacy Pack specific achievements with a 150-point total gain. This \\"AFL mode\\" has been met with much approval. Madden Ultimate Team Madden Ultimate Team, also known as \\"MUT\\" (pronounced: \\"mutt\\") is a game mode released on January 7, 2010. In this mode, users are able to build a team by purchasing player packs. These packs are purchased with coins that are earned by winning a game, scoring a touchdown etc. They can also be purchased with real money through the user's PlayStation Network or Xbox Live accounts. As the user gains more coins, they are able to buy better packs of players, eventually building their \\"Ultimate Team\\". This mode has received negative feedback with regards to the 'Player Contracts' that are attached to each 'Player Card'. When purchased 'Player Cards' have a 10 match contract - this decreases by 1 every game (even if due to disconnection). Replenishment of a contract on a 'Player Card' is done by a contract card that is purchased with coins. It is thus extremely difficult to keep a good team 'in contract' without spending real money. It is also possible to be in a position where you have a low amount of coins and not enough players to even play 'Madden Ultimate Team' - unless you wish to spend real money to buy contract cards to replenish your players contracts, or to buy new packs with - to try to fill the empty team positions that are stopping you from playing the mode. Madden NFL Arcade EA Sports released Madden NFL Arcade as a downloadable title through the PSN Store and Xbox Live Marketplace networks on November 24 respectively. The game is a five-on-five arcade style football game similar to Midway's NFL Blitz, featuring all 32 NFL teams and stadiums.

She also made occasional contributions to PBS, NPR, and Fox News. In 2006, the Iranian authorities revoked Saberi's press accreditation and closed the FSN bureau in Iran. She maintained a second press accreditation, permitting her to freelance in Iran for the BBC. In late 2006, it was also revoked.

On March 3, 2009, an Iranian judiciary spokesman confirmed that Roxana Saberi had been arrested on the orders of the Islamic Revolutionary Court. Although Saberi holds both Iranian and American citizenship, Iran does not recognise dual citizenship. On March 10, a number of international news organisations wrote an open letter to the Iranian government, calling on Iran to allow independent access to Saberi. Signatories included President of NPR Vivian Schiller, President of ABC News David Westin, Wall Street Journal Editor-in- Chief Robert Thomson, John Stack of Fox News, and Jon Williams (world editor at the BBC). The open letter expressed deep concern about Saberi's well-being and \\"the deprivation of her rights\\": After more than five weeks' captivity, on March 8, Saberi was allowed to see an attorney for the first time. On March 18, marking 47 days of detention, the Saberi family called on Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to intervene during the run-up to the Persian Nowruz holiday. The US administration expressed its concern at Saberi's detention, dismissing allegations against her as \\"baseless\\". US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton demanded her release. On April 6, her parents were allowed a 30-minute visit to Saberi in Evin Prison, where she was being held. On April 8, the Iranian government charged Saberi with espionage, while the Iranian Students News Agency, quoting a hard-line judge who is the deputy head of Iran's prosecutor's office, said Saberi had \\"accepted\\" the accusation of espionage. Saberi's father, who was in Iran at the time but was not allowed into the courtroom, told NPR his daughter was coerced into making incriminating statements. \\"They told her if she made the statements they would free her,\\" he said. \\"It was a trick.\\" The court sentenced her to eight years in prison, which her lawyer Abdolsamad Khorramshahi promised to appeal. Switzerland represents United States interests in Iran, as Iran and the United States do not presently have diplomatic relations.

Hunger strike On April 25, 2009, the BBC reported that Saberi's father, Reza Saberi, said he had received word from his daughter that she had been on a hunger strike for the past five days. At the end of two weeks, she told him she had discontinued the hunger strike. During this time, her situation was followed closely by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Asian American Journalists Association, Committee to Protect Journalists, Society of Professional Journalists, and UNITY: Journalists of Color, Inc. Amnesty International later named her a prisoner of conscience. Release On May 10, 2009, Saberi's appeal was heard by an Iranian appeals court. The court reportedly dismissed the charges against her on the grounds that the US is not a hostile country because it is not at war with Iran. Her original conviction was on the charges that she was working with a \\"hostile country\\" ‚Äì the United States. On May 11, 2009, Saberi was freed from prison after the appeals court suspended her eight-year jail sentence. An appeals court reduced the charge against her from espionage to possessing classified information,Jailed US journalist Roxana Saberi 'had secret document on war in Iraq', The Times a charge Saberi denied, and reduced her eight-year prison term to a two-year suspended sentence. After her release, Saberi said that although she was not physically tortured during her captivity, she was placed under \\"severe psychological and mental pressure\\". She said her captors blindfolded her during days of interrogation, held her in solitary confinement, and would not allow her to inform anyone of her whereabouts. According to Saberi, her interrogators threatened her with many years in prison and even execution if she did not confess to being a spy. She said that under these pressures, she had made a false confession, which she later recanted while still in custody. After Saberi was released from prison, one of her lawyers declared that she had obtained a classified document while working as a translator for a powerful clerical lobby. He claimed that this had been used as evidence to convict her on charges of espionage. He said the document was a classified Iranian report on the US-led war in Iraq.May 12, 2009. \\"Journalist Copied Iranian Report on U.S. and Iraq\\", Washington Post Saberi later said \\"I didn't have any classified documents. I had a research article that was public information, but my captors lied and claimed I had a classified document, evidently to pretend that there was legitimacy to my case.\\" Saberi has suggested that the lawyer may have been under pressure from the Iranian government to say after her release that the document was classified, even though in court he had argued that it was not. = Life after imprisonment = Since her release, Saberi wrote a book about her experiences in Iran, Between Two Worlds: My Life and Captivity in Iran, which was released by HarperCollins on March 30, 2010. She has also been speaking out for Iran's \\"prisoners of conscience\\"\\"Will Elections Loosen the Grip of Iran's Hard- liners?\\" The Washington Post, June 11, 2009 as well as the Iranians who have been detained in the aftermath of the 2009 Iranian presidential election.

Synonyms include hepar sulfuris, sulfur, sulfurated potash and sulfurated potassa. There are two distinct varieties: \\"potassic liver of sulfur\\" and \\"ammoniacal liver of sulfur\\". Liver of sulfur is mainly used in metalworking to form a brown or black patina on copper and silver as well as many (though not all) copper alloys and silver alloys (brass, for example‚Äî a copper alloy‚Äî does not react with sulfur compounds). It is sold as a yellow brittle solid (a \\"lump\\" which must be mixed with water before use) as well as a pre-mixed liquid and a gel form. The solid is believed to have the longest shelf life, though all liver of sulfur tends to rapidly decompose with time. Modern gel forms contain stabilizers that allow the reactivity to last much longer. Liver of sulfur that is kept dry, sealed from air, out of the light, and in a freezer will last many times longer than that kept in any other condition. The highest quality liver of sulfur in solid form is a dark yellow, almost \\"liver\\" colored substance. As it ages and is exposed to air, its potency decreases, it will turn lighter yellow and finally white, at which point its reactivity is negligible. Liver of sulfur decomposes to sulfate of potash and carbonate of potash, neither of which has any value as an oxidizer of metal. The reactivity of liver of sulfur with silver and copper quickly creates a dark or colored patina on the metal. This is done by immersing the metal object in a solution of liver of sulfur and water. When treating silver, the solution must be hot, though If the bath is brought to its boiling point the liver of sulfur will quickly decompose and become ineffective. Also, if the concentration of the solution is too strong, the oxidation process will proceed too quickly and the layer of patina thus created will tend to flake away. The best results are usually obtained by using more dilute solutions and allowing the patina to build more slowly but more securely, and, for silver, keeping the solution just under its boiling point. Lastly, it is critical that the metal surface be extremely clean, as clean as would be necessary to electroplate the same surface. Even small amounts of oil on the metal such as that produced by handling without gloves will be sufficient to protect the metal surface from oxidation. Medical use Liver of sulfur was once used to counteract poisoning with several metals, including arsenic, copper, lead, and antimony. A lump was dissolved in warm water and the patient was instructed to drink the solution three or four times over the course of an hour. At one time sulfurated potash was used to combat arthritis. It eventually fell into disfavor for medical purposes because sulfides and polysulfides were discovered to be toxic in their own rights.

He became after his marriage the son-in-law of the Belgian architect Paul Saintenoy.Pucheu Pierre, ministre du Mar√©chal P√©tain Early years The son of a tailor from southwest France, Pucheu was born in Beaumont-sur-Oise and won a scholarship to the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, where he was a contemporary of both Robert Brasillach and Jean-Paul Sartre. Initially intending to follow the path of a writer himself, he became enamoured of capitalism in Paris and determined instead to enter the business world.P. Webster, Petain's Crime, London, Pan Books, 2001, p. 126 He was ultimately drawn to the steel industry and eventually came to head up one of the largest monopolies, the Cartel d'Acier.Webster, Petain's Crime, p. 117 Initially showing little real interest in politics, his interest was sparked by the 6 February 1934 crisis and he became associated first with the Croix-de-Feu and then with Jacques Doriot's Parti Populaire Fran√ßais before splitting from the latter group in 1938 over Doriot's financial links with Nazi GermanyWebster, Petain's Crime, p. 127 and Fascist Italy.M. Curtis, Verdict on Vichy, London: Phoenix Press, 2004, p. 79 In particular Pucheu was opposed to the Munich Agreement, which he felt punished Czechoslovakia.

In the latter role he became noted for his heavy-handed approach, notably selecting personally 89 hostages for execution in October 1941 in reprisal for the killing of German officers. He also formed the Police aux Questions Juives in 1941 and took personal charge of the organisation.Webster, Petain's Crime, p. 119 He was also responsible for setting up the SPAC anti-communist police force, the anti-Masonic Service for Secret Societies and the Amicales de France, which served as the propaganda arm of Vichy.David Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, London: Heinemann, 1972, p. 231 According to Joseph Barth√©lemy, Pucheu, who had a violent hatred of Communists and Jews, was a confirmed Nazi. However, Pucheu actually wanted to model France's economy on Nazi Germany's rather than being fully convinced of the merits of occupation, and as such the Germans called for him to be replaced in April 1942. As part of a loose intellectual movement known as the jeunes cyclists, Pucheu quickly came to terms with Germany as the leader of Europe but hoped that economic renewal would ensure France would be one of the leading secondary powers in this new order.Curtis, Verdict on Vichy, p. 259 In government Pucheu has been characterised, along with the likes of Jean Bichelonne, Jacques Barnaud and Fran√ßois Lehideux, as a technocrat who helped to ensure that the Vichy regime was able to take on the administrative functions of a government. They were said to belong to a group called the Synarchy. Like Bichelonne he was devotee of Saint-Simonianism, the belief in industrialisation as the motor of progress in society, a belief that was not shared by the rural traditionalist Philippe P√©tain.Philip M. Williams, Crisis and Compromise: Politics in the Fourth Republic, London: Longmans, 1964, p. 14 Later years Deprived of his position, Pucheu moved, just after the allied landings in North Africa, to Spain, and at the invitation of General Giraud, who promised him safe passage,Duff Cooper Diaries, ed. John Julius Norwich, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 2005, p.293, footnote 1. he went to Casablanca, Morocco in May 1943. Despite the safe passage offer, he was arrested shortly thereafter and charged with treason and making illegal arrests, and then was transferred to Algiers in October 1943. Pucheu was tried in March 1944, convicted and sentenced to death. Despite a request for clemency by General Giraud, General de Gaulle refused to intervene, although personally regretting the political necessity of Pucheu's execution, and expressing admiration for the way in which he had conducted himself during the trial. It is said that de Gaulle had ensured that the captured Pucheu faced the death penalty in order to undermine any further collaboration in France.Webster, Petain's Crime, p. 270 On 20 March 1944, Pucheu was executed by firing squad.Amouroux, Un Printemps de Mort and D'Espoir, pp. 125‚Äì131 He met his death with great courage, shaking hands with the firing squad, and giving the order to fire himself.

Its modern redevelopment is the result of cooperation between the Arts Council of Tuscaloosa and the Tuscaloosa County Parks and Recreation Authority. The three-story brick and limestone building is located at the corner of Sixth Street and Greensboro Avenue in downtown Tuscaloosa. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on August 30, 1984. It is also a contributing building in the Downtown Tuscaloosa Historic District, NRHP-listed in 1985.  History  Early history = The Bama Theatre was originally constructed from 1937‚Äì38 through Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal as a Public Works Administration project. The building was built as a combination theater and city hall for Tuscaloosa. It was designed by Birmingham architect David O. Whilldin, who also designed other historically significant buildings in the Tuscaloosa downtown area and worked from the Whilldin Building. The building opened as a theater on April 12, 1938. The theater was one of the last movie palaces built in the South. The building features a Streamline Moderne exterior style, popular during the period, and a lavish \\"atmospheric\\" interior style that is decorated with a combination of Moderne and Renaissance elements. Twinkling stars and clouds on the ceiling create an open air feel in the performance hall. See also: The city hall was moved out the building following the city's acquisition and renovation of the former United States Post Office (built 1909) in 1968. = Renovations = Entrance of the Bama Theatre in 2009 Detail of the marquee in 2010 The theater was converted to a performing arts center in 1976 and has been completely renovated for live theatrical/concert use. With the arrival of theater manager David Allgood in 2003, the Bama has become a sought-after venue for touring artists. The movie fare at The Bama was also revamped, creating the Bama Art House Film Series, featuring independent, foreign, and documentary movies. Past screenings have included Boyhood, Moonrise Kingdom, Turn Me On, Dammit, Room, and the world premier of John Sayles's Honeydripper, which was filmed in Alabama. Sayles attended the one-night screening, which drew an audience of nearly 900 people.\\"Honeydripper Premieres\\" by Mark Hughes Cobb, February 4, 2008, Tuscaloosa News http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20080204/honeydripper- premieres The Bama continues to be the premier performing arts venue in Tuscaloosa, boasting over 300 nights per year of concerts, movies, dance, and live theater.

The Tuscaloosa Children's Theatre and Tuscaloosa Community Dancers perform at the theater 2-3 times a year each and entertain packed houses with every show. The ACT (\\"Actors' Charitable Theatre\\") performs 3-4 shows annually. The theatre is also home to several dance school end-of-year recitals including The Dance Centre and The Academy of Ballet and Jazz. The Tuscaloosa Academy Players, Tuscaloosa County High School Drama Dept and Brookwood Drama Department have also all enjoyed great success with their productions in this historic space.

By 899, his followers controlled large parts of the region, and in 900 he scored a major victory over an Abbasid army sent to subdue him. He captured the local capital, Hajar, in 903, and extended his rule south and east into Oman. He was assassinated in 913, and succeeded by his eldest son Sa'id. His religious teachings and political activities are somewhat unclear, as they are reported by later and usually hostile sources, but he seems to have shared the millennialist Isma'ili belief about the imminent return of the mahdƒ´, hostility to conventional Islamic rites and rituals, and to have based the Qarmatian society on the principles of communal ownership and egalitarianism, with a system of production and distribution overseen by appointed agents. The Qarmatian \\"republic\\" he founded would last until the late 11th century. Early life Abu Sa'id was of Persian origin, from Jannaba in coastal Fars. He was born sometime between 845 and 855, and was reportedly crippled on his left side. He later claimed (or it was claimed by his followers) that he had royal descent from the Sasanian dynasty, but in his early life he was a furrier or flour merchant, initially in his native Jannaba, and later in the vicinity of Kufa, where he moved. There he married into the Banu'l-Qassar family, who were prominent members of the Isma'ili community in the area. He was proselytized and taught by the Isma'ili missionary (dƒÅ'ƒ´) Abu Muhammad Abdan, the brother-in-law of Hamdan Qarmat, the overall leader of the Isma'ili movement in Iraq. In the period about 874/884, Abu Sa'id was then in turn sent as a dƒÅ'ƒ´ to proselytize in Fars, in the area of Jannaba, Siniz, Tawwaj, and Mahruban. His mission was successful, and he gathered converts and funds: all dƒÅ'ƒ´s were required to gather funds for the awaited mahdƒ´, who was still in Occultation. Eventually, however, he was denounced to the Sunni authorities. His treasure and stores were confiscated, but Abu Sa'id managed to escape and went into hiding, perhaps in Basra. Conquest of Bahrayn Map of eastern and central Arabia in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries According to the report of Ibn Hawqal, at that time he met with Hamdan Qarmat, who recognized Abu Sa'id's abilities and entrusted him with leading the missionary effort in Bahrayn, a region encompassing all of eastern Arabia from the borders of Iraq to Qatar. Bahrayn is generally ignored by the historical sources of the period; the area was under Abbasid rule, but according to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, \\"the Arabic sources fail to tell much about its extent or effectiveness\\". According to the 10th-century historian al-Mas'udi, Abu Sa'id arrived there in 886/887, but other sources place this at different dates, from 894 to 896, or even as late as 899, by which time however he is known to have established himself as a power in the area; as a result the later dates are unlikely to be correct. Abu Sa'id initially assumed the role of a flour merchant in the town of Qatif, where he established crucial bonds with the Banu Sanbar, a Thaqafi family of some prominence: the three sons, Hasan, Ali and Hamdan, became his closest supporters, while Hasan's daughter became his wife. The family would continue to play a leading role in the Qarmatian state over the next decades. According to Ibn Hawqal and Akhu Muhsin, the Isma'ili community he founded initially consisted of the \\"small folk, butchers, porters, and the like\\". At Bahrayn he encountered another Isma'ili dƒÅ'ƒ´, Abu Zakariya al-Tamami, who had been sent by the Yemeni dƒÅ'ƒ´ Ibn Hawshab, and who had managed to convert the Banu Kilab tribe. A certain rivalry ensued, but for long the two became reluctant partners, until Abu Sa'id finally had Abu Zakariya imprisoned and killed. Abu Sa'id nevertheless managed to gain the backing not only of the Kilab, but also of the Banu Uqayl, who became the core of his military forces. The Bedouin tribes were, in the words of Heinz Halm, \\"an ideal target group\\" for the dƒÅ'ƒ´: the‚Äîadmittedly rabidly anti-Isma'ili‚Äîaccount of Akhu Muhsin describes the tribes as \\"accustomed to war, but at the same time strong and ignorant, carefree and far from the law of Islam, with no knowledge of prophecy, or of what is allowed and forbidden\\". Indeed, the first group to join the cause, the Banu al-Adbat, a subtribe of the Kilab, had previously been shunned on account of a blood feud. Joining Abu Sa'id's revolutionary doctrine gave them not only the prospect of booty and power, but also of redemption. With the backing of a strong Bedouin army, Abu Sa'id began attacking towns in the area: Qatif, Zara, Safwan, Zahran, al-Hasa, and Juwata. His expeditions reached as far east as Sohar (which he briefly captured after several attempts) in the Oman and west to Bilad al-Falaj and south to Yabrin; the central al-Yamama region was left devastated and depopulated in the process, as the local tribes of Banu Qushayr and Banu Sa'd were either killed or expelled. Yamama was probably not placed under Qarmatian control, although they clashed with the Banu 'l-Ukhaidhir who ruled it at the time, and who later became allies of the Qarmatians. At some unknown point, Abu Sa'id even captured the island of Awal (modern Bahrain), and imposed tariffs on shipping there. In 899, a major rift occurred in the Isma'ili movement, when Hamdan Qarmat and Abu Muhammad Abdan denounced the movement's secret leadership at Salamiya, which had been taken over by Sa'id ibn al-Husayn, the future founder of the Fatimid Caliphate. Shortly after that, Hamdan Qarmat disappeared, while Abu Muhammad was murdered in the same year at the instigation of Zakarawayh ibn Mihrawayh, apparently on the instructions of Salamiya. After Hamdan's disappearance, the term \\"Qarmatians\\" was retained by all Isma'ilis who refused to recognize the claims of Sa'id, and subsequently of the Fatimid dynasty. Abu Sa'id likewise rejected Sa'id's claims; apart from ideological reasons and loyalty to his masters, political considerations may also have played a role, as this was \\"a favourable opportunity to make himself completely independent\\", as Wilferd Madelung put it. It was also at that time, according to Ibn Hawqal, that he had his rival Abu Zakariya al-Tamami imprisoned and executed, as he remained loyal to Sa'id. In later decades the Fatimids launched attempts to get the Qarmatian communities to recognize their leadership, but although they were successful in some areas, throughout their existence, the Qarmatians in Bahrayn refused to do so. Neither, however, did Abu Sa'id try to coordinate his movements with the other Qarmatian groups active in the Abbasid territories, such as the rebellions launched in Syria and Iraq by Zakarawayh ibn Mihrawayh and his sons in 901‚Äì907. By 899, Abu Sa'id's followers controlled most of Bahrayn, except for the regional capital Hajar, which was still under Abbasid control, and in the north had advanced up to the vicinity of Basra. The fall of Qatif in that year alarmed the populace of Basra, as they realized that a Qarmatian attack on the city was now a possibility; hasty work commenced to erect a brick wall around the hitherto unfortified city. Early in 900, Abu Sa'id began his siege of Hajar, but as the city resisted for several months, he established his own residence and base of operations (dƒÅr al-hijra) at al-Ahsa (modern al-Hofuf), some two miles from Hajar. The news of the siege prompted the reaction of the Abbasid caliph al-Mu'tadid, who in April 900 named his general al-Abbas ibn Amr al-Ghanawi governor of Bahrayn and Yamama, and sent him with 2,000 soldiers, augmented with volunteers, against Abu Sa'id's forces. On 31 July, in a salt marsh some two days' march from Qatif, the Abbasid army was defeated in battle. Al-Ghanawi was taken prisoner and later released, but the other captives, reportedly 700 in number, were executed. In the aftermath of this success, Hajar was captured, only to be lost again after the arrival of a new Abbasid governor in 901, while Abu Sa'id was leading an expedition in the vicinity of Basra. In late 903, the Abbasid governor Ibn Banu reported to the central government in Baghdad that he had captured Qatif and defeated and killed Abu Sa'id's designated successor there. Nevertheless, around the same time or a little later, Hajar was forced to surrender anew to the Qarmatians after they cut its water supply. Many of its inhabitants chose flight to Awal, Siraf, and other places, while many who remained behind were either killed or converted in the pillaging that followed. Despite the destruction visited upon it, Hajar remained the chief city and capital of Bahrayn. Abu Sa'id, however, established his own palatial residence at al-Ahsa oasis, where he ruled in the traditional manner of an Arab prince. From Bahrayn, the Qarmatians launched a series of raids against the vicinities of Basra, both to capture slaves and in retaliation for the participation of the local Zabba tribe in the 900 campaign against them. The most notable of these raids occurred in July/August 912, but although the local Abbasid governor was reportedly unable to confront it, the sources report that the force involved was very small, barely 30 men. Governance and doctrine As the founder of the Qarmatian \\"republic\\" of Bahrayn, he was ascribed by later generations the establishment of its institutions. While certainly far from their fully developed form as reported by Ibn Hawqal, he certainly did initiate some of them. The Qarmatian system was based on communal ownership and egalitarianism, with a system of production and distribution overseen by Abu Sai'id's agents. For example, any livestock and supplies taken during raids were stored and distributed; slaves were employed in communal labour; the herding of cattle, camels, and sheep, the production of arms and clothing, were centrally directed; and all boys taken captive were trained together from the age of four, both in arms and riding and in the Qarmatian doctrine. A council, the al- øIqdƒÅniyya, comprising representatives of leading families and senior officials, was also established in an advisory capacity. His religious teachings are less clear, as the Qarmatians of Bahrayn left no testimonies of their own; what is known about them is reported by few, foreign, and usually heavily hostile sources. Initially, he obviously adhered to the millennialist Isma'ili teachings about the imminent return of the mahdƒ´, Muhammad ibn Isma'il. After the rift of 899, he no longer recognized the authority of Sa'id; according to the qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ Abd al- Jabbar ibn Ahmad, Abu Sa'id now claimed that the mahdƒ´ was no longer Ibn Isma'il but Muhammad, the son of Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, whose appearance was expected in 912, the year 300 of the Hijri calendar, but this information is of dubious reliability. When the date passed without incident‚Äîin the meantime Sa'id had declared himself as the mahdƒ´ and founded the Fatimid Caliphate in Ifriqiya‚Äîthe failure of the prophecy is said to have caused considerable embarrassment to the Qarmatian regime. Following Isma'ili expectations that the mahdƒ´ would reveal the \\"hidden\\" or \\"inner\\" (bƒÅ·π≠in) truths of the religion to his followers, thus ushering an \\"age of pure spiritual knowledge\\" and making religious laws and customs obsolete, Abu Sa'id abolished numerous Islamic rites, such as prayer and fasting. Death and succession Al-Mas'udi reports that Abu Sa'id was murdered in June/July 913 while taking his bath in his palace by two ·π£aqlabƒ´ eunuch slaves. Several of his higher-ranking officers and followers were killed at the same time, including Ali and Hamdan ibn Sanbar. However, the death was not reported in Baghdad until the summer of 914, perhaps indicating that it was kept secret until then. The reason for his murder is unknown, but Heinz Halm suggests it may be linked to the failed prophecy on the appearance of the mahdƒ´ the previous year. He left seven or six sons, who due to their youth were at first under the tutelage of their uncle Hasan, the last of the three Banu Sanbar brothers. Power was likely nominally invested among all of Abu Sa'id's sons, as a response composed soon after Abu Sa'id's death to a letter from the Abbasid vizier was written on behalf of all sons. Among his sons, the oldest, Abu'l-Qasim Sa'id al-Jannabi, was at first the pre-eminent, but his reign was brief; he was replaced by the youngest son, Abu Tahir al-Jannabi, at the latest by 923. The reason and manner of the transition is unclear. Most Arabic sources agree that Abu Sa'id had appointed him as his heir, but that he was deposed in 923 by Abu Tahir. Another tradition, by the Kufan anti-Isma'ili polemicist Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Rizam al-Ta'i, reports that Abu Sa'id had always intended for Abu Tahir to succeed him, and had named Sa'id only as regent, and that Sa'id voluntarily relinquished power to his brother in 917/918. Following his death, Abu Sa'id became the object of veneration by his followers. It was believed that he would return to lead them, to the point that a saddled horse was kept at the entrance of his tomb. The state he founded survived until its overthrow by the Uyunids in the 1070s, and as late as the mid-11th century the Bahrayni Qarmatians called themselves Ab≈´ Sa øƒ´dƒ´s after him.

During World War I, the battalion was raised in 1915 as part of the Australian Imperial Force, attached to the 5th Brigade, of the 2nd Division. It was sent initially to Gallipoli, where it suffered many casualties before it was withdrawn from the line and sent to France and Belgium, where it served at the Western Front as part of the Australian Corps and took part in most of the major battles between 1916 and 1918. The battalion's last engagement of the war was at Montbrehain in October 1918 and it was disbanded in April 1919. After the war, the battalion was re-raised as a part-time force in the Sydney area. It was briefly amalgamated with the 51st Battalion in 1935‚Äì1936, but the two units were later unlinked and re-raised as separate units. During World War II, the battalion served in a garrison role in Australia and was disbanded in 1944 without having seen active service overseas. HistoryWorld War I= Raised as an Australian Imperial Force (AIF) battalion in March 1915 as part of the 5th Brigade of the 2nd Division, the 18th Battalion was formed at Liverpool, New South Wales. Following training, the battalion was sent to Egypt, and from there to Gallipoli in August 1915 as part of a wave of reinforcements that arrived after the initial landing.. There it participated in the costly August Offensive, during which it was sent to Damakjelik Bair.. From there, they played a mainly defensive role in the campaign, apart from playing a minor role in the attack on Hill 60, Beginning the battle with about 1,000 men, by the end the battalion could muster only 386.. Following that, the battalion was placed in reserve behind the 5th Brigade's positions between Walker's Ridge and Quinn's Post,. until they were withdrawn in December 1915. Their main area of responsibility during this time was Courtney's Post. After returning to Egypt, the AIF underwent a period of reorganisation as it was expanded from two infantry battalions to five prior to their transfer to Europe.. As the battalion was rebuilt, further training was undertaken before it was sent to France, arriving there in late March 1916. For the next two- and-a-half years they participated in most of the main battles fought by the Australians on the Western Front. Their first major action came at Pozi√®res in mid-1916 as part of the wider Battle of the Somme, being committed twice in July and August. In late August, the 18th was withdrawn to Belgium to recover, before returning to the Somme in October. For the rest of 1916, the battalion undertook defensive duties along the front, although they were not involved in any major attacks. The following year, the Germans shortened their lines and withdrew to the Hindenburg Line, after which the 18th Battalion took part in the fighting around Warlencourt in February 1917 as the Allies sought to follow up the German withdrawal. A brief advance followed before they came up against the forward positions of the Hindenburg Line. In May, the 18th Battalion was committed to the Second Battle of Bullecourt before moving again to Belgium where they saw further action around the Ypres Salient at Menin Road in September and Poelcappelle in October before settling down for the winter. A Stokes mortar from the 18th Battalion in action near Ploegsteert, January 1918 In early 1918, following the collapse of the Russian resistance on the Eastern Front, the Germans had been able to transfer many troops to the Western Front. As a result, in March, they launched their Spring Offensive. With the Germans making rapid gains, Australian units, including the 18th Battalion, were moved south from Belgium where they had spent the winter and they were thrown into the line to help blunt the attack around Villers- Bretonneux, which lay before the strategically important rail hub at Amiens. After this, in August the Allies were able to launch their own offensive, which subsequently became known as the Hundred Days Offensive and ultimately brought about the Armistice. During this offensive, the battalion fought at Amiens and Mont St Quentin before assaulting \\"Beaurevoir Line\\", which was the third (and final) fortified line of the Hindenburg Line. There, at Montbrehain, on 3 October 1918, Lieutenant Joseph Maxwell earned the battalion's first and only Victoria Cross in what was ultimately to prove their last engagement of the war. After this the units of the Australian Corps, severely depleted due to heavy casualties and limited reinforcements, were withdrawn from the line upon the insistence of the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes,. for rest and re-organisation and did not return to the front before the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. Following the end of hostilities, the demobilisation process began and as personnel were repatriated back to Australia, the battalion's numbers dwindled until the battalion was finally disbanded on 11 April 1919, while it was still in Belgium. Throughout the course of the war, the battalion suffered 3,513 casualties, of which 1,060 were killed. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, one Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, five Distinguished Service Orders, 35 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 44 Military Crosses, 158 Military Medals, seven Meritorious Service Medals and 39 Mentions in Despatches. The 18th Battalion received 20 battle honours for its war service. =Subsequent service= Australia's part- time military force was re-organised in 1921 to perpetuate the numerical designations, battle honours and formations of the AIF.. The 18th Battalion was re-raised in the Kuring-Gai region of Sydney, as part of the Citizens Forces, at this time drawing personnel from 17th and 18th Infantry Regiments. In 1927, when territorial designations were adopted, it assumed the title of the \\"Kuring-Gai Regiment\\". On 1 July 1935, the 18th Battalion was amalgamated with the 51st Battalion to form the 18th/51st Battalion. This lasted until 1 October 1936, when the two battalions were unlinked and re-formed as separate units.Festberg 1972, p. 80. At the outbreak of World War II, the battalion was based at Willoughby, New South Wales, where it formed part of the 8th Brigade, attached to the 1st Division within the 2nd Military District. By April 1941, the battalion formed part of the 9th Brigade. In November 1942, the battalion's machine gun company was detached and in conjunction with several other Militia machine gun companies, it was used to form the 6th Machine Gun Battalion. Throughout the war, the battalion remained in Australia, where it conducted garrison duties before being disbanded on 20 October 1944. Over the course of the war, it was assigned variously to the 8th, 9th, 28th and 1st Brigades. Following the conclusion of the demobilisation process, Australia's part-time military force was re-raised under the guise of the Citizens Military Force in 1948.. At this time, the 18th Battalion was re-raised, albeit as an amalgamated unit with the 17th Battalion to form the 17th/18th Battalion (The North Shore Regiment). In 1960, the Australian Army was reorganised along Pentropic lines,. and the 17th/18th Battalion became 'B' Company, 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (2 RNSWR). When the Pentropic divisional structure was abandoned in 1965, however, the 17th Battalion was reformed in its own right as the 17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, but the 18th Battalion was not re-raised.

He is also the current President of the Lebanese Kataeb party. Early life and education Samy was born into a prominent Maronite Catholic family in Lebanon on 3 December 1980. He is the son of former Lebanese President and former Phalange leader Amine Gemayel and Joyce Gemayel. His older brother, Pierre, was a Member of Parliament and the Minister of Industry until his assassination on 21 November 2006. His grandfather, Pierre Gemayel, founded the Phalange party in 1936. Sami is also the nephew of the assassinated former President-elect Bachir Gemayel. Gemayel received a bachelor of arts degree in law in 2003 and a master's degree in public law in 2005 from Saint Joseph University in Beirut. Early political activism Samy Gemayel was the head of the student movement of the Phalange Party as a law student at Saint Joseph University from 1999 to the early 2000s. His policies were considered more nationalistic than those of his father Amine Gemayel, and in 2006 he launched the Loubnanouna (Our Lebanon) Movement, separate from the Phalange Party. Sami's movement aimed at reuniting the politically divided Lebanese Christians. He is an outspoken critic of both Hezbollah's military wing and the Michel Aoun-led Free Patriotic Movement, the main Christian party in opposition to March 14 Movement. In a 2006 interview following the 2006 Lebanon War, Gemayel accused Hezbollah of wanting \\"to implement an Islamic state in Lebanon,\\" also adding that \\"Hezbollah is functioning as [its own] state: political power, economical power, social allegiance, military power, a region where it imposes its laws... all the attributes of a state.\\" He expressed his hope that Lebanese Christians would reunite under similar political stances, and stressed that the Phalange is open to all Christians. After the assassination of his brother Pierre Amine Gemayel in November 2006, Samy rejoined the Phalange Party to head the Phalangist Youth and Student Council and later, became the coordinator of the Phalange Central Committee. Political career Early in 2009, the Phalange announced that it struck a deal with Michel Murr for a political alliance in the Matn District in the Lebanese parliamentary elections that were to be held in June. They declared that Samy Gemayel would run for a seat in parliament as one of two Phalangists hoping to represent the Matn District of Lebanon, the other being Elie Karami. On 3 April 2009, Sami officially announced his candidacy and again stated that \\"Christian unity is the only solution\\" to Lebanon's problems. After his nomination in February 2009, Samy had constantly stressed the importance of all Lebanese voting in the upcoming elections. On 21 February, he stated that the Christian voters would make the difference in a choice between \\"Lebanon, the country of Resistance and the main state to be affected by the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict or Lebanon, the non-aligned and democratic country.\\" Gemayel has also stated that the Phalange would not make any agreement or reconcile with the Free Patriotic Movement as long as the latter continued to stand in support of Hezbollah bearing arms. Following a long count, Sami Gemayel was elected into parliament. Of seven seats possible to win in the Matn District, one went to Sami, one to ally Michel Murr, and the remaining to the Free Patriotic Movement led by Michel Aoun. Following the 2020 Beirut explosions, he resigned along with two other members of the Kataeb Party on 8 August 2020. Political views In May 2010, he criticized Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah, asking him if he thought that all Lebanese who shared the Phalange's views were \\"Israeli agents.\\" On 8 September 2010, he claimed that \\"he is not ashamed that his party dealt with Israel against Syria at a certain stage.\\" Sami insisted that given the situation in which they were facing both PLO militiamen and Syrian troops, the Phalange had no choice but to accept aid from Israel. At the same time, he stated that any Lebanese foreign collaboration that took place since the end of the civil war in 1990 is not justifiable and that those who did collaborate should be considered traitors and foreign agents.

The film was released in the United States as Sheba and The Terror of Sheba and subsequently re-titled The Graveyard for VHS release in the 1980s. The film's promotional taglines are: *Warning: this film is NOT for the squeamish *The horror of a twisted mind! *Now it's David's turn to get even‚Ä¶ and he has a very special treat for his mother. Plot summary Carrie Masters (Lana Turner) is a crippled, wealthy, bitter woman who takes pleasure in tormenting her young son David (Mark Weavers). She blames him for her crippled leg and, in bizarre and horrifying ways, exacts her revenge by dominating him. Years later, a 24-year-old David (Ralph Bates) returns home with his wife Janie (Suzan Farmer) and their newborn child, but he is still subject to his mother's evil influence. When she is involved in two terrifying deaths, David's mind snaps; although he is already mentally twisted by Carrie's treatment, David becomes completely insane and swears vengeance on his mother for his years of hate and resentment.

British Horror Film Locations, retrieved 21 July 2015. Reception Persecution was a commercial and critical failure and widely panned by critics. In its review of the film, Variety wrote: \\"The old-fashioned meller is riddled with ho-hum and sometimes laughably trite scripting. Also, very tame in the shock horror department. Under the circumstances, Turner's performance has reasonable poise. There isn't much animation to Ralph Bates as the grown-up edition of the tormented son\\". Richard Schleib in The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Movie Review wrote: \\"Turner hams it up and she and Ralph Bates have fun playing games with one another. Don Chaffey‚Äôs pace is slow moving, despite occasionally inventive photography and some offbeat editing. The story is confusing ‚Äì by the end, one is never sure who David‚Äôs real father was. The catty premise is not terribly interesting and the script trades in some unconvincingly histrionic psychology. The one show stealer is the sultry seductive Olga Georges- Picot.\\"Shelley, Peter. Grande Dame Guignol Cinema: A History of Hag Horror from Baby Jane to Mother, retrieved 21 July 2015.

It is in the parish of Llangynfelyn. The village is known for the Bedd Taliesin, a hilltop Bronze Age tumulus which is traditionally regarded as the site for the grave of the Welsh bard, Taliesin. A manuscript in the hand of 18th century literary forgerer Iolo Morganwg claimed he was the son of Saint Henwg of Llanhennock but this is contrary to every other fact and tradition. It is listed as a Historic Monument It is a round-kerb cairn with a cist about 2m long. The capstone has fallen; the side stone slabs are more or less in their original positions. The cairn has no proven connection with the historical Taliesin, a 6th-century poet esteemed by the poets of medieval Wales as the founder of the Welsh poetic tradition whose surviving work includes praise poems to the rulers of the early Welsh kingdom of Powys and Rheged, in the Hen Ogledd (modern northern England/southern Scotland). He became a figure of legend in medieval Wales and his association with Elffin ap Gwyddno, son of the king of the fabled Cantre'r Gwaelod, off the coast of Ceredigion, may account for the monument's name. The village was established in the 1820s, when a number of houses were built on former common land that had been sold to fund the drainage of Cors Fochno. The village then further expanded in the 1860s to house the families of miners working in the lead mines in the area. Prior to the building in the 1820s there were only a few scattered houses along the turnpike road, and the settlement was known as 'Tafarn Fach' (Small Tavern) - the story locally was that the new name was chosen as a more respectable one, given the religious sensibilities of the time. The village includes a chapel (Rehoboth) and a community hall (Llanfach). The village primary school (Ysgol Llangynfelyn) was closed by Ceredigion Council in 2016.

It adds a series of analyses that are particularly useful for RF circuits to the basic capabilities of Spectre. SpectreRF was first released in 1996 and was notable for three reasons. First, it was arguably the first RF simulator in that it was the first to be designed for large bipolar and CMOS RF circuits; it used shooting methods as its base algorithm; and it pioneered the use of Krylov subspace methods. The use of shooting methods gave SpectreRF remarkable robustness and the Krylov methods gave it capacity that was roughly 100 times greater than existing simulators at the time. Previously such simulators were designed to simulate very small GaAs integrated circuits and hybrids. These simulators were based on harmonic balance and could reliably simulate circuits with tens of transistors whereas SpectreRF could simulate circuits with thousands of transistors. SpectreRF added the Periodic Steady State and Periodic small-signal analyses to Spectre. The Periodic Steady-State or PSS analysis directly computed the periodic steady-state response of a circuit. The periodic small-signal analyses use the periodic steady-state solution as a periodically time-varying operating point and linearize the circuit about that operating point and then computes the response of the circuit to small perturbation sources. Effectively they build a periodically time-varying linear model of the circuit. This is significant as periodically time-varying linear models, unlike the time-invariant linear models used by the traditional small-signal analyses (AC and noise) exhibit frequency conversion. SpectreRF pioneered a variety of periodic small-signal analyses, including periodic AC (pac), periodic noise (pnoise), periodic transfer function (pxf), periodic s-parameter (psp) and periodic stability (pstb). After its introduction, SpectreRF quickly became the dominant simulator for RF integrated circuits, and was instrumental in establishing Spectre as the most popular circuit simulator for integrated circuits. Eventually the dominance of SpectreRF faded as the use of Krylov subspace methods propagated to other simulators, particularly those based on harmonic balance. SpectreRF now provides harmonic balance in addition to shooting methods, both of which are accelerated using Krylov subspace methods. SpectreRF was developed by Ken Kundert, Jacob White, and Ricardo Telichevesky.

History Red Bank High School began as an extension to the one-year-old Red Bank Junior High School in 1938. Recognizing that the original plans for the school serving grades 7, 8, and 9 were not fulfilling the needs of the Red Bank community and surrounding areas, the Hamilton County Board of Education added a 10th grade in 1938, an 11th grade in 1939, and finally a 12th grade in 1940. During the three years of movement toward being a complete high school, Red Bank High School created its unique identity in the area. Blue and white were chosen as the school‚Äôs colors, and the Lion was selected as the mascot. A school newspaper was created called the Blue and White, while the yearbook was named the Roar. The school's colors of blue and white, with the addition of red from the name, creates the three colors the American flag consists of, which is the reason why those two colors were chosen. The first senior class, consisting of 50 students, graduated in 1941. Due to the booming population growth in the area of the school, the Board of Education built several additions to the original building. Additions in 1939, 1944, and 1955 not only opened up new classrooms but also provided an auditorium, a band room, a music room, and athletic facilities. With the opening of a new Red Bank Junior High School in 1960, grades 7 ‚Äì 9 were removed from Red Bank High School, opening up much more space for the increasing school population and for a much needed home economics department. During the 1970 ‚Äì 1971 school year, a new cafeteria, study hall, and gymnasium were added and the old cafeteria space was renovated for use by the JROTC department. Recognizing that the limited acreage of the campus on Dayton Boulevard prohibited further growth, Red Bank High School changed campuses with Red Bank Junior High School in the summer of 1982. The new campus on Morrison Springs Road offered 54 acres of space for new growth and development. Four new additions to the campus have provided valuable facilities. In 1982, a wing was built to house the JROTC department, and in 1983 a new football stadium was completed. Then in 1986 a wing was built to accommodate the move of the 9th grade back into the Red Bank High School student body, and in 1991 a wing was opened with a new gymnasium, cafeteria, conference room, and library, as well as offices and classrooms. Academics RBHS has a student enrollment that fluctuates between 725-800. Red Bank High School has won state championships in wrestling, football, volleyball, and softball. Red Bank High School offers various programs for the students. Red Bank High School was named a National School of Excellence in 1993.

It is made by heating whole bulbs of garlic (Allium sativum) over the course of several weeks, a process that results in black cloves. The taste is sweet and syrupy with hints of balsamic vinegar or tamarind. Black garlic's popularity has spread around the world as it has become a sought-after ingredient used in both home-cooking and high-end cuisine. HistoryProduction Black garlic is made when heads of garlic are aged under specialized conditions of heat and humidity. Bulbs are kept in a humidity-controlled environment from 80 to 90% at temperatures that range from for 15 to 90 days (typically 85%, 70 ¬∞C, 40 days). There are no additives, preservatives, or burning of any kind. The enzymes that give fresh garlic its sharpness break down. Those conditions are thought to facilitate the Maillard reaction, the chemical process that produces new flavour compounds responsible for the deep taste of seared meat and fried onions. The cloves turn black and develop a sticky date-like texture. Bacterial endophytes capable of fermentation and with a strong ability of heat resistance have been identified in common garlic and black garlic. These may have relevance to black garlic production. Culinary uses In black garlic, the garlic flavor is softened such that it almost or entirely disappears depending on the length of time it is heated. Additionally, its flavor is dependent on that of the fresh garlic that was used to make it. Garlic with a higher sugar content produces a milder, more caramel-like flavor, whereas garlic with a low sugar content produces a sharper, somewhat more acidic flavor, similar in character to tomato paste. Burnt flavors may also be present if the garlic was heated for too long at too high a temperature or not long enough: during heating, the garlic turns black in color well before the full extent of its sweetness is able to develop. Black garlic can be eaten alone, on bread, or used in soups, sauces, crushed into a mayonnaise or simply tossed into a vegetable dish. A vinaigrette can be made with black garlic, sherry vinegar, soy, a neutral oil, and Dijon mustard. Its softness increases with water content. Unlike the vegetable from which it is made, white garlic, black garlic has a very subtle and muted flavor that is easily overpowered. Because of its delicate and muted flavors, a considerably larger amount of black garlic must be used in comparison to white garlic in order to achieve a similar level of intensity. Additionally, black garlic cannot be used in place of white garlic. If a garlic flavor is desired in addition to the flavor of black garlic, then fresh garlic must be added. One method to release the subtle flavors of black garlic is to knead a peeled clove between the fingers until its structure is thoroughly broken down and then to dissolve the resulting paste in a small amount of hot water. This produces a dark brown, coffee-colored suspension of the fibrous black garlic particles in a solution that carries most of its flavor, acidity, and sugar content. This liquid may then be added to foods that are otherwise neutral in flavor (like, for example, mashed potatoes) to better showcase the flavor of the black garlic. Likely owing to its harsh and concentrated odor, the potent reputation of fresh garlic, and the association of Maillard reactions with the browning of meat, it is a common misconception that black garlic has a \\"meaty\\" flavor. It does not. It is commonly eaten on its own by enthusiasts, who sometimes liken the flavor to a savory, slightly acidic caramel candy or to sweet tamarind fruit. The most prominent flavor it imparts is sweetness when used in high concentrations and when used in low concentrations, provided that there are no other flavors to compete with that of the black garlic, the flavor and aroma are somewhat similar to those of instant coffee, though without any bitterness. In popular culture It gained USA television attention when it was used in battle redfish on Iron Chef America, episode 11 of season 7 (on Food Network), and in an episode of Top Chef New York (on Bravo), where it was added to a sauce accompanying monkfish. In the United Kingdom, where it made its TV debut on the BBC's Something for the Weekend cooking and lifestyle program in February 2009, farmer Mark Botwright, owner of the South West Garlic Farm, claimed to have developed a process for preserving garlic after finding a 4000-year-old Korean recipe for \\"black garlic\\". Television show Bob‚Äôs Burgers Season 5 episode 5 ‚ÄúBest Burger‚Äù highlights black garlic as a key ingredient for Bob and Linda's entry in a cooking competition during a food festival.

It runs southeast from Pearl Street to South Street, a distance of two blocks (585.6 feet). The entire length of the road is a pedestrian street, though before 2013, the block north of Water Street carried vehicular traffic.

History  Coenties Slip is mentioned in the opening page of Herman Melville's Moby Dick: \\"Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see? ...\\" Although surrounded by skyscrapers, a row of buildings from the 19th century still stands along the block that is open to vehicles, and these buildings are in active use by small businesses. The construction of these high rise buildings resulted in the removal of the blocks between Water Street and Front Street, and between Front Street and South Street. Part of 55 Water Street and part of the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial are built on land that was once part of Coenties Slip. Both Coenties Slip and Coenties Alley are named after Conraet Ten Eyck and his wife Antje. Arthur Bartlett Maurice describes Coenties Slip in a 1935 book Magical City: ‚ÄúAt the head of the Slip, where the Elevated road winds its way along Pearl Street on its way from South Ferry to Hanover Square, stood the Stadt Huys of Dutch days, the first City Hall on Manhattan Island. After the Erie Canal was finished in 1825, the slip, then only a tiny corner of what it is today, harbored many of the canal boats that plied along the new waterway connecting the Atlantic and the Great Lakes. Ten years later the land was filled in, bringing the Slip down to a new water‚Äôs edge on South Street. New buildings went up, only to be destroyed within a few months in the great fire of December, 1835.‚Äù In 2010, the Downtown Alliance proposed upgrades to Coenties Slip and Whitehall Street plazas. Coenties Slip between Water and Pearl Streets was closed, painted, and converted into a pedestrian plaza in 2013. However, a $23 million permanent upgrade stalled because of a lack of funding. In 2018, New York City Department of Transportation announced permanent upgrades as part of the Water Street upgrade project.  Coenties Alley  Coenties Alley, formerly City Hall Lane, is an historic pedestrian walkway that leads inland from Coenties Slip. The alley runs south from South William Street to Pearl Street, and is the cut-off for Stone Street's discontinuity. In the 17th century, New Amsterdam's City Hall stood at Coenties Alley on the north side of Pearl Street, just to the north of Coenties Slip.  Artists of Coenties Slip  For a time in the mid-20th century, Coenties Slip also was the home for a group of ground-breaking American artists. From the late 1950s to the early 1960s, the artists Chryssa, Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin, Lenore Tawney, Fred Mitchell and Jack Youngerman lived in this Lower Manhattan location overlooking the East River. These artists were among a group of intellectuals, writers, filmmakers, and poets who lived and worked in the old seaport at the lower tip of Manhattan called the Coenties Slip. Distinguished by its views of the Brooklyn Bridge and its position between land and sea, the slip served as an important inspiration for the artists, who frequently incorporated aquatic themes into their early work. Selections of their early works were shown in an exhibition, entitled \\"Between Land and Sea: Artists of the Coenties Slip\\" at the Menil Collection in Houston, TX, which ran from April 14, 2017 to August 27, 2017. The exhibition featured 27 aesthetically distinct works, united by the artists‚Äô desire to locate new ways of thinking about abstraction. Curated by Michelle White, the exhibition drew heavily from the Menil's holdings and was augmented by important loans from private collections in Houston and the Lenore Tawney Foundation, New York.

Leslie gives Jesse his present: an art set which includes all the colors and different sized brushes. Jesse is shocked but loves the present. Jesse has an unspoken infatuation with his music teacher, Miss Edmunds, which is the reason why Jesse does not invite Leslie to the museum with him and Miss Edmunds. 2007 film=Depiction= Knowing that Jesse loves drawing, Leslie gives him an art set for his birthday.

He also has a crush on Miss Edmunds (played by Zooey DeschanelRyan Parsons, \\"Bridge to Terabithia One-Sheet?\\" on CanMag (August 23, 2006).). Leslie's crush on Jesse is hinted in several scenes, such as her reaction to the gift of Prince Terrien by hugging him. He also falls in love with her the last time he sees her, though it could be argued that seeing her wave goodbye to him from afar, Jessie has a sudden foreshadowing of her death. In the wake of Leslie's passing, her father reveals to Jesse that Leslie loved him, and that he was the best friend she ever had. Jesse then comes to realize how much he cared for her and that he really did love her, after which he blames himself for her death due to not inviting her to go to the museum with him.

In the 2007 movie, this same role was portrayed by actress AnnaSophia Robb. She is based on Lisa Hill. Real life inspiration Debbie Elliott reports that \\"Katherine Paterson was inspired to write The Bridge to Terabithia after her son's childhood friend Lisa Hill was struck and killed by lightning.\\"Debbie Elliott, 'Terabithia' Inspired by True Fictional biography Leslie is depicted as being tomboyish, kind, sweet, friendly, free-spirited, cheerful, daring, strong, intelligent, athletic, and clever. She is gifted with imagination and creativity, and is a fast runner, claiming the position of the fastest racer in the fifth grade, a title normally intended for boys, to the irritation of Jesse. Her family had relocated to Lark Creek during summertime at the start of the book, but after starting school she is socially ostracized for her utter tomboyishness, non-conformism to certain standards, and eccentricities. However, she soon gains the friendship of Jesse Aarons and, later, that of the bully Janice Avery, after learning of the girl's abused background. Leslie's parents are portrayed as being carefree and relaxed, but criticized for their hippie lifestyle and dress. They permit their daughter to address them by their given names and demonstrate great creativity when redecorating their home, but abstain from television. As a sanctuary from the burdens faced in reality, Leslie and Jesse decide to design an imaginary fantasy kingdom that they call Terabithia, over which they reign as king and queen. They craft a small wooden shelter in which to hide when visiting this refuge accessed by a rope swing hanging over a creek. They frequently rely on the comforts of Terabithia to escape from daily life, adopting a puppy named Prince Terrien (abbreviated as P.T.) to join them on their fictional adventures. Although the bond between Jesse and Leslie intensifies over time, Leslie dies after the rope swing she and Jesse use to access Terabithia snaps and she drowns in the creek. This leaves her family and only friend devastated, leading to the Burke family's decision to relocate to their former residence prior to Lark Creek. Jesse's little sister May Belle adopts the position as Queen/Princess of Terabithia after Leslie's sudden and tragic death, ending the novel with the indication that all will be restored. Fashion In the 1977 book, Leslie went to school the first day wearing a T-shirt and cut-offs. In the 2007 movie, Leslie's clothes were outrageous and colorful, primarily because of the time alteration between the novel and film. She also has on armwarmers.

Leslie Burke is also the title of a song by Austin, Texas pop band The Sour Notes, inspired by Leslie's rope swing accident while entering Terabithia. Other characters * Joyce Ann Aarons ‚Äì Jesse's baby sister. May Belle thinks Joyce Ann is \\"nothing but a baby\\". She is played by Grace Brannigan in the 2007 film. * May Belle Aarons ‚Äì May Belle is one of Jesse's younger sisters. She is described as the only one of Jesse's siblings with whom he feels comfortable. However, because she is six years to Jesse's ten, she does not fit the mould of the ideal confidante to Jesse, leaving him still desperate for companionship. She clearly admires him from the beginning, and like him feels that she does not have a place in the family. She is the first of his sisters to learn about Terabithia, and becomes princess after Leslie dies.The last sentence of the novel,\\"Shhh, yes. There's a rumor going around that the beautiful girl arriving today might be the queen they've been waiting for.\\" She is the only one Jesse allows to enter into his world and the only one who has any sort of empathy for, or acceptance of, Jesse in his family. She is played by Jennifer Matichuk in the 1985 film and Bailee Madison in the 2007 film (in which a scene from the book of her in her underwear was changed so she wore pajamas for it) * Ellie and Brenda Aarons ‚Äì Ellie and Brenda Aarons are Jess's two older sisters. They primarily exist as secondary static characters, or characters who do not grow or change as a result of the events of a story. They are never mentioned separately within the novel and are never portrayed in a positive light. From the beginning of the story, they continually ask for favors from their mother, and pocket money which she cannot afford to give them. With sufficient whining, they know how to get their way with their parents, as by asking for five dollars to pay for school supplies from their mother by saying that their father promised that they could have the money. Being the elder of the two and the eldest child in the family, Ellie develops the ideas of their ideas. Both have an incredible desire not to have anything to do with Jess specifically, but with all of their younger siblings more broadly. At the climax of the story, when Jess learns of Leslie's death, Brenda is the one who tells him of it. The fact that Brenda is the one who breaks the news to Jesse in the novel only serves to increase the shock. Ellie is played by Emma Fenton in the 2007 film. Brenda is played by Sharon Holownia in the 1985 film and Devon Wood in the 2007 film. * Janice Avery ‚Äì The school bully at Lark Creek. Janice is very overweight and tends to become offended when people tease her for being so. She has a crush on Willard Hughes, which Jesse uses to trick her. Janice's father beats her and she secretly smokes marijuana. She was betrayed by her friends and comforted by a sympathetic Leslie. She is played by Bridget Ryan in the 1985 film and Lauren Clinton in the 2007 film. The giant troll in Terabithia is based on her. * Miss Edmunds ‚Äì The somewhat unconventional and controversial music teacher, whom Jesse greatly admires. She invites Jess to go to the Smithsonian Museum, which leads Leslie to go to Terabithia by herself. As a result, Leslie is alone when she falls from the rope and drowns. She is played by Annette O'Toole in the 1985 film and Zooey Deschanel in the 2007 film. In the 1985 film, Mrs. Edmunds seems to take the role of Mrs. Myers. She tells Jess the story of a relative dying after Leslie dies instead of Mrs. Myers, and she, instead of Mrs. Myers, gives the homework assignment of watching a show on television. * Prince Terrien ‚Äì A puppy that Jess gave Leslie as a Christmas present. He is the guardian and court jester of Terabithia. Leslie's parents take him as they leave the community forever at the end of the novel. * Gary Fulcher ‚Äì A cocky kid. Jess and Gary see each other as bitter rivals; how long this has been the case is unknown. Gary and Jess's rivalry led to Jess's practicing running all summer long, in anticipation of the new school year, wherein Jess hoped to be the fastest kid in the fifth grade. Both are beaten at this by Leslie. He is played by Tyler Popp in the 1985 film and Elliot Lawless in the 2007 film. * Mrs. Myers ‚Äì Jess and Leslie's 5th grade teacher, who is given the nickname \\"Monster Mouth Myers\\" by some due to her being quite strict. She thinks highly of Leslie, but is secretly made fun of by Jess and Leslie. In the 1985 film, she does not make an appearance. In the 2007 film, she is played by Jen Wolfe. * Bill and Judy Burke ‚Äì Leslie's parents; novelists who come to the story's location for purposes of their work. Unlike most of the locals, they do not watch television and do not believe that all who ignore or reject Christianity are subject to damnation. They move away after their daughter's death.

A cyborg clone of the hero Thor, Ragnar√∂k has a similar appearance and abilities but uses them in opposition to the established heroes. Publication history Ragnar√∂k first appeared in Civil War #3 (July 2006), and was created by Mark Millar and Steve Mcniven. Ragnar√∂k began appearing as a regular character in the Dark Avengers series, beginning with Dark Avengers #175. Fictional character biography When the real Thor was missing in action and presumed dead, Tony Stark took one of his hairs, which he had retained from the first meeting of the Avengers. He helped Reed Richards and Hank Pym clone the Asgardian DNA within while fusing the cloned DNA with Stark Industries technology. This resulted in the creation of a new cyborg clone of Thor. The clone was put into action during the superhero Civil War, sent to battle anti-registration heroes.Mark Millar. Civil War #3 (September 2006). Marvel Comics. The heroes were easily brought down by the cyborg clone, but Hercules helped the heroes to escape. The battle got out of hand when the clone murdered Goliath by blasting him through the chest and set out to kill the rest of the anti-registration heroes. Reed Richards deactivated the cyborg with a vocal code and later operated on his brain to prevent such a mishap from happening again.Mark Millar. Civil War #4 (October 2006). Marvel Comics. The cyborg clone of Thor returned during the final battle between the pro- and anti-registration heroes. He faced off against Hercules and Storm who defeat the cyborg clone by ramming his own hammer into his skull claiming it was an insult to the Odinson and yelling at the cyborg clone \\"Thou art no Thor.\\"Mark Millar. Civil War #7 (January 2007). Marvel Comics. The clone's remains were taken to Camp Hammond and stored in the laboratory for experimentation. Baron Von Blitzschlag tells Pym he admires his work, showing the Thor clone to demonstrate this. During the \\"Secret Invasion\\" storyline, it was revealed that the Hank Pym who helped create the cyborg clone was actually the clone of a Skrull impostor named Criti Noll who had placed a program into the cloned Thor's remains as a contingency in case of the invasion's failure. Unless a special code which only the Skrull knew was input every eighteen days, the cyborg clone would reawaken. With the clone of Criti Noll's death during the Invasion, this event came to pass during the \\"Dark Reign\\" storyline. Malfunctioning and believing himself to be the true Thor, the cyborg clone believed he had been imprisoned in Camp Hammond. He threatened Baron Von Blitzschlag into returning his hammer to him and set out to destroy the Initiative. The cyborg clone swiftly defeated the Initiative's forces and the New Warriors, who had arrived to help. During that time, he took on the name Ragnar√∂k (which the Baron had called him, declaring that he would \\"bring the end of all that is\\"). Ragnar√∂k was only stopped when Von Blitzschlag, whose electrical powers made him immune to Ragnar√∂k's lightning, arrived on the battlefield. The Baron showed Ragnar√∂k footage of his creation and showed him that the real Thor had returned and had formed a new Asgard above the city. Disgusted by what he perceived as Asgard's \\"indignity\\", Ragnar√∂k left Camp Hammond to confront the real Thor.

This includes super-strength, extensive combat knowledge, godly stamina, high resistance to physical injury, immunity to all Earthly diseases, and superhuman agility and reflexes. Ragnar√∂k's hammer, though not the enchanted Mjolnir, is constructed of a vibranium and adamantium alloy. The hammer is able to absorb and discharge lightning, like the true Mjolnir, and has circuitry within its head, which allows Ragnar√∂k to direct it mentally.

Biography  In 1605, Cunningham became captain of the 60-ton Danish naval ship . Along with the 70-ton and the 20-ton , the ships were directed by the Danish King, Christian IV, to re-establish contact with the Norse settlements in Greenland, the first of three annual expeditions sent between 1605 and 1607. Cunningham served as the chief commander, following the piloting of James Hall and commanding Godske Lindenov in the L√∏ven and John Knight in the Katten. During the Lindenov expedition of 1606, Cunningham served as the captain of the L√∏ven under Lindenov's command. In 1615, Cunningham was among the commanders aboard the naval expedition under Gabriel Kruse sent to Spitsbergen to demand tolls from foreign whalers. There, Cunningham encountered Robert Fotherby, Thomas Edge, and Adriaen Block. The following year, he captained the Gabriel as part of the naval expedition under J√∏rgen Daa sent to rid the coasts of Norway, the Faeroes, and Iceland of illegal whalers and pirates. In 1619, Cunningham was made Governor of Finnmark in the far north, a post he retained until his death in 1651. There, he presided over 52 witch trials, nine of which afflicted the Sami population.

Connor has been an aide or appointee of several Republican Governors of Texas, including William P. Clements, Jr., George W. Bush, and Rick Perry. Most notably, Connor served as the 104th Secretary of State of Texas under Governor Perry. Connor's tenure in this position was especially noteworthy for his efforts to build strong diplomatic and trade relationships between Texas and foreign countries. Since leaving the Texas Secretary of State's Office, Connor has been active as a consultant, lobbyist, academician, and attorney. His current public service includes positions with The William P. Clements Jr. Center for National Security, Alamo Board of the Texas General Land Office, and Texas State Guard. He remains active internationally and with the diplomatic community in the state of Texas. Background Connor was born and reared in Runnels County, a predominantly rural county near San Angelo, Texas. In 1985, Connor received a B.A. from Texas State University (formerly Southwest Texas State University) in International Studies. Connor also studied abroad at Birkbeck College, University of London. He later attended the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, from which he received his J.D. degree in 1988. He has been board certified in administrative law since 1995. He completed a graduate certificate course from the Texas A&M; University Bush School of Public Service focused on Intelligence Studies. In 2016, Connor received his PhD in history from the University of Texas at Austin with a focus on modern U.S. diplomatic and national security history. Connor was a member of the Delta Epsilon chapter of Sigma Tau Gamma while attending Texas State University. Connor lived in the United Kingdom in 1985. During this time, he served as an analyst for the British Government and was a top aide to the Chairman of the House of Lords Foreign Policy Committee (The Earl of Kimberley) and the Chairman of the Lords Defence Committee (Lord Chalfont). Early political career Connor began his career in American public service as Assistant General Counsel to Governor William Perry Clements, Jr., in 1988. By the time he departed the Governor's office in 1991, Connor had advanced to Deputy General Counsel. In 1991, Connor joined the Texas Department of Agriculture as assistant commissioner and general counsel under then Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry. In 1995, he became general counsel for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, a post he held until 1999. During the 1990s, Connor also served as a member of the State Emergency Communications Commission (appointed by Governor Clements in 1990) and as a member of the Coastal Coordination Committee (appointed by Governor George W. Bush in 1995). After more than a decade in government, Connor took a break from the public sector and accepted a position with the Austin office of the international law and lobby firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld (1999‚Äì2001). Texas Secretary of State‚Äôs Office When Rick Perry became Governor of Texas in January 2001, he tapped Connor to serve as the Deputy Secretary in the office of the Texas Secretary of State. This office, which evolved out of the Secretary of State of the Republic of Texas, has a diverse portfolio that includes supervising elections, serving as chief protocol officer for Texas, acting as the Governor's liaison on border and Mexico affairs, as well as maintaining a variety of corporate and commercial filings. With the departure of Secretary of State Henry Cuellar in October 2001, Connor served four months as Acting Secretary of State until the swearing in of Gwyn Clarkston Shea as Secretary of State in January 2002. Following Shea's swearing-in, Connor resumed his duties as Deputy Secretary of State. Upon Shea's resignation, Governor Perry appointed Connor to be the 104th Secretary of State of Texas.

While there are multiple factors behind the state's increasing prominence in exports, the focused and active promotion of Texas exports by the state's chief international officer played a role. At the beginning of 2005, Connor resigned from the Secretary of State's office to pursue a variety of private sector activities. Private Sector and Later Public Service Shortly after returning to the private sector, Connor cofounded Texas Global, an international strategic consulting firm that advises clients on government affairs, economic development, and corporate growth.

Biography  Family and careers = Enr√≠quez Fr√∂dden was born into an upper middle class family that featured prominently in the political history of the city of Concepci√≥n, Chile. His sister, In√©s Enr√≠quez Fr√∂dden, (1913‚Äì1998) was a lawyer, a leader of the Chilean Radical Party and the first woman elected into the chamber of deputies of the Chilean parliament. His brother, Humberto Enr√≠quez Fr√∂dden, (1907‚Äì1989) was a law professor, Chilean senator and minister of health. Another brother, Hugo Enr√≠quez Fr√∂dden, a physician, held the position of director of the Juan Aguirre Hospital in Santiago and was a distinguished member of the World Health Organization. He entered the medical school of the University of Concepci√≥n in 1930 and graduated in 1936. As a student he received the A. de Ambrossy Prize from the University of Concepci√≥n and the Carlos Mockenberg Prize from the University of Chile ‚Äì both awards were earned for academic excellence. He married the lawyer Raquel Espinoza Townsend with whom he had four children: his youngest child Miguel Enr√≠quez (1944‚Äì1974) followed him into the field of medicine and became the legendary revolutionary figure who founded the MIR and headed the resistance against the Pinochet dictatorship. Enr√≠quez Fr√∂dden served in the Naval Academy from 1938, first as a general practitioner, later he became the director of the Naval Hospital of Talcahuano; ultimately reaching the rank of Captain of the Naval Medical Services Corp. He was also a professor of anatomy and medicine in a number of schools and institutions and he chaired the first Latin American Studies Conference held in Concepci√≥n in 1969. = Popular Unity = Just after the June 29, 1973 tanquetazo, Salvador Allende began to set up a new cabinet to appease his opponents in Congress who were systematically impairing his democratically elected socialist government. Allende began to offer ministerial posts to members of the Christian democratic party - a party that had traditionally represented the middle classes in Chile. By 1973 the Christian democratic party had started to shift to the right and openly show support for a military overthrow of the popular unity government. Letter sent by Eduardo Frei Montalva to Mariano Rumor justifying the military coup of September 11, 1973 that ended Salvador Allende‚Äôs government. (Spanish language) In this climate of open political provocation by his enemies in Congress Allende found it difficult to find someone with the credentials to accept the ministerial portfolio for education because the education reforms he had initiated encountered major obstacles. Allende had promised an overhaul in education in Chile, he massively increased expenditure for public education and had implemented a university reform aimed to facilitate access to higher education for the working class and people from the shanty towns. His reform had started to encounter powerful and staunch opposition from private educational institutions (which was backed by the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and employers' organisations) ‚Äì where the Chilean elite normally enrolled their children to prevent them associating with lower or working- class people. It was within this political context that Enr√≠quez Fr√∂dden accepted the post of minister of education offered to him by Allende - but his ministerial term was cut short by the U.S. backed military overthrow of the Salvador Allende government on September 11, 1973. = Arrest and exile = After the military overthrow of the Popular Unity government and the subsequent death of President Salvador Allende, the new military junta declared members of his government enemies of the state. The military junta moved quickly to remove Allende‚Äôs ministers from the public scene with many imprisoned, exiled and some murdered. Enriquez Fr√∂dden was arrested, imprisoned and then relocated to the remote concentration camp set up in Dawson Island. He was forced into exile with his wife in 1976 and settled in Mexico where he remained for about 14 years. Enriquez Fr√∂dden (with his wife Raquel) spent the rest of their lives campaigning for the disappeared and denouncing the human rights abuses that were committed by the Pinochet regime. Two of his sons Miguel Enr√≠quez, and Edgardo Enriquez along with his ex-son in law Bautista van Schouwen (all three leading members of the MIR) were assassinated in the first period of the Pinochet dictatorship. > ‚Ä¶the old Chilean Army.

The City of Chicago gave the Lincoln Park Conservation Association permission to improve the community in the 1960s.http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/parks.detail/object_id/95E1837E-FE05-42A7-8ACA- FD697E49EA22.cfm In 1974, the Chicago Park District acquired the land and began constructing a park. Lyman Frank Baum, a children's author and the creator of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, was a resident of the Lincoln Park area in the 1890s.http://chicago.citysearch.com/profile/11342331/ Remembering its former resident, fans of The Wizard of Oz would gather in the park for an Oz Festival to honor the famous book, movie, and author every year. The park was officially named Oz Park in 1976, The Oz Park Advisory Council raised the money to put sculptures of the Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, and Dorothy and Toto by sculptor John Kearney in the Park.  Facilities  The park has one walking/biking trail, which is long.http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/walking_trails.home/keyword_park/95E1837E-FE05-42A7-8ACA- FD697E49EA22Oz%20Park.cfm To go along with the Wizard of Oz theme, the park's garden is named \\"The Emerald Garden\\", and the playground is called \\"Dorothy's Playlot.\\" The Emerald Garden (located at the corner of Webster and Larrabee) features flowers through which guests may walk. The Gardens are maintained by the Oz Park Advisory Council, which is a local group of volunteers. Dorothy's Playlot has swings and other climbing equipment on which children can play. While Dorothy is the main character of The Wizard of Oz, the playground is also named after Dorothy Melamerson, a retired Chicago gym teacher.http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/parks.detail/object_id/95e1837e-fe05-42a7-8aca- fd697e49ea22.cfm Melamerson, interested in children's physical well-being, donated enough money in 1994 to create an athletic field with basketball courts, an asphalt volleyball court and tennis courts. In 1996 and 1997, $600,000 of the $900,000 that Melamerson left for park upgrades and to begin youth sports programs went to renovating the Oz Park athletic field. In her honor, the field was named Melamerson Athletic Field. State Representative John Fritchey and Alderman Vi Daley gave the Oz Park Advisory Council funding for improvements to Dorothy's Playlot in 2006. In 2007, Dorothy's Playlot was covered with a rubberized material, and several pieces of play equipment were replaced.http://www.lincolncentral.org/Parks.htm  Sculptures in the park  Shortly after the park had been built and named, the artist John Kearney was approached by an elderly woman who wanted him to create sculptures of the main characters from The Wizard of Oz to decorate the park. She died, however, before the park approved the project four years later. Approximately 30 years later the documents regarding the initial plans were found, and in the early 1990s Kearney was commissioned by the Oz Park Advisory council to create the first of the four statues. He later went on to create a total of four: The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion, The Scarecrow, and Dorothy & Toto.http://chicago.timeout.com/articles/out-there/13331/the-man-behindthe- curtain = Tin Man = Installed in October 1995 the Tin Man sculpture stands at the northeast corner of the park near the intersection of Lincoln, Webster, and Larrabee.

Verification of Complex Analog and RF IC Designs. Proceedings of the IEEE, February 2007. Discussion of analog verification began in 2005 when it started to become recognized that the analog portion of large mixed-signal chips had become so complex that a significant and ever increasing number of these chips were being designed with functional errors in the analog portion that prevented them from operating correctly. Technical details Analog verification is built on the idea that transistor level simulation will always be too slow to provide adequate functional verification. Instead, it is necessary to build simple and efficient models of the blocks that make up the analog portion of the design and use those to verify the design. Those models are typically written in Verilog or Verilog- AMS, but could also be written in VHDL or VHDL-AMS. However, simply using a simple functional model is not sufficient. It is also necessary to build a comprehensive self-checking testbench, that thoroughly exercises the design and compare its response against a previously written specification for the design. Furthermore, this testbench should be applied in turn to both the model and the design. In this case, the design is represented with a transistor-level schematic. If both the model and the design pass all tests, and if the testbench is comprehensive, then this confirms that the model is consistent with the design and that the design is consistent with the specification. Applying a comprehensive testbench to an entire analog functional unit such as an audio codec, power Management IC, Power Management Unit, serdes, or RF transceiver, represented at the transistor level, is impractical. So instead, the verification proceeds hierarchically. One first builds simple models and testbenches for individual blocks. The block-level testbenches are used to confirm that models match the implementation of the blocks and that the implementation matches the block-level specification. Then testbenches are built for the entire analog functional unit, and applied to the top-level schematic of that unit with the blocks represented with their now verified models. To further improve the tests, one can perform mixed-level simulation, where the testbench for the functional unit is applied with one or two blocks at the transistor level, and all others at the model level.

Biography  The son of French-born former matador Michel Lagravere and Mexican Diana Peniche Marenco, Michelito claims to have started bullfighting at the age of five, and credits his love for the sport to being surrounded by bullfighters from an early age. His father runs a bullfighting academy in Mexico and his mother operates a string of bullrings in the Yucat√°n region. Being in close proximity to bullfighting from an early age helped him grow into the sport. However, not everyone in the Michelito household wanted him to become a bullfighter. His grandmother showed him gruesome bullfights on television in order to deter him from the sport when he was just four, but by then he had already joined his father's academy. He has been plying his trade mostly in Mexico and other Latin American countries due to the age restrictions which prevent him from fighting in Spain and also because a child bullfighter in Latin countries can earn around a hundred thousand dollars a year. The minimum age for bullfighters in Spain is 16 years. Michelito was embroiled in a controversy recently for killing six young bulls in a single fight in the bullring of M√©rida, Mexico in a bid to get his name in the Guinness Book of World Records (24 Jan 2009). Animal right activists and child protection groups in the region had objected to such an event but a local judge ruled in its favor after reviewing licenses submitted by Michelito's father. Michelito, who was eleven at the time, killed six calves aged from one to two years old. However, the Guinness World Records said that it was not aware of such an event taking place and as such did not recognize the result. They also made it clear that the organization was against records based on killing or harming of animals. He has also been banned from performing in many French towns after protests by the Anti-Corrida Alliance, who has been campaigning to ban children from the ring in France. They have actively targeted Michelito, who they think, always seeks to end a fight with a kill unlike other child toreros.

It is about three boys‚ÄîTony, 13, Diosel, and Bunso, 11‚Äîstruggling to survive in a crowded Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center in Cebu, alongside adult rapists and murderers. The two street-smart boys paint a picture of the world of children caught between extreme poverty and the law. Ditsi Carolino received the Best Director award for the documentary film Bunso (The Youngest) at the OneWorld 2005 documentary films festival held in Prague, Czech Republic. Bunso is about three boys named Tony (13), Diosel (11), and Bunso (11) who are detained in a city jail. There, they share dingy spaces with adult criminals convicted of rape, murder and drug dealing. OneWorld is an international human rights film festival. The Grand Jury honored Ditsi Carolino along with Pirjo Honkasalo for the film Three Rooms of Melancholia, an entry from Finland. In a statement by the Grand Jury, Carolino was noted for achieving \\"empathy and closeness to her characters who are children held in atrocious conditions in a jail.\\" \\"Filmed from not above or below their level, the film intermingles humor and despair as the children are allowed to speak for themselves as equals.\\" \\"It‚Äôs a miracle that we won,\\" Carolino wrote in an e-mail to UNICEF. The film competed against other works with bigger production budgets. \\"What is also amazing is the very strong responses from the audience. People would stay after a screening and ask how they can help.\\" Directed by Carolino and photographed by Nana Buxani, Bunso was shown in December 2004 on a limited screening. In November 2004, it had its offshore world premiere at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in the Netherlands where it was shown as part of the non-competition Reflecting Images section. Carolino and Buxani teamed up for the third time following their critically acclaimed documentary films, Minsan Lang Sila Bata (They Are Children Only Once) in 1996 and Riles (Railroad) in 2002. Supported by the Consuelo Foundation and UNICEF, Bunso is an advocacy tool that child rights advocates are using to generate support for the passage of the Juvenile Justice Bill. Bunso is making the rounds of international film festival. It had sold-out screenings at the HotDocs Canadian International Film Festival in Toronto in April and at the DokFest International Documentary Film Festival in Munich, Germany in May.
