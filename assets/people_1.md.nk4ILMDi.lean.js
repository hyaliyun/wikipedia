Plot Just before the Bastille Day holiday weekend English secretary, Danielle \\"Dany\\" Lang, types up a document for her advertising agency boss, Michael Caldwell, to take on a business trip to Geneva. On the way to drop off her boss and his wife, Anita, her former room-mate, at the airport, her boss gives her an envelope with her pay in it. After dropping them off Dany impulsively decides to drive to the Riviera for the weekend. When Dany pulls into a small café the owner tries to return a coat to her she claims she left there the day before. At a petrol station Dany is attacked in the toilet and injures her hand. She is bemused as various strangers claim to know her. Heading further south she picks up a hitch-hiker, Philippe and the pair spend the night together. The following day Philippe steals Dany's car prior to reaching the coast. She later finds Philippe in Marseilles where they find a man's body and a gun in the trunk of the car. After Philippe disappears again, Dany visits the home of the dead man in Avignon and oddly finds both some of her clothes and also nude pictures of herself. Returning to the café to reclaim the coat she finds a copy of her pay envelope in one of the coat's pockets. Dany is now completely perplexed by the situation and returns to the dead man's home where her boss, Michael, is waiting for her. He tells Dany that the dead man was one of Anita's lovers, whom she murdered at his home. To frame Dany, they planted evidence and set up various incidents to establish her guilt: the attack in the toilet was committed by Michael, who injured her hand so Anita could wear a bandage and be mistaken for the secretary; and the nude photos had been taken by Anita when they were roommates. When Michael tells Dany he plans to murder her and make it look like a suicide she tells him he won't succeed as she has already sent both pay envelopes to the police.

After several chapters of it appeared in 1855–1857 in Otechestvennye Zapiski, Morskoy Sbornik (Sea Anthology) and Sovremennik, in 1858 the first separate edition of Frigate \\"Pallada\\" came out, to critical and popular acclaim. In its author's lifetime the book has been re-issued five times: in 1862, 1879, 1884 (as part of the Complete Works by Ivan Goncharov edition) and 1886 (twice).Mashinsky, S. Goncharov and His Legacy. Foreword to The Works of I.A.Goncharov in 6 Volumes. Ogonyok's Library. Pravda Publishers. Moscow, 1972. Vol. 1, pp. 3–54  Background Frigate Pallada In the autumn of 1852 Goncharov received an invitation to take part in the Admiral Putyatin-led around the world expedition through England, Africa, Japan, and back to Russia. The flotilla, led by Frigate Pallada under the command of Admiral Ivan Unkovsky, included also corvette Olivutsa (Admiral Nikolai Nazimov), schooner Vostok (Voin Rimsky-Korsakov) and Knyaz Menshikov, a small merchant vessel. The mission's objective (beside that of inspecting the Alaskan shores which had been officially declared to be its purpose) was to establish trade relations with Japan, then a closed and, as far as Russia was concerned, mysterious country. As it was successfully completed, Pallada, unable to enter the Amur River because of her draft, had to overwinter in Imperatorskaya Gavan. Goncharov returned to Saint Petersburg on 25 February 1855, after traveling through Siberia and the Urals, this continental leg of the journey lasting six months. According to Goncharov's commentaries to the first published fragment of the book (\\"Ryukyu Islands\\", Otechestvennye Zapiski, April 1855), he \\"started to keep a diary during the trip and to sent his notes back home to friends occasionally... so as to avoid later questions as: 'where have you been, and what have you seen.'\\" Some of these letters survived and were later published by Literaturnoye Nasledstvo (books 22-24). The logbook that Goncharov kept during the trip has been lost and it remained uncertain to what extent its entries might have been used in the book. While on board the ship, Goncharov started to shape his notes into literary form. In a 26 March 1854 letter he wrote: \\"I started my [literary] studies, and to my amazement experienced such a drive that now my suitcase is stuffed with travellers' notes as a result... [Many of these notes] are in good enough order to be sent to print straight away.\\"Literaturnoye Nasledstvo, Vols. 22-24, p.407 Characters While all of the book's characters were real (and some of them very well known) people, none of them appeared under their real names in the pre-1917 editions. Some were given nicknames (Major general Alexander Khalezov featured here as Oldman, Дед), others, like the author and scientist (later academician) Konstantin Posyet or the ethnographer and scholar Archimandrite Avvakum (Dmitry S. Chestnoy, 1801-1866) were represented by their names' first letters. For decades the readers were unaware of the identities of the true people behind the characters described in the book. Mixing famous people (like Khalezov for whom that was his fourth round-the-world naval trip) with common sailors and caring for human traits, qualities, modes of speech rather than ranks or titles, Goncharov created a vast and curiously democratic gallery of vivid, memorable characters, which gave the book its distinctly 'novelistic' feel, according to the critic and biographer K.N. Tyunkin.Tyunkin, K. N. Commentaries to Frigarte Pallada. The Works of I.A.Goncharov in 6 Volumes. Ogonyok's Library. Pravda Publishers. Moscow, 1972. Vol. 2, pp. 327–342. =Protagonist= Tyunkin warns against automatically associating the book's protagonist with Goncharov himself, seeing him rather as an extenuation of the Ivan Oblomov character. This view is corroborated by Goncharov's December 2, 1852, letter (parts of it were later included in the text of the Frigate \\"Pallada\\") which he jokingly declared to be \\"a foreword... to The 'Around-the- World trip by I. Oblomov'.\\"Literaturnoye Nasledstvo, p.356. In another letter he wrote: \\"I still cherish the hope that one day I'll come to write the chapter called 'The Travellings of Oblomov' and in it will try to show, how it is for a Russian man to search for things in his bags, to learn where this or that object lies, then ten times a day go mad with desperation, sighing for his Mother Russia... And that is exactly what I come through now.\\"Literaturnoye Nasledstvo, p.348 According to Tyunkin, in Frigate \\"Pallada\\" Goncharov came to realize this initial idea and created a \\"brilliantly typical type of narrator, with this peculiar sense of humour and meaningful irony.\\" Occasionally Goncharov addresses some personal issues in the book. The chapter called \\"The Voyage Through the Tropical Atlantics\\" is written in the form of an epistle to his friend, the Romantic poet Vladimir Benediktov and should be taken in the context of the author's earlier polemics with his opponents, concerning the aesthetics of Romanticism. Concept and themes The account of the events during the trip, provided by the book, is accurate but by no means full; that is another reason why Frigate \\"Pallada\\" is occasionally referred to as 'fictionalized travelogue'. It omits many things that would have made it look like proper documentary, most notably everything concerning the diplomatic negotiations the Russian officials held with their Japanese counterparts. It also sidesteps all the difficulties that the expedition had to endure (Pallada was in poor condition and had to make several unplanned stops for repair). The darker side of the journey was dealt with later, in a piece called \\"Twenty Years On\\" (Через двадцать лет), written in 1874. Goncharov saw his objective as creating a vast and detailed, even if purely subjective analytical survey of the life abroad. \\"...This chance to closely examine and then analyze foreign lives - be it the life of the nation or the life of an individual - provides one with this kind of lesson... that one won't be taught by books or in schools,\\" he wrote. Goncharov saw Frigate \\"Pallada\\" as closely linked to his famous trilogy, in a sense that all four books dealt in one way or the other with the notion of the time of change coming to Russia. These new times, according to the author, warranted not only the re-evaluation of Russia's past, but also close attention to the similar processes as experienced by other countries. While totally overlooked by contemporary critics (including those belonging to the Socialist camp), in retrospect one of Frigate Palladas recurring themes was the critique of the Western colonialism, in Africa, but mostly in China. Critical reception The initial response to Frigate Pallada was very warm, although most of the reviews in retrospect seem superficial and flat. The liberal author and critic Stepan Dudyshkin, reviewing the 1855 fragmentary publications, commented: \\"The artist remains the artist everywhere... so what new does Goncharov's account of his travels bring to our literature? Lots of pictures of Southern nature and life, painted by experienced painter's brush; pictures which for a long time will be viewed with great pleasure.\\"Otechestvennye Zapiski, 1856, No.1, p.50 Another liberal critic, Alexander Druzhinin, saw Goncharov as a 'practical artist' and, drawing parallels with the Flemish painting, defined the author's object as \\"revealing poetic meanings in what would look like simple, everyday life.\\" Nikolai Nekrasov reviewed each chapter published by Sovremennik in 1855, praising the \\"liveliness and beauty of language\\" as well as the \\"moderation of tone\\" which enabled the author to depict every object \\"in its true light, full of mild overtones as well and multiple colours.\\" According to Dmitry Pisarev's 1858 review, Goncharov's notes \\"provide little by way of scientific data, or new explorations; they even lack detailed descriptions of the lands and the cities that he visited. What he gives us instead is the gallery of masterfully painted etudes which strike one by their freshness, completeness and originality.\\"Rassvet magazine, 1859. Vol. I, p. 69 According to Nikolay Dobrolyubov, The Frigate Pallada \\"bore the hallmark of a gifted epic novelist.\\" In retrospect modern Russian critics see the book as a well-balanced, unbiased report, containing valuable ethnographic material, but also some social critique.

History =Card benefits= The company's namesake card, which was targeted to millennials, was widely compared to American Express's \\"Black Card\\" (officially known as the Centurion Card). Similarities between the two cards include that they were both black, made of metal, and promised exclusive perks to members. Despite appearances, however, Magnises's card was not a real charge card; instead, each card merely copied the magstripe information from a customer's existing Wells Fargo or Bank of America card, for which it could then be used as a substitute.

The case was settled in January 2016, and the company subsequently relocated its headquarters to the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.

The company has retrospectively been described as a scam.

In 1949, the United States Congress agreed to 'shared' financing the construction of a line of radar stations, across southern Canada, to enhance warning of ‘air attack’ and for the direction of fighter interceptors. Given the estimated costs in construction, maintenance and personnel, it was agreed Canada would focus on priorities in southern Ontario and Quebec, with the United States on stations in Western and Atlantic Canada.Michael T.

Beck was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was baptized in 1914. In 1914, his family moved to McGill, Nevada. Beck first attended school here, and enjoyed playing pranks, camping, and collecting insects, rocks, plants and animals. In 1921, he and his family moved to Lava Hot Springs, Idaho, where Beck graduated from high school in 1925. Education Beck attended Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, and studied zoology and entomology. While he was at BYU, Beck lived with his grandmother in Spanish Fork and commuted each day. He also enlisted in the Medical Corps of the National Guard, and served for three years. Beck was selected to participate in a biology field expedition in 1928 where he spent six weeks surveying land in Idaho and Utah. During his senior year at BYU, he was a laboratory instructor in general zoology. He graduated from BYU in 1929 with his bachelor's degree, and in 1930 with a master's degree. Beck then got his Ph.D. from Iowa State College in 1933. On May 31, 1933, he married Florence Robinson in the Salt Lake Temple. The couple had four children. Career Beck was made the head of the Biology Department at Dixie State College in St. George, Utah, after his graduation in 1933. He stayed at Dixie State College until 1938 when he went to teach at BYU in the Zoology and Entomology Department, of which he became chair in 1962. Beck served in the Medical Entomological Service of the United States Army Medical Department from 1943 to 1945. While stationed on Guadalcanal, Beck collected insects and reptiles which were sent back to BYU. This collection included over 16,000 insect specimens. He was promoted to captain in 1945. He was honorably discharged in October 1945. After his service, Beck returned to BYU. He studied mosquito abatement and the effects of atom bombs on wildlife. With his research, he helped develop a mosquito control program for Utah County. Beck left BYU on sabbatical to do research at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and at Lake Placid, Florida. Beck's research resulted in a new genus and five new species. His research included many photographs of plants and animals that were published in various magazines. He served as an adviser of the World Health Organization on malaria and mosquito control from 1956 to 1958, working closely with the Chinese government. Beck also spent two years working with the Taiwan Provincial Malaria Research Institute. Beck had a collection of earthworms that he began in 1948. This collection was sent to the American Museum of Natural History. Other contributions Beck was an active member of the LDS Church. He served as the superintendent of the local Sunday School and held the office of high priest. Beck served as the President of the Provo Junior Chamber of Commerce.

Bishop Alexander is well known for his missionary leaflets. From 1985 to 2005 Bishop Alexander published a total of 763 brochures: 300 in Russian, 192 in English, 168 in Spanish and 103 in Portuguese.  Early years  The future Bishop Alexander was born in 1938 in Odessa in a military family, a descendant of a Russian noble family. After his father Vasiliy Mileant went missing on the front during World War II in 1941, his family emigrated to the West. They first lived in Europe (Prague, then Rome) until 1948, when the whole family moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina. From an early age, in Europe, Alexander served under Bishop Panteleimon (Rudyk), and then Athanassiy (Martos). Bishop Athanassiy had a large library of holy books, which the young Alexander loved to read. Alexander, who desired to read \\"The Lives of the Saints\\" in the original, first studied the modern Greek language and later ancient Greek. At the end of 1963 he entered Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary, located at Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York. He completed seminary with a Bachelor in Theology Degree in 1967.  Priest  In 1967, after Great Lent, the future Bishop Alexander was ordained to the priesthood by Metropolitan Philaret (Voznesensky) and assigned to serve in the Protection of the Holy Virgin Church in Los Angeles, where he served 31 years of his life. He conducted services in both Church Slavonic and in English. The church also had a parish Russian School attended by as many as 110 children. From 1971–1985, Fr. Alexander organized pilgrimages for youth to holy places in Greece and the Holy Land. Starting in 1985, Fr. Alexander began publishing \\"Missionary leaflets\\" in four languages: Russian, English, Spanish and Portuguese. In 1995, during Great Lent, Fr. Alexander was tonsured into the mantia at the Holy Trinity Monastery with the name Alexander, in honor of Hieromartyr Alexander of Kharkov (before this he was named in honor of St. Alexander Nevsky).  Bishop  On May 28, 1998, in the Synodal Cathedral of the Sign in New York City, he was consecrated Bishop of Buenos Aires and South America. The ordination was performed by Archbishop Anthony (Medvedev) of Western America and San Francisco, Archbishop Laurus (Škurla) of Syracuse and Holy Trinity, Bishop Agathangel (Pashkovsky) of Simferopol and Crimea, Bishop Mitrophan (Znosko-Borovsky) of Boston, and Bishop Gabriel (Chemodakov) of Manhattan. In the last years of his life Alexander suffered from cancer. Because of his illness, he rarely visited his cathedral in Buenos Aires, however he sent his flock messages using modern communication methods. During that period, he served primarily at Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church in Oxnard, California. Bishop Alexander actively advocated closer ties between the Russian Church Abroad and the Moscow Patriarchate. In two of his messages he stated that he is compelled by a sense of spiritual unity with the people in his homeland. He spoke frequently about the ongoing spiritual renewal of Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church where the Holy Spirit can be felt in abundance. He died on 12 Sep 2005 in La Canada Flintridge, CA. He is buried at Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York. Archbishop Kyrill (Dmitrieff) of San Francisco officiated at his funeral at Holy Trinity Church in Oxnard, CA, on Friday, September 16, and Metropolitan Laurus, accompanied by Bishops Gabriel (Chemodakov) of Manhattan and Peter (Loukianoff) of Cleveland, served his burial at Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, NY, on Monday, September 19.

Walker was a British trade unionist. Walker worked as an electrician in the 1880s and was a founder member of the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) in 1889. At the first conference of the ETU, the following year, he was elected as the union's inaugural president, while Dick Steadman was appointed as the first general secretary, working on a part-time basis.John Lloyd, Light and Liberty: the history of the EETPU, p.18 In 1891, the ETU decided to make the general secretary post full-time. Steadman did not wish to give up his work, and Walker was elected unopposed, and stated that he hoped he would remain in the post for life. Initially, membership rose under his leadership, peaking at 1,183 in 1892. He reviewed the union's financial position and raised concerns that its income would not cover its commitments to pay benefits to members. This occurred as the year went on, a downturn in the trade leading to many members finding themselves unemployed. In response, the union's executive committee decided to introduce a levy on working members of three pennies per week. This led many members to resign, worsening the union's financial position.John Lloyd, Light and Liberty: the history of the EETPU, pp.24-29 By 1894, only 402 members of the ETU remained, the large majority in London. Walker was perceived as incompetent, struggling with administration and accounting. The executive appointed a treasurer, Arthur Senior, in an attempt to resolve the union accounts, and this process revealed that £21 9s 3d was missing, believed to have been stolen by Walker. He was dismissed from the general secretaryship in November 1894, and Steadman took over on a part-time acting basis until new elections were held.

The term \\"officer of the United States\\" is not a title, but a term of classification for a certain type of official. Under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, the principal officers of the United States, such as federal judges, ambassadors, and \\"public Ministers\\" (Cabinet members) are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, but Congress may \\"vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\\" Civilian officers of the United States are entitled to preface their names with the honorific style \\"the Honorable\\" for life; though in practice, this rarely occurs. Officers of the United States should not be confused with employees of the United States; the latter are more numerous and lack the special legal authority of the former. Background =Establishment= Origin and definition The Appointments Clause of the Constitution (Article II, section 2, clause 2), empowers the President of the United States to appoint \\"Officers of the United States\\" with the \\"advice and consent\\" of the United States Senate. The same clause also allows lower-level officials to be appointed without the advice and consent process. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives the U.S. Senate the right to confirm or reject the nomination of any officer of the United States. > ... he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, > shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the > supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose > Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be > established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such > inferior Officers as they think proper, in the President alone, in the > Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments. The Framers of the U.S. Constitution understood the role of high officers specially imbued with certain authority to act on behalf of the head of state within the context of their earlier experience with the British Crown. Day-to- day administration of the British Government was based on persons \\"holding sovereign authority delegated from the King that enabled them in conducting the affairs of government to affect the people.\\" This was an extension of the general common-law rule that \\"where one man hath to do with another's affairs against his will, and without his leave, that this is an office, and he who is in it, is an officer.\\" According to an April 2007 memorandum opinion by the United States Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, addressed to the general counsels of the executive branch, defined \\"officer of the United States\\" as: > a position to which is delegated by legal authority a portion of the > sovereign power of the federal government and that is 'continuing' in a > federal office subject to the Constitution's Appointment Clause. A person > who would hold such a position must be properly made an 'officer of the > United States' by being appointed pursuant to the procedures specified in > the Appointments Clause. Barack Obama signs the commission document investing Elena Kagan as an officer of the United States in 2010, specifically as a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The difference between an \\"Officer of the United States\\" and a mere \\"Employee of the United States,\\" therefore, ultimately rests on whether the office held has been explicitly delegated part of the \\"sovereign power of the United States\\". Delegation of \\"sovereign power\\" means possession of the authority to commit the federal government of the United States to some legal obligation, such as by signing a contract, executing a treaty, interpreting a law, or issuing military orders. A federal judge, for instance, has been delegated part of the \\"sovereign power\\" of the United States to exercise; while a letter carrier for the United States Postal Service has not. Some very prominent title-holders, including the White House Chief of Staff, the White House Press Secretary and most other high-profile presidential staff assistants, are only employees of the United States as they have no authority to exercise the sovereign power of the federal government. Military officers and secondary appointments In addition to civilian officers of the United States, persons who hold military commissions are also considered officers of the United States. While not explicitly defined as such in the Constitution, this fact is implicit in its structure. According to a 1996 opinion by then-Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, \\"even the lowest ranking military or naval officer is a potential commander of United States armed forces in combat --and, indeed, is in theory a commander of large military or naval units by presidential direction or in the event of catastrophic casualties among his or her superiors.\\" p. 144, n. 54. The officer's authority to command the forces of the United States draws its legitimacy from the president himself as \\"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States\\"; the president cannot reasonably be expected to command every soldier, or any soldier, in the field and so delegates his authority to command to officers he commissions. Commissioned officers of the eight uniformed services of the United States-- the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps, and Public Health Service Commissioned Corps--are all officers of the United States. Under current law, the Senate does not require the commissions of all military officers to be confirmed; however, anyone being first promoted to major in the Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps, or lieutenant commander in the Navy, does require such confirmation. This results in several hundred promotions that annually must be confirmed by the Senate, though these are typically confirmed en masse without individual hearings. Military officers are considered officers of the United States. Finally, some persons not appointed by the president but, instead, appointed by persons or bodies who are, themselves, appointed by the president may be officers of the United States if defined as such under the law. Examples include United States magistrate judges, who are appointed by United States district courts, and the Postmaster General of the United States, who is appointed by the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service, which, in turn, is appointed by the president. Ineligibility Clause Members of the United States Congress—the legislative branch of the United States government—are not \\"officers of the United States\\" and cannot simultaneously serve in Congress and as an officer of the United States under the \\"Ineligibility Clause\\" (also called the \\"Incompatibility Clause\\") of the Constitution (Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2). This provision states: > No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was > elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United > States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have > been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the > United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in > Office. The question of whether the Ineligibility Clause bars member of Congress or civil officers of the United States from simultaneously serving in the military (especially the military reserves) has never been definitively resolved. A case involving the issue was litigated to the U.S. Supreme Court in Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, but the Supreme Court decided the case on procedural grounds and did not address the Ineligibility Clause issue.Cynthia Brougher, Service by a Member of Congress in the U.S. Armed Forces Reserves, Congressional Research Service (June 10, 2009). Congress has enacted legislation provided that \\"a Reserve of the armed forces who is not on active duty or who is on active duty for training is deemed not an employee or an individual holding an office of trust or profit or discharging an official function under or in connection with the United States because of his appointment, oath, or status, or any duties or functions performed or pay or allowances received in that capacity.\\" A 2009 Congressional Research Service report noted that \\"Because Congress has the power to determine the qualifications of its own Members, the limitations that it has imposed on what constitutes an employee holding an office of the United States may be significant to courts considering the constitutional limitations.\\" Creation and appointment With the exception of military officers and certain court- and board-appointed officers, the method for creating an officer of the United States generally follows a set procedure. First, the Constitution must describe the office, or the U.S. Congress must create the office through a statute (though the president may independently create offices when exercising his exclusive jurisdiction in the exercise of foreign affairs, generally meaning ambassadorships). Second, the president nominates a person to fill the office and then commissions that person at which time the appointee comes to occupy the office and is an officer of the United States. However, if the office is that of ambassador, \\"public minister\\" (member of the Cabinet of the United States), judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, or if the office has not been specifically vested for filling \\"in the President alone\\" by the authorizing legislation, then an intermediate step is required before the commission can be issued, namely, the U.S. Senate must give its \\"advise and consent\\" which, in practice, means approval by vote of a simple majority. An officer of the United States assumes his office's full authority upon the issuance of the commission. However, officers must take an oath of office before they can be paid. =Statistics= The Federal Communications Commission pictured in 1937. Each of the commissioners is an officer of the United States by virtue of their authority to discharge part of the sovereign power of the U.S., specifically, regulation of radio waves. According to a 2012 study by the Congressional Research Service, there are between 1200 and 1400 civilian officers of the United States which are subject to the \\"advice and consent\\" of the Senate prior to commissioning. A further 100,000 civilian officers of the United States have been exempted from this requirement by the U.S. Congress under the \\"inferior officer\\" exemption allowed by the Appointments Clause. Among military officers there were, as of 2012, 127,966 officers in the Selected Reserve and 365,483 officers in the United States armed forces. The NOAA Corps and U.S. Public Health Service had smaller numbers of officers. =Examples of officers of the United States= Officers of the United States in the executive branch are numerous; but some examples include: the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and members of the Federal Communications Commission and Interstate Commerce Commission. Customs and courtesies Commission for Philip Habib for his trip as Special Representative of the President of the United States for the Middle East in 1982, signed by President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz. The commission issued to a U.S. Vice Consul in 2012. =Commission certificate= Most civilian officers of the United States are issued written commissions. Those who do not require confirmation of the Senate are provided semi-engraved commission certificates (partially printed with hand inscription of name, date, and title by a White House calligrapher) on letter-sized parchment. To this is set the signatures of the president and the U.S. Secretary of State applied by autopen. The document is sealed with the Great Seal of the United States. Those who require confirmation of the Senate are issued fully engraved certificates (certificates completely hand-written by a calligrapher) on foolscap folio sized parchment. The President and Secretary of State usually hand-sign these certificates and, like others, they are sealed with the Great Seal of the United States. The commissions of military officers are signed under the line \\"for the President\\" by the appropriate service secretary (e.g. the Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the Air Force, or for the Coast Guard, the Secretary of Homeland Security), instead of the Secretary of State, and are sealed with their respective departmental seal (e.g. Army seal) instead of the Great Seal. The presentation of commissions for civilian officers generally follows the following style, or some variation thereof: =Honorific title= Civilian officers of the United States are permitted to be titled \\"the Honorable\\" for life, even after they cease being an officer of the United States. In practice, however, this custom is rarely observed except in the case of judges. When it is invoked for non-judicial officers it is only done in written address or platform introductions and never by the official to whom it is applied in reference to him or herself.

She was born in Pont l'Abbé in the Finistère. A teacher, Guyot resigned in 1917 to prepare for the competition of the Ecole Centrale of the Paris Lycée Jules-Ferry when she learned that the school would accept girls into its ranks. She graduated in 1921 from the first class of Central School of Paris to accept women. She ranked 45th of 243 graduates (425 students were received in the contest). Also a top athlete, she participated in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam in the 800 meters. She was also French Cross Country Champion in 1928. Arrested by the Germans in 1940, she died in 1941 in Paris as a result of her imprisonment.  Early life  Sébastienne Marie Henriette Guyot was born 26 April 1896 at Pont-‘l’Abbé in Brittany. Her father worked as a mounted policeman, ultimately being promoted to the role of Adjutant-Chef. She had one elder brother George (1894-1982) who became a pilot in the First World War and decorated with the Légion d’Honneur in 1917. Her two younger brothers were Roger (1901- 1980) and René (1903–1977).  Education  In the spring of 1917, Sébastienne Guyot was working as a teacher. Turning twenty-one meant she was now legally an adult and able to make her own decisions, financial or otherwise. She gave up teaching and in October 1917 enrolled at the Lycée Jules Ferry in Paris, which ran classes to help women to prepare for the 1918 competition for entry into Central School of Paris, which had just permitted women to join their classes (as long as they sat in the front row). She came fifty-seventh out of 425 successful candidates passing the examination to enter the Central School of Paris. She chose to study mechanics, which included electrical engineering. By the end of the first year only 262 engineering students remained, with only 243 actually graduating in 1921.  Career in engineering  After graduation, Guyot moved into working in aviation. She may have been inspired by her older brother George’s experiences during the First World War, when he fought first as an aviation observer, got shot down and later trained and flew as a pilot, earning the Légion d’Honneur. Guyot initially worked in two small companies, the “Ateliers de construction de l'Ouest\\" and then at the \\"Établissements Lumière\\" company from c.1922 through to 1928. The Lumiere aeroplane company was set up by Louis de Monge, a Belgian engineer living in Paris, to design aircraft. Guyot worked on the company’s small twin-engine aircraft, launched in 1924, although much of the company’s work was to undertake aeronautical research projects for the French government. In 1929 Guyot moved to work as an aeronautical engineer at the \\"Hydravions Lioré & Olivier\\", a much larger company, which designed and manufactured seaplanes and military aircraft, including the LeO 45. She remained there until 1935, working on fuselages and hulls of several seaplanes, and in collaboration with designers, Paul Asantchéef and André Violleau, who thought highly of her. In 1932, Guyot learnt to fly and bought a second-hand light plane, a Farman 231 with lowered wings, two-seater tandem roadster, Renault 95 horsepower engine, maximum speed around 186 km / h12. It was registered number F-AJZN and had a decal of two dogs on its side. Around 1932 Guyot started working on the engineering of rotary blades for rotor craft. A 1933 record of a helicopter named \\"Loth- Guyot\\" survives in the Air Section of the Historical Defence Service at Vincennes. Between 1932 to 1939, Guyot took out six patents in conjunction with engineer and entrepreneur William Arthur Loth (1888-1957), concerned with improving the lift of the rotator blades. One involved the stabilisation of rotating lifting systems, another a swivelling screw propeller. In 1936, the Arsenal de l'Aéronautique (usually called the Arsenal), a national military aircraft manufacturer, was established by the French Government at Villacoublay. In the dossier compiled by her brothers in 1947, making the case for her Resistance Medal, Sébastienne Guyot was described as \\"Head of the Helicopter Service at the Arsenal de l'Aéronautique\\", although details of her role there remain sketchy. The Arsenal was moved to Toulouse during the Second World War. It was dissolved in the 1950s and its pre-war records have disappeared.  Sport  As well as her engineering and aeronautical career, Sébastienne Guyot was also a successful long-distance runner. In January 1927 she joined the Académie at the Val d´Or stadium, one of the few sports clubs which promoted women's sport in France at the time. She was French champion of female cross country running in 1928, and was selected to run the 800 metres at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, continuing to compete until 1932.  Médaille de la Résistance  On the 7th July 1940, Sébastienne Guyot learnt that her younger brother René had become a prisoner of war earlier that month. He was held at the Mulsanne camp and Sebastienne decided to try to rescue him, leaving Toulouse on 9 July. She somehow crossed the German army’s lines without discovery, arriving at Mulsanne on 15 July and managed to get in touch with her brother. René explained that he had be appointed the “commandant du camp” the representative of all the other prisoners in dealing with the Wehrmacht, and felt that he could not abandon his men as his escape could endanger them. Sébastienne had to agree with the logic of his argument and left to return to Toulouse. She was discovered by German troops and found to be in possession of a map with instructions for evading them as well as a compass (her family think she travelled in her Renault car). She was arrested on 19 July 1940, tried in a court martial on 5 August and sentenced to six months in jail. Despite the prison staff being French and visits from a chaplain, Guyot fell ill in prison and did not receive proper treatment. When her brother George arrived to pick her up at the end of her sentence on January 1941, he learned that she had just been hospitalised as an emergency. He discovered her in a skeletal state in the hospital, with gangrenous frostbitten hands. George rushed her to Paris where a surgeon saved her hand, but the disease progressed and she died in great pain at the Broussais Hospital on 22 August 1941. She received the Médaille de la Résistance posthumously in March 1947. Her three brothers survived the war.  Legacy  Guyot was awarded the medal of the resistance posthumously. She is the only woman whose name is on the war memorial of the Ecole Centrale. Since 2010, a scholarship in her name is given annually to five young Ecole Centrale students to fully fund their studies at the School. In 2015, her name was given to one of the eight streets in the new university area of Moulon in Gif- sur-Yvette, an area that will accommodate CentraleSupélec in 2017, following the merger of Centrale Paris and Supélec.

U.S. Patent 7,763,712. The most common side effects include injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions (such as difficulty breathing, nausea, dizziness and fever), lipodystrophy (a loss of fat tissue resulting in an indentation in the skin or a thickening of fat tissue resulting in a lump under the skin) at the injection site, and ectopic calcifications of the eyes and kidney. The enzyme tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) plays a key role in creating and maintaining healthy bones, and managing calcium and phosphate in the body. People with hypophosphatasia cannot make enough working ALP, which leads to weak bones. Asfotase alfa is a version of the human ALP enzyme and serves as a replacement, thereby increasing levels of working ALP. Medical uses In the United States, asfotase alfa is indicated for the treatment of people with perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset hypophosphatasia (HPP). In the European Union, asfotase alfa is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in people with paediatric-onset hypophosphatasia to treat the bone manifestations of the disease. Adverse effects The most common adverse effects in studies included injection site reactions (pain, itching, erythema, etc.), headache, limb pain, and haematoma. Possible rare side effects could not be assessed because of the low number of patients. Interactions Asfotase alfa interferes with alkaline phosphatase measurements. As asfotase alfa is a glycoprotein (as opposed to a small molecule), no relevant interactions via the cytochrome P450 liver enzymes are expected. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Hypophosphatasia is caused by a genetic defect of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP), an enzyme that plays a role in bone mineralization. Asfotase alfa is a recombinant glycoprotein that contains the catalytic domain (the active site) of TNSALP. It is thus a form of enzyme replacement therapy. =Pharmacokinetics= After subcutaneous injection, asfotase alfa has a bioavailability of 46–98% and reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after 24 to 48 hours. Elimination half life is five days. Chemistry The peptide part of the glycoprotein asfotase alfa consists of two identical chains of 726 amino acids each, containing (1) the catalytic domain of TNSALP, (2) the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1, and (3) a sequence of ten L-aspartate residues at the carboxy terminus. The two chains are linked by two disulfide bridges. Each chain also contains four internal disulfide bridges. The complete peptide sequence of one chain isDrugBank: Asfotase Alfa.KEGG: Asfotase Alfa LVPEKEKDPK YWRDQAQETL KYALELQKLN TNVAKNVIMF LGDGMGVSTV TAARILKGQL HHNPGEETRL EMDKFPFVAL SKTYNTNAQV PDSAGTATAY LCGVKANEGT VGVSAATERS RCNTTQGNEV TSILRWAKDA GKSVGIVTTT RVNHATPSAA YAHSADRDWY SDNEMPPEAL SQGCKDIAYQ LMHNIRDIDV IMGGGRKYMY PKNKTDVEYE SDEKARGTRL DGLDLVDTWK SFKPRYKHSH FIWNRTELLT LDPHNVDYLL GLFEPGDMQY ELNRNNVTDP SLSEMVVVAI QILRKNPKGF FLLVEGGRID HGHHEGKAKQ ALHEAVEMDR AIGQAGSLTS SEDTLTVVTA DHSHVFTFGG YTPRGNSIFG LAPMLSDTDK KPFTAILYGN GPGYKVVGGE RENVSMVDYA HNNYQAQSAV PLRHETHGGE DVAVFSKGPM AHLLHGVHEQ NYVPHVMAYA ACIGANLGHC APASSLKDKT HTCPPCPAPE LLGGPSVFLF PPKPKDTLMI SRTPEVTCVV VDVSHEDPEV KFNWYVDGVE VHNAKTKPRE EQYNSTYRVV SVLTVLHQDW LNGKEYKCKV SNKALPAPIE KTISKAKGQP REPQVYTLPP SREEMTKNQV SLTCLVKGFY PSDIAVEWES NGQPENNYKT TPPVLDSDGS FFLYSKLTVD KSRWQQGNVF SCSVMHEALH NHYTQKSLSL SPGKDIDDDD DDDDDD Asfotase alfa is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. History Asfotase alfa was granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2008. Asfotase alfa is manufactured by Alexion Pharmaceuticals and it was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the U.S. FDA in 2015 as it is the first and only treatment for perinatal, infantile and juvenile-onset HPP.CDER Breakthrough Therapy Designation Approvals. It was approved in October 2015, in the U.S. and in August 2015, in the EU. Text was copied from this source which is © European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. The safety and efficacy of asfotase alfa were established in 99 participants with perinatal (disease occurs in utero and is evident at birth), infantile- or juvenile- onset HPP who received treatment for up to 6.5 years during four prospective, open-label studies. Study results showed that participants with perinatal- and infantile-onset HPP treated with asfotase alfa had improved overall survival and survival without the need for a ventilator (ventilator-free survival). Ninety-seven percent of treated participants were alive at one year of age compared to 42 percent of control participants selected from a natural history study group. Similarly, the ventilator-free survival rate at one year of age was 85 percent for treated participants compared to less than 50 percent for the natural history control participants. Participants with juvenile-onset HPP treated with asfotase alfa showed improvements in growth and bone health compared to control participants selected from a natural history database. All treated participants had improvement in low weight or short stature or maintained normal height and weight. In comparison, approximately 20 percent of control participants had growth delays over time, with shifts in height or weight from the normal range for children their age to heights and weights well below normal for age. Juvenile-onset participants also showed improvements in bone mineralization, as measured on a scale that evaluates the severity of rickets and other HPP-related skeletal abnormalities based on x-ray images. All treated participants demonstrated substantial healing of rickets on x-rays while some natural history control participants showed increasing signs of rickets over time.

Her 1982 book Poets in their Youth records her life with first husband John Berryman and his circle of poets, including Delmore Schwartz and Robert Lowell. In 1984 she was a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts in General Nonfiction.  Early life  Born Eileen Patricia Mulligan in New York City, Simpson was orphaned by age 7 and sent by relatives to a New Jersey boarding school. She struggled with undiagnosed dyslexia, a condition later identified by Berryman. Simpson met Berryman at a New Year's party in New York in 1941, soon after her graduation from Hunter College, and they were married the following year at St. Patrick's Cathedral. The couple moved to Beacon Hill, and Berryman found work lecturing at Harvard, and later Princeton. Berryman, like other poets of his generation, would continue to earn his living through academic postings. Simpson meanwhile supported his poetry practice first with secretarial positions, and later, as a psychology student, with work at a Princeton clinic.  Poets in Their Youth  Simpson's eleven years of marriage to Berryman were turbulent. As Berryman struggled as an artist, Simpson supported him practically and emotionally, even as his personal problems and behavior worsened. Simpson remained an astute and sympathetic observer of Berryman, his poet and writer colleagues, and their wives and families, including Randall Jarrell, Delmore Schwartz, Robert Lowell, Jean Stafford, and R.P. Blackmur, all of whom appear in Poets in Their Youth. Simpson's Times obituary concludes that \\"madness and despondency were the principal motifs of her life\\" with Berryman and his circle. Between Berryman's alcoholism, infidelities, suicidal urges, and persistent self-destructive tendencies, Simpson was forced to conclude that \\"no amount of love and care could protect him from external circumstances, and that these could bring him to the edge of madness.\\" After 11 years of marriage, she writes: \\"The job of net-holder had exhausted me.\\" Still, as the Washington Post reviewer Jonathan Yardley noted, it was a union characterized by \\"much happiness\\", and Simpson's enduring love and affection for Berryman, and the poets and poets' wives of their circle, are principal strengths of her memoir: a \\"cleareyed compassion... is characteristic of 'Poets in Their Youth,' which never sensationalizes these brilliant but wildly erratic young men, only seeks to understand them.\\" While New Yorker poetry editor Howard Moss, writing in the New York Review of Books on the occasion of its publication, called it \\"too forgiving by far\\", Lee Siegel, reviewing its reissue in the New York Times, ascribes to the memoir \\"an almost uncanny clemency and a kind of cerulean objectivity\\", calling it \\"both a memorial to the men Simpson admired and an admonitory epitaph on lives lived at often false and ugly odds with their own aspirations toward truth and beauty.\\" Simpson left Berryman in 1953, divorcing officially in 1956. Berryman would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize for \\"The Dream Songs\\" in 1965, and eventually committed suicide in 1972. Simpson's memoir was published in 1982 by Random House, and reissued in 2014 by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. The title is taken from Wordsworth's \\"Resolution and Independence\\": > “We poets in our youth begin in gladness; / But thereof comes in the end > despondency and madness”.  Later life  In 1960, Eileen married Robert Simpson, a banker and diplomat, and relocated to Paris. Unable to continue her psychotherapist practice, she turned to writing, publishing a novel and two personal memoirs as well as studies in psychology. After the death of her second husband, she married Francis X. Baine, who died in the late 1990s.  Works  * The Maze (novel).

Final Fantasy XV, an action role-playing video game released in November 2016, is the fifteenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, and is thematically connected to Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked by a common mythos which includes Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Type-0. The world and main characters were created by Tetsuya Nomura, the game's original director. Nomura also designed the main characters, with later revisions and additional characters being designed by Yusuke Naora: other character designers involved with the game included Roberto Ferrari and Yusaku Nakaaki. The story revolves around a conflict between kingdom of Lucis and the empire of Niflheim for control of the magical Crystal. The main protagonist is Noctis Lucis Caelum, sole heir to the throne of Lucis. On his journey, he is accompanied by three companions: Gladiolus Amicitia, a brother-figure from a noble family sworn to Noctis's protection; Ignis Scientia, Noctis's strategist; and Prompto Argentum, a friend of Noctis from a lower-class family. A key character is Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, Noctis's fiancée through an arranged marriage. Other characters include Noctis's father Regis, the king of Lucis; Cor Leonis, a famous warrior of Lucis; Cindy, who with her grandfather Cid acts as mechanic for Noctis' car; and Iris, Gladiolus's sister. The game's main antagonist Ardyn Izuna is supported by the forces of Niflheim under emperor Iedolas Aldercapt and his chief scientist Verstael Besithia, Lunafreya's brother Ravus Nox Fleuret, and the mercenary dragoon Aranea Highwind. Originally a spin-off game titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII, the game changed multiple times during its ten-year development cycle, including the redesign or removal of characters and story elements. Additional media and merchandise based upon the world and characters of XV have been produced, with its expanded media being dubbed the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\": these include the original net animation Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV , the CGI feature film Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV, numerous pieces of story-based downloadable content (DLC), and a novel The Dawn of the Future based on a cancelled second series of DLC. Reception of its characters has been mixed; while the playable cast and its interactions met with frequent praise, underuse of its supporting cast and lack of female characters were frequently faulted. It also saw commentary on its portrayal of gender roles and character disability. The additional media saw a mixed reaction; Brotherhood was praised for its character development, while Kingsglaive met with frequent criticism. The DLC episodes met with varied reactions, though many critics praised their expansions on each character. Concept and creation The concept and setting of Final Fantasy XV, initially a spin-off titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII, was created by original director Tetsuya Nomura. Initially in development for PlayStation 3, Versus XIII was shifted to the eighth generation consoles PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. During this transition, Final Fantasy Type-0 director Hajime Tabata became co- director; later in development, he assumed full directorial duties from Nomura. The development period ultimately lasted about ten years, although Tabata now refers to Versus XIII and XV as different games. The game was originally part of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a collection of games united by a common mythology and shared themes. When it was renamed, XV \\"disconnected\\" from Fabula Nova Crystallis; although the mythos was retained, its role in the story was reduced and its unique terminology was removed to aid with marketing and provide Final Fantasy XV with an individual identity. A surviving theme from the mythos was the struggles of humans chosen by a divine crystal. The central concept behind the world of XV is \\"a fantasy based on reality\\": the setting is based on the real world and the fantasy elements grew out of familiar settings. Realizing this aspect of the game was quite difficult for Nomura before the game's move onto eighth-generation hardware. While the story was similar to other entries, he wanted to create more realistic characters. His ambition was to make XV \\"about man in the real world\\", including less fantasy elements. He also described Final Fantasy XV as the darkest entry in the series, acknowledging that this atmosphere might narrow its target audience while feeling that the time was right for such characters. Nomura wanted to depict a story centered on a group of men traveling the world, much like that of a road movie. This approach was inspired by experiences from his youth, in which he often witnessed single- gender groups taking extended trips. Nomura also did not want the protagonists to be drawn together by a grand destiny, instead being natural friends confronted with bizarre and dangerous situations. To help convey the road movie theme, the team created towns featuring both strange and familiar elements, taking inspiration from the opening scenes of Back to the Future Part II. The initial story themes were \\"misery\\" and \\"bonds\\", with all characters representing these themes through their actions and circumstances. It was intended to be a painful story that emphasized the power of friendship. The theme of bonds was represented in Final Fantasy XV by the relationships between Noctis and his comrades, as well as Noctis and his father, Regis. A key narrative element was Noctis' personal journey from prince to king. The original script was written by Kazushige Nojima, who described his story for Versus XIII as \\"Myth vs. Reality\\". When Versus XIII became FInal Fantasy XV, multiple aspects were changed. A scene that was removed was the original opening, in which Noctis met another character at a treaty-signing party, then had to escape Lucis when the forces of Niflheim attacked; those scenes were changed to have the group being away at the time of the invasion. However, other characters revealed during earlier trailers were retained and would have important roles in the story. When consulted over how his original draft could be reworked, Nojima said that he would be content as long as the overall concept remained faithful to the original. This gave the team the confidence to rework and realize the original story within XV. This rewriting was primarily done by Saori Itamuro, who was credited as \\"Lead Scenario Designer\\". The story takes place over a ten-year period, and the characters' appearances were altered as they aged: this bucked the trend of many similar JRPGs, with the team wanting to properly represent the characters growing through their journey. The game's opening depicts a scene late in the game; this approach was inspired by Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, which featured a conclusion linked to the original Final Fantasy VII. In both cases, the developers wanted players to experience a sequence of events leading up to a known conclusion. The ending was left deliberately ambiguous so that players could develop their own interpretations. For both Versus XIII and XV, game staff stated that it would likely be the saddest Final Fantasy story to date. Alongside the serious plot, several elements of light comedy were added as a counterbalance. A large amount of dialogue was conveyed using in-game conversations instead of cutscenes. Nomura also wanted the dialogue to sound \\"natural and not game-like or lofty\\". Final Japanese voice casting for the game began in 2010. =Character design= In contrast to many previous Final Fantasy titles, the playable cast of Final Fantasy XV is all male. This concept was chosen by Nomura from the outset, and agreed upon by Tabata despite some later reservations on his part. Women still have significant roles in the story, and Tabata noted in an interview that it is \\"not healthy to have a bias in genders\\". The game's main cast was designed by Nomura. The clothing for characters was designed by Hiromu Takahara, lead designer for Japanese fashion house Roen. Takahara's involvement principally came due to the detail needed for the costumes, which were inspired by western fashion: designing them himself would have been time-consuming for Nomura to do along with his other duties, which included designing characters for Final Fantasy XIII. He also wanted to continue to express the game's realism through the character outfits. The design trait for the main characters was \\"jet-black\\", while all the character clothing in the game utilized Roen's distinctive asymmetrical styling. Roen's designs were kept in the game when it became XV, as the team felt it would be wrong to remove them. The changeover from Versus XIII to XV resulted in the redesign of characters such as Regis, and the replacement of the previous main heroine Stella with the similarly-named Lunafreya. A result of the shift onto new hardware was that the art style moved away from the \\"stylized\\" look required by earlier hardware limitations. To help maximize the realism of the characters, their hair was first created by a hairstylist using a mannequin's wig, then rendered into the game using the technology of the Luminous Studio engine. The same technique was used for Agni's Philosophy, the engine's demo at E3 2012. The characters of Ardyn, Gentiana, Iris, Aranea, Umbra, Cindy, Cid, and Verstael were all designed by Roberto Ferrari, who had previously done work on Type-0 and was involved with the project from its earlier development as Versus XIII. These designs were completed by 2010, when the project was still known as Versus XIII. Ferrari was brought on board the project in 2010 after an unidentified female designer resigned from the project as her art was repeatedly rejected by the developers. The change and subsequent alterations to the game's content meant that many of Ferrari's character designs went unused, something he was openly frustrated about as he considered these unseen characters more visually striking than his surviving designs. Many of his surviving character designs were altered during later development, including those for Gentiana and Umbra. Ardyn and Aranea remained mostly unchanged. Another contributing artist was Yusaku Nakaaki, who helped design Cindy. The party's black garb were retained as a reference to the concepts of \\"death worship\\" present in Versus XIII, which were cut to avoid changing too much for regional censorship laws. Black remained an important color in-game due to its connection to the Lucian royal family. The later characters of Aera and Somnus were respectively based physically on Lunafreya and Noctis, while a young version of Verstael was physically based on Prompto. =Expanded media= To avoid spreading the narrative of Final Fantasy XV into multiple games, the team created a multimedia universe surrounding the game; these included a special prequel demo titled Platinum Demo, the feature movie Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV, and the original net animation Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV. The central theme for the overall story of Final Fantasy XV was the bond between father and son: Kingsglaive represented the theme from the father Regis' point of view. Brotherhood focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and includes interpersonal scenes that could not be included in the game. Lunafreya was highlighted as the \\"keystone\\" connecting the game, the movie, and the anime series together. While the media universe was expanded, Tabata divided the two phases between pre-release media and post- release downloadable content (DLC) and spin-off titles. The story also continued in Comrades, a multiplayer-focused expansion set during the ten-year narrative gap and focusing on the titular faction from Kingsglaive. The DLC was split into three episodes covering Gladiolus, Prompto, and Ignis during periods they were separated from Noctis. The online multiplayer expansion filled the ten-year gap in the narrative A second series of DLC episodes was commissioned under the title The Dawn of the Future, which was intended to create an alternate series of events and allow a better ending where the lead characters defy their fates. Prior to this, an anime short centered around Ardyn's past was also planned, expanding into its own DLC episode. The basic scenario were written by Toru Osanai. Due to several factors, only Episode Ardyn was released, with the other three episodes being cancelled. The scrapped content was instead turned into a novel of the same name, written by Emi Nagashima based on the draft scenario; the novel released in 2019 in Japan and 2020 in the West. =Localization= The English localization of XV was led by Dan Inoue. One of the aspects of the localization was using different accents to show the characters coming from different regions of the world: a cited example was Ignis, who spoke with a British accent while the other main characters spoke with an American accent. For the game's lore, the team made a conscious effort to move away from the esoteric terminology Final Fantasy had gained a reputation for. They used understandable names like \\"Astral\\" and \\"Daemon\\". To stop the lore becoming uninteresting, the divine beings' speech was made very impersonal—such as Gentiana not using \\"I\\" or \\"You\\" during her dialogue—and using interpretive dialogue for simple concepts. Different issues raised later included Ignis' localized lines, which changed aspects of the character interaction, and the alteration of Cindy's name from the original \\"Cidney\\". In an interview with Famitsu during Gamescom, Tabata revealed that the main reason for the delays in XVs release were related to the game's localization and debugging, as the team wanted to bring the game out in the west close to its Japanese release. The decision for a simultaneous release meant the localization had to happen alongside the game production, with no extra time for tweaks and corrections. In addition to being released with French and German dubs and text translation for those respective regions, it was also localized for Latin America with Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese text: this was the first time a Final Fantasy title was localized into these languages. One of the early issues, which drew public attention with the release of Episode Duscae, was Noctis' English voice actor. In Episode Duscae, his voice was pitched rather low, making the character seem older and less energetic than his Japanese counterpart. This was explained as being due to tight scheduling removing the opportunity for Tabata to catch the issue and re-record before it was time for release. After Episode Duscae, the voice work was redone to better convey Noctis' personality. The team needed to deal with the clash between normal dialogue and the fantastic elements, which threatened to undermine the narrative. This forced the different pieces of media to take different approaches, and some scripted character interactions to join up the different sides of the narrative. The game's localization methods ended up backfiring after release due to the dialogue matching mechanism for characters causing line repetition or omission. Main characters =Noctis Lucis Caelum= is the protagonist and sole playable character of XV. The crown prince and protector of Lucis, he was chosen by the Crystal as the legendary True King when he was five years old. At the game's beginning, he is en route to the city of Altissia for his arranged marriage with Lunafreya when he receives the news of Lucis's invasion by Niflheim. He eventually becomes the True King, a figure who saves Eos from a plague of darkness called the Starscourge at the cost of his life. In The Dawn of the Future, Noctis ends up rebelling against his role, succeeding in both saving Lunafreya and purging Eos of the Starscourge while surviving. Noctis is voiced by Tatsuhisa Suzuki in Japanese and Ray Chase in English. =Lunafreya Nox Fleuret= , for short, is one of the central figures in Noctis' journey. A princess of the royal family of Tenebrae, Lunafreya forms an early connection with Noctis when her mother, Queen Sylva, cures him of a Starscourge infection. Following the death of Sylva during Niflheim's attempted assassination of Regis and Noctis, Lunafreya becomes the youngest Oracle in history. During the events of Kingsglaive, Lunafreya unsuccessfully attempts to reach Noctis and Regis, then becomes central to Niflheim's infiltration and eventual invasion of Lucis's capital Insomnia. Lunafreya escapes with the Ring of the Lucii—a magical ring key to the prophecy of the True King—as both Regis and Kingsglaive member Nyx Ulric sacrifice themselves to ensure her escape. Lunafreya then travels ahead of Noctis, ensuring the Astrals grant him their power while guiding him through her companion Gentiana, the human form of the Astral Shiva. As she is persuading with the Astral Leviathan, she is fatally stabbed by Ardyn, giving the Ring of the Lucii to Noctis before dying. It is later revealed that speaking with the Astrals was slowly killing her, and she had been counting on her brother Ravus to finish what she started. Lunafreya continues to support Noctis in spirit form, aiding him directly in his final confrontation with Ardyn before reuniting with Noctis in the afterlife. In The Dawn of the Future, Lunafreya is resurrected by Bahamut to become a replacement for the rebellious Ardyn; initially falling in line, Lunafreya decides to rebel in turn against his wish to purge Eos of life, ultimately surviving and reuniting with Noctis. Lunafreya's place in XV was originally held by the similarly-named , the main female protagonist of Versus XIII. The relationship between Stella and Noctis was originally designed to be platonic rather than romantic, as Nomura felt a preference towards portraying a different kind of relationship between male and female protagonists. He also wanted to make her the first female character to \\"stand out from all previous [Final Fantasy heroines]\\". A key scene for Stella was the meeting and conversation with Noctis during the game's opening. While Nomura deliberately designed her against his usual tastes, he grew fond of her design over the years. Stella's design underwent alterations between 2011 and 2013, mainly to make her more beautiful. She was intended to be a very polite person, with that politeness conveyed through specific dialogue traits in her speech. During the transition from Versus XIII to XV, the developers envisioned a different type of heroine which did not fit with Stella's original role, but Stella was already known to and expected by fans who had followed the game's development. The team considered redesigning Stella to play a more active role in the story, but Tabata was uncomfortable about this. Faced with the scenario of fans being disappointed if Stella's personality or role were changed, the developers instead opted to replace her entirely. Stella's replacement Lunafreya was conceived by Tabata; he wanted a heroine who would properly portray the darker and more somber elements of the rewritten story of Final Fantasy XV. Lunafreya was described as the \\"keystone\\" linking the narratives of Final Fantasy XV, Kingsglaive and Brotherhood. While she did not have an active role in Kingsglaive, her character strength was conveyed through a single-minded determination. During the design process, it was decided that Lunafreya would assume and accept responsibility from a young age, putting her in direct contrast with Noctis; this required Lunafreya to be older than Noctis, which influenced elements of her character design. According to Tabata, the relationship between Noctis and Lunafreya was not a typical love story despite their being engaged. He also defined Lunafreya's personality as being stronger than either Stella or Noctis. Lunafreya was designed by Naora. Her appearance was defined by Tabata as \\"strong and heroic\\", which would be conveyed by her expressions and actions. Lunafreya was designed to give off the look of a strong-willed woman. To achieve this, the designers focused on the shape of her eyes and mouth, blending her appearance in Final Fantasy XV with that in Kingsglaive so she could project an air of grace and strength even when standing still. Her expressions reflected a notably wide range of emotions born from her goals, which resulted in her expression being \\"serious and somewhat sad\\". To convey Lunafreya's strong will and her high-born status through her appearance, Naora consulted a professional hairstylist and makeup artist; the way makeup was applied to her eyes and mouth was changed accordingly, and her hairstyle was done to resemble \\"something that would require the assistance of a handmaiden\\". Care was taken not to make her too prim, so that players could relate more to her. Lunafreya was voiced by Rina Kitagawa in Japanese and Amy Shiels in English. Shiels described the role as interesting due to the character's combined strength and vulnerability. In Kingsglaive, the character is voiced by Shiori Kutsuna in Japanese and Lena Headey in English. =Ardyn Izunia= is the main antagonist of XV, and the protagonist of Episode Ardyn. He is initially introduced as Niflheim's Imperial Chancellor and regarded as both its main political force running the empire and benefactor of its advances in Magitek technology. His true name is eventually revealed as , a healer who cured the Starscourge by taking it into his own body. The growing Starscourge caused him to be ostracised by his brother Somnus and rejected by the Crystal, an event compounded by the death of his lover Aera Mirus Fleuret during his fight with Somnus. Imprisoned for 2000 years, he is recovered by Niflheim and eventually embraces his dark powers, gradually losing his sanity and taking on the \\"Izunia\\" name. During an assault on Insomnia 30 years prior to the game, he learns that he was chosen by the Astrals to become a sacrificial vessel for the Starscourge; he reluctantly submits to this fate in exchange for revenge against Somnus's descendant Noctis. He orchestrates the events that lead to Niflheim's invasion of Insomnia, while guiding Noctis in forming Covenants with the Astrals so he can kill him once he becomes the True King. Ardyn reveals his motives by fatally wounding Lunafreya after she summons Leviathan, then harassing Noctis first by tricking him into attacking Prompto, then revealing the truth of their kinship when Noctis reaches the Crystal. After ten years, Ardyn faces Noctis in single-combat after setting the infected Ifrit and Lucii—embodiments of past Lucian monarchs—on him. Noctis destroys first Ardyn's body and then his spirit, completing his role and purging Eos of the Starscourge. In The Dawn of the Future, Ardyn instead rebels against Bahamut's will, prompting Bahamut to plan the destruction of Eos. Eventually Noctis and a revived Lunafreya convince him to complete the ceremony in Noctis's place, allowing him to kill Bahamut, erase the Starscourge, and make peace with Somnus and Aera. Ardyn was created in 2010 while the game was still titled Versus XIII, following the deletion of another character, a Niflheim officer called Safay Roth. According to Tabata, Ardyn is an unusual antagonist within the Final Fantasy series as he actively helps Noctis through his quest, even though it ultimately serves his desire for revenge. Both Tabata and Itamuro called Ardyn a character driven by his hatred of the Lucian royal line, with everything in his life serving his quest for revenge and his wish to torment Noctis. Ardyn was designed by Roberto Ferrari, remaining nearly unchanged throughout development; his design stood out from the other cast members, with one notable feature being the fedora he wore. He is described by the staff as \\"an interesting and strange character\\", with a unique personality and using his attire to express it, comparing it to the outfit of Kefka Palazzo, the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VI. His red hair color was chosen because his Japanese voice actor, Keiji Fujiwara, had previously voiced red-haired characters Reno from Final Fantasy VII and Axel from the Kingdom Hearts series. Ardyn is voiced in English by Darin De Paul. As Paul was used to playing deeper-voiced characters, he almost did not audition for the role, but changed his mind as he \\"got [the] character\\". He did a single take for the voice, which landed him the role. Ardyn makes a cameo appearance in Assassin's Creed: Origins as part of a franchise crossover between Square Enix and Ubisoft in 2017. He was added as a playable character for the crossover mobile title Dissidia Final Fantasy: Opera Omnia in 2019, and the fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy NT in 2020. =Gladiolus Amicitia= , or Gladio to his close friends, is the protagonist of Episode Gladiolus. The eldest son of a noble family pledged to the protection of the Lucian royal family, being Noctis's guardian as his father Claris was to Regis. While initially Gladiolus disliked Noctis for his cold attitude when they first met as children, he warmed up to Noctis keeping his sister Iris safe and the two developed a brotherly relationship. During the course of the story, Gladiolus serves as both Noctis' most loyal companion and a foil for his impulsive nature. He is briefly demoralized when he is easily defeated by Ravus and left the party to go on a personal quest in Episode Gladiolus to grow his strength. The events at Altissia and Ignis' injury drive a brief wedge between Gladiolus and Noctis until Ignis forces a reconciliation. Gladiolus and Ignis later make their way through the Niflheim fortress Zegnautus Keep after being separated from Noctis, encountering the Daemon form of Niflheim's emperor Iedolas Aldercapt and seeing footage of Ravus' death. Gladiolus, along with Noctis' other companions, become Daemon Hunters until his return, and accompany him to the final battle against Ardyn. Gladiolus' design and role was established from an early stage: as the King's Shield, he was more than a part of Noctis' entourage, having trained all his life to protect and at times chastise the current Lucian king. With this in mind, he was given a muscular design and an outspoken personality, with his other hobbies and quirks fitted in around that. Gladiolus's original design was dubbed a \\"straight muscleman\\" by Naora, but was redesigned to appear more intellectual for Final Fantasy XV. His eyes were also narrowed to give him a \\"sultry gaze off into the distance\\". For the musculature of his chest and midriff, which was designed to appear realistic and in keeping with his lifelong training, martial artists and other similar real-life figures were used as references. Gladiolus is voiced by Kenta Miyake in Japanese and Chris Parson in English. When deciding upon Gladiolus' English vocal performance, Inoue's guideline was to make him sound like a young version of John McClane, the main protagonist of the Die Hard film series. Parson found voicing Gladiolus odd, as his physique and personality were almost the exact opposite to the character. =Ignis Scientia= , or Iggy to his close friends, is the protagonist of Episode Ignis. Raised alongside Noctis to be his advisor and provided with an extensive education, he developed a collected composure and tactical instinct. Ignis acts as Noctis' confidant and helper, forming a deep connection to Noctis during their youth when Noctis begins realizing his eventual fate of becoming king. Ignis is blinded during the battle with Leviathan, when he wields the Ring of the Lucii to drive Ardyn away from an unconscious Noctis. His blindness causes tension within the group until he forces a reconciliation. Like Noctis's other companions, Ignis becomes a Daemon Hunter, and accompanies Noctis to the final battle against Ardyn. Ignis' personality was designed to be expressed in his looks, the way he spoke, and his gestures. His role as the party's cook came about when considering which among them would be most likely to take up that duty. His cooking skills are explained in-game to exchanges with Noctis during their early lives. Out of the main cast, Ignis went through the fewest changes despite the technological improvements that occurred during the shift from Versus XIII and Final Fantasy XV. To reflect his position as Noctis's protector from a young age, he was made to look more toned and his musculature was developed, particularly around the neck. Care was taken to retain his intellectual look. For Ignis' English version, Inoue wrote him to be a suave and logical character like a younger version of James Bond or Sherlock Holmes. Ignis is voiced by Mamoru Miyano in Japanese and Adam Croasdell in English. =Prompto Argentum= is the protagonist of Episode Prompto. He is a friend of Noctis from a lower-class family, dating back to their teenage years. On their journey, Prompto acts to lighten the atmosphere of the party, taking on burdens for others and lifting their spirits with his antics. Initially a shy and obese child when he first met Noctis at school, a chance encounter with one of Lunafreya's messenger dogs prompted Lunafreya to ask him to be Noctis' friend—Prompto slims down and builds up his confidence, ending up firm friends with Noctis when they meet in high school. During their journey to Niflheim, Ardyn tricks Noctis into knocking Prompto from the train, leading to his capture by Niflheim's forces. Upon being found, Prompto reveals that he is actually from Niflheim, a baby designed to become a Magitek soldier but was spirited away to Lucis. Like the other companions, Prompto became a Daemon Hunter during the ten-year wait and accompanied Noctis to Insomnia for the final battle. A major element of Prompto's character is his humble origins when compared to Gladiolus and Ignis's aristocratic families, with his less cultured mannerisms being an obvious embodyment of that. Prompto's facial features and hairstyle underwent multiple redesigns, the more recent ones based on negative feedback from fans, so that he would have international appeal. The character was initially unpopular with series fans, so the team designed Prompto's photography hobby—and its subsequent gameplay and story interactions—as a way of making him useful and enabling each player to chronicle their journey through the game. Tabata later defined Prompto's camera as a manifestation of Prompto's wish to record Noctis and Lunafreya's journey. Prompto proved to be the starting point for Brotherhood, as producer Akio Ofuji conceived the series based around wanting to expand upon a backstory created by staff surrounding his difficult childhood. For Prompto's English performance, Inoue based him on the titular protagonist of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Prompto is voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara in Japanese and Robbie Daymond in English. Other characters =Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII= is the king of Lucis and Noctis's father. As the ruling king of Lucis, he safeguards the Crystal and protects Insomnia using a magical barrier called the Wall using the hereditary Ring of the Lucii. Maintaining the Wall drains Regis of his life energy, causing him to age rapidly. In Brotherhood, it is revealed that Regis fought off the Daemon that almost killed Noctis, but the two become estranged as Regis's health failed to meet the Wall's energy demands and Noctis had to come to terms with his future as Lucis's king. He fought against Ardyn in Episode Ardyn, almost dying at his hands. When Regis accepted Niflheim's peace offer despite knowing it is a trap, he sent Noctis away from the chaos that would ensue in the events of Kingsglaive. Losing the Ring of the Lucii when it was cut from his hand by Niflheim's General Glauca, Regis dies fighting the general despite Lunafreya wanting to save him. Regis reappears as one of the Lucii when Noctis sacrifices himself to end the Starscourge and destroy Ardyn, delivering the final blow. A character carried over from Versus XIII, Regis underwent a major redesign during development, becoming an older character in appearance. This was due to Regis's expanding role in Kingsglaive and the new technology available. The development team wanted to create a more expressive character and aged him to properly convey his stature as a king. Due to this, his in-game incarnation was redesigned to better fit with his portrayal in Kingsglaive. The redesign was also chosen as his original design no longer fit into the reworked story of Final Fantasy XV. Regis's motion capture and physical model were provided by British actor Jon Campling. Regis features as the lead playable character in the spin-off title A King's Tale, portrayed as a fairy tale told by Regis to a young Noctis. Regis is voiced by Tsutomu Isobe in Japanese and Jim Pirri in English; in Kingsglaive, Regis's English voice actor was Sean Bean. =Aranea Highwind= is the commodore of Niflheim's Third Army Z-Corps 87th Airborne Units, a group of Daemon hunters and mercenaries employed by Niflheim. Due to her prowess in aerial combat, she is known as \\"the Dragoon\\". Over the course of the story, she becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the empire's actions—particularly in capturing Daemons for experimentation—and ultimately severs ties with them, instead using her resources to aid refugees. She later appears in Episode Prompto, sent by Noctis to find Prompto. She chastises Prompto for doubting Noctis and refuses his help in fighting Verstael until he overcomes it. In The Dawn of the Future, Aranea helps Niflheim citizens escape and takes down a Diamond Weapon, later aiding Lunafreya and Noctis in their battle against Bahamut. Aranea was designed by Ferrari. Compared to other characters, Aranea—who was designed in mid-2010—underwent very few changes during the game's development. The only notable change was to her weapon, which was altered as it was deemed \\"unsuitable\\". Two characters closely connected to her, Biggs and Wedge, originally had major roles with unique designs; they were eventually reduced to a minor role with Niflheim NPC character models. Aranea was voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in Japanese and Kari Wahlgren in English. =Cor Leonis= is the Marshal of the Crownsguard and a famous warrior of Lucis known as , a name he earned when a teenager for being the only survivor of a Lucian squad that encountered the supernatural swordsman Gilgamesh and managed to cut off his arm despite losing his sword to him. He fought alongside King Regis against the forces of Niflheim in his youth, being friends with Gladious's father Clarus. He helps the party early on in Noctis's hunt for the Royal Arms, magical weapons tied to Noctis's family. In Comrades, he continues to support the Kingsglaive, halting any search for Noctis on orders from Gentiana. He later rallies the soldiers of Lucis around Noctis when he returns, and helps him directly during the assault on Insomnia. Cor was one of the characters created for Versus XIII, initially designed as the fifth permanent playable character who joined the group during the course of the game. When transitioning from Versus XIII to Final Fantasy XV, Cor was retained, but his role was reduced to a non-playable mentor figure. This was because the team decided to focus on the dynamics within the core group of similarly-aged men, feeling that an older man would not be compatible with their plans. His character went otherwise unchanged. He acts as a temporary party member during certain points, following the party in order to protect the prince and his group, occasionally joining them in battle. Cor's Japanese voice actor, Hiroki Tōchi, was originally cast as Noctis's chauffeur in Versus XIII before its transition to Final Fantasy XV. The character was voiced in English by Matthew Mercer. Cor, depicted as a mature background figure of authority, was a character Mercer had not played before in his career. =Iris Amicitia= is the younger sister of Gladiolus and a childhood friend of Noctis. When she was a child, Noctis shielded her from trouble when she got lost in the grounds of Regis's palace; her later confession to Gladiolus helped soften his view of Noctis. She escaped Insomnia during Niflheim's invasion, taking refuge in Lestallum. Iris is depicted as having a carefree attitude and is close to all four of the party members; particularly Noctis, whom she has a crush on. During Noctis's slumber, Iris becomes one of the most notorious Daemon hunters in the world, being dubbed \\"the Daemon Slayer\\". Iris is voiced by Megumi Han in Japanese and Eden Riegel in English. =Iedolas Aldercapt= is the emperor of Niflheim and an antagonist in XV. At the game's beginning he has withdrawn from frontline politics, delegating the task of administrating his empire to Ardyn. Nevertheless, he retains an active role within Niflheim's political scene. Aldercapt's ambition is to use the Crystal to grant Niflheim world domination. In The Dawn of the Future, it is revealed Aldercapt's attitude was born from the loss of his family during the war against Lucis, and Ardyn's manipulation. Aldercapt is eventually infected by Ardyn with the Starscourge, transforming into the Daemon Foras before being killed by Noctis. Aldercapt is voiced by Shōzō Iizuka in Japanese; in English, he is voiced by Bob Joles in Final Fantasy XV and David Gant in Kingsglaive. =Ravus Nox Fleuret= is Lunafreya's older brother and a former prince of Tenebrae. He bears a grudge against Lucis and the Caelum dynasty for abandoning his homeland, joining the imperial army in order to exact his revenge. During the events of Kingsglaive, Ravus attends the treaty-signing as part of Niflheim's delegation, subsequently participating in the empire's invasion of Lucis. He attempts to wield the Ring of the Lucii, but it rejects him and destroys his arm. Upon the death of General Glauca, Ravus is promoted to high commander of Niflheim's armies, with his maimed arm replaced by a Magitek prosthesis. While appearing antagonistic, it is revealed that he merely deemed Noctis unworthy and resented Lunafreya worsening her health on his behalf. After Lunafreya asks him to give Noctis Regis' sword, Ravus is labeled an enemy of the empire for his failure to contain the summoning of Leviathan, leading to his defecting to Noctis's side. Ravus is then killed by Ardyn and resurrected as a partially transformed Daemon which the party defeats. Ravus is voiced by Yūichi Nakamura in Japanese and Trevor Devall in English. =Verstael Besithia= is the head researcher of Niflheim, and the \\"father\\" of Prompto, a promising scientist in his youth who developed the Magitek army from Solheim's lost technology to reduce casualties in his people's war against Lucis. More than thirty years before the game's events, Verstael uncovered the dormant Ifrit and freed Ardyn from his prison, seeing them as a means to end the war with Lucis and to acquire immortality. In the main storyline, Verstael is seen persuading Emperor Aldercapt to capture Lunafreya alive as he believed the Oracle could have potential use in her link to the Astrals. In Episode: Prompto, it is revealed Verstael used the Starscourge and his own DNA to create Magitek soldiers, along with other Daemon weapons. Verstael reveals Prompto's origins as a clone retrieved by Lucis, goading his \\"son\\" into shooting him. Upon his death he uploads his consciousness into his final magitek invention, Immortalis, intending to conquer the world in his new body before being eventually destroyed by Prompto with Aranea's help. He is voiced by Jin Urayama in Japanese and Steve Blum in English. His younger version in Episode Ardyn is voiced in Japanese by Noriaki Sugiyama. =Kingsglaive= The is an elite group dedicated to protecting Regis. They are empowered with abilities similar to those of the Lucian royal line. Following Regis's acceptance of Niflheim's peace, there is dissension among the ranks, and several turn traitor. The Kingsglaive survivors are the main protagonists of Comrades, helping defend survivors from the growing Daemon numbers and receiving forgiveness from Bahamut in return for protecting Noctis during his ten-year slumber. They join with Noctis in a final assault on Insomnia during the final battle. During early production, Ferrari had created a group of similar figures to the Kingsglaive, though they were themed after ninjas. The character Umbra was supposed to be one of the group, but these plans were changed. The characters of Kingsglaive were designed to be relatable, playing into the movie's themes. * is the main protagonist of Kingsglaive, and a member of the titular elite guard that defends Lucis from the invading forces of Niflheim. Having lost his mother and sister in his youth when his hometown of Galahd was conquered by the empire, Nyx developed a fierce loyalty to Regis when rescued by the king. During the events of Kingsglaive, Nyx is appointed as Lunafreya's protector and eventually learns of Niflheim's plot. He subsequently sacrifices himself by using the Ring of the Lucii to enable Lunafreya's escape. Nyx is voiced by Gō Ayano in Japanese and Aaron Paul in English. *, also known as General , acts as both the Kingsglaive leader and the main antagonist of the movie. Originally loyal to Lucis, the destruction of his home town by Niflheim after Regis withdrew to the fortified capital caused him to ally with Niflheim in an act of vengeance. He is responsible for the deaths of the previous Queen of Tenebrae and Oracle Sylva Via Fleuret, as well as King Regis, and dies fighting Nyx during the destruction of Insomnia. Drautos was voiced by Kōichi Yamadera in Japanese. In English, he was voiced by Adrian Bouchet in Kingsglaive and Matthew Waterson in Final Fantasy XV. * is a member of the Kingsglaive and Nyx's childhood friend, hailing from the same home town. He is among those disillusioned by King Regis's acceptance of Niflheim's offer of an armistice, defecting to the rebels when his friend Crowe is killed. However, upon witnessing the destruction Niflheim has wrought and learning of Drautos's secret identity Libertus returns to aid Nyx, escorting Lunafreya to Insomnia's borders so she can escape. Libertus also acts as a key guide for the Kingsglaive survivors in Comrades. He is voiced by Mitsuaki Kanuka in Japanese and Liam Mulvey in English. * is considered the unofficial leader of the Kingsglaive, having gained much trust within the group. While openly loyal, Luche is the leader of dissenters among the Kingsglaive, and leads their attempt to kill Nyx and Lunafreya. When he corners and wounds Nyx, Lunafreya tricks him into wearing the Ring of the Lucii, which burns him to ashes. Luche is voiced by Tomokazu Seki in Japanese and Todd Haberkorn in English. * is a powerful mage within the Kingsglaive and Libertus's friend. Having lost her family, she considers the Kingsglaive her family, and shares a sibling bond with Libertus. She is sent by Regis on a mission to accompany Lunafreya, but she is killed by Luche; her death prompts Libertus to leave the Kingsglaive. Crowe is voiced by Ayumi Fujimura in Japanese and by Alexa Kahn in English. =Astrals= The , also called the Hexatheon, are six beings worshipped by the people of Eos as deities. The six are Bahamut, Shiva, Ifrit, Titan, Ramuh and Leviathan. In ancient times, the Astral Ifrit acted as a patron of humankind, but when they rebelled against the Astrals, Ifrit flew into a destructive rage that threatened Eos. This triggered the Great War of Old, which only ended after Bahamut felled Ifrit. Ifrit was recovered by Niflheim, and ended up corrupted and enslaved to Ardyn. In her quest to aid Noctis, Lunafreya ensures the Astrals will lend him their power by forming pacts dubbed \\"Covenants\\". In Comrades, the Astrals witness Bahamut's trial of the Kingsglaives on the island of Angelgard, meeting place of the Astrals. Noctis's group fights a corrupted Ifrit, while the other Astrals aid in the assault on Insomnia, then unite their power with Noctis to destroy the Starscourge and Ardyn. In The Dawn of the Future, the Astrals turn against Bahamut when he threatens Eos, uniting with Noctis, Lunafreya and Ardyn to destroy him; while the Starscourge is eradicated, Bahamut's death causes magic and the other Astrals to vanish from Eos. In the original lore of Versus XIII, inspired by the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, god-like beings called the fal'Cie existed separately from the summons. The summon Leviathan's design was the earliest completed for the game. During production, the mythos terminology was removed and the mythos gradually shifted to become a thematic base for original lore. As used in Final Fantasy XV, the Astrals were designed to play integral parts in the story and world as opposed to being simple monsters to be called into battle. They were intelligent beings that Noctis needed to forge a pact with rather than simply commanding them. Due to their key role in the story, the staff chose traditional Final Fantasy summons instead of creating ones unique to the game. In gameplay, four of the Astrals—Titan, Ramuh, Leviathan and Shiva—act as regular summons during the game, triggered based on the local environment and Noctis's situation. *, also known as the Glacian and the Frostbringer, is the Goddess of Ice. She is seen through most of the game as Lunafreya's human attendant . Originally hostile towards humanity, Ifrit changed her views, though she took sides against him during the Great Wer of Old. Her faith in humanity was further rekindled by Lunafreya, and she willingly aided Noctis through his quest. When Ardyn enslaved Ifrit, Shiva woke to protect him and her Astral body felled by Niflheim's troops. She later joins the other Astrals in aiding Noctis's entry to Insomnia, and deals the finishing blow to the infected Ifrit after Ardyn sets him against Noctis. In The Dawn of the Future, she directly rebels against Bahamut out of liking for Lunafreya and Noctis. Shiva is voiced by Sayaka Kinoshita in Japanese, and Renee Faia in English. *, also known as the Infernian and the Pyreburner, is the God of Fire. Originally a patron of humanity who granted them the gift of fire and founded the Solheim civilisation, humanity's betrayal turns him hostile. He is corrupted by Ardyn upon awakening, becoming enthralled to the Starscourge. He features as both the penultimate boss of Final Fantasy XV, and a boss fight in Comrades. In The Dawn of the Future, Lunafreya cleanses Ifrit of the Starscourge, and he aids Noctis in the final battle with Bahamut. Ifrit is voiced by Yasuhiro Mamiya in Japanese and John Kassir in English. *, also known as the Draconian and the Bladekeeper, is the God of War and leader of the Astrals. When the Starscourge ravaged Eos, he planned the events leading to the main game to permanently destroy the plague; to that end he gifted the Crystal and the Ring of the Lucii to the Caelum dynasty, and his trident to the Fleuret family. He summons Ardyn--and later, Noctis--to his domain to explain to each their role as sacrifices to end the Starscourge, aiding the latter in his battle against the revived and corrupted Ifrit. Bahamut takes on the role of main antagonist in Dawn of the Future, resolving to purge the planet to eradicate the Scarscourge after Ardyn refuses his role. Noctis and Lunafreya ally with Ardyn and defeat Bahamut. Bahamut is voiced by Itaru Yamamoto in Japanese and David Lodge in English. Bahamut makes a cameo appearance in Assassin's Creed: Origins as part of a franchise crossover between Square Enix and Ubisoft in 2017. *, also known as the Hydraean and the Tidemother, is the Goddess of the Seas. She is awakened from beneath the city of Altissia by Lunafreya, going on a rampage upon being attacked by Niflheim until Noctis is empowered by Lunafreya and defeats her. She later aids Noctis both on his journey to Niflheim and in the final battle. Leviathan is voiced by Urara Takano in Japanese and Candi Milo in English. *, also known as the Archaean and the Landforger, is the God of Earth. Located near the town of Lestallum, Titan is the first Astral to lend his power to Noctis. He later protects Noctis and the dying Lunafreya from Leviathan's rampage in Altissia, before joining the other Astrals in the final battle. Titan is voiced by Kenichiro Matsuda in Japanese and Ike Amadi in English. *, also known as the Fulgurian and the Stormsender, is the God of the Storms and overseer of Eos's natural laws. He was woken from his slumber on Angelgard by Lunafreya. Noctis acquires him by completing a trial in the region of Duscae, and appears with the other Astrals during Noctis's final battle. Minor characters * and his granddaughter are supporting characters who act as mechanics for Noctis's car. In his youth, Cid fought alongside Regis and Cor against the forces of Niflheim. The pair also support the repentant Kingsglaive during the events of Comrades. Cid is voiced by Nobuyuki Katsube in Japanese and Jack Angel in English; Cindy is voiced by Yū Shimamura in Japanese and Erin Matthews in English. * and are minor antagonists, serving as Brigadier Generals in Niflheim's army. Loqi has a long-standing antagonism with Cor, and both pursue Noctis and threaten his allies. Caligo is killed by Ravus in the aftermath of Leviathan's rampage. In The Dawn of the Future, Loqi sacrifices himself to defend fleeing citizens from Daemons. Loqi is voiced by Takashi Ohara/Jason Spisak, while Caligo is voiced by Itaru Yamamoto/Rick Zieff. * and are two dogs who act as companions to and messengers for Noctis and Lunafreya. They are two of the twenty-four Messengers, beings who serve as intermediaries between humanity and the Astrals. Prompto helped an injured Pryna in his youth, indirectly leading to his friendship with Noctis. Pryna dies along with Lunafreya in Altissia, but she manifests for Prompto to guide him during the events of Episode Prompto. Umbra continues to watch Noctis, giving him a message after he wakes from his ten-year slumber in the Crystal and appearing in Insomnia following his final battle. * is one of the twenty- four Messengers, and features in both Final Fantasy XV and as a key character in Platinum Demo. Regis gifted Carbuncle to the young Noctis through a small mascot; Carbuncle's role is to guard and guide Noctis through his dreams. During Platinum Demo, Carbuncle guides the comatose Noctis through his dreams following a Daemon injury. Carbuncle was also featured in a supplementary manga titled Episode Carbuncle. * is a central character in Episode Gladiolus, and a version of a recurring Final Fantasy character. He served as Somnus's Shield in ancient times. He became an immortal being, challenging Lucian warriors in battle. He tests Gladiolus's worth, and grants him his favour and the weapon he took from Cor during their bout years before. He is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Tom Taylorson in English. *, referred to also as the Founder King and the Mystic, is Noctis's ancestor and Ardyn's younger brother. Somnus took a martial approach to quelling the Starscourge, subsequently taking Ardyn's place as the chosen king and accidentally killing Aera, expunging Ardyn's existence from history. He becomes one of the Lucii, and acts as the final boss of Episode Ardyn. In both Final Fantasy XV and The Dawn of the Future, Somnus's Lucii form aids in destroying the Starscourge. Somnus is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and Zach Villa in English. * is Lunafreya's ancestor, the first Oracle, and the fiancée of Ardyn. When Aera revealed to Somnus the identity of the chosen king, she was used to lure Ardyn into Somnus's trap, dying in the ensuing fight between the brothers. Her death would play a vital role in Ardyn's vendetta against Somnus's bloodline. In Dawn of the Future, Aera asks Lunafreya to save Ardyn, then meets him in the afterlife after Bahamut's defeat. Aera is voiced by Saori Seto in Japanese and Julie Nathanson in English. *, also called Sol, is a character from The Dawn of the Future. The secret grandchild of Iedolas Aldercapt, she is rescued from Nilfheim's capital Gralea by Aranea and Loqi as it falls to the Starscourge. During the next ten years later she becomes an experienced Daemon hunter, helping the revived Lunafreya and ultimately aiding in the final battle. Reception Six characters from Final Fantasy XV ranked in the Top 75 of NHK's \\"All-Final Fantasy Grand Poll of Japanese players\\" in 2020, which tallied over 468,000 votes; Noctis, Ignis, Prompto, Ardyn, Lunafreya and Aranea placed #13, #28, #38, #63, #69, and #75 respectively. Game Informer, in its \\"RPG of the Year\\" awards, awarded the \\"Best Cast\\" category to the leads of Final Fantasy XV and best sidekick to Ignis. In an article for ComicsVerse, Peter Swann noted that Final Fantasy XVs all-male cast helped challenge gender roles, focusing on Ignis's behavior during rest periods and the non-prejudice representation of Prompto's early obesity. He felt that this helped balance out any problems with female representation in the game. An article by the Perkins School for the Blind lauded the representation of Ignis's recovery from his blinding, citing it as a positive example of acclimatising to disability. Chris Carter of Destructoid enjoyed the playable cast, and felt other characters' presence within the narrative despite a lack of development. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Mollie L. Patterson cited the four lead characters as \\"the glue that keeps everything together even in the game’s worst periods\\", saying that they went beyond their stereotypes due to the amount of time spent with them, but faulting the representation of its female cast. Game Informers Andrew Reiner praised the portray of Noctis's burdens, and enjoyed the characters and the portrayal of their hobbies and interests. Game Revolutions Jonathan Leack felt the characters lacked development during the early sections of the game. Peter Brown of GameSpot enjoyed the grounded portrayal of the playable cast, but faulted the minimal representation of supporting characters despite portrayals in additional media. IGNs Vince Ingenito said the relationships within Noctis's party gave the game its only heart, as he felt its supporting cast was underused and its romantic elements poorly written. Philip Kollar of Polygon called Noctis's companions the game's \\"beating heart\\". Hardcore Gamers Adam Beck, while negative on the storyline and treatment of supporting characters, said the main cast \\"serve strong character building and chemistry\\". Reviewing Kingsglaive, Meghan Sullivan of IGN said the voicework helped make the lead cast believable, but faulted its handling of the secondary characters. Wireds Matt Kamen was highly critical of the story's treatment of its female characters, calling Lunafreya a stereotypical damsel-in-distress. In his review of Kingsglaive, Andrew Barker of Variety felt the \\"throwaway characters\\" were one of its biggest flaws. Polygons Ashley Oh felt there was a lack of character development compared to other Final Fantasy narratives. GamesRadar was more positive, praising its cast as relatable. Carter found the anime Brotherhood helped him become interested in the game's lead cast. GamesRadar called the anime \\"surprisingly well-written\\", praising its more intimate narrative compared to Kingsglaive. In a feature following the release of the anime's third episode, Michelle Nguyen of Geek.com praised the camaraderie between the leads and how the anime fleshed out Prompto's character, though he disliked the lack of female characters. Jenni Lada, writing for Siliconera, felt that the additional backstory and interactions shown in Brotherhood helped the main game's narrative work. Writing about Episode Gladiolus, Andrew Webster of The Verge found the character development lacking in the absence of Gladiolus's companions. RPGFans Peter Triezenberg enjoyed the interactions between Gladiolus and Cor. Reviews of Episode Prompto generally praised his portrayal and storyline despite some clichéd or clashing elements, and all lauded his interactions with Aranea. Carter called Episode Ignis the best DLC episode to that point, praising its relation to the main narrative as well as Ignis's portrayal. Triezenberg enjoyed the narrative, and felt the alternate storyline featured in the DLC provided some good character development for Ignis, Noctis and Ardyn. Mike Fahey from Kotaku praised Ardyn's portrayal as the setting's overarching antagonist, citing Episode Ardyn and its anime tie-in as highlights for his character development and making his vendetta against Noctis's family \\"fully justified\\". RPG Sites George Foster was very positive, saying the DLC \\"manages to turn a previously interesting, but oftentimes one- note villain, into a sympathetic figure\\". Hirun Cryer from USGamer was less positive, faulting Ardyn's overarching characterisation and saying Episode Ardyns narrative undermined the work done during the anime tie-in.

History Aeroprakt A-20 Vista Aeroprakt A-22 Foxbat Aeroprakt A-24 Viking Aeroprakt A-32 Vixxen Aeroprakt A-36 Vulcan The company was founded as an amateur aircraft design club by Yuri Yakovlev when he graduated from the Kuybyshev Aviation Institute and commenced work at Antonov in Kyiv in 1986. It was at the time of Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 that the company was formally formed. The company was named after a similar-named club in Kuybyshev, Russia, founded while Yakovlev was there at school. The company's first aircraft was the Aeroprakt T-8, a simple two-seat ultralight trainer. The prototype was constructed in 1987 and first shown in the Soviet Union in 1989, but did not enter series production, despite winning awards. The first true production aircraft was the Aeroprakt A-20 Vista known locally as the Chervonets, the first prototype of which was finished in August 1991. As a result of the design and the political situation at the time, the club became the Kyiv division of Lada-Mononor, a joint Soviet-Finnish venture that was headquartered in Tolyatti, Russia. Yuri Yakovlev was named the Chief Designer and Oleg Litovchenko became its director. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 the company became an independent entity and the A-20 entered production, with the first production aircraft delivered in July, 1993. November 1996 saw the introduction of the A-22 Foxbat, known locally as the Sharik () and the twin-engined A-26 Vulcan as well. The company has continued to develop new aircraft based on the A-20 concept, including the A-28 Victor and the A-36 Vulcan. In 2014 the A-32 Vixxen, a development of the A-22, was introduced.

He was killed during the Palmyra offensive of the Syrian Civil War. On 11 April 2016, President Vladimir Putin declared Prokhorenko a Hero of the Russian Federation, the highest Russian honor. His funeral with full military honors was held in his home village of Gorodki on 6 May 2016. Early life Prokhorenko was from the village of Gorodki in Orenburg Oblast. Prokhorenko was married and expecting his first child when he was killed in action. Military career In 2007, he graduated from the Gorodets secondary school with a silver medal and entered the Orenburg Higher Anti-Aircraft Missile School. In 2008, due to the closure of the school, he was transferred to the Military Academy of Military Air Defense of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, from which he graduated with honors. After graduating from the academy, he was assigned to the position of an advanced aviation gunner in the group of the Special Operations Forces of the Russian Federation. Since January 2016, he took part in the Russian military operation in Syria as a forward observer tasked to carry out the acquisition of airstrikes at Islamic State militant positions. Death Prokhorenko was deployed in Syria when he was killed during the Palmyra offensive. It took weeks to retrieve and identify his body. He was nicknamed the Russian Rambo by Russian state media and buried with military pomp. He was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation for reportedly calling in an airstrike on his own position, after being surrounded by ISIS militants.  Commemoration  Chkalovsky airfieldleft Prokhorenko's body was recovered and repatriated in coordination with Kurdish YPG forces. According to the Russian Defence Ministry, his body arrived in Moscow on 29 April and a spokesperson stated his repatriation \\"was a matter of honor for the Russian Defence Ministry\\". The authorities of Orenburg decided to name one of the city's streets after Prokhorenko in his honor and a teacher at Prokhorenko's former school is reported as saying that she and others now wanted to rename the Gorodetskoy Middle School after him. On 5 May 2016 a concert was performed by musicians from St. Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre orchestra in the Roman Theatre at Palmyra in Syria conducted by Valery Gergiev. The concert was dedicated to the memory of Alexander Prokhorenko. The theatre is a UNESCO-listed site. In November 2015, ISIS had used the theatre site as a setting for the execution of Syrian soldiers. Two retired French citizens, Micheline Mague and Daniel Couture, paid tribute to Prokhorenko by donating World War II era military medals to his family. Micheline Mague and her husband Jean-Claude traveled to Russia and presented the medals to his parents, Alexander and Natalia Prokhorenko, and his brother, Ivan, in a meeting at the Russian Defense Ministry. Mague gave a Legion of Honour (Ordre National de la Légion d'honneur) and a Cross of War (Croix de Guerre) with a bronze palm. The awards belonged to close family members who fought in World War II. Daniel Couture sent the Legion of Honour which belonged to his father, a member of the French Resistance. Couture stated in a letter that he felt that Prokhorenko died defending not only Russia and France, but all other countries who are menaced by terrorism. He also wished to honor the Russian people \\"who had brought their decisive contribution to the victory over Nazi Germany.\\" The \\"Ordre National de la Legion d’Honneur\\" (Legion of Honour) is the highest French order for military and civil merits.

Its purpose was to assure the doctors and nurses who took part in the euthanasia program would not be prosecuted for murder. During the postwar trials of these same individuals, they attempted to use this decree as a justification for their actions. Background In July 1939 Hitler gave Karl Brandt and Philipp Bouhler the task of organizing the adult euthanasia program. (The children's euthanasia program had already begun in 1938.) In late July and August 1939, and Brandt and Bouhler assembled a group of doctors, all of whom were staunch advocates of euthanasia, to attend a series of meetings in Berlin that would help them plan and execute the adult euthanasia program. Bouhler told them that euthanizing the mentally disabled would create hospital space for the impending war and free up doctors to care for the wounded. He also told them that Hitler had not published a euthanasia law because it would used as propaganda against Germany but reassured them that they would not be prosecuted for participating in the euthanasia program. However, there were still concerns about the legality of euthanasia, as under German law illegally killing a human being was a capital offense. At a meeting about the euthanasia program in September 1939, Hans Heinrich Lammers, head of the Reich Chancellery (German: Reichskanzlei) and Hitler's legal advisor, pushed for the euthanasia program to have a solid legal basis. According to Lammers, Hitler gave him the task of drafting a euthanasia law, but Hitler decided not to promulgate the law because he was afraid that it would cause an uproar. Since there would be no law formally authorizing the euthanasia program, doctors, nurses, and public health officials were afraid of criminal liability if they participated in it. To assuage their fears, Hitler's Chancellery (German: Kanzlei des Führers or KdF) asked Hitler to authorize the euthanasia program in writing. He agreed, and the KdF prepared a written statement on his own stationery. He signed it in October 1939 but backdated it to September 1, 1939. The memorandum itself Use in postwar trials When those who had participated in the euthanasia program were tried and charged with murder following the end of the war in 1945, they appealed to this decree, arguing that it gave their actions a legal basis. However, while American military tribunals accepted the decree as a legal basis for euthanasia, no West German court accepted the degree as a valid law. =Hadamar trial= In the U.S. Hadamar trial of October 1945, the Americans prosecuted seven defendants who had worked at the Hadamar Euthanasia Centre. However, they did not charge them with murdering the mentally disabled but rather with killing Polish and Russian workers who were sick with tuberculosis. The Americans presumed that the euthanasia program had a legal basis in German law (the \\"Memorandum Authorizing Involuntary Euthanasia\\"), meaning that for the Americans, prosecuting the staff at Hadamar for killing the mentally disabled would infringe on the sovereignty of the Third Reich. In their trials of German war criminals and perpetrators of atrocities, the Americans were concerned above all to maintain U.S. sovereignty by not setting a precedent for one nation to interfere in the domestic affairs of another.

He is a playable character and main protagonist of Final Fantasy XV, originally a spin-off titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII. The crown prince and protector of Lucis, Noctis and his allies must reclaim their country when the empire of Niflheim attacks Lucis in an attempt to take control of its magical Crystal. Alongside Final Fantasy XV, Noctis has appeared in the game's expanded media, including Final Fantasy crossover titles, and other game titles including Puzzle & Dragons and the fighting game Tekken 7. Noctis was created and co-designed by Tetsuya Nomura, with later design revisions being handled by Yusuke Naora. Nomura created Noctis as a type of protagonist not featured in a leading role in the Final Fantasy series before. He also wanted his personality to be unique in the series, being unlike protagonists like Cloud Strife or Squall Leonhart, instead focusing more on realism. Noctis' clothes were designed by Hiromu Takahara, lead designer for Japanese fashion house Roen. His clothing was created to be both asymmetric, mirroring the fashion house's trademark style, and indicative of the game's themes and atmosphere. Before his design was finalized, Noctis was given a story-inspired temporary outfit used in early trailers. Since his original reveal, Noctis has been compared with other asocial characters seen in the series' other games based on his appearance. Following the release of the game, Noctis has been positively received by journalists, with many noting his growth over the course of the story, and contrasting him against other Final Fantasy protagonists. His appearances in both the expanded media of Final Fantasy XV and other games have gathered multiple types of responses. Character design Noctis as he appears in the first trailer for Final Fantasy Versus XIII, showing his placeholder design. Noctis was created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura, the original director of Final Fantasy XV. XV was originally titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII, planned as a series spin-off within the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries and companion to Final Fantasy XIII. Nomura did not want Noctis to look strong, instead being used more to communicate the darkness in the story, which caused some difficulties for the team. His full name loosely translates from Latin into \\"Light of [the] Night Sky\\"; his nickname, Noct, translates as \\"of the Night\\". Noctis's name was not going to be based on the sky or weather, as with previous protagonists designed by Nomura. After Lightning, the main protagonist of Final Fantasy XIII, was given a weather-based name, Nomura gave Noctis his current name. This name was also a reference to Sora, the main protagonist of the Kingdom Hearts series; Sora and Caelum both mean \\"sky\\" in their respective languages, and Nomura considered Noctis to be his latest \\"son\\". Noctis' adult appearance was designed by art co-director Yusuke Naora. A major departure from Noctis' character in contrast to previous Japanese role-playing games' protagonists was his ageing across Final Fantasy XV. Despite fears of how it would be received by fans, the Square Enix staff decided to make this change. Tabata further elaborated that it \\"felt that it was important in communicating [the party's] development and wanting to express it in a way that we only can with the current generation of consoles.\\" When creating the development of Noctis' facial features over time, the team drew from pictures of war veterans and actors to add finer details to help mature the character's expression. They also designed Noctis' features so they would hold similarities to Regis, reflecting the game's theme of the father-son relationship. While the game changed names, platforms and eventually directors, Nomura worked with new director Hajime Tabata to ensure that Noctis remained as unchanged as possible in the final product. Alterations and adjustments made to his character model were supervised by Naora. The main goal was to make Noctis appear more realistic: his skin texture was enhanced and subtleties added to its depiction and the effect of different lighting on it, in addition to adding elements such as subtle birthmarks and skin blotches. One of the major goals was keeping the same character impression while making adjustments and enhancements, as series fans already had a concept of who the character was. His hair's shadow effects needed to be adjusted after the upgrade in technology so they did not cast too much shade on his face, but the hairstyle itself was kept consistent. His hairstyle was meant to give two impressions to the player: from the front it was ordered, while from the rear it looked wild. In order to make his hair movements realistic, the team worked with a professional hairstylist to create the design using a mannequin's wig, then used the Luminous Engineto render it in real-time. The technique was originally used for the characters in the engine's 2012 tech demo Agni's Philosophy. The character's clothing was designed by Hiromu Takahara, the main designer at Japanese fashion house Roen. Takahara's key inspiration for the style and coloring of the clothing was \\"jet black\\", which was meant to exemplify and be representative of the game's atmosphere. In addition, Takahara designed the outfit along the same lines as the asymmetric designs common to Roen's clothing lines. His outfit was designed to make Noctis look like someone who went to a high-class pub. Unlike previous Final Fantasy protagonists, a real set of Noctis' clothes was created by Roen and kept in the office for reference by the development staff: this was due to previous experiences when Nomura had been constantly asked what materials his characters' outfits were made of by the graphics teams. An aspect of his design central to the story was a ring he wore on his right hand, while the gloves he wore were simply for \\"design purposes\\". Noctis's outfit when the game was first revealed was a temporary one used while his final look was being created. It was based on the game's script to give a visual impression in trailers. Takahara also designed a formal suit worn by the character in the original opening section of the game. All Roen designs, including Noctis' suit, were retained when Versus XIII was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV as the team felt wrong about removing them despite the other changes. Attributes While originally one of four controllable characters in Versus XIII, Noctis is the sole playable character in Final Fantasy XV. He is also the only character who can use summoned monsters, recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series. Noctis has the power to manipulate multiple weapons at once; his Limit Break \\"Armiger\\" further enables him to summon crystalline weapons known as \\"Royal Arms\\" into battle. In the story, these powers are passed down through the royal line of Lucis. During an earlier stage of development, Noctis was the only character in the world of XV that could use magic. As this would not have worked from a gameplay standpoint, the team engineered it so Noctis' companions could share Noctis' magic abilities. During certain points during both story scenes and gameplay, Noctis' eyes turn from their natural blue color to red. This feature was present in both Versus XIII and Final Fantasy XV. =Personality= Nomura did not want Noctis to have a personality like Squall Leonhart or Cloud Strife, the respective protagonists of Final Fantasy VIII and VII, defining their personality type as that of \\"a silent, gloomy little boy\\". Instead, Nomura wanted to create a realistic character type not seen in the Final Fantasy series before. Because of this, he was wary about him as he was so new to the series that he might fall \\"out of bounds\\". Whereas previous protagonists did not have strong personalities to avoid interfering with player empathy, Nomura wanted Noctis to have \\"an overabundance of idiosyncrasy\\", which was one of the ways he would leave an impression on the player. Nomura also wanted the character to have traits and perform actions that bore both heroic and villainous traits, creating someone akin to an anti- hero. He thought that these qualities would match the game's themes very well. While naturally shy, Noctis hides this under a cold exterior, though his close friends can see through this. A key scene that demonstrated his personality in Versus XIII was his first meeting with Stella Nox Fleuret, the original heroine of Final Fantasy Versus XIII. According to Tabata, Noctis' cool mannerisms and reserved exterior stem from his lonely childhood, in addition to a fear of losing those closest to him. His words and actions stem from a fear of disappointing those around him, causing him to work to both fulfill expectations and bring people happiness as a result. When comparing the personalities of Noctis and Lunafreya, Tabata referred to Noctis as the weaker of the two, remarking that he is the one who needs protection instead of her. A key part of his narrative is Noctis' transition from prince to king during his journey. According to scenario writer Saori Itamuro, Noctis faces the future as king with both dread and acceptance as he was brought up to expect such an event. This part of his story influenced aspects of his appearance. =Voice actors= Noctis is voiced in Japanese by Tatsuhisa Suzuki as an adult, and by Miyuki Satō as a child. Suzuki was cast in 2009, seven years prior to the game's final release and when the project was still titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII. When he was first voicing the character, Suzuki said Noctis was far more introverted, speaking with a gruff manner and showing little sympathy for those beyond his immediate circle. When the change was made to Final Fantasy XV, Suzuki worked with the production team to create a new persona for the character, who became more outgoing and emotional. For the final game, Suzuki recorded his lines together with the rest of the central cast. To aid his performance, Suzuki modeled it on the stage mannerisms of Kurt Cobain, lead singer of the grunge band Nirvana. While he did not do continuous work on the game due to the game development's \\"twists and turns\\", he found himself constantly keeping the character in mind so he could easily portray him when it was time to record voicework for the game. According to Suzuki, some of the recording work he did for Versus XIII survived and was incorporated into Final Fantasy XV. When voicing the character for Brotherhood, Suzuki—who had established a good rapport with the main cast—talked with them about how to shift their portrayals for the altered storytelling medium. For the English localization, Noctis is voiced by Ray Chase as an adult, and by Hyrum Hansen as a child. Localization lead writer Dan Inoue's English interpretation of the character was based by Suzuki's own influence. Speaking about his role, Chase was told that rather than create an English version of the Japanese performance outside a few select scenes, Chase was told to make a performance that would resonate with Western audiences. This resulted in Noctis' English version being noticeably different from the Japanese. If anything seemed wrong, localization directors Inoue and Keythe Farley would call Chase in to re-record lines of dialogue. Noctis was not only Chase's first Final Fantasy character, but his first major role in a video game project. He was initially shocked when he received the call that he would be voicing Noctis. Group recording efforts were discontinued due to the need to roughly match the English dialogue to precisely match timing for the Japanese performances. Only one scene was recorded with several English actors together: the opening scene of the game, where Noctis sets out on his journey. English voice work was included for Episode Duscae, but it was cut close in terms of production scheduling. During the ROM checking stage, Tabata saw that the performance was wrong for the character, a feeling reflected in player feedback after the demo's release. As it was too late to re-record, the performance was carried into the demo. Tabata commented that the original performance made the character sound too old, comparing it to Batman. After release, the voice work was redone to show the character's youth and charm, along with his \\"sense of ennui\\". Due to the feedback from Episode Duscae, the staff considered recasting Noctis's role, but instead Chase worked with the localization team to find a different voice for Noctis. After putting together a demo reel of Chase performing a variety of lines, Tabata listened and picked the one he thought best suited for the character. The most emotional part of the original recording for Chase was Noctis's final farewell to his comrades during a post-credit scene, which for Chase also symbolized saying goodbye to the localization team. A piece of late-game dialogue that needed re-recording was during Noctis's scene on the throne of Lucis at the end of the game; Noctis initially sounded on the point of tears, but the performance was redone to emphasise his resolve.  Appearances  =Final Fantasy XV= Noctis Lucis Caelum is the only son and heir of King Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII of Lucis; the Caelum dynasty safeguards the Crystal, a divine artifact connected to the world's deities. When he was five years old, Noctis was chosen by the Crystal as the \\"True King\\", a prophesied figure who would purge Eos of the Starscourge, a plague that will trigger eternal darkness on Eos and turns living things into monstrous Daemons. At eight years old, Noctis is attacked by a Daemon and is sent to the nation of Tenebrae for healing, where he meets and bonds with the nation's princess Lunafreya Nox Fleuret. However, Noctis and Regis are forced to flee Tenebrae when it is attacked by the Niflheim Empire. By the events of Final Fantasy XV, Lucis is besieged by Niflheim, and Regis agrees to a ceasefire. As part of the treaty, Noctis will marry Lunafreya, and Regis dispatches him to Altissia where they are to be married. Following Noctis' departure, Niflheim attacks Lucis' capital Insomnia, steals the Crystal and kills Regis. Noctis—together with his three companions and sworn protectors Gladiolus Amicitia, Prompto Argentum and Ignis Scientia—sets out on a quest to retrieve the Crystal and defeat Niflheim. To fulfill his role, Noctis collects the Royal Arms, weapons of the ancient Lucian monarchs, from tombs across Lucis. He also gains the blessing of the Astrals, divine beings who granted the Crystal to the Lucian line—he is in turn aided by Lunafreya, her attendant Gentiana, and Niflheim's chancellor Ardyn Izunia. Ardyn is later revealed to be Ardyn Lucis Caelum, the immortal older brother of Noctis's ancestor Somnus, who swore revenge on both the Crystal and Somnus's bloodline because he became corrupted by the Starscourge. Noctis gains the favor of the Astrals Titan and Ramuh, but when he finally reaches Altissia and Lunafreya awakens the Astral Leviathan, Niflheim attacks and Ardyn mortally wounds Lunafreya, disrupting the ritual. With a last effort, she helps Noctis subdue Leviathan before giving him the Ring of the Lucii, an artifact through which he can access the Crystal's magic. Noctis heads for Niflheim's capital of Gralea, burdened by the loss of Lunafreya and tormented by Ardyn. Arriving in Gralea to find its population turned into Daemons, Noctis finds and is pulled into the Crystal. Noctis learns from the Astral Bahamut of Providence, a power borne from the combined might of the Crystal, the Royal Arms and the Ring of the Lucii capable of destroying the Starscourge forever, the price of wielding it being Noctis's own life. Waking up ten years later, Noctis reunites with his companions as they travel to Insomnia where they defeat the rogue Astral Ifrit and the enslaved Lucii before facing Ardyn. After defeating Ardyn in the physical world, Noctis sacrifices himself to fulfill his role as the True King by purging the Starscourge, destroying Ardyn's spirit in the afterlife with the aid of the Lucii. In the game's mid- credits and post-credit scenes, Noctis confesses his feelings for his friends during a rest before the final battle, and reunites with Lunafreya in the afterlife. =Related media= Noctis is one of the main characters in Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV, an original net animation following his early journey and the history of his companions. In the opening and concluding episodes, Noctis learns of the fall of Lucis and faces the Daemon that nearly killed him in his youth. Initially helpless against it, he draws strength from his friends and the memories of his father to kill the Daemon. Noctis also made a brief appearance in the CGI movie Kingsglaive, as a young child in a wheelchair, and during a post-credits scene at the beginning of his journey to Lestallum. Noctis is also the main character of the manga adaptation of Final Fantasy XV. Noctis would have been the central character of a future downloadable content (DLC) episode Episode Noctis: The Final Strike, the finale of a planned tetralogy of DLC episodes dubbed Dawn of the Future. Aside from the first planned installment Episode Ardyn, all other episodes were cancelled. The cancelled DLC was remade into novel Final Fantasy XV: The Dawn of the Future, which leads from an alternate ending to Episode Ardyn. In The Dawn of the Future, Noctis follows his destiny and enters the Crystal, learning the full truth behind Ardyn's past and Lunafreya's role. Outside, Ardyn has defied his role in Bahamut's plans, and Lunafreya is resurrected as part of a plan to purge Eos of life using Bahamut's \\"final summoning\\" Teraflare. Noctis ends up rebelling against Bahamut in his turn, allowing Ardyn to complete the ritual of Providence, destroying Bahamut's spiritual self while Noctis destroys Bahamut's physical form and saves Lunafreya. With both the Starscourt and magic gone from the world, the population sets about rebuilding, and Noctis marries Lunafreya. As a guest character, Noctis appears in Itadaki Street: Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy 30th Anniversary, as a playable character in the mobile spin-off Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, and the crossover fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy NT. Noctis' original costume created by Nomura for the first trailers of Versus XIII appear as downloadable content. Outside Final Fantasy, Noctis appears as a DLC character in Namco's fighting game Tekken 7 as a friend of Lars Alexandersson. Lars' voice actor, Junichi Suwabe, enjoyed the interactions between both Lars and Noctis. Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada commented it was his idea to include Noctis within the game, resurrecting old concepts for a series crossover dating back to the original PlayStation era. Additionally, Harada wanted to surprise fans by including an RPG character by adding it to a fighting game and thus had multiple discussions with Tabata in order to get the permission to feature him in Namco's game. In the making of the character, the developers wanted Noctis to emulate his techniques from Final Fantasy XV with their own hardware. He was created to be accessible to newcomers of the Tekken franchise. Nevertheless, they received a model to follow by Square Enix. Besides Noctis' regular costume, he wears an original hooded outfit created by the Namco staff. The other alterante outfits were created by Square Enix staff. Noctis was featured in a collaboration with Puzzle & Dragons. Noctis was parodied by Bkub Okawa, author of the comedy manga Pop Team Epic alongside Ignis as both characters received super deformed designs that parodied the two main characters from that series. Reception Video games publications have commented on Noctis' character. Once Final Fantasy XV was revealed to the audience, Todd Ciolek from Anime News Network said that Noctis was \\"your standard-issue brash anime kid in demeanor.\\" Daniella Lucas from GamesRadar compared him with Final Fantasy VIII main character, Squall Leonhart, based on his rebellious attitude as he lives \\"by his own rules\\" in contrast to the strict code of conduct set by his royal overseers. Similarly, Michelle Nguyen from Geek initially noted physical and mental similarities between Noctis and Narutos anti-hero and antisocial character, Sasuke Uchiha. However, she found Noctis was nicer but had a heavy burden that made him look cold. Nguyen praised the way Noctis became friends with the other characters. Like Nguyen, David Roberts from GamesRadar enjoyed Noctis' role in Brotherhood due to the way he develops to his relationships with his friends. Andrew Webster from The Verse noted while the characters appear to be cliche, the way Noctis became friends with them gave him a wish to play Final Fantasy XV and see how more do they develop. A Play Arts Kai figurine of Noctis was also developed. In an early preview of the game's demo Episode Duscae, GameSpot's Alexa Ray Corriae praised the interactions between Noctis and his companions, citing them as a good example of deep platonic love between men. In a review of Brotherhoods first episode, Meghan Sullivan from IGN also praised the interactions between the main characters, particularly finding comical how Noctis removed parts from his hamburger and this being discussed by his friends as whether or not they were spoiling him. Similarly, Destructoid's Chris Carter became attached to Noctis and his friends ever since the Brotherhood series and expects more from the video game. A fragrance was created in the character's image. There has been an internet meme focused on Noctis and his friends in the Regalia looking at photoshopped images. Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto found it comical and motivated fans to produce more in order to increase people's interest in Final Fantasy XV. Following the game's release, Dustin Bailey from Anime News Network praised the interactions between Noctis and his friends, commenting on \\"Noctis' brooding silence\\" to the point some scenes felt realistic. Carter shared similar points of comparing Noctis and his allies to the cast of Final Fantasy VI, a highly acclaimed title of the franchise. However, despite also agreeing with Bailey, Carter commented on the reason of how overpowered is Noctis which seemed \\"hokey\\". While agreeing with other reviewers regarding the appeal of Noctis and his allies, Philip Kollar from Polygon highly praised the ending Square gave to them in the game without spoiling too much to new gamers. Game Informer writer Andrew Reiner referred to Noctis as a \\"great leader\\" as well as \\"an interesting, conflicted character, torn between his duties to the kingdom and wanting a different life\\". Noctis has been seen as a \\"apathethic\\" in the trailers before the game's release by Becky Cunningham from Cheat Code Central. However, the reviewer found Noctis' characterization in Final Fantasy XVs actual title more enjoyable than in the previous trailers. Despite criticising some parts about the story such as the lack of explanation about Noctis not wanting to take over his kingdom, EGMNOW's Mollie L. Patterson praised how the character grew up alongside his adult design. In a Famitsu poll from 2017, Noctis was voted as the top most wanted character fans expect to be featured in another Square Enix's franchise, Kingdom Hearts. The Gamer listed Noctis as one of the most overpowered characters in Final Fantasy due to the multiple moves he learns across his game. In a NHK poll from 2020, Noctis was voted as the 14th best Final Fantasy character. Noctis' inclusion in the fighting game Tekken 7 as downloadable content earned multiple reactions. Rock, Paper, Shotgun found him fitting based on Noctis' and the rest of the cast's skills, and joked about his relationship with Tekken character Lars. Kotaku noted that the crowd of fans cheered for him when he was first announced. Engadget found his inclusion typical of Final Fantasy characters similar to Cloud when he was added to Super Smash Bros., despite finding it unfitting. Similarly, PCGamer compared Noctis' inclusion to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles appearing in another fighting game, Injustice 2, as Noctis did not originate from another fighting game like other guest characters. Writer from Kotaku agreed, with the latter addressing multiple complaints regarding how the fans wanted Kazuma Kiryu from Yakuza as a guest character instead. While finding this surprising, and stating there was \\"no logical justification\\", Sam Prell for Gamesradar wrote that fans might enjoy the addition of Noctis to Tekken 7, jokingly commenting that the only similarities between Noctis and Tekken characters were their hairstyles. Similarly, Den of Geek was curious about Noctis' fighting style in the game based on his fighting style, which appeared to combine hand-to-hand combat with magic techniques, making him based on \\"hit 'em with something sharp\\".

They play their home matches at Rhyl F.C.'s Belle Vue Stadium.  History  Prestatyn Ladies & Girls were founded in 2009 in Prestatyn by Tom Jamieson with a five-year plan to eventually reach the Welsh Premier Women's Football League. In 2014, Prestatyn Ladies & Girls won promotion from the North Wales League to the Welsh Premier Women's Football League by winning a play-off against the Ceredigion League's Aberystwyth University 10–0. Owing to ground regulations, the club moved away from Prestatyn and joined with Rhyl to play at Belle Vue Stadium. The club were also renamed Rhyl & Prestatyn Ladies as a result. Following the club's move to Rhyl, a new women's football club was set up in Prestatyn and became affiliated with Prestatyn Town F.C. which became known as Prestatyn Town Ladies in order to continue women's football in Prestatyn. Following the disbandment of Wrexham Ladies F.C., a number of players moved to Rhyl & Prestatyn Ladies. Rhyl & Prestatyn Ladies along with Llandudno Ladies were the only teams from North Wales competing in the Welsh Premier Women's Football League with concerns expressed that they would be the main teams representing the region as North Wales League clubs had been dissuaded from applying for promotion due to the expense.

International Strategic Analysis.  Predictions  In the spring of 2018, ISA cited that geopolitical risk levels were rising in many areas of the world as the world's leading power, the United States, increasingly turned inwards, leaving rivals such as China and Russia with an opportunity to expand their influence in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, the threat of a major Middle East war involving Saudi Arabia, Iran and other regional powers was a rising threat to global stability as the proxy wars between these powers in Syria and Yemen continued. On the economic front, ISA warned that, while global economic growth rates were forecast to remain relatively high over the near term, longer-term economic risk levels were rising. Among the major risks facing the global economy were the threat of a global share price correction, the withdrawal of stimulus programs in Europe, rising debt levels in China, the threat of a global trade war and the impact of low commodity prices on many emerging markets.

Groene ( ; born August 10, 1955) is a politician from the state of Nebraska in the Midwestern United States. In 2014, he was elected to the Nebraska Legislature, representing a district in the southwestern part of the state, including the city of North Platte. Groene is a member of the Republican Party. Personal life and professional career Groene was born August 20, 1955, and raised on a farm near Olean in northeastern Nebraska. He graduated from high school in Dodge in 1973. He attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, graduating in 1977 with a B.S. in agricultural economics. Groene began working for Brothers Equipment Company, a dealer in new and used agricultural implements based in Friend, Nebraska. In the course of this job, he moved to Holyoke, Colorado in 1990. In 1997, he returned to Nebraska, settling in the city of North Platte. Groene married in 1985; he and his wife Barb produced two children. In April 2018, he became widely known for his emails towards persons out of his district. Political career In Holyoke, Groene involved himself in Republican Party politics. In 1995, he ran for the local school board. According to Groene, he paid little attention to taxes in Colorado. However, when he moved back to Nebraska in 1997, he said, he was struck by how much higher the taxes were. In particular, he described his house in Nebraska as comparable to the one he had occupied in Colorado, but with a property tax bill twice as high. In North Platte, Groene co-founded the Western Nebraska Taxpayers Association, which he described as a nonpartisan group with no agenda apart from lowering taxes. In 2006, the group staged a petition drive to amend the Nebraska constitution; the proposed amendment would have limited the growth of state government spending to the rate of inflation and population growth. Enough signatures were secured to place the measure on the ballot; it was opposed by groups including the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Education Association (NEA), the Nebraska Farm Bureau, the League of Nebraska Municipalities, the Nebraska and the Greater Omaha Chambers of Commerce, and the Associated General Contractors. By November 1, shortly before the election, the pro-limit campaign had raised about $1.7 million, most of it from two out-of-state organizations, Americans for Limited Government and the National Taxpayers Union; the opposition had raised $2.4 million, about half of which came from the AARP and the NEA. The measure failed by a margin of 30-70%. In 2006, Groene also ran for a seat on the board of governors of Mid-Plains Community College. In the general election, he was defeated by a margin of 45-55%. In the course of the 2006 campaigns, Groene met Pete Ricketts, who was then making an unsuccessful attempt to win one of Nebraska's U.S. Senate seats from incumbent Ben Nelson. Discussions between Groene and Ricketts led to the establishment of the Platte Institute for Economic Research, which described itself as \\"Nebraska's first Free Market think tank\\". When the organization was launched in 2007, Ricketts held the title of director and president; Groene was a member of the board. =2014 election= In 2014, Groene announced that he would run for a seat in the Nebraska legislature, representing the 42nd District, which was coterminous with Lincoln County. Under Nebraska's term- limits law, the incumbent, Tom Hansen, was ineligible to run for a third consecutive term. 2014 primary Groene faced two other candidates in the nonpartisan primary election. Scott Dulin, a member of the Democratic Party from North Platte, had grown up on a farm near Hershey, then worked for the Union Pacific Railroad for 19 years, then spent four years working as a rail accident investigator for a Minnesota law firm. While at Union Pacific, he had served for ten years as the local union chairman; for four years, he had served as the alternate legislative representative. Roric Paulman, like Groene a Republican, was a farmer from Sutherland. He was president of the non-profit Nebraska Water Balance Alliance, and had served on state task forces dealing with water and agricultural issues. None of the candidates had previously held public office. All three candidates named taxes as an issue of concern, and expressed support for lowering property taxes. None of the three supported the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA); Dulin supported the proposed expansion of Medicaid in Nebraska under the ACA's provisions, while Groene and Paulman opposed it. In the primary election, Paulman received 42.3% of the vote; Groene, 37.6%; and Dulin, 20.0%. As the top two vote-getters, Paulman and Groene moved on to the general election. 2014 general election In announcing his candidacy, Groene had stated that he would not accept contributions from \\"special interest groups\\", and would only accept \\"help to run his campaign from individual citizens\\". Over the course of the entire campaign, he secured $37,000 in contributions and spent $35,000. Major contributors to the campaign included Groene and his family, donating $8800; Providence Investments of North Platte, contributing $3500; and two individuals, one in Blair and one in Columbus, each contributing $2500. The Paulman campaign's total receipts amounted to $162,000; its total expenditures were $167,000. Paulman contributed $34,000 to his campaign, and loaned it another $54,000. Major contributions included $10,000 from the Nebraska Hospital Association, $4750 from the Nebraska Bankers State PAC, $4500 from the Nebraska Realtors, and $3300 from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Paulman received endorsements from the Nebraska Farm Bureau and the Nebraska chapter of the AFL–CIO. His campaign website listed endorsements from nine members of the state legislature, including 42nd District incumbent Hansen. When the general election was held, Groene received 5322 votes, or 51.5% of the total, to Paulman's 5008 votes, or 48.5%. Groene described his victory as unexpected, and attributed it to extensive door-to-door campaigning, and to buying time every week on a local talk-radio show. =Legislative tenure= 2015 session In the 2015 legislative session, Groene was assigned to the Education Committee, the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, and the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee. Groene led two successful filibusters in the 2015 session. LB18 would have required Nebraska students to be vaccinated against meningitis. Supporters of the measure argued that mandatory vaccination was necessary as a public-health measure, and was supported by the general medical community; opponents maintained that the incidence of meningitis in Nebraska was low, and that the danger was not sufficient to justify the incursion on individual freedom. A second filibuster killed LB423, which would have made tax credits available for wind- or solar-energy production. Supporters argued that the bill would spur development of Nebraska's wind-power resources, and would boost the economy of rural areas; Groene and other opponents contended that the unreliability of wind power would preclude using it to replace coal plants, and that the $75 million cost of the tax credits would ultimately be borne by ratepayers and taxpayers. Among the \\"most significant\\" actions taken by the Legislature in its 2015 session were three bills that passed over vetoes by governor Pete Ricketts. LB268 repealed the state's death penalty; LB623 reversed the state's previous policy of denying driver's licenses to people who were living illegally in the United States after being brought to the country as children, and who had been granted exemption from deportation under the Barack Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; and LB610 increased the tax on gasoline to pay for repairs to roads and bridges. Groene voted against the death-penalty repeal, and to sustain Ricketts's veto of the measure; he voted against passage of LB623, and to sustain the gubernatorial veto; and he voted against passage of the gas-tax increase, and to sustain the veto. 2016 session In its 2016 session, the Nebraska legislature passed three bills that Ricketts then vetoed. LB580 would have created an independent commission of citizens to draw new district maps following censuses; supporters described it as an attempt to de-politicize the redistricting process, while Ricketts maintained that the bill delegated the legislature's constitutional duty of redistricting to \\"an unelected and unaccountable board\\". In the bill's 29-15 passage, Groene voted against it, stating \\"Politicians are giving more and more authority to un-elected appointed commissions to avoid having to take a stand on issues.\\" Sponsor John Murante opted not to seek an override of the governor's veto. A second vetoed bill, LB935, would have changed state audit procedures. The bill passed by a margin of 37-8, with 4 present and not voting; Groene was one of those voting against it, on the grounds that an amendment to the bill had made it more difficult for citizens to monitor spending by state employees and elected officials. The bill was withdrawn without an attempt to override the veto; the state auditor agreed to work with the governor on a new version for the next year's session. A third bill passed over Ricketts's veto. LB947 made DACA beneficiaries eligible for commercial and professional licenses in Nebraska. The bill passed the Legislature on a vote of 33-11-5, with Groene among those voting against it; the veto override passed 31-13-5, with Groene again casting a nay vote. Groene stated that his opposition arose from the belief that illegal immigrants \\"cheat the system and jump the line\\", and should not be rewarded for this misconduct. The legislature failed to pass LB10, greatly desired by the Republican Party, which would have restored Nebraska to a winner-take-all scheme of allocating its electoral votes in U.S. presidential elections, rather than continuing its practice of awarding the electoral vote for each congressional district to the candidate who received the most votes in that district. Supporters were unable to break a filibuster; in the 32-17 cloture motion, Groene was among those who voted in favor of the bill.

Bamford, having won the World Championship on four previous occasions, was a favourite to win and took the first two games in the best-of-five match decisively, but Mulliner scraped through in the third game, took the fourth with a sextuple peel that nearly went badly wrong, and then took the fifth game with convincing form.

Plot Twenty years after her debut ball, recently-widowed Christine tracks down her former dance partners to see how time has treated them. Her beaux have not fared well: one killed himself over Christine and his doting mother haunts his room in a perpetual state of denial. Promising lawyer and poet Pierre became a cynical nightclub owner and mob boss. An older composer took monastic vows and now teaches music to choirboys. The relatively fit and well-adjusted bachelor Eric has secluded himself on a mountain. Francois is a petit-bourgeois mayor marrying his henpecked maid in a small village. A former medical student is now a world-weary, drug-addicted wreck performing illegal abortions in the dockyard district. And optimistic card- trick-loving Fabien is a hair-dresser well-contented with his domestic life (though perhaps closeted) and frequenting the same old dance circuit. Christine indulges in the melancholy of regret, remaining non-judgmental, but nevertheless disturbed by the profound effect she had on these men, their loss of innocence, and the ravages of time.

Early life and education  Jeren was born in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan to a family of the actors Sofya Kurbanklycheva and Muhammetnur Kurbanklychev. Her debut with her first composition was when she was eight years old; she wrote a song to her father’s new stage play and performed it as a surprise to her dad, in their house in front of their family friends and Muhammetnur’s colleagues. Jeren Kurbanklycheva started her musical studies as a pianist. In her early age, she went to the Special Boarding Music School at Turkmen National Conservatory. Upon graduation she was accepted to Specialized Music School named after Dangatar Ovezov where she spent 4 years and received an Undergraduate degree in Piano Performance. After that Kurbanklycheva was accepted to Turkmen National Conservatory to the Composition Department and studied composition under the People's Artist of Turkmenistan, professor Chary Nurymov.Chary Nurymov Upon graduation she started working at the conservatory as theory and composition teacher and then later in her career she became the Chair of Composition Department at the same conservatory. In 1976 Jeren's piano sonata won in the Conservatory Competition Among Young Composers. In 1989 her composition took honorable mention place in international festival project InterOrchestra 89 founded by a former rector of Kurmangazy State Conservatory of Almaty, Dusen KaseinovDusen Kaseinov who is now the General Secretary of TÜRKSOY. Within this project Kurbanklycheva's \\"Poem for Strings, Percussion and Celesta\\" was performed by the USSR Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra under Fuat Mansurov and was added to All-Union and Turkmen Radio Funds. Vinyl recording of Kurbanklycheva's Cello Concerto was recorded by Melodia with USSR State Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra under Vladimir Kozhukhar. Since 1978 Jeren Kurbanklycheva is a member of the Composer's Union of Turkmenistan.Composer's Union of Turkmenistan Collections of works and songs for children is another chapter of her repertoire. Besides composing for kids, Kurbanklycheva devotes a big amount of her time in masterclasses, coachings, seminars and presentations at public schools, community schools and orphanages. For her work with children and adolescents she became a Laureate Of The Prize Of Lenin Komsomol Of Turkmenistan(1987). In 1993 Jeren Kurbanklycheva was awarded a title of Merited Artist of Turkmenistan.  Musical language  Kurbanklycheva composes in various genres including chamber music, with works such as \\"String Quartet\\" (1977), \\"Sonata for Flute and Piano\\" (1986); instrumental music, pieces for violin (1974) and woodwinds (1980); vocal music, symphonic music, songs for children etc. Among her notable symphonic works are \\"Symphonic Dances\\" (1974), \\"Symphonic Poem for Strings, Percussion and Celesta\\" (1978), \\"Concerto for Violoncello and Orchestra\\" (1979), \\"Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in Memory of Ayal Bakshy\\" (1991), \\"Dabaraly Mugam\\" (\\"Grand Overture) for orchestra of Folk Instruments (2002), \\"Concerto for Dutar and Orachestra of Folk Instruments (2004)\\". Vocal cycles \\"Songs of Motherhood\\" (1984), \\"Songs of My Dutar\\" (1987), \\"Ornaments of Independence\\" (1993) are some of her major vocal works. Like in other music of Turkmen composers, in music of Jeren Kurbanklycheva we can clearly hear patriotic and ethnic notes but unlike other composers, Jeren chooses to deliver her nationalistic ideas and patriotic spirit through the language of contemporary music. Her style, musical language and thoughts about contemporary music and compositional techniques can be understood when she discusses her vision of modern music: “Young generations always strive for something new. Of course a contemporary composer should possess a whole arsenal of tools and a vision for new music and modern writing, but should it completely destroy the common sense of music and melody? That’s not what I believe in. However, neither should a stereotype of staying musical and sounding good dissolve ones initial idea and hold one from delivering a message across. First, an idea, then you develop the melody that conveys the meaning behind it in it’s absolute accuracy up to the point when your melody becomes a better expression of your idea than your words or even thoughts. Then, more you engrave your melody, the brighter it starts to reflect different colors of other factors like nowadays social life, your emotional and mental state, your ethnical heritage, nationality and culture and of course other types of modern arts. The moment those vivid reflections of one single idea become organic enough to shine as a ray but still keep their unique colors to be heard individually, you get the composition that came directly from an open heart. Pure and honest. People appreciate honesty, so no matter how boldly atonal or “old fashioned” tonal a piece ended up being, the audience will pick up your open message and will connect to it.”  Teaching philosophy  Jeren Kurbanklycheva teaches composition at Turkmen National Conservatory. As a composition teacher she mentions her philosophy: “My goal as a pedagogue is to be able to cultivate already existing talent. Students who come to study composition are very different. Some young composers think widely, some are very gentle and flexible- those can be guided to chamber music. There are students who feel voice very well, most likely they will be able to express the best of themselves in vocal music genre. The most important thing while directing students in one way or another is to keep their individual language and not to break their unique musical personalities.”  Audience connection  Jeren Kurbanklycheva has said on multiple occasions that her main award will always be an appreciation from her audiences and one of her main goals is to make the process of hearing her piece rewarding for her listeners, which beneficially effects her process and helps her to broaden the boundaries of her professional art, inspiring her to write more and to be more: “It’s not easy to gain trust, attention, and engagement from listeners- especially if it’s a premiere. If my piece is played in a huge hall with just one person in the audience and if just this one person will connect to my piece, it means that through my composition I found a way to evoke something in this person so the piece that is personal for me, so it becomes personal for him it will be my victory and I will consider it a successful premiere.”  Personal life  Since 1978 Jeren Kurbanklycheva is married to Oleg Annaovezov, a former chief of Turkmenistan's ministry of foreign economic relations, and is a mother of three children: Bahar Annaovezova (by marriage: Bahar Ilarslan), 1979; Bayram Annaovezov, 1983; Maral Annaovezova, 1991. She currently resides in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan and continues making her contribution into musical and cultural life of her country as a composer, teacher and performer.

The work was commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the conductor James Levine. It was given its world premiere in Boston on April 17, 2008 by the mezzo-soprano Kate Lindsey, the baritone Nathan Gunn, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra directed by James Levine. The text of the piece is set to Orpheus and Eurydice by Czesław Miłosz, Relic by Louise Glück, and the Sonnets to Orpheus by Rainer Maria Rilke. Composition The symphony has a duration of roughly 35 minutes and is composed in four movements: #Con fuoco #Andante cantabile #Grave #Lento Though it was originally conceived as a purely orchestral work, Harbison decided to add vocal parts to the symphony at the suggestion of James Levine. The first two movements are set to the text of Czesław Miłosz's Orpheus and Eurydice, while the third and fourth movements are set to Louise Glück's Relic and Rainer Maria Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus, respectively. =Instrumentation= The work is composed for solo baritone and mezzo-soprano and a large orchestra comprising three flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), three oboes (3rd doubling English horn), three clarinets (2nd doubling E-flat clarinet; 3rd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, two trombones, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, piano, harp, electric guitar, and strings. Reception The symphony has received a positive response from music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Jeremy Eichler of The Boston Globe called it \\"an accomplished four-movement work that has extremely prominent roles for baritone and mezzo-soprano.\\" He continued: David Wright of the Boston Classical Review described the piece as \\"an arresting meditation on grief and the hereafter.\\" At a later performance of the piece, Jeremy Eichler called it \\"an artful and moving work\\" and wrote, \\"The movements based on Glück and Rilke fill out the picture, the latter set with the two vocal lines in vivid canon.

Formed in late 1942 from the machine gun companies of several infantry battalions, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion undertook training on the New South Wales south coast before being deployed to New Guinea where they took part in the Markham and Ramu Valley – Finisterre Range campaign, defending the airfield at Gusap, and undertaking patrols. In early 1944, the battalion returned to Australia and over the course of the year was disbanded, with its personnel being sent to other units as reinforcements. Many of these personnel then saw combat in Borneo in 1945. History The 6th Machine Gun Battalion was raised on 22 August 1942, at Narellan, New South Wales. This was part of a reorganisation of the Militia infantry battalions, which saw them lose their integral machine gun companies, so that they could be grouped together under a single battalion headquarters. The relevant companies came from several units assigned to the 1st Division, specifically: the 1st, 13th, 17th, 18th, 20th/19th, and 34th Infantry Battalions. In addition, a small number of personnel were received from the 2nd and 41st Infantry Battalions. Assigned at divisional level, the role of the machine gun battalion was to provide direct fire support in addition to the machine guns that were organic to infantry battalions. With an authorised strength of 700 to 800 men, the battalion was equipped with 48 Vickers medium machine guns that were spread between four main companies. These companies were supported by assorted service support soldiers including signallers, stretcher bearers, administration clerks, caterers and quartermasters. The battalion was highly mobile and included many different types of vehicles. The battalion's commanding officer on establishment was Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Hearne. Shortly after the companies came together at Narellan, the battalion moved to Wallgrove for training. The battalion was sent to Dapto, on the New South Wales coast, in October 1942, to carry out defensive duties. The move was carried out on foot over several days. Training was completed around Wollongong and Shellharbour, New South Wales. While at Shellharbour, on 16 May 1943, the battalion took part in rescuing the crew of a US tanker, the Cities Service Boston, which sunk near Bass Point after running aground. Four personnel from the 6th Machine Gun Battalion drowned during the rescue effort. They were later commemorated in a memorial that was established in 1968 near the wreck site, and were also decorated posthumously by the United States for their efforts. Cities Service Boston, prior to running aground off the coast of New South Wales Several months later, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion was sent to New Guinea, where the Australians were fighting against the Japanese. Relieving the 7th Machine Gun Battalion, the battalion was attached to the 3rd Division and undertook defensive duties in Port Moresby, mainly located at Ward's Airfield, starting in July. Two months later, the battalion was sent to Donadabu, where they were attached to the 7th Infantry Brigade. The 6th Machine Gun Battalion came under the command of the 7th Division, in October 1943, and, less one company which stayed in Port Moresby, it joined the Markham and Ramu Valley – Finisterre Range campaign. Its role during this period was to defend Gusap Airfield, amidst heavy fighting around Shaggy Ridge. Conditions around the airfield were highly malarial and the machine gunners were subjected to a number of aerial attacks. As personnel were evacuated due to illness, the Port Moresby company was used as a reinforcement pool until it was disbanded. The battalion was relieved around Gusap in March 1944, and returned to Dobodura by air. Later, they moved to Semina where they established a camp until shipping became available for the return to Australia. The battalion subsequently returned in two contingents, both aboard the Katoomba. The main element arrived in Townsville in March, but one company was sent to Sydney. A period of leave followed, after which personnel concentrated at Wallgrove. In June 1944, the battalion began disbanding as its personnel were needed as reinforcements for other operational units. By December, the unit ceased to exist. Most of its personnel volunteered to serve overseas with the Second Australian Imperial Force and later served in Borneo in 1945 with several other infantry, pioneer and machine gun battalions, including the 2/24th Infantry Battalion, with which they saw further action on Tarakan.

Formed in late 1942 from the machine gun companies of several infantry battalions, the 7th Machine Gun Battalion undertook defensive duties around Port Moresby and Milne Bay during the New Guinea campaign before taking part in the defence of Wau airfield during the Battle of Wau in early 1943. The battalion was returned to Australia in late 1943 and subsequently disbanded in mid-1944. History A Militia unit, the battalion was raised on 2 November 1942, in Port Moresby under the designation of the \\"New Guinea Force Machine Gun Battalion\\". The following month, it was renamed as the \\"7th Machine Gun Battalion\\". Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Terry Farrell, the battalion was formed by bringing together the machine gun companies of six infantry battalions that were already deployed in New Guinea. These were: the 3rd, 36th, 39th, 49th, 53rd and 55th. The role of the machine gun battalion was to provide direct fire support in addition to the machine guns that were organic to infantry battalions. With an authorised strength of 700 to 800 men, like other machine gun battalions, it was equipped with 48 Vickers medium machine guns and organised into four machine gun companies. There was also several support platoons and a headquarters company. Assigned at divisional level to the 6th Division, the battalion was employed initially defend the beaches around Port Moresby against a possible Japanese landing. This lasted until January 1943, when one of its companies was transferred to Milne Bay where it joined the 11th Division and carried out patrols and other defensive tasks; other elements of the battalion were deployed forward by air to Wau, to defend the vital airfield in January and February 1943. At Wau, a company from the 7th Machine Gun Battalion was assigned to Kanga Force and the 17th Brigade. They subsequently took part in the Battle of Wau during which the battalion was reinforced by elements of the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion. The battalion occupied several positions around Wau and Mubo and over several months took part in several actions, and suffered casualties from disease, air attacks and indirect fire. Allied aircraft at Wau airfield, where the battalion was deployed during the Battle of Wau Meanwhile, a party was maintained in Port Moresby during this time, undertaking training, defensive duties and working to improve the defences. During this time, reinforcements were sourced from the 6th Divisional Carrier Company, and members of the Royal Australian Air Force. In July and August 1943, the Wau detachment returned to Port Moresby, and having been relieved by the 6th Machine Gun Battalion they embarked for Australia. They main body departed aboard the transport Duntroon, while the Milne Bay company returned aboard the Howell Cobb. Training recommenced in October 1943 as the battalion began preparing for its next deployment. This included practising amphibious landings around Trinity Beach, Queensland, at the start of 1944. However, the decision was made to disband the unit, and use its personnel to reinforce other operational units, including several of the Second Australian Imperial Force machine gun battalions. Commencing in mid-March, the battalion transferred much of its vehicles and equipment and its personnel began marching out. Support troops went to docking and forestry companies, while combat troops went to units such as 2/1st, 2/2nd and 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalions, and 61st Infantry Battalion with whom they saw subsequent operational service. Some personnel were also transferred to the Royal Australian Navy. The process of disbanding the unit was completed by 1 May 1944.

Throughout the war, Russian soldiers reported finding taped executions of Russian officers and men. Experts say such films were an attempt to frighten enemy soldiers and advertise their deeds. Some videos were later sold as snuff films and ended up online. One tape created in September 1999 showed six Russian servicemen, one as young as 19, being brutally executed by Chechen militants. Sometimes the incident is mistakenly identified as the 1996 filmed execution of four Russian soldiers at the end of the First Chechen War.  Battle On 5 September 1999, two units of Chechen militants crossed into Dagestan, seizing the border village of Tukhchar in the Novolaksky District. The Chechen commander leading the attack was identified as Umar Edilsultanov (known as Karpinsky Amir, named after the microdistrict of Karpinka in Grozny), a subordinate of Abdul-Malik Mezhidov, commander of the Islamic religious police of Ichkeria. Attacking very early in the morning, the Chechens found and exchanged fire with 12 Russian conscripts and one officer of the Kalachevsky brigade stationed at a police checkpoint to strengthen border security. Shortly after the fighting began, the Russian operator of the unit's 30 mm BMP-2 was killed, communication was disrupted, and the Russians had run out of ammunition. Senior lieutenant Vasily Tashkin ordered a retreat to a second checkpoint. During a lull in the battle, local residents told Russian soldiers that the Chechens had given them half an hour to leave the village. The villagers brought with them civilian clothing so they could smuggle the policemen and soldiers out of town safely. Tashkin refused to retreat any further, and his resolve convinced others to stay as well. When the half hour was up, the Chechen militants began to search for the Russian defenders, who had been hidden by the townspeople. Six of them barricaded themselves in a barn, but the Chechens surrounded it and poured gasoline on the walls, threatening to burn the structure down. The Chechen militants called for the Russians to surrender, claiming that their intent was to obtain leverage for a prisoner exchange. Massacre The six gave up their arms and surrendered on the promise of becoming prisoners of war. It was not long before the Russians realised that they had been deceived. In the name of resolving a \\"blood feud\\"—revenge for the recent loss of four friends and relatives in the war—the Chechen commander Umar Edilsultanov then staged a public execution in a nearby field. The prisoners were ordered to lie face down on a track outside the village, and Edilsultanov selected five men from his unit to cut the prisoners' throats. The sixth (Alexey Polagaev) was killed by Edilsultanov himself. One of the Russian soldiers, identified as Alexey Lipatov, fled the site, but was shot with an assault rifle. The others killed were named as Senior lieutenant Vasily Tashkin, Vladimir Kaufman, Boris Erdneyev, Alexey Polagaev, and Alexey Paranin.  Aftermath  The morning following the executions, village head Magomed-Sultan Khasanov sought and received permission from the Chechen militants to retrieve the bodies of the Russian soldiers. The Chechens held the village until September 8. Survivors Alexey Ivanov and Fyodor Tchernavin escaped execution by remaining in hiding. Ivanov spent two days in an attic, while Tchernavin hid for five days in a basement, and it was not until after they were rescued that they learned of their colleagues' deaths. In late September the soldiers were quietly buried, with their families unaware of the gruesome nature of their deaths.  Investigation  In 2000, the film showing the killings was discovered by Russia's security service on sale in Grozny, which sparked an investigation into this as a war crime. = Tamerlan Khasaev = The first perpetrator of the massacre identified was Tamerlan Khasaev. At the time Khasaev was already in jail for kidnapping a man in December 2001, and by chance a police officer happened to see the tape and recognized Khasaev from the earlier abduction investigation. Khasaev was brought back to Dagestan from a jail in central Russia to face charges for the death of Alexey Lipatov. In an interview with a Russian investigator, Khasaev said he was simply following orders, and while he described the act as \\"unpleasant\\", he expressed no remorse. Khasaev faced a trial before the Dagestan Supreme Court in October 2002. He pleaded guilty only in part, admitting to participation in illegal militant groups, armed rebellion, and illegal possession of firearms. In his defense, he claimed that he did not strike the killing blow since the sight of blood made him feel ill at ease, and he handed the knife to another fighter. The Russian Lipatov then broke and ran, and a militant shot him in the back. Previously facing 8.5 years of imprisonment for the kidnapping charge, Khasaev was sentenced to life in prison. The court declared that he deserved the death penalty, but because of a moratorium on its use, life imprisonment would have to suffice. Khasaev died in prison shortly afterward. = Islan Mukaev = Police later detained Islan Mukaev (murderer of Vladimir Kaufman), known as a former Chechen militant, for the crimes. Mukaev lived in the Ingush district centre of Ordzhonikidzevskaya. In 2005, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. = Arbi Dandaev = Authorities in 2000 identified Arbi Dandaev, accused of executing lieutenant Vasily Tashkin and Boris Erdneyev. Dandaev evaded capture for eight years but was arrested in Grozny by Chechen police on 3 April 2008. According to the investigation, Dandaev turned himself in, confessed to the crime, and confirmed his testimony when he was taken to the site of the execution. He pleaded not guilty, however, before the Dagestan Supreme Court, saying that he was interrogated under duress and refused to testify. Nevertheless, the court found his previous admission of guilt valid because it was made in the presence of a lawyer and no complaints were filed at the time. The court studied the film of the execution, and noted that the name Arbi was clearly pronounced in the recording. In interviews with the residents of Tuhchar village, one claimed to recognize Dandaev, although the court weighed the eyewitness evidence lightly given the villager's advanced age and uncertainty. Dandaev's defense also claimed that Dandaev was mentally disturbed, and petitioned the court multiple times to repeat psychiatric evaluations that previously had determined that the defendant was fit to stand trial. The petition claimed that in 1995, Russian soldiers wounded Dandaev's younger brother in Grozny, and after some time in the military hospital the boy's corpse was returned to the family, his internal organs harvested to fuel the illegal Chechen human organ trafficking trade. According to Dandaev's lawyers, the incident caused intense mental trauma, and the charges against Dandaev were devised to prevent the defendant's father from seeking legal redress for the death of his youngest son. Nonetheless, the court held that Dandaev was sane and that the investigation into his brother's death had no bearing on the case. Dandaev was convicted, and although the prosecutor asked for a sentence of 22 years, the court sentenced Dandaev to life imprisonment in 2009. = Mansur Razhaev = In 2010, the investigation led to Mansur Razhaev, a 34-year old from Grozny in jail for gang-related crime and robbery. Like Khasaev, he said he was present, but did not strike a killing blow and thus wasn't guilty of murder. During the trial Dandaev testified on behalf of Razhaev. Razhaev was convicted on 31 January 2012 for the execution of Boris Erdneyev and sentenced to life imprisonment. = Rizvan Vagapov = On August 8, 2011, Rizvan Vagapov was detained by law enforcement agencies in Grozny. He was convicted and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment for his role in the massacre.

It is the type species of the genus Supramontana.  Description  Dorsal view of Supramontana irritata Supramontana irritata is a medium-sized land planarian up to in length when crawling. The dorsum has a light straw-yellow background color that is covered by very fine dark-brown to black spots. The spots form two wide diffuse lateral bands that become less marked towards the posterior end. The spots also concentrate at the margins of the bands, forming an irregular marginal stripe on each side of the body and two poorly marked paramedian stripes that run on each side of a thin median brown line. Sometimes the dark spots turn the median line inconspicuous, especially when the animal is contracted. The anterior end has an orange tinge that gradually fades posteriorly into the straw-yellow color of the dorsum. The ventral side is yellowish white. The numerous eyes are very small and hardly visible to the naked eye. They are distributed marginally on the first millimeters of the body and posteriorly become dorsal, occupying about 20% of the body width on each side. When crawling, S. irritata usually maintains the anterior end raised with the sides slightly curved downwards, giving it a U shaped in cross-section. In order to move forward, it usually stretches the anterior end, touches the substrate and contract the posterior region. If stimulated, it moves nervously and quickly, hence the name irritata (Latin for irritated).  Distribution  The only known place of occurrence of S. irritata is the São Francisco de Paula National Forest in southern Brazil.

HarperCollins has published eight books by McPhedran, who won a Walkley Award in 1999. Career Prior to 1998, McPhedran was foreign affairs and defence writer for The Canberra Times. Between 1998 and 2016 he worked as a defence writer News Corp Australia, writing for publications including the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph and Northern Territory News, before announcing his retirement in January 2016. At the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003, McPhedran reported on the war from Baghdad, staying at the Meridien Palestine Hotel. McPhedran was expelled from the country by the Iraqi Government soon after ABC photojournalist Paul Moran was killed by a suicide car bomber in northeastern Iraq on 23 October 2003. McPhedran reported that Iraqi officials had accused him of not following regulations when he left his hotel to visit the Information Ministry building without a minder. McPhedran's first book, The Amazing SAS, was published by HarperCollins in 2005. Michelle Grattan's review in The Age criticised McPhedran for offering the 'official account' of an incident in Afghanistan in which innocent people died after being mistaken for insurgents. She suggested that further discussion and analysis was needed of the incident, but overall she praised McPhedran's remarkable access. In 2009 McPhedran was invited by the Australian Defence Force to take part in an \\"embedding trial\\". McPhedran suggested the ADF's model should rather be called 'media hosting' and he was sometimes frustrated by a lack of access and time wasting during the trial. Family and personal life McPhedran, the oldest son born to his Anglo- Burmese refugee father, Colin McPhedran, and Australian mother, was raised in Bowral, in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales. McPhedran is married to journalist Verona Burgess. They live in Balmain, Sydney. White Butterflies, a book written by Ian McPhedran's father Colin with editing assistance from Verona Burgess, tells the story of Colin's journey on foot from Burma to India during World War II to escape the Japanese invasion of Burma. Colin, then 11 years old, embarked on the journey with his mother and two siblings but only he survived.

Representatives and scouts from 23 NFL teams attended his Pro Day and four defensive line coaches from the Cincinnati Bengals, Pittsburgh Steelers, Philadelphia Eagles, and Tennessee Titans also came to watch Hargrave, along with 14 other prospects. Although analysts and scouts gave him positive reviews for his motor, playmaking ability, quick footwork, athleticism, and strength they also criticized him for his short arms, stocky frame, small hands, lack of instincts, and also considered him a raw talent.

Zaseki in Russian means abatises, field fortifications made of felled trees. In medieval times, the Kaluga region was part of the defensive line between the Russian forests to the north and potential invaders from the south. The reserve has been protected in some form for a thousand years, and remains old-growth forest. The reserve is situated in the Ulyanovsky District, Kaluga Oblast. It was formally established in 1992 and has an area of . Topography The Kaluzhskiye Zaseki Reserve sits on a mosaic of different soil types—black earth supporting broad-leaf forest, sandy soils supporting pine forests, grey- forest soil of northern forests, and steppe grassland. The terrain is gently rolling hills with riverine gullies and ravines over glacial moraines and eroded soil. The Vytebet River passes near the security zone, and there is a network of small rivers and forest streams. There are two sections to the reserve, about equal in size and separated north-south from each other by about 12 km. Climate and ecoregion Kaluzhskiye Zaseki is located in the East European forest steppe ecoregion, a transition zone between the broadleaf forests of the north and the grasslands to the south.. This ecoregion is characterized by a mosaic of forests, steppe, and riverine wetlands. The climate of Kaluzhskiye Zaseki is Humid continental climate, warm summer (Köppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters.. In Kaluzhskie, the average temperature in January is , and in July is . Precipitation ranges from 450 to 700 mm/year, with maximum rainfall in July. The prevailing winds are westerly and south-westerly. Flora and fauna The reserve is 96% covered with forest, of which about 25% is broad-leaf forest characterized by lime, oak, ash, elm and maple. Another 25% of the forest is birch in the secondary forests. Twelve percent of the area is pine forest, and an equal amount in spruce. Scientists on the reserve have recorded over 400 species of vascular plants and over 500 species of mushrooms. Kaluzhskiye is working, along with Orlovskoye Polesye National Park, to reintroduce the European bison to Central Russia. As of 2013, there were 84 bison in the Kaluzhskie herd, which appeared to be healthy and growing. The bison seek forested tracts with small meadows. Ecoeducation and access As a strict nature reserve, the Kaluzhskiye Zaseki Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with environmental education purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are, however, ecotourist routes in the reserve that are open to the public but which require permits to be obtained in advance. The northern sector has 2.7 km of guided trails with information boards and is accessible to casual hikers and children. There are three trails on the southern tract, with over 5 km total on circular routes that highlight the flora and fauna of the region and provide vantages for bird watching. The reserve sponsors a nature education center that is open to the public daily. The main office is in the village of Ulyanovo.

He played college football at Texas A&M.; He was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the third round of the 2016 NFL Draft. College career Williams, originally a five-star running back out of Royal High School, started his college football career at Oklahoma. After finishing his true freshman season as the fourth- leading rusher for the Sooners, he decided to transfer to Texas A&M.; He sat out the 2012 season due to NCAA transfer rules and played two more seasons at running back before Aggies coach Kevin Sumlin switched Williams to cornerback in his senior season.  Professional career  Coming out of Texas A&M;, many NFL draft experts and analysts were split on the projected round Williams would be selected in. Some experts thought Williams could go as high as the third or fourth round, while some projected him to be a seventh round pick or a priority undrafted free agent. The conflict on grades stemmed from the little experience Williams had since he played cornerback in 13 games for one single season as a senior in contrast to his talent and ability. Many analysts felt he would be over drafted based on his athleticism and traits. He received an invitation to the NFL combine and completed all of the combine drills and raised his draft stock after tying for sixth among all prospects in the 40-yard dash (4.37). On April 6, 2016, he participated at Texas A&M;'s pro day and opted to only perform positional drills for the team representatives and scouts from the 30 NFL teams. Defensive backs coaches from the Indianapolis Colts, Detroit Lions, and Oakland Raiders attended to personally scout and meet Williams. Williams was ranked as the 33rd best cornerback prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. =Arizona Cardinals= The Arizona Cardinals selected Williams in the third round (92nd overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was the 14th cornerback selected in the draft. 2016 On May 9, 2016, the Arizona Cardinals signed Williams to a four-year, $3.08 million contract that included a signing bonus of $672,695. He competed with Asa Jackson, Tharold Simon, Harlan Miller, and Cariel Brooks throughout training camp for a job as a backup cornerback. After showing promise throughout camp, Williams climbed the depth chart and began to compete against Justin Bethel and Mike Jenkins for the vacant starting cornerback job left by the departure of Jerraud Powers. Head coach Bruce Arians named Williams the Cardinals' starting cornerback, along with Patrick Peterson, to begin the regular season. He earned his first career start and made his professional regular season debut in the Arizona Cardinals' season-opener against the New England Patriots and finished the 22-23 loss with two combined tackles. Williams struggled throughout his debut and gave up a touchdown pass after missing a hand signal that switched the defense from zone to man coverage. In Week 2, he alternated plays with Marcus Cooper who the Cardinals acquired in a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs on September 2, 2017. By Week 3, Williams had been benched in favor of Cooper. On December 24, 2016, Williams recorded a season-high 11 combined tackles and a pass deflection in a 34-31 win over the Seattle Seahawks. In the second quarter, Williams was covering Seahawks' receiver Tyler Lockett as Lockett made a 28-yard reception. During the course of the tackle, Williams landed on Lockett's right leg, causing Lockett to break his tibia and fibula. He finished his rookie season with a total of 26 combined tackles (22 solo) and three pass deflections in three starts and 13 games. From Weeks 3-13, Williams did not play a single defensive snap and was inactive for three games during that span. 2017 Throughout the off season, Williams worked on learning coverages and his technique after struggling through a dismal rookie season. He entered training camp competing with Justin Bethel and Tramon Williams for the starting cornerback job. He was named a backup cornerback behind Patrick Peterson and Justin Bethel to begin the NFL season. Through the first seven games of the season, Williams played sparingly and only made two tackles during that time. 2018 Williams played in 16 games in 2018, recording 10 tackles and two passes defensed. 2019 Williams was waived/injured during final roster cuts on August 31, 2019, and reverted to injured reserve the next day. =New York Giants= After becoming a free agent in March 2020, Williams had a tryout with the Indianapolis Colts on August 13, 2020, with the Kansas City Chiefs on August 17, 2020, and with the Chicago Bears on August 20, 2020. Williams signed with the New York Giants on August 29, 2020. He was released during final roster cuts on September 5, 2020, but was re-signed the next day. He was placed on injured reserve on September 30, 2020.

Independently owned by Wow Media, LLC, the station streams an adult album alternative (AAA) format promoted as \\"timeless rock\\". The oWOW Radio studios and offices are located at the 78th Street Studios complex in Cleveland's Detroit-Shoreway neighborhood. History 78th Street Studios complex Radio programmer John Gorman, known for stints at longtime Cleveland rock station WMMS and oldies station WMJI, states he first saw potential for Internet radio in the mid-1990s. Gorman recalls growing frustrated with the radio industry at that time, citing among other things a general lack of creativity, including for online streaming. He believes the success of Pandora and Spotify many years later helped establish Internet radio as a more viable alternative for radio listeners. On February 20, 2015, oWOW Radio launched in a small, temporary studio while construction continued on what is now the current 1,600-square foot facility located at the 78th Street Studios complex in the Gordon Square Arts District, part of the Detroit-Shoreway neighborhood on Cleveland's west-side. Funding for oWOW Radio was acquired through private investors, traditional bank loans, and a small business grant from city of Cleveland. Serving as chief content officer, Gorman recruited former WMMS director of marketing Jim Marchyshyn to manage sales; the two function as oWOW's \\"principal partners\\". John Chaffee, formerly president of Malrite Communications, was announced as a consultant in late April 2015. Veteran local radio personalities were hired for regular on-air shifts, and illustrator David Helton, perhaps best known for designing the WMMS Buzzard, also designed the oWOW Radio logo. Gorman is critical of traditional radio, he compares terrestrial AM and FM stations to outdated fax machines, he also believes services like Pandora and Spotify have a limited ability to serve local markets. oWOW actively targets Northeast Ohio listeners. The local approach has been emphasized during what has been an \\"uphill battle\\" to find advertising clients.

FGM is an issue in New Zealand because of the number of migrants from countries where FGM is commonly practiced settling in New Zealand. FGM is referred to as procedures that, for non-medical reasons, intend to cause harm to female genital organs. The procedures may have negative health impacts by causing problems such as urinating, infections, severe bleeding and complications during childbirth. Procedures are normally carried out on girls from infancy to 15 years old. FGM is predominantly practiced in countries throughout the Middle East, Asia and in Africa. Background FGM is a cultural tradition, based upon the belief that having FGM performed upon young girls is in their best interests. fgm.co.nz Retrieved 2016-4-30 Despite the first known documentation of FGM being recorded in Egypt in 25BC, it is thought that the practice of FGM has been occurring for some centuries prior to this. fgm.co.nz Retrieved 2016-4-30 While FGM practices differ between communities, the theory among them remains relatively similar. That is that women are more attractive prospects for marriage when they have had the FGM procedure and in some regions it is considered a necessary part of a girl’s social development. Where the most severe forms of FGM are practiced (such as where infibulation is performed – this is the narrowing or sealing off of the vaginal opening) women are prevented from engaging in any promiscuity prior to marriage, thus making them more desirable. It is further believed that FGM saves women from temptation and safeguards the morality of women. In some communities where FGM is a tradition, misconceptions regarding the benefits of FGM have been passed through generations. Some beliefs include that FGM: promotes fertility, is an essential measure to ensure good health of the baby and the cleanliness of a woman and that the clitoris is a feature of masculinity and therefore FGM procedures create a smooth skin surface that is more desirable. Prevalence There have been no cases of FGM taken under the New Zealand legislation, although it is known that migrants from countries such as Somalia have undergone FGM procedures before entering New Zealand. The communities that are predominantly affected by FGM are Ethiopian, Sudanese, Eritrean and Somali and many women in these communities have undergone FGM prior to arriving in New Zealand. fgm.co.nz Retrieved 2016-4-30 The most affected group is the Somali community, where 98% of women have already undergone FGM prior to migrating to New Zealand. FGM is also practiced in some Muslim communities in Malaysia, India and Indonesia and some women and girls from these communities, living in New Zealand, may have also undergone FGM. International obligations New Zealand has a good history of ratifying and complying with international law instruments. NZ Human Rights Organisation Retrieved 2016-4-30 A number of these instruments refer to or impact upon New Zealand and the domestic laws surrounding FGM. The first over arching covenant is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which New Zealand supported in 1948. Specifically, Article 25 provides that everyone has the right to adequate health and medical care, clothing, shelter and necessary social services, as well as the right to security in the event of sickness, unemployment or other circumstances beyond his or her control. New Zealand ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1985. Ministry of Justice Retrieved 2016-4-30 The Ministry of Women’s Affairs is responsible for administering this Convention. Article 2(f) relates to FGM because it requires states to take all measures to abolish or modify existing laws, customs and practices which amount to discrimination against women. Further relevant obligations contained within this convention include Article 5, which states that all appropriate measures shall be taken to modify the patterns, both social and cultural, of women and men to achieve the elimination of prejudices based on the superiority and inferiority of either sex. Article 12 also relates to FGM because it requires all relevant measures be taken by the state to extinguish discrimination against females in health care and to ensure men and women have equal access to health care services. In response to these obligations, New Zealand has sections relating to discrimination within its Human Rights Act 1993. For example, section 21 prohibits discrimination on a number of grounds, including sex. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, which New Zealand ratified in 1993, contains a number of obligations which require all states who are party to the convention to act against FGM. These are prescribed in Articles 2, 19, 24 and 37. Article 2 requires states to ensure all rights of children within the convention are protected under domestic jurisdiction without any form of discrimination, including: sex, religion, ethnic or social origin or race. Article 19.2 specifically requires the state to provide the necessary support and measures for children who have been maltreated through forms of mental or physical violence, neglect or injury while in the care of a parent or legal guardian. A further requirement is that there are forms of prevention, investigations and treatment for the children and, where appropriate, for judicial involvement. Article 24 ensures that states recognise children’s rights to access health care and to make sure no child is deprived of this right. Further, Article 24.3 states that all measures, where appropriate, should be taken to abolish traditional practices that are to the detriment of children’s health. Article 37 states that no child shall be subjected to torture or other degrading or inhuman punishment or treatment. New Zealand complies with these obligations under the covenant on the rights of the child by having domestic law which makes any practice or form of FGM illegal. Also relevant is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which New Zealand ratified in 1978. Article 7 relates to FGM because it states that no one will be subjected to degrading or inhuman punishment or torture, or to scientific or medical experimentation (without free consent). New Zealand issued its report for the fourth periodic review of states party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at the sixty-sixth session of the Human Rights Committee in 1999. New Zealand reported that; in complying with the international obligations in article 7 of the covenant, Parliament amended the criminal legislation to specifically make FGM illegal. Domestic measures In New Zealand, FGM is regarded as a violation of human rights. The practice of FGM was therefore made illegal in 1996 under an amendment to the Crimes Act 1961.Crimes Act 1961 Under section 204A of the Crimes Act 1961, it is illegal to perform any form of female genital mutilation. FGM is defined within the Crimes Act as the mutilation, infibulation or excision of part of or the whole of the labia minora, labia majora or the clitoris of any person. s204A Crimes Act 1961 FGM is illegal even where the girl or woman has consented to the procedure. Crimes Act s204A It is also illegal to cause a child to be sent outside of New Zealand or to make arrangements for a child to be sent outside of New Zealand where the intent is that FGM be carried out that would be illegal under s204A if performed in New Zealand.Crimes Act 1961 s204A The Act also states that a person is liable for up to seven years imprisonment where that person aids, procures or incites FGM to be performed outside of New Zealand where that person is a New Zealand resident or citizen and doing so would be illegal if carried out in New Zealand.Crimes Act 1961 s204B The punishment is up to seven years imprisonment for FGM whether the person actually performs the procedure or assisted. There is no defence of consent, even where the defendant claims to have thought the victim consented, and no ‘victim’ will be charged as a party to the offence. In New Zealand, there are no direct public health policies that relate to FGM. However, the New Zealand Health Strategy 2000 referred to programmes relating to FGM, including the need to address refugee communities who practice FGM. In 1997, in response to the increasing number of women and girls settling in New Zealand from countries which practice FGM, a community based programme was established to provide improved health care services for women affected by FGM. This programme is funded by the Ministry of Health and aims to provide education on FGM and support for those affected by FGM. As the result of a study carried out in 2008, the New Zealand FGM Programme developed guidelines for health care professionals. Today, Child Youth and Family regional practitioners and forensic interviewers for each region undergo training carried out by the FGM Education Programme. This means that where a suspected case of FGM arises there are people in place who understand what to do. There is also an investigation plan in place which ensures that the Police Child Abuse Team is notified. The process includes the following steps; a health professional who knows the family is contacted, as well as a community worker (depending on the ethnicity of the child and their family), and engagement of an interpreter is considered. Engagement with the family is conducted in a sensitive manner to allow the family to retain their dignity. Further checks are made as to whether the family are aware of New Zealand’s laws on FGM. A limitation of these guidelines is that they are not compulsory for all health services in New Zealand, meaning that not all health professionals are sufficiently trained in how to care for women who have had FGM procedures. This becomes an issue during labour and postnatal periods.

The offensive resulted in the military's capture of the southern section of the rebel-held East Ghouta, as government forces exploited concurrent large-scale rebel infighting in East Ghouta that left around 500 rebels dead.  The offensive  On the evening of 25 April, government forces captured the entire Bala Al-Kadhima region, approaching the villages of Harasta Al-Qantara and Hawsh Jarabo. With this, the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta pocket, east of Damascus, was almost split in two and the rebels in Deir Al-‘Assafir and Zibdeen were close to being cut off. On 29 April, the Army launched its second phase of the offensive, with an attack on Rukabiyah, seizing the southern part of the village within an hour. By the end of the day, the village was mostly secured. Shortly after, a 24-hour ceasefire was agreed upon in the area, with government troops receiving orders to withdraw from Rukabiyah. The next evening, the offensive restarted and the military once again entered Rukabiyah, taking 80 percent of the village. On 1 May, the military completely secured Rukabiyah, after which the ceasefire was renewed for another 24 hours. Following the capture of Rukabiyah, the third planned phase of the offensive envisioned an assault against the rebel stronghold of Deir al-Asafir. On 8 May, government forces captured parts of the town of Zabdin. On 11 May, government troops advanced from Rukabiyah and captured its farms. The next day, they launched a push, from the areas they had taken control of since the start of the offensive, towards Deir al-Asafir and into the parts of Zabdin that were still rebel-controlled, taking the village of Nolah, as well as positions near the Deir al-Asafir farms. The Army also reportedly seized Zabdin's mosque. On 14 May, the Army and Hezbollah reportedly reached Deir al-Asafir and imposed fire control over the town, after they seized the village of Hawsh Al-Khatib. Shelling of Deir al-Asafir started on 17 May. On 17 May, government forces took control of the Bazinah farms and half of the village of Bazinah. The next day, the rebels recaptured positions in Bazinah they had lost the previous day, however, several hours later the military took full control of the village. On the morning of 19 May, government forces took full control of Deir al-Asafir and shortly after entered the northeastern part of Zabdin, advancing to within 250 south of the Bala Air Defense Battalion base. Elsewhere, the Army made other rapid advances, capturing two villages, as rebel defenses collapsed. By the end of the day, Zabdin was captured and the Army and Hezbollah cleared the whole southern section of East Ghouta, which represented some 20 percent of the rebel-held East Ghouta pocket. With the success of the offensive, government troops were in control of most of the agricultural Marj region, which had been the biggest agricultural storehouse for East Ghouta. Due to this, some speculated that people inside the rebel-held East Ghouta pocket would starve and that the blockade would intensify. Hundreds of families were displaced from the valuable farmland, that nourished residents trapped in the blockaded area, as government forces advanced. Following the capture of the area, the Army discovered a large network of tunnels connecting different villages and towns that contained large amounts of weapons, ammunition, medical supplies and communication equipment.  Aftermath  On 20 May, the rebels recaptured Harasta Al-Qantara, as well as the nearby Bazinah farms. It was later reported the rebels were pushed out of the Bazinah farms, while on 21 May, the military launched an assault against Harasta Al-Qantara and reportedly recaptured its farms while fighting in the village continued. On the evening of 28 May, the 416th Regiment of the Republican Guard, along with Hezbollah and the PLA, attacked the villages of Al-Bahariyah and Al-Nashabiyah, in another region of East Ghouta. During the assault, government forces broke through the rebel defense line south of Al-Nashabiyah, crossing the Barada River, and entered the village as the rebels withdrew to the village center. Meanwhile, government troops advanced on the eastern axis towards Al-Bahariyah's center. Two days later, the military crossed the river at another point west of Al- Nashabiyah, seizing the Military Airbase Construction Battalion at Beit Na’em village. Later that evening, they entered the village itself and broke through the first line of defense at nearby Al-Muhammadiyah, breaching the central region of East Ghouta for the first time since 2012. On 1 June, the military cut the supply line between Al-Muhammadiyah and Beit Na’em. On the evening of 6 June, the Army blew up a large tunnel network connecting the Bala Farms with Al-Muhammadiyah and Beit Na’em. In all, nine tunnels were destroyed. Two days later, government troops entered Al-Muhammadiyah, capturing 20 houses, although most of the village still remained in rebel hands. Additionally, between 11 and 12 June, they advanced in Jisreen's and Al-Muhammadiyah's farms. Also, on 14 June, the military captured the farmlands to the west of Hawsh al-Farah, cutting the rebel supply route to the rebel-held parts of Tal al-Sawwan. At the end of June, a new Army offensive was launched at the far eastern section of Eastern Ghouta.

The work was commissioned by the Seattle Symphony with contributions from the philanthropists Richard and Constance Albrecht. It was given its world premiere in Seattle on June 17, 2004 by the Seattle Symphony under the direction of Gerard Schwarz. Composition =Background= The symphony was composed during a turbulent period in Harbison's life when his wife became very ill. The composer wrote in the score program notes, \\"One morning at eight, in Bogliasco, Italy, where I was working, I receive a phone call - two o'clock the caller's time. I cannot describe the knowledge that struck during that call except to say that the breath of mortality, bearing at this moment on the person closest to me, came suddenly and radically near.\\" He continued: =Structure= The symphony has a duration of roughly 27 minutes and is composed in five movements: #Fanfare #Intermezzo #Scherzo #Threnody #Finale =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising three flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), three oboes (3rd doubling English horn), three clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, two trumpets, two trombones, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, piano, harp, and strings. Reception The symphony has been praised by music critics. Lisa Hirsch of the San Francisco Classical Voice wrote, \\"It's an engrossing work, full of interesting detail and structural experimentation. Like the Mahler and Ravel, it deploys a very large orchestra, but the effects provided by that orchestra seem more studied and less organic than those in its companions, thought through rather than arising naturally from the melodic and harmonic elements of the work.\\" Keith Powers of the Boston Classical Review compared the symphony with Harbison's 1999 opera The Great Gatsby, writing: Matthew Guerrieri of The Boston Globe was slightly more critical of the work, however, saying \\"...the whole symphony feels like workings-through, of influences, forms, processes, difficulties.\\" He added, \\"The opening and closing movements had crisp force; the quieter movements, especially the piecemeal transparency of the 'Intermezzo,' were more skittish and hesitant.\\" References 4 Category:2003 compositions Harbison 4 Category:Music commissioned by the Seattle Symphony ","title":"Symphony No. 4 (Harbison)"},{"id":"50370739","text":"German submarine U-2348 was a Type XXIII U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II.

Lithograph on chine collé. Henry William Burgess (London, c. 1792–1839) was a British artist known particularly for his drawings of trees and landscapes. His medium was graphite and watercolour. He was part of the a well-known dynasty of painters who flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. His father was the portrait-painter William Burgess (1749–1812), and his grandfather was Thomas Burgess (fl. 1766–1786). His brothers were the painters John Cart Burgess and Thomas Burgess. His son John-Bagnold Burgess (1830–1897) also became a successful painter. Based in Chelsea like the rest of his family, between 1809 and 1839 Burgess exhibited many works at the Royal Academy,Allgemeines Lexikon der Bildenden Künstler, Leipzig 1911 the Suffolk Street Gallery, and the New Water-Colour Society in London.E. Bénézit, Dictionnaire critique et documentaire des peintres, sculpteurs, dessinateurs et graveurs. He became landscape painter to William IV of England in 1826. At least one of his drawings is still in the Royal Collection, Windsor Castle, a distant view, with deer and horse and cart.\\\\- RCIN 922324) He was also drawing master at Charterhouse School.Saur, Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon, München- Leipzig 1997 In 1827 the book Eidodendron was published (J. Dickinson, London, 1827), a collection of sepia-printed lithographs on chine applique, realized by the lithographer Charles Joseph Hullmandel (1789–1850) after H.W. Burgess's drawings. The subtitle is: Views of the general Character and Appearance of Trees Foreign & Indigenous as connected with picturesque Scenery. It is a set of pastoral landscapes, each featuring different species of large trees. Rural folk going about their routines provide a sense of scale. Drawing by Henry William Burgess, signed and dated 1818 - Private collection.Burgess and Hullmandel were among the earliest practitioners of lithography in England, which in this series replicates the tonal variations of a sepia ink wash drawing very effectively. Burgess's attention to the qualities of light exhibited in these prints links him to his contemporaries John Constable and J. M. W. Turner. Henry William Burgess died in London on 8 May 1839, aged about 47.

Le Guin, the author, in 2004. \\"Coming of Age in Karhide\\" is a science fiction short story by Ursula K. Le Guin, first published in 1995. The story is set on the fictional planet of Gethen, the same as Le Guin's 1969 novel The Left Hand of Darkness, and is a part of Le Guin's Hainish cycle. The story explores themes of growing into adulthood on a planet where individuals have no fixed gender identity. Reviewers stated that the story went further than Left Hand in its exploration of gender and sexuality, and was a \\"quietly feminist\\" work. It was also described as lacking the \\"dizzying impact\\" of Left Hand. In 2002, it was anthologized in the volume The Birthday of the World, along with many other stories exploring marriage and sexual relationships. Setting \\"Coming of Age in Karhide\\" is set on the fictional planet of Gethen, a part of the Hainish universe, created by Le Guin. The planet is also the setting for Le Guin's Hugo and Nebula award-winning 1969 novel The Left Hand of Darkness. In this alternative history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Earth and Gethen, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. Some of the groups that \\"seeded\\" each planet were the subjects of genetic experiments, including on Gethen. In the language of its people, \\"Gethen\\" means \\"Winter\\", and as its name indicates, is a planet that is always cold. The inhabitants of Gethen are sequentially hermaphroditic humans; for twenty-four days (somer) of each twenty-six-day lunar cycle, they are sexually latent androgynes. They only adopt sexual attributes once a month, during a period of sexual receptiveness and high fertility, called kemmer. During kemmer they become sexually male or female, with no predisposition towards either, although which sex they adopt can depend on context and relationships. This absence of fixed gender characteristics led Le Guin to portray Gethen as a society without war, and also without sexuality as a continuous factor in social relationships. On Gethen, every individual takes part in the \\"burden and privilege\\" of raising children, and rape and seduction are virtually absent. Plot The story is told from the point of view of Sov Thade Tage em Ereb, a teenager who lives in a large communal home in the Karhidish city of Rer. The 140 people in the house are all a single family. None of its members form long-lasting marital bonds (known on Gethen as \\"keeping kemmer\\"); instead, individuals go to a communal \\"kemmerhouse\\" when they are sexually receptive, and any children that are conceived are raised in the \\"hearth\\", or communal home. As a result, Sov grows up among a number of cousins and siblings, none of whom know who their sire is. When Sov turns fourteen, Sov witnesses the \\"Somer-forever\\" party of their mother's sibling, who has reached the age where sexual activity is no longer possible. Witnessing this makes Sov wonder about their own sexuality, which Sov was not concerned about before reaching sexual maturity. That same spring Sov begins an apprenticeship at a carpenter's workshop, and begins to feel like an adult. At the same time, Sov begins to experience mood swings and symptoms of illness. Sov goes to their mother, who tells them that Sov is coming into kemmer for the first time. Sov discusses this with their cousin Sether, who is having the same experience, and they both express fears that being in kemmer is dehumanizing, and involves being a \\"sex machine\\". On the day Sov is due to kemmer, their family takes them to the kemmerhouse after presenting them a new set of clothes and going through traditional celebratory rituals. Sov is welcomed into the kemmerhouse with elaborate ritual. The first person Sov encounters is already in kemmer as a male, and his pheromones and touch lead to Sov kemmering as a female. He reveals that he is her father. Over the next few days she has sexual experiences with a number of different men and women, and enjoys herself, although she is nervous and afraid. After coming out of kemmer Sov makes friends with another in the kemmerhouse, and a month later enters kemmer with Sether. Sov concludes by saying \\"The old days or the new times, somer or kemmer, love is love.\\" Themes \\"Coming of Age\\" examines themes of growing into adulthood, as well as ideas of gender and sexuality. In deliberate contrast to The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin's previous work which was set on the same fictional planet, Le Guin uses feminine pronouns for all the Gethenians when they are not in kemmer, and uses male or female pronouns for individuals in kemmer, depending on what sex they take on. She does the same in a later reprinting of \\"Winter's King\\", another short story set on Gethen, first written in 1969. In addition, first-person narration discusses the difficulty of telling a story about people without fixed male or female characteristics, in a language that only has gendered pronouns. \\"Coming of Age\\" examines Gethenian sexuality in greater detail than in Left Hand. In describing the story, Le Guin stated: > It seemed high time we got all the way into a kemmerhouse. With a native > guide, instead of a poor uptight Earth guy trying to figure out what's going > on and being disturbed by it ... Left Hand gives the reader very little > opportunity to experience being double-gendered [...] I wanted to explore it > as a natural, universal experience, instead of a weird alien condition. Back > in 1968, I and most readers needed Genly Ai's POV to mediate the > strangeness. I don't think we do, now. She referred to the story as a sexual footnote to Left Hand. Sandra Lindow stated that the kemmerhouse was an \\"effective cultural solution to the problem of sexuality\\", because socially acceptable promiscuous sex (both homo- and hetero-sexual) occurred in the absence of a power differential, thus making it healthy. In addition, Gethenians were shown as having an inbuilt mechanism which forces them to seek consent for any sexual activity. The story further challenges conventional sex mores because the narrator Sov is seduced by her male parent Karrid, so that she may kemmer for the first time as a woman, according to the tradition within their family. However, Karrid does not take advantage of his position, and permits no further sexual activity to take place. Lindow states that this experimentation was possible in a story written in 1995 in a way that it was not when Left Hand was written; \\"In 1968 and 1969, Le Guin's imagination did not yet include Gethenian homosexuality, gynocentrism, or the multiplicity of connection possible inside a kemmerhouse; however, by 1995 [...] much had changed in the cultural acceptance of sexuality.\\" The story complicates the common theme of transitioning to adulthood by examining this transition on a planet where individuals have no fixed gender identity. The narrator Sov goes through a period of intense worry and anxiety when she learns she is going to kemmer for the first time. After experiencing the kemmerhouse, however, she says that \\"love is love\\", no matter whether a person is in kemmer or not. Thus, the story separates the idea of love from a person's sexual and gender identity. Publication and reception The story was first published in 1995, in the collection New Legends, edited by Martin Greenberg and Greg Bear. The collection was published by Legend Books. Alexis Lothian called it a \\"quietly feminist story\\", which demonstrated Le Guin's shift in political views since writing Left Hand towards more explicit feminism. The story was also published in Le Guin's 2002 collection The Birthday of the World, along with the original novella Paradises Lost and six other stories from the period 1994–2002. A review of that volume stated that \\"Coming of Age\\" lacked the \\"giddying impact\\" of The Left Hand of Darkness, with which it shared a setting. The review called it disappointing, and stated that it was \\"one of the two weakest stories in the book\\". With one exception, all of the works in the collection examine unorthodox sexual relationships and marriage.

Just like the Mayas, the Muisca had a vigesimal numerical system, based on multiples of twenty (Chibcha: gueta). The Muisca numerals were based on counting with fingers and toes. They had specific numbers from one to ten, yet for the numbers between eleven and nineteen they used \\"foot one\\" (11) to \\"foot nine\\" (19). The number 20 was the 'perfect' number for the Muisca which is visible in their calendar. To calculate higher numbers than 20 they used multiples of their 'perfect' number; gue-muyhica would be \\"20 times 4\\", so 80. To describe \\"50\\" they used \\"20 times 2 plus 10\\"; gue-bosa asaqui ubchihica, transcribed from guêboʒhas aſaqɣ hubchìhicâ. 1619 - Muisca numbers according to Bernardo de Lugo - accessed 29-04-2016 In their calendar, which was lunisolar, they only counted from one to ten and twenty. Each number had a special meaning, related to their deities and certain animals, especially the abundant toads.Izquierdo, 2009, p.30 For the representation of their numbers they used hieroglyphs drawn inspired by their natural surroundings, especially toads; ata (\\"one\\") and aca (\\"nine\\") were both derived from the animals so abundant on the Bogotá savanna and other parts of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense where the Muisca lived in their confederation. Most important scholars who provided knowledge about the Muisca numerals were Bernardo de Lugo (1619), Pedro Simón (17th century), Alexander von Humboldt and José Domingo Duquesne (late 18th and early 19th century) and Liborio Zerda.Humboldt, 1807, Part 1Humboldt, 1807, Part 2Humboldt, 1807, Part 3Duquesne, 1795Zerda, 1883  Numerals  The Muisca used a vigesimal counting system and counted primarily with their fingers and secondarily with their toes. Their system went from 1 to 10 and for higher numerations they used the prefix quihicha or qhicha, which means \\"foot\\" in their Chibcha language Muysccubun. Eleven became thus \\"foot one\\", twelve: \\"foot two\\", etc. As in the other pre-Columbian civilizations, the number 20 was special. It was the total number of all body extremities; fingers and toes. The Muisca used two forms to express twenty: \\"foot ten\\"; quihícha ubchihica or their exclusive word gueta, derived from gue, which means \\"house\\". Numbers between 20 and 30 were counted gueta asaqui ata (\\"twenty plus one\\"; 21), gueta asaqui ubchihica (\\"twenty plus ten\\"; 30). Larger numbers were counted as multiples of twenty; gue-bosa (\\"20 times 2\\"; 40), gue-hisca (\\"20 times 5\\"; 100). = Numbers 1 to 10 and 20 = { class:wikitable style=\\"float:center; border: 2px solid #003893; border- radius:5px;\\" ! align=center  Number ! align=center  Humboldt, 1807 ! align=center  De Lugo, 1619 ! align=center  Muisca hieroglyphs - ! align=center  1 ! align=center colspan=2  ata ! align=center valign=center rowspan=11  300px - ! align=center  2 ! align=center  bozha / bosa ! align=center  boʒha - ! align=center  3 ! align=center colspan=2  mica - ! align=center  4 ! align=center  mhuyca / muyhica ! align=center  mhuɣcâ - ! align=center  5 ! align=center  hicsca / hisca ! align=center  hɣcſcâ - ! align=center  6 ! align=center colspan=2  taa Taa on Muysccubun Dictionary - ! align=center  7 ! align=center  qhupqa / cuhupqua ! align=center  qhûpqâ - ! align=center  8 ! align=center  shuzha / suhuza ! align=center  shûʒhâ - ! align=center  9 ! align=center colspan=2  aca - ! align=center  10 ! align=center  hubchibica / ubchihica ! align=center  hubchìhicâ - ! align=center  20 ! align=center  quihicha ubchihica gueta ! align=center  qhicħâ hubchìhicâ guêata } = Higher numbers = { class:wikitable style=\\"float:center; border: 2px solid #003893; border-radius:5px;\\" ! align=center  Number ! align=center  Humboldt, 1807 ! align=center  De Lugo, 1619 - ! align=center  11 ! align=center  quihicha ata ! align=center  qhicħâ ata - ! align=center  12 ! align=center  quihicha bosa ! align=center  qhicħâ boʒha - ! align=center  13 ! align=center  quihicha mica ! align=center  qhicħâ mica - ! align=center  14 ! align=center  quihicha mhuyca ! align=center  qhicħâ mhuɣcâ - ! align=center  15 ! align=center  quihicha hisca ! align=center  qhicħâ hɣcſcâ - ! align=center  16 ! align=center  quihicha ta ! align=center  qhicħâ ta - ! align=center  17 ! align=center  quihicha cuhupqua ! align=center  qhicħâ qhûpqâ - ! align=center  18 ! align=center  quihicha suhuza ! align=center  qhicħâ shûʒhâ - ! align=center  19 ! align=center  quihicha aca ! align=center  qhicħâ aca - ! align=center  20 ! align=center  gueta ! align=center  guêata - ! align=center  21 ! align=center  guetas asaqui ata ! align=center  guêatas aſaqɣ ata - ! align=center  30 ! align=center  guetas asaqui ubchihica ! align=center  guêatas aſaqɣ hubchìhicâ - ! align=center  40 ! align=center  gue-bosa ! align=center  guêboʒha - ! align=center  50 ! align=center  gue-bosa asaqui ubchihica ! align=center  guêboʒhas aſaqɣ hubchìhicâ - ! align=center  60 ! align=center  gue-mica ! align=center  guêmica - ! align=center  70 ! align=center  gue-mica asaqui ubchihica ! align=center  guêmicas aſaqɣ hubchìhicâ - ! align=center  80 ! align=center  gue-muyhica ! align=center  guêmhuɣcâ - ! align=center  90 ! align=center  gue-muyhica asaqui ubchihica ! align=center  guêmhuɣcâs aſaqɣ hubchìhicâ - ! align=center  99 ! align=center  gue-muyhica asaqui quihicha aca ! align=center  guêmhuɣcâs aſaqɣ qhicħâ aca - ! align=center  100 ! align=center  gue-hisca ! align=center  guêhɣcſcâ - ! align=center  101 ! align=center  gue-hisca asaqui ata ! align=center  guêhɣcſcâs aſaqɣ ata - ! align=center  110 ! align=center  gue-hisca asaqui hubchihica ! align=center  guêhɣcſcâs aſaqɣ hubchìhicâ - ! align=center  120 ! align=center  gue-ta ! align=center  guêta - ! align=center  150 ! align=center  gue-muyhica asaqui hubchihica ! align=center  guêqhûpqâs aſaqɣ hubchìhicâ - ! align=center  199 ! align=center  gue-aca asaqui quihicha aca ! align=center  guêacas aſaqɣ qhicħâ aca - ! align=center  200 ! align=center  gue-ubchihica ! align=center  guêhubchìhicâ - ! align=center  250 ! align=center  gue- quihicha bozha asaqui hubchihica ! align=center  guêqhicħâ boʒhas aſaqɣ hubchìhicâ - ! align=center  300 ! align=center  gue-chihica hisca ! align=center  guêqhicħâ hɣcſcâ - ! align=center  365 ! align=center  gue- chihica suhuza asaqui hisca ! align=center  guêqhicħâ shûʒhâs aſaqɣ hɣcſcâ - ! align=center  399 ! align=center  gue-chihica aca asaqui quihicha aca ! align=center  guêqhicħâ acas aſaqɣ qhicħâ aca }  See also  *Muisca art *Muysccubun *Quipu - Inca numerals *Muisca calendar *Maya numerals  References  = Bibliography =   Muisca Muisca 1 ","title":"Muisca numerals"},{"id":"50371068","text":"Iranian frozen assets in international accounts are calculated to be worth between $100 billion and $120 billion. Almost $1.973 billion of Iran's assets are frozen in the United States. According to the Congressional Research Service, in addition to the money locked up in foreign bank accounts, Iran's frozen assets include real estate and other property. The estimated value of Iran's real estate in the U.S. and their accumulated rent is $50 million. Besides the assets frozen in the U.S., some parts of Iran's assets are frozen around the world by the United Nations. Background Iran's assets were first frozen by U.S. president Jimmy Carter in 1979, after revolutionaries overthrew the U.S.-allied Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi's administration and took American hostages. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the United States ended its economic and diplomatic ties with Iran, banned Iranian oil imports and froze approximately 11 billion 1980-US dollars of its assets.Suzanne Maloney (2010): \\"The Revolutionary Economy\\". United States Institute of Peace. Retrieved November 17, 2010. Many of the assets were then unfrozen in 1981 after the Algiers Accords were signed and the hostage crisis ended. At the time of the 1979 revolution, the Pentagon re-sold some $400 million in Iranian military equipment already paid for by the deposed government, and the money was \\"placed in an escrow account\\". Much of the frozen cash includes Iran's income from selling a limited amount of oil prior to the lifting of the sanctions, when Iran could legally sell oil but could not transfer the money back to Iran, because doing so was illegal under U.S. sanctions. After nuclear negotiations Some pages of the JCPOA were dedicated to the listing of individuals and entities whose assets would be unfrozen. According to Nader Habibi, a professor of economics at Brandeis University, JCPOA will lead to the release of only about $30 billion worth of assets; a similar figure of about $32 billion was estimated by Valiollah Seif, the chief of Iran's central bank. According to the Washington Institute in 2015: \\"...the pre-deal asset freeze did not have as great an impact on the Iranian government as some statements from Washington suggested. And going forward, the post-deal relaxation of restrictions will not have as great an impact as some critics of the deal suggest.\\" The US government also has seized a Manhattan skyscraper belonging to the Iranian government worth over a billion US dollars. Seizure of Iranian assets Deborah Peterson and other plaintiffs brought a lawsuit in U.S. federal court against the Islamic Republic of Iran, and obtained a judgments against Iran for its role in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings (in which 241 Marines were killed) and for other acts of international terrorism. While foreign states usually enjoy immunity from claims in court, the plaintiffs invoked an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 that allows foreign states to be held liable for acts of state-sponsored terrorism.Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 130 Harv. L. Rev. 307 (2016). The central bank of Iran, Bank Markazi, challenged the execution of the judgment on various grounds. However, in 2012, Congress passed, and President Barack Obama signed, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which specified that the judgment in the Peterson et al. v. Islamic Republic of Iran et al. would be subject to execution and also abolished Bank Markazi to the execution of judgment. Bank Markazi challenged this statute as unconstitutional, arguing that Congress had unduly interfered with a judicial function by intervening in a specific case; however, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Bank Markazi v. Peterson, ruled 7-2 that Congress's act was constitutional. Iran had denied any involvement in any of the bombings. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani called the action \\"blatant robbery\\".

Koven of The Boston Musical Intelligencer called it \\"a work of immense interest and power.\\" He continued, \\"It is also a tour de force of orchestration, of which Harbison is a supreme master.

The plant closed after 84 years in operation. One former worker estimated that \\"from 1915 to 1961 over 67,000 people had worked on the site\\". It was fabricated of steel and bronze by sculptor Julie Squires and BHP workers in the Fabrication Shop before the plant closed down. The seventy tonne monument is eight metres high, sixteen metres long and twelve metres wide, and demonstrates the significance of steel making to the city of Newcastle. It was installed on Industrial Drive, in the suburb of Mayfield in 1999.  Site  The land on which the work is installed is part of the site of the steelworks, originally chosen for its proximity to coal. The art work site in Muster Point Park was important to the members of the Newcastle Industrial Heritage Association and to former employees, who wanted to build the memorial. The nearby Newcastle Steelworkers Memorial by artist/ blacksmith Will Maguire which specifically \\"honours those who lost their lives in the steelmaking industry in Newcastle from 1915 to 1999\\" was dedicated on 2 June 2015.  Artist  Sculptor Julie Squires was born in Newcastle in 1966. She trained at the Hunter Institute of Technology and Newcastle University and has created other works in bronze and other public art works in Newcastle, including Destiny at Dyke Point, which was commissioned by the Newcastle Port Corporation to mark 200 years of operation as Australia's first commercial port.  Design  Trade union acknowledgements on wall beyond commemorative pair of bronze industrial gloves The Muster Point is designed as a \\"walk-through\\" steel and bronze sculpture with gates that are locked but can be opened to allow access. The sculptor described the Muster Point work \\"as a visual analogy to reflect the real life experiences of the employees of the Newcastle Steelworks, prior to the closure of the plant\\". Items associated with work at the steelworks are included in the design. For example, there is a whistle and a clock as well as a locomotive driver to represent the rail that moved all the steel. The images of four men on the gates represent friendship and the four walls create a skyline profile that references the one seen when looking at the plant. The cats are in recognition that the animals were dumped in the area. The relevant trade unions associated with steel manufacture are acknowledged by their initials, incorporated into one wall. Among them are the Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia, the Maritime Union of Australia, the Transport Workers Union of Australia, the Electrical Trades Union of Australia, the Building Workers Industrial Union, the Operative Painters and Decorators Union, the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. A cross is incorporated into the design to honour the people who lost their lives doing dangerous work for BHP.

Fraser Kershaw stars in the film. The film captures live footage while combining fictional elements. The film embraces the power of family and the commitment to conflict for survival. The film is based on a true story and throughout the film Kershaw transitions into various characters seen in his subconscious. Filming The footage within the film was collected over 2 years throughout Latin America. Lacking access to modern health care in the jungle added stress to the film's production. Fraser Kershaw takes a camera crew through highly restricted areas to find the deeply personal tales of stories from locals of Latin America. Kershaw can be seen delivering clean water in rural restricted areas. Plot The film is based in part on some fiction, which itself is based in three separate adventures in the mind of Kershaw. He is seen as multiple characters. The film weaves together the stirring true stories of individuals who have overcome devastating obstacles to find clean water. The film embraces the power of family, commitment and how a community can be radically divided because of survival. Music The original score was composed by Brent Kutzle and Fraser Kershaw. Behind the Water's soundtrack was released on April 23, 2016. Caribbean's Cana News states, \\"The score is clever enough to enhance the visions into place which assimilates to the footage from beginning to end.\\" Release Behind the Water was released on International television during Earth Day weekend throughout the Caribbean and Latin America.

Career Born in Otahuhu, Auckland, on 2 November 1941, Peryer completed a Master of Arts in Education at the University of Auckland in 1972, and lectured in English at Auckland Teachers' College. He began photographing in 1973, and was largely self-taught. His work was included in The Active Eye, the first survey of contemporary New Zealand photography, mounted by the Manawatu Art Gallery in 1975. Peryer held his first solo exhibition at the Dowse Art Museum in 1977; this was the first solo exhibition of a contemporary photographer at a New Zealand public art gallery. His work has been extensively exhibited in public and private art galleries throughout New Zealand and internationally, in solo exhibition and group shows. In 1995 an exhibition of Peryer's work titled Second Nature: Peter Peryer Photographs toured New Zealand and Germany. One of the works used to advertise the exhibition in Europe was Dead Steer (1987), which depicts the bloated carcass of a cow on a rural roadside. New Zealand's then Minister of Agriculture John Falloon protested the inclusion and use of the work, on the basis that it was bad publicity for the New Zealand meat industry. He attempted unsuccessfully to have the exhibition closed and ordered the New Zealand High Commissioner to withdraw from attending an opening of the exhibition. In the 1997 Queen's Birthday Honours, Peryer was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to photography. In 2000, he was among the five artists recognised by the Arts Foundation of New Zealand as their inaugural Laureates. Peryer died on 18 November 2018 at the age of 77. The next exhibition of works by Peryer will take place in February 2019 at {Suite} Gallery in Wellington. Work Peyer began taking photographs with a cheap Diana camera. Early series and portfolios included Mars Hotel (1975), Gone Home (1975) and Souvenir (1976.) In a review of Peryer's early activity in late 1977 critic Neil Rowe wrote \\"Although he has been taking photographs seriously for only two years he has achieved a highly distinctive style and an intensely personal repertoire of imagery\\". In 1979 Peryer was included in the Auckland Art Gallery exhibition Three New Zealand photographers: Fiona Clark, Laurence Aberhart, Peter Peryer, which toured to nine other galleries. Peryer showed 11 works, including a number of photographs of various zoo animals, including pelican, ibis, peacock, alligator, monitor lizard, kingfisher. Each animal was captured in such a way that its surrounding enclosure was not removed but suggested in the image, an ongoing theme of Peryer's work. Peryer's best-known early works are a series of photographs taken of his then-wife, Erika Parkinson. The portraits were gathered into a 2000–01 touring exhibition Erika: A Portrait by Peter Peryer. The exhibition curator Justin Paton wrote at the time: > Nothing in New Zealand photography of the seventies has the same > psychological charge or stark glamour. Two decades later they still feel > urgent, as if the need to look ignited the need to be looked at, and the > photos just flared into being. In a 1989 article looking back over the first 15 years of Peryer's photography career, curator Ann Elias wrote: > The group of powerful human portraits that established Peryer's reputation > in the second half of the nineteen-seventies were often melodramas in which > he romanticised the subject (himself, Erika, Christine Mathieson and others) > through devices many artists have used in the same deliberate way – a dark > and grainy technique to intensify the mystery; the choice of a haunted, > confrontational or tragic expression to intensify the seriousness; and the > incorporation of objects, sometimes extraneous (a rooster, a fish), often > clothing, to intensify the narrative. ... A comparison of his early > photographs with the most recent shows how Peryer has altered his position > on the making of images. Six Foot Lake, Campbell Island can only be > described as understated compared with the orchestrated drama of the early > portraits. Writing in the mid 1990s, curator Robert Leonard observed \\"Peter Peryer made his name as an expressive photographer producing angst-ridden portraits. A change of heart in the early 1980s saw him adopt a more formalist approach, treating miscellaneous subjects in a more documentary but still quirky way.\\" In a 1985 exhibition catalogue Peryer said: > I work in an additive way. I tend to start with a blank picture and add the > elements one by one. That's one of the reasons why so few of my pictures > have horizons because it is quite hard to control the background … a painter > can subtract or alter – I just build up. Photography critic Peter Ireland traced the \\"growing formalism\\" of Peryer's works to the Grid Series of 1981. He noted that \\"While Peryer draws on movements and artists as distinct as Constructivism, German avant-garde photography, and Moholy-Nagy, his intellect saves this from being merely an art-historical tour to mould it into a highly-personal visual ideology\\". Robert Leonard also noted Moholy-Nagy and the \\"New Photography\\" movement of Weimar Germany when citing Peryer's influences and sources, but also noted \\"various non-art vernaculars, like botanical and catalogue photography, National Geographic, and scenic postcards.\\" Peryer himself identified Edward Weston as a photographer he looked to, \\"but I was influenced not by the images so much as by the fact that he quit everything to pursue a life as a photographer. And what's more he wrote most eloquently about it.\\" Solo exhibitions * 2014 Peter Peryer: A Careful Eye, The Dowse Art Museum and Sarjeant Art Gallery * 2012 Other: photographic portraits 1975–2011, Gus Fisher Gallery, Auckland * 2001–2002 Erika: A Portrait by Peter Peryer, Dunedin Public Art Gallery City Gallery Wellington and Auckland Art Gallery * 2001 The left hand raised, Govett-Brewster Art Gallery * 1997 At home and away: recent photographs, Sarjeant Art Gallery * 1995–1996 Second Nature, touring New Zealand and Germany * 1986 Peter Peryer: Photographs, Sarjeant Art Gallery and touring * 1977 Peter Peryer: An Introduction, The Dowse Art Museum Publications * Peter Peryer: A Careful Eye, Lower Hutt: The Dowse Art Museum, 2014. * Peter Simpson, Peter Peryer : photographer, Auckland: Auckland University Press, 2008. * Silver / Peter Peryer, photographs : Bill Manhire, poem, Whanganui: McNamara Gallery, 2006. * Greg Burke, The left hand raised : photographs, 1995–2001, New Plymouth: Govett-Brewster Art Gallery, 2001. * Justin Paton, Erika : a portrait / by Peter Peryer, Dunedin: Dunedin Public Art Gallery, 2001. * David Maskill, After Rembrandt by Peter Peryer, Wellington: Adam Art Gallery, 1999. * Charles Eldredge, At home and away : recent photographs, Whanganui: Sarjeant Art Gallery, 1997. * Greg Burke, Second nature : Peter Peryer, Zurich: Edition Stemmle, 1995. * Peter Peryer: Photographs, Whanganui: The Sarjeant Art Gallery, 1985.

The hymn was written as a missionary hymn; there are conflicting accounts of why the hymn was written. The hymn was later published in 374 hymnals worldwide, though it was censored and altered in the United States by slaveholders for evangelising to slaves. The hymn later fell out of favour with hymn book editors in the 1960s.  History  There are conflicting accounts of why the hymn was written. According to one account, George Bowen was converted to Christianity through hearing a Welsh girl singing hymns. He later went to stay at Llwyn-Gwair Manor at the same time that the Welsh Methodist Association were there. While there, he met Williams and asked him to compose some verse about the Preseli Hills. \\"O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness\\" was written as a result of these requests. Though it is possible that this story may be correct as Llwyn-Gwair Manor and Williams' bedroom at the manor did overlook Carn Igli, in the 19th century an alternative story arose. In this version, Williams was travelling to Pontrhydyfen and composing a new missionary hymn as part of a commission from Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon. Upon passing the ruins of an old Cistercian abbey and seeing the mountains he would have to cross on a stormy night, the view inspired him to write \\"O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness\\" for the Countess.Kirk, 100 The hymn was first written in Welsh as English was not Williams' first language so it was later translated into English by another person. This was because Williams did not know enough English to fully express the intent of the original Welsh verses in translation. In 1836, \\"O'er the Gloomy hills of Darkness\\" was reviewed in an issue of The Eclectic Review. In a remarkably snide review, the hymn, among many others, is criticised for a lack of grammatical correctness as well as a lack of rhyme in the first verse, \\" ...inane verbiage preferred by worthy people to the noblest compositions of sanctified genius; and to blot it out from our hymn-books would be a species of sacrilege\\". This was attributed to Williams' lack of English as a native language gave rise to \\"a stiffness apparent\\" in the hymn. The New York Times stated it had gained popularity because of Williams' \\"ease and sweetness\\" in his hymn writing.  Controversy  The second verse of the hymn begins with the lines \\"Let the Indian, let the negro, Let the rude barbarian see\\". Williams included this after hearing stories of promising missionary contact with Cherokee tribes and with slaves in the Province of Georgia.Kirk, 108 When the hymn became established in the United States, slave owners changed the line referencing \\"Indian\\" and \\"negro\\" to \\"Let the dark benighted pagan\\". The abolitionist Ebenezer Davies claimed “The altered reading, I learned, prevails universally in America, except in the original version used by the Welsh congregations. Slave-holders, and the abettors of that horrid system which makes it a crime to teach a negro to read the Word of God, felt perhaps that they could not devoutly and consistently sing \\"Let the Indian, let the negro ... see”. In the 1850s, the Baptist Union of Great Britain dropped the hymn from usage. The reason published in the Baptist Magazine stated \\"But the verses are too rude and unfinished to be generally accepted in modern day\\". In later years in the 19th century churches, including the Church of England, started to publish the hymn replacing the second verse with the American slave owner's amended version. In the early 1900s, the second verse would often be omitted altogether from hymnals.  Hymnals  \\"O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness\\" first appeared in published hymnals in 1792. Jeffrey Richards states that \\"William Williams's O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness of 1772 (sung variously to Thomas Clark's Calcutta, by Baptists; to Henry Gauntlett's Triumph, in The Scottish Hymnal; to Edwin Moss's Ulpha, in the 1982 Presbyterian Church Praise) did not make it into Hymns Ancient and Modern, but it was in Bickersteth's Christian Psalmody in 1833 and was still to be found complete in the 1933 Baptist Hymnal … This very much set the tone for missionary hymns.\\" After being published in 374 hymnals throughout history, in the 1960s the hymn stopped being published in all Christian hymnals. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints retained the hymn in their hymnals from 1927 until dropping it in 1985. This was because its members in modern times felt that the hymn connected Native Americans and black people with barbarians. The hymn's lyrical style set the tone for future missionary hymns. \\"O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness\\" inspired the founder of Methodism, Charles Wesley, to write \\"Sun of Unclouded Righteousness\\" for missionaries working with \\"Mahometans\\".

Aït Bouadou is a commune of the Ouadhia District (daïra) which is a Tizi Ouzou Province (wilaya) in the Kabylie region of Algeria. History = French invasion= Captain of engineers Péchot, head of the Arab bureau's Algiers section, was given the mission of a good will tour of the tribes. The Arab bureau section in Algiers was created by a ministerial decision of 22 March 1849. The territory of the subdivision included, according to the organization of 16 April 1849: 1° the circle of Algiers, composed of the Sahel of Algiers, of the bach aghalik of Sebaou, of the agaliks of the Khachena and the Flissa and of the unsurrendered tribes of Kabylie; 2° the circle of Dellys, composed of the suburb of Dellys, the caïdals of the Beni-Tour, Beni-Slyim, Sebaou-El-Kodim, Isser-Drœu, Isser-El- Djediane and Isser-Oulad-Smir. Si Ahmed Taïeb ben Salem, khalifa d'A])d el Kader, was camped at Beni-bou-Addou, on the north flank of the Djurdjura; he had with him the remains of his regulars and a group of Arab horsemen who had hitched their star to his and whose ranks were thinning daily from desertions brought on by lack of resources; so he welcomed a reason for some skirmishes and looting. Lieutenant-colonel Charles Denis Bourbaki first took the hamlet of Tassoukit, then attacked Ir'il-Imoula, which defended itself vigorously, but was unable to hold out long against French troops. The cherif fled towards the plain of Guechtoula, trying to reach Djurdjura; the chasseurs pursued and pushed him hard for five or six kilometers, as far as the foot of the villages of the Beni-bou-Addou, seconded by a goum, who was camped near the Mcchtras. Bou Bar'la managed to escape, but this shameful flight lowered his prestige in the eyes of Kabyles. He tried again, among the Beni-Sedka and the Zouaoua, to recruit contingents to contest the terrain taken by the French, but did not meet with any success and did not reappear until the very end of the operations there. On 27 February 1847, surrender of si Ahmed Taïeb ben Salem in Aumale: it was followed by that of Bel Kassem or Kassi. The latter was named bach-aghadu Sebaou; Ben Salem was authorized to travel to Mecca, and his brother, Aomar ben Salem, was named of the Beni-Djaad and of the Sahel oued.  Climate  Aït Irane has a hot, temperate climate. The village has an average yearly temperature of 15.4 °C. The hottest month of the year is August, reaching an average temperature of 26.2 °C.

Information  = Subject = The play is set on the back porch of a New Zealand home and tells the story of a daughter returning home after 15 years' absence. The central relationship is between the mother, who has not achieved her life-long goals, and the daughter, who has experienced so much through her travels. = Honours and critical response = The play won second prize in the Southland Centennial Playwriting Competition in 1956, however it was rejected by a number of New Zealand theatres. It was subsequently purchased by a London agent and debuted in Bristol. After it achieved success in England, the New Zealand Players, who had previously rejected it, toured forty North Island towns with it in 1959. It was met with critical acclaim, The New Zealand Herald calling it \\"an adult, compelling and first-class piece of work\\". It was published in 1960 by Whitcombe and Tombs with New Zealand Literary Fund support. Contemporary critics compared The Tree to Arthur Miller's style of playwriting, and particularly his 1947 play All My Sons, with its sparse dialogue and portrayal of a family under pressure. It was also compared to New Zealand playwright Bruce Mason's The Pohutukawa Tree, with comment that Jones' text read \\"much more smoothly\\" than Mason's. 1980s commentators on the play point out that the father's role is relatively insignificant, and that other of Jones' works also show strong female lead characters, although this gender-based analysis may not have been apparent to audiences in the 1950s. The play is recommended reading for drama papers at the University of Auckland, and was included in a Landmark New Zealand Play Reading Series in 2012.

In 1981, she gave birth to a son, Argyris.Dimitriou, Giotas (October 9, 2008). \\"The Song Is Not a Junk T-Shirt\\" {in Greek} By 1985, having taken lessons in classical singing, she made her professional debut in Thessaloniki and came into contact with songwriter George Zikas whose songs she performed on her first solo album.Eleni Tsaligopoulou at Music Corner {in Greek} In 1987 she interpreted songs by top Greek composers and songwriters Manos Hadjidakis and Stamatis Spanoudakis and toured Greece, other parts of Europe and also in America with established singing star George Dalaras. Their professional association continued for the next ten years. She frequently gave concerts in Athens with Dalaras and, although during the early years of her career, her voice and singing style were frequently compared to another established star, Eleftheria Arvanitaki, she quickly formed her own unique style. In 1989 she collaborated with another star musician, singer and songwriter Nikos Xydakis and, the following year, issued the bestselling album Κορίτσι και γυναίκα (Girl and Woman). Its success was such that it gave impetus to the so-called \\"modern artistic\\" style of Greek music which came to the fore in the 1990s and exemplified that era. Career as a star performer During the decade, she rose to the top tier of Greek musical performers, with nine albums, from 1990's Κορίτσι και γυναίκα (Girl and Woman) to 1999's Αλλάζει κάθε που βραδιάζει (Changes Descend Every Evening). Among her most popular albums were 1996's Argentinos, followed, two years later, by Dream Era, which includes live recordings from her Ιερά Οδό (Sacred Way) appearances. During 1998–99, she formed a singing partnership with another Greek vocalist, Melina Kana, resulting in 1999's 13 Φεγγάρια (13 Moons). The decade's end signaled changing musical trends and styles, as she released an album featuring bold western pop music and toured the country with concerts in tandem with yet another musical star, Dimitris Basis as well as bands Mode Plagal and, starting in 2007, Mikro, which blended traditional Greek music with jazz, funk and other international styles. She adapted to the trends of 2000s, while partnering with John Kotsiras (in 2000) and (in 2001) with her husband Giorgos Andreou as well as with Nikos Portokaloglou. In 2002, she performed with Manolis Lidakis and was heard on the soundtrack of writer- directors Thanasis Papathanasiou and Michalis Reppas' 2001 film To klama vgike ap' ton Paradeiso (Crying... Silicon Tears). In 2004, she headlined at Athens Concert Hall, performing the songs of Vassilis Tsitsanis and, during the summer, was seen as a singer and leading the dance as part of the Iphigenia in Aulis staging at Patras Municipal and Regional Theatre. During 2005 she partnered in a summer tour with actress and singer Tania Tsanaklidou and, her album for that year, Αγαπημένο μου Ημερολόγιο (Dear Diary), was a record of her work with the musical ensemble Εστουδιαντίνα Νέας Ιωνίας (Estoudiantina Neas Ionias) known for traditional interpretations of Greek folk songs, which provided a return to the roots of her initial inspiration and performing style.Eleni Tsaligopoulou at U-verse In the following years she continued to record albums and perform, such as her 2008 appearances with singers Andriana Babali and Giota Nega and at the \\"Αποθήκη του Μύλου\\" performance venue in Thessaloniki, with singer Glykeria, and, at the Polis Theatre with the band Trifono which specializes in tribute concerts of Greek traditional music.Eleni Tsaligopoulou has been interpreting the works of Greek songwriter Kostas Livadas for the last 15 years (Serifos Festival, July 27, 2015) 2016 performances in the United States On April 22, 2016 she performed in the United States at the Kaye Playhouse in New York City's Hunter CollegeChoros, Evgenia. \\"AKTINA Festival: Magical Performance by Eleni Tsaligopoulou & Bogaz Musique\\" (Greek USA Reporter, April 28, 2016) and, the following day, at the Berklee Performance Center in Boston.\\"Plaka Entertainment / AKTINA Productions presents Greek Music Journey 2016 with Eleni Tsaligopoulou (April 23, 2016) Accompanied by her band which, in 2015, she gave the new name of Bogaz Musique: Apostolos Tsardakas (kanonaki/tzoura/baglama/vocals), Spyros Chatzikontstantinou (guitars/vocals), Haris Kellaris (bass) and Argyris Diamantis (drums), she presented a 2½-hour show at each venue, performing best-known selections from her personal discography, as well as traditional, classic and rembetika songs, including top hits by Manos Hatzidakis, Mikis Theodorakis and Stavros Xarchakos.

This group of historians played an important role in creating a \\"scientific\\" basis for historical research, and were also responsible for coining two fundamental groups of terminologies in scientific racism: *Blumenbach and Meiners's color terminology for race: Caucasian or white race; Mongolian or yellow race; Malayan or brown race; Ethiopian or black race; and American or red race;The End of Racism by Dinesh D'Souza, pg 124, 1995, \\"Blumenbach's classification had a lasting influence in part because his categories neatly broke down into familiar tones and colors: white, black, yellow, red, and brown.\\" * Gatterer, Schlözer and Eichhorn's Biblical terminology for race: Semitic, Hamitic and Japhetic. The University of Göttingen was the original centre of the \\"Geschichtswissenschaft\\" or history as an academic discipline, and became a major centre for globally- orientated anthropology. The school itself was one of the newest universities in Europe, having been founded in 1734 by :de:Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen, and the first to require the obligation to conduct and publish research alongside lecturing. The historians of this school sought to write a universal history by combining the critical methods of Jean Mabillon with that of the philosophical historians such as Voltaire and Edward Gibbon.

The team began by competing in the 2001 Spanish Formula Three Championship, with Daniel Martín, Álvaro Parente, Miguel Ramos and Paul Robinson as drivers. Robinson brought two podiums to the team at Jarama and Estoril. The next year was the most successful in the team's history. Marcel Costa grab the championship title with two wins at Jerez. For the next year the de Villota's son Emilio de Villota Jr. joined team as well as Andy Soucek, who was the only driver to collect podiums for the team in the season. In 2004 the team continued with Andy Soucek, but de Villota Sr. sells its stake in EV Racing and creates Master Junior Formula series. In 2007 his team returns to Spanish Formula Three Championship with Bruno Méndez, who had podiums at Estoril and Jerez. In the final year in the championship under Spanish Formula Three branding, the team had Will Bratt as the only full-time driver. He had five podiums to finish the season on the seventh in the series standings. In 2009 the main driver of the team was Sergio Canamasas, who had three podiums and ended season as sixth. For 2010 the team had signed Fernando Monje and Juan Carlos Sistos, who brought three podiums to the team. Also during the 2010 the team participated in Superleague Formula with cars representing Sevilla FC, AS Roma and Sporting CP. The team continued their collaboration with Sistos in 2011, when he scored four podiums at Algarve, Monza, Jerez and Barcelona. Sistos remained with the team for the third consecutive season and achieved the first win since their return in 2007.

Designed by Henri Dupuy de Lôme, the prototype Napoléon displayed such outstanding performances during her trials that a production series was immediately ordered, yielding the Algésiras sub-class. Furthermore, construction of the two Bretagne class 130-gun ships was interrupted: Desaix, whose construction had only just started, was cancelled altogether and replaced with Arcole, while Bretagne was dismantled and entirely rebuilt on principles heralded by Napoléon. Further improvements to the Algésiras type yielded the Ville de Nantes sub-class. The \\"swift ships of the line\\" of the Napoléon class were initially considered of the 3rd rank, behind the 120-gun first rank ships of the Océan class and Valmy and the 2nd rank 100-gun ships of the Hercule-class, and on par with the 90-gun Suffren class; however, in practice, most of the ships of the Hercule and Suffren classes had been transformed for steam and sail, losing ten guns in the operation, which made them steam ships of the line of 90 and 80 guns respectively. The Napoléon class was thus quickly promoted to 2nd-rank ships, also reflecting the status provided by their nautical performances.

History Zoe Reynolds recorded her first acoustic demos — which later became the 2014 EP “I Can Feel You In My Hair Still” — in her mom’s laundry room, and the EP’s online release received early attention from music publications. Together with guitarist Colin Kupson, Reynolds wrote and recorded her second EP, 2015’s “We Have No Future, We’re All Doomed,” with Jake Ewald (Modern Baseball, Slaughter Beach, Dog). The album, released on Soft Speak Records, was named after a friend’s yearbook message, and ultimately became a memorial line after their passing. “We Have No Future” ushered in a dark, dream-pop that countered but didn’t overwhelm the act’s folk roots, and highlighted the impending sense of doom adolescents face at the cusp of adulthood. After parting ways with Kupson post-tour, Reynolds emerged once again as a solo artist occupied with self-love and healing. The result of these occupations was “Sunset Blush,” named after a boxed wine she and her friends drank and their subsequent long, late-night conversations. She recorded the album with friend Kyle Pulley (Thin Lips), who acted as a collaborator, at Headroom Studios in Philadelphia. After the album was picked up by SideOneDummy, a label that later downsized, Reynolds chose to self-release it on a vanity label she named Bug Crusher Records to stay true to the original April 2018 release date. On October 8, 2020, Reynolds announced her signing to Triple Crown Records, alongside a new single called \\"Around Your Room\\".

Around 1540 the ship, which had mostly been used for representative purposes, was acquired by Henry VIII, King of England, to augment his fleet. The ship saw action during the French invasion of the Isle of Wight in 1545. She along with Samson were used in an unsuccessful attempt to raise Henry VIII’s flagship, Mary Rose, after she foundered during the Battle of the Solent. She was later chartered to a group of merchants in 1563 by Queen Elizabeth I. Jesus of Lübeck became involved in the Atlantic slave trade and smuggling under John Hawkins, who organized four voyages to West Africa and the West Indies between 1562 and 1568. During the last voyage, Jesus, along with several other English ships, encountered a Spanish fleet off San Juan de Ulúa (modern day Vera Cruz, Mexico) in September 1568. In the resulting battle, Jesus was disabled and captured by Spanish forces. The heavily damaged ship was later sold for 601 ducats to a local merchant.

Life Batistich was born in Dargaville to John Barbarich and Milka Matutinovich, settlers from Dalmatia. Her parents ran a boarding house which attracted new migrants, including labourers heading for Northland's gumfields for work. She was educated by the Sisters of St Joseph and the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions. The family moved to Auckland when Batistich was 11. Her father worked at a quarry there with Dalmatian stonemasons, and she was thus again surrounded by Dalmatian people. In the 1940s, aged about 44, she began to write poems and stories about her family and community, and the hardships faced by early settlers. These were initially published in The Listener magazine and the School Journal, a magazine for New Zealand school children. She also wrote about other ethnic minorities in New Zealand, such as Chinese in the Otago Gold Rush. In 1981, Batistich's novel Pjevaj Vilo u Planini won first prize in an international competition in the former Yugoslavia for migrant writers, and she was invited to visit Croatia by the Croatian Writers' Guild. In the 1997 Queen's Birthday Honours, Batistich was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for community service.

July 13, 1994, 3 In 1998, the Howard Government changed its stance and supported East Timor self-determination, prompting a referendum that saw East Timor gain its independence.\\"Unanimous assembly decision makes Timor-Leste 191st United Nations member state\\", United Nations, 27 September 2002, accessdate 4 May 2016 Background With a change in government following the 1974 Portuguese revolution, the colonial ruler of East Timor, Portugal, moved to decolonise. As a result, Portugal effectively abandoned their colony of East Timor. Following this, in 1975, the two main East Timorese political parties Fretilin and the UDT, formed a government. At this time, Indonesia began a secret operation to build a relationship with the UDT, named Operation Komodo. The UDT attempted a coup, which Fretilin resisted with the help of the local Portuguese military. With the UDT leaders fleeing into Indonesia, Fretilin made a unilateral declaration of independence on 28 November 1975, of the Democratic Republic of East Timor (República Democrática de Timor-Leste in Portuguese). Shortly after, on 7 December 1975, Indonesian forces invaded East Timor. Overview The Flag House in Balibo According to author Clinton Fernandes the governments of Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating co- operated with the Indonesian military and President Suharto to obscure details about conditions in East Timor and to preserve Indonesian control of the region.Fernandes, Clinton (2004), Reluctant Saviour: Australia, Indonesia and East Timor Australian governments saw good relations and stability in Indonesia (Australia's largest neighbour) as providing an important security buffer to Australia's north. Nevertheless, Australia provided important sanctuary to East Timorese independence advocates like José Ramos-Horta (who based himself in Australia during his exile). However, throughout the duration of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor, the Australian public were generally uncomfortable, if not actively against the occupation, initially highlighted by the deaths of five Australian journalists who came to be known as the \\"Balibo 5\\". Also the actions of the Timorese people in supporting Australian forces during the Battle of Timor in World War II were well-remembered, particularly by veterans. These two issues kept the East Timor occupation in a negative light, throughout the duration of the invasion and occupation. Protests took place in Australia against the occupation, prominent East Timorese lived in Australia and kept the issue alight, and some Australian nationals participated in the resistance movement. According to Professor James Cotton, writing in his book on the invasion, Suharto in fact avoided coming to Australia, with the knowledge that there would be public protests.James Cotton, Professor School of Politics, \\"East Timor, Australia and Regional Order: Intervention and Its Aftermath\\", Routledge, p 33 Governmental responses =Whitlam Government era 1974–75= Suharto- Whitlam House in Dieng Plateau (Indonesia), where East Timor's fate was discussed in 1974. There are a number of reasons why the Whitlam Government supported Indonesia's annexation of East Timor. Whitlam, speaking to the ABC, said to an extent, his Government was carrying on the view that East Timor was not viable as an independent state. Additionally, there were initial fears of a possible Communist government being installed in East Timor by the Timorese, after the withdrawal of the Portuguese. This saw the Whitlam Government look favourably upon Indonesian annexation, and Whitlam expressed this desire to Suharto in a visit to him in 1974. Michael Salla, writing in the Australian Journal of International Affairs, said Whitlam perceived and interpreted the issue in an anti-colonial framework. Whitlam himself said \\"the division of the island of Timor is no more than an accident of Western colonial history\\". There were also fears that a long drawn out civil war could result in great loss of life over a long period, as had occurred in Angola, another ex- Portuguese colony.Salla, Michael (1995), \\"Australian foreign policy and East Timor\\", Australian Journal of International Affairs, 49:2, 207–222, DOI: 10.1080/10357719508445157 To an extent, Whitlam established the logic and support of the annexation, and this was carried on by later Australian prime ministers and their governments. In addition, the Australian Government saw the desire for peace in the ASEAN region. Nicholas Klar, writing on Whitlam's response to the Indonesian invasion, said that Whitlam also was concerned that revolution by separation movements could spread across Indonesia, causing a domino effect that could see the balkanisation of Indonesia into several small states. According to historian Luke Miller, Wikileaks documents have indicated that before the invasion, there is some possible evidence that Australia was feeding intelligence to Indonesia about Portugal, in order to minimise misunderstanding about the situation between the two countries. It has been argued that comments by the Whitlam Government may have encouraged the Suharto regime to invade East Timor,\\"Fed: Cables show Australia knew of Indon invasion of Timor\\". AAP General News (Australia). 13 September 2000. Retrieved 3 January 2008. with former Army officer, and deputy commander of UNTAET, Michael Smith, writing that the invasion at least had \\"tacit approval from Australia and the United States\\".Smith 2003, p. 38. Despite this, and the general favourable view of the annexation, the Australian Government voted for a UN resolution condemning the invasion, in 1975. During the lead up to Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in 1975, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) paid a Dili-based Australian businessman Frank Favaro for information on local political developments. The leaking of his identity in late 1975 led to a confrontation between the then Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and Bill Robertson, the head of ASIS, resulting in the sacking of the intelligence agency director on 21 October 1975, to take effect on 7 November. Bill Robertson disputes the reason for his dismissal in documents lodged with the National Archives in 2009. =Fraser Government and East Timor 1975–84= The Government of Malcolm Fraser was the first to officially recognise Indonesia's de facto annexation of East Timor, doing so in January 1978. This was followed by de jure recognition, during negotiations with Indonesia regarding the seabed boundary between the two countries.\\"Final Report on the Inquiry into East Timor\\", Senate Report, Commonwealth Government of Australia, 7 December 2000, section 7.2 The Prime Minister ordered the seizure of a two- way radio link between East Timor and Australia being operated illegally by Fretilin supporters near Darwin. Following his return from Jakarta, Mr Fraser gave instructions that the Telecom outpost radio service near Darwin cease picking up and passing on Fretilin messages from East Timor. He also denied Australian entry visas to Fretilin spokesmen claiming to represent the Democratic Republic of East Timor.\\"Final Report on the Inquiry into East Timor\\", Senate Report, Commonwealth Government of Australia, 7 December 2000 Section 7.10 The opposition party at the time, the Labor Party, in 1979, called on the Fraser Government to withdraw the recognition.Thakur, Ramesh, \\"Responsibility to Protect and Sovereignty\\", Routledge, p68 Fraser himself saw that he had no choice but to continue the recognition, as it would have caused serious repercussions with Indonesia, and the US at the time would not support Australia, as they saw the East Timorese resistance group, FRETILIN, as communists,Fraser, Malcolm and Margaret Simons, \\"Malcolm Fraser: The Political Memoirs\\", Melbourne University Publishing, 2010 and it was seen in Australia's interest to support Indonesia. \\"Final Report on the Inquiry into East Timor\\", Senate Report, Commonwealth Government of Australia, 7 December 2000, Section 7.9 =Hawke Government 1983–91= The Timor Gap The Hawke Government continued and confirmed Australia's de jure recognition of the Indonesian annexation of East Timor.

However, the Keating Government escalated its military and other relations with Indonesia, beyond the previous governments. Both Australia and the US were involved in assisting the Indonesian military, and upgraded relations during this time included the signing of a security treaty. According to John Pilger and several other journalists, Keating was perceived as not having done enough, while Prime Minister, to prevent human rights abuses in East Timor,Pilger, John, \\"Blood On The Hands of the Mates\\", New Statesman & Society.

A UN-sponsored referendum held in 1999 showed overwhelming approval for independence, but was followed by violent clashes and a security crisis, instigated by anti-independence militia. Australia then led the United Nations backed International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) to end the violence and order was restored.\\"Final Report on the Inquiry into East Timor\\", Senate Report, Commonwealth Government of Australia, 7 December 2000, section 7.140 After the withdrawal of the Indonesian military from East Timor, violence flared in Indonesia, mainly involving pro-Indonesian militia.

Australian public support for East Timor independence Demonstration in support of East Timorese independence in Perth (1999) While the Government continued to recognise the annexation of East Timor during this period, there was a large amount of support for East Timorese self-determination by the Australian public. In particular, the Catholic Church, Unions, the Communist Party of Australia and East Timorese living in Australia worked together to protest against the issue. Smith writes that throughout the occupation reports emerged from the province regarding human rights abuses. He states that mostly these were unsubstantiated until the November 1991 Santa Cruz incident, which was caught on camera. Smith goes on to write that \\"such human rights abuses prevented the Indonesians from gaining the trust and confidence of the [East Timorese] people and strengthened...international resentment against Indonesia's occupation\\".Smith 2003, p. 39. The feelings amongst the Australian public gradually peaked, and when the Militia violence occurred after the UN- sponsored referendum ballot in 1999, the feelings were that strong the Australian Government moved to be involved to protect the East Timorese. Large scale protests in Melbourne and Sydney and other Australian cities occurred in support of intervention that attracted tens of thousands of people. Australia subsequently played a lead role in the establishment of the international peace keeping force that deployed to East Timor in September 1999, following Indonesian consent.Smith 2003, pp. 44-46.

The ship spent most of her career training and made many visits to foreign ports in Africa, Western Europe and Australia. In the late 1960s, she was modernized and equipped to operate a helicopter. In the mid-1970s, President Steyn played a minor role in the Angolan Civil War as a part of South African operations against the communists. The ship was withdrawn from service in 1980 and was sunk as a target in 1991 after financial problems prevented her from being reactivated.  Description  The President-class ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a mean deep draught of . The ships were powered by a pair of English Electric geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers. The turbines developed a total of which gave a maximum speed of . They carried of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . Their crew numbered 14 officers and 200 ratings. The Presidents were armed with one twin-gun mount for QF 4.5-inch (114 mm) Mk V dual-purpose guns forward and one twin mount for Bofors anti-aircraft guns. For anti-submarine work, the ships were fitted with Type 162, 170, and 177M sonars for the pair of triple-barrelled Mk 10 Limbo anti-submarine mortars. They were equipped with a Type 293Q surface-search radar, Type 262 and 275 gunnery radars, Type 277Q height-finding radar and a Type 978 navigation radar. By the mid-1960s, it was obvious that the sonars of the President class were capable of detecting submarines well outside the range of the Limbo anti- submarine mortars and the South Africans decided to follow the lead of the Royal Navy in giving them the ability to operate helicopters that could carry anti-submarine torpedoes or depth charges to a considerable distance from the ships. Therefore, the forward Limbo mortar was removed and its space was plated over to form a small flight deck. The Bofors mount, its director and the aft superstructure was replaced by a hangar for a Westland Wasp helicopter. Two single Bofors guns were positioned on the hangar roof and provisions were made for four Browning machine guns. A pair of American Mk 32 triple-barrelled anti-submarine torpedo tubes were added amidships and their electronics were upgraded, including the addition of a Thomson-CSF Jupiter early-warning radar atop a new mainmast and a Selenia Orion fire-control system. Construction and career Three President-class frigates were ordered by the South African Navy in the late 1950s following the Simonstown Agreement with the Royal Navy (RN). President Steyn was the second ship of the three sister ships and was ordered from Alexander Stephens and Sons on 18 September 1957 with the name President Kruger. The government wanted the first ship to be completed to receive the name of the first president of South Africa and a strike at the Alexander Stephens shipyard delayed the laying of the ship's keel. So she exchanged names with the first ship built by Yarrow which had already been laid down and became President Steyn, named after Martinus Theunis Steyn, last president of the Orange Free State. She was laid down at their shipyard in Linthouse, Glasgow on 20 May 1960. The ship was launched on 23 November 1961 and commissioned on 8 April 1963, with Captain John Fairbairn in command. Completion was slightly delayed by a fire aboard the ship on 3 July 1962 that required holes to be cut in the hull and decks to rescue the workmen trapped aboard. President Steyn arrived in Simon's Town on 13 September and all three of the Presidents were assigned to the 10th Frigate Flotilla. They participated in Capex 63 training exercise with British and French warships in July–August 1963, but only President Steyn and her sister participated in Capex 64 the following year. In 1965 the Royal Navy decided to reduce Capex to a weapons training period with only RN and SAN units participating, presumably to reduce the profile of cooperating with the apartheid government of South Africa. On 7 October 1968, the 10th Frigate Flotilla, now consisting of President Steyn, President Pretorius and the replenishment oiler , departed Simon's Town for Australia and arrived in Fremantle on the 23rd. They continued onwards to Sydney and then participated in the Remembrance Day ceremony in Melbourne on 11 November. The flotilla departed three days later, bound for home, but they were forced to put into Freemantle when a pump in President Pretorius burnt out en route. The ships finally reached home on 3 December. President Steyn began her modernisation the following year on 5 August 1969 and was recommissioned in May 1971. Several months later, the ship departed Simon's Town on 1 September to escort the newly completed, French-built submarine to South Africa. En route, she visited ports in Portugal, West Germany, England, and Spain. While visiting Luanda, Portuguese Angola, the ship's helicopter needed to make a test flight after replacing the main rotorhead and was lost with all hands on 25 November. President Steyn and Emily Hobhouse arrived on 10 December and the frigate made another voyage to Toulon the following year to escort the submarine home from France. This time, the trip was much more direct and the two ships arrived on 19 June 1972. Shortly afterwards, President Steyn sailed to Gough Island to pick up a seriously ill weatherman for treatment. In 1973, the ship, together with President Kruger and Johanna van der Merwe, visited Lourenco Marques (now Maputo) in Portuguese Mozambique from 29 March to 7 April. Despite downplaying the exercises with the South Africans, the Royal Navy continued to do so until the British government abrogated the Simonstown Agreement on 16 June 1975. President Steyn played a minor role in Operation Savannah, the South African covert intervention in the Angolan Civil War, most notably when she rescued 26 advisors to the National Liberation Front of Angola who had been cut off after a failed attack on Luanda on 28 November. To provide manpower for the French corvettes under construction, the ship was placed in reserve in early 1977. The United Nations arms embargo imposed later that year put paid to that plan and she was recommissioned the following year. Shortly before President Kruger was recommissioned on 15 August 1980, President Steyn was permanently decommissioned on 1 August, after the navy decided to only keep two of the sisters active. She briefly served as a barracks ship before all of the useful equipment and machinery was stripped from her and the navy planned to use her as a target for Skerpioen missiles in 1982. However, the accidental sinking of her sister in February 1982 gave the ship a reprieve as she was placed in reserve in case the navy decided to restore her to operational service. Plans to do so were made later in the 1980s, but shortages of money prevent them from being realized. President Steyn was towed from Simon's Town on 29 April 1991 and sunk by a combination of missile hits and gunfire from the five involved in the exercise.

Description The shrub has an intricately and openly branched, diffuse to low-spreading habit and typically grows to a height of and a width of . The stem usually divides just above the ground to form horizontally spreading branches. It has light grey coloured slightly roughened bark and glabrous finely ribbed branchlets that are a light to reddish brown colour at the extremities but age to a grey colour. The branchlets that erect triangular stipules that are in length. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. Th smooth green and glabrous phyllodes are in length and wide with an asymmetrical elliptic to obtriangular shape ending with a rigid, pungent, straight, brown point with a length of . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Bruce Maslin in 2008 as part of the work New taxa of Acacia (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae) and notes on other species from the Pilbara and adjacent desert regions of Western Australia as published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin words meaning very small in reference to the size of the phyllodes. Distribution It is native to an area in the Pilbara and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia. The shrub has a range from the eastern edge of the Pilbara, to the east of Balfour Downs Station in the west to the Little Sandy Desert around Lake Disappointment in the east but has a scattered distribution composed of a series of discontinuous populations. In the areas where it does occur it is not uncommon. It is often situated in swales between sand dunes an on plains growing in sandy or loamy soils that at times have a gravelly mantle. It is usually a part of shrub steppe communities usually in association with a spinifex hummock grassland understorey.

In addition, President Pretorius was converted to use diesel fuel and some of her water ballast tanks were converted into fuel tanks. History Three President-class frigates were ordered by the South African Navy in the late 1950s following the Simonstown Agreement with the Royal Navy (RN). President Pretorius, named after the first President of the South African Republic, was the last of the three sister ships and was ordered from Yarrow Shipbuilders on 29 July 1959. The ship was laid down at their shipyard in Scotstoun, Glasgow on 21 November 1960 and was launched on 28 September 1962 by Mrs. Mientjie Grobelaar, wife of General Pieter Grobbelaar, Chief of the South African Defence Force. She was commissioned on 18 March 1964 with Captain James Johnson, later Chief of the Navy, in command. President Pretorius was escorted into Cape Town by her two sister ships, , , the destroyer Simon von der Stel and four smaller warships to be greeted by the Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Hugo Biermann, on 26 September. After 1964, the British government was reluctant to be seen openly cooperating with the apartheid government of South Africa and limited itself to exercises as their ships passed by. In September 1967, the 10th Frigate Flotilla, consisting of President Pretorius, President Kruger, and the newly commissioned replenishment oiler , participated in one such exercise with the aircraft carrier , the frigate and the submarine . The flotilla departed Simon's Town on 7 October 1968 for Australia and arrived in Fremantle on the 23rd. They continued onwards to Sydney and then participated in the Remembrance Day ceremony in Melbourne on 11 November. The ships departed three days later, bound for home, but they were forced to put into Freemantle when a pump in President Pretorius burnt out en route. They finally reached home on 3 December. A year later, a squadron consisting of Simon von der Stel, President Pretorius, Tafelberg and two minesweepers visited Portuguese Angola. President Kruger and President Pretorius trained with a passing British squadron in July–August 1970. By this time, the navy was experiencing shortages of manpower and the ship was laid up on 1 September to be used as an accommodation ship while President Steyn was finishing up her modernisation. President Pretorius was formally decommissioned on 11 May 1971, but languished in reserve for some time before actual work began. The ship did not recommission until 12 July 1977 in marked contrast to the time required to modernise her sisters. She conveyed the remains of the Xhosa Chief Maqoma from Robben Island to Ciskei in August 1978. Almost three years later, in May 1981, President Pretorius and President Kruger participated in the 20th anniversary of the republic's founding and exercised with a squadron from the Republic of China (Taiwan). Shortly afterwards, the two sisters made a showing the flag cruise along the East African coast. After the accidental sinking of President Kruger in 1982 and the earlier laying up of President Steyn, President Pretorius was the last of the sisters remaining active. She was refitted during the early 1980s to lay mines and to operate assault boats. The ship exercised with another Taiwanese squadron in mid-1985 before she was decommissioned on 26 July due to manpower shortages and lack of funds. Plans to reactivate and modernise President Pretorius were made later in the 1980s, but shortages of money prevented them from being realized. The ship was sold for scrap on 9 December 1992 and subsequently broken up.

The painting, which is not dated, was painted before the events which caused it to be marked. It was marked to make it a political allegory of the patriot hero Johan de Witt who was murdered by orangists. Since Roos was known for his patriotic politics, it is quite possible that he marked the painting himself when he bought it in 1800, though the estate sale catalog already mentions that it is an allegory of Johan de Witt.Catalog entry at 1800 purchase for Een Levensgrote Zwaan in een Landschap National art gallery Though one of the main attractions of the young museum in 1800, the Oranjezaal could never be moved and has since remained well-preserved, but closed to the public.

He began his NBL career in 2012 as a development player with the Cairns Taipans, before earning a full-time roster spot in 2013. In 2016, he moved south to join the Brisbane Bullets. After half a season with the Adelaide 36ers in 2019, he joined the Kings. Early life and career Born and raised in Horsham, Victoria, Bruce attended Horsham College where he graduated from in 2008. Two years earlier, as a 15 year old, Bruce began playing for the Horsham Hornets in the Big V Division Two, joining his brother Cameron at the club. He played four seasons for the Hornets which culminated in a 2009 season where he averaged 27.5 points in 23 games, and had two triple-doubles during the year. In January 2010, Bruce moved to Ballarat and joined the Ballarat Nuggets of the SEABL D-League. Under the tutelage of Ballarat Basketball Association elite program manager Guy Molloy, Bruce impressed early on for the Nuggets which earned him elevation to the senior squad, the Ballarat Miners, in April 2010. He completed his first season with the Miners having played in 19 games while averaging 3.6 points, 1.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. In 2011, Bruce re-joined the Miners and completed his first full SEABL season, a season which culminated in him winning the SEABL East Golden Hands Award, which is calculated by adding a player's assists and steals and subtracting their turnovers. In 26 games for the club, he averaged 6.7 points, 1.7 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. In January 2012, Bruce had a three-day training stint with the Melbourne Tigers of the National Basketball League. He believed the experience was invaluable to his future development, and in his third season as Miner in 2012, the numbers demonstrated such development. In 28 games for Ballarat in 2012, he averaged 10.8 points, 3.0 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game. Professional career =Cairns Taipans (2012–2016)= 2012–13 season As a result of his continued improvement in the SEABL, in August 2012, Bruce signed with the Cairns Taipans as a development player for the 2012–13 NBL season, joining the NBL ranks alongside his brother Aaron. Despite moving north to Cairns, in December 2012, Bruce recommitted to the Ballarat Miners for the 2013 SEABL season. During the 2012–13 season, Bruce managed to appear in 17 games for the Taipans while averaging 1.1 points per game. He subsequently won the inaugural Aron Baynes Award for Most Outstanding Athlete. His stint with the Taipans paid dividends, as he was a dominant force for the Miners in 2013 as team captain. In 17 games for the club, he averaged career high numbers of 14.6 points, 3.4 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game. He did, however, miss eight games during the season with a torn quadriceps, denying him a chance to represent Australia on the international stage at the World University Games. 2013–14 season In August 2013, Bruce was rewarded with a full-time contract by the Taipans for the 2013–14 season. He appeared in 21 of the team's 28 games in 2013–14, averaging 1.2 points 1.0 rebounds per game.

He appeared in all 17 games for the Marlins in 2014, averaging 17.2 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 1.2 steals per game. He was subsequently named to the QBL All-League Team. 2014–15 season Bruce was retained by the Taipans for the 2014–15 season and received a more prominent role. As the back-up point guard, he assisted starters Scottie Wilbekin and Cameron Gliddon, and on 31 December 2014, he recorded his first double-digit scoring game of his NBL career with 12 points against the Adelaide 36ers. After finishing outside the playoff picture in 2013–14, the Taipans stormed to minor premiers in 2014–15 with a 21–7 record, a club record. They went on to qualify for the Grand Final series where they faced the New Zealand Breakers. However, they were outclassed by the Breakers in the best-of-three series, losing in straight sets despite having home court advantage. While Bruce's play during the 2014–15 season did not garner too many highlights, he built a reputation as a steady role player who runs the offence and defends with aggression. He appeared in 31 of the team's 32 games during the season, averaging 3.7 points, 1.5 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game. In July 2015, after returning from the Australian University Games tour of Asia, Bruce re-joined the Cairns Marlins for the rest of the 2015 QBL season.

In 1836 he helped in the formation of the Blaenavon Iron and Coal Company and was appointed resident managing director. Early life James Ashwell was born in 1799 in Nottingham. He attended Nottingham Grammar School and later Edinburgh University. As a school boy he showed an interest in his father's businesses in iron and coal. A visit to Manchester and Leeds in 1816, where he was fascinated by steam mills and machinery, particularly steam locomotives, led to his decision to be an engineer. Training He trained as an engineer with Bryan Donkin, and became friends with Henry Robinson Palmer, who was often employed by Thomas Telford to make surveys. Ashwell assisted Palmer on surveys in East Anglia. While still training he was involved in starting what is now the Institution of Civil Engineers. Work After completing his training Ashwell worked at ironworks in Derbyshire and Scotland. In 1836 he helped in the formation of the Blaenavon Iron and Coal Company and was appointed resident managing director. Ashwell started to build a new ironworks, to be called Forgeside, on a pocket of freehold land, so that the new company would be free of the rents, royalties, and insecurity of the leasehold of the old ironworks. Foundations were built for blast furnaces, forges and rolling mills. While at Blaenavon Ashwell was responsible for the magnificent water balance tower (known locally as the guillotine because of the sight of two cages passing the oval openings) at Blaenavon Ironworks, which is now a Grade I listed building. He was also responsible for other water balance lifts at coal pits and quarries associated with the company. Within a few years there was a downturn in the industry, Ashwell was forced to resign in 1841, and the new works at Forgeside abandoned (although it was later restarted in 1859). Ashwell moved to Cambridge, where his sons studied, and himself studied for an MA and BA. His health deteriorated and his doctor, Benjamin Brodie, advised him not to return to his studies but to travel abroad. When travelling he was commissioned to report on the Great Luxembourg Railway Company and became Managing Director and Engineer in Chief of the company from 1847 to 1852. The company was embroiled in a dispute with the Belgian government resulting in a lawsuit. The company was acquitted but Ashwell suffered financially and his health deteriorated. Retirement Ashwell returned to England to study Hebrew and harmony and died on 2 July 1881 at his home, Mildway Lodge, in Weston-super-Mare References Category:1799 births Category:1881 deaths Category:People from Nottingham Category:People educated at Nottingham High School Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh ","title":"James Ashwell"},{"id":"50372743","text":"Annual production of bauxite in the United States, 1900-2013 Bauxite mining in the United States produced an estimated 128,000 metric tonnes of bauxite in 2013.World Mineral Statistics 2010-2014, British Geological Survey, 2014. The United States Geological Survey has withheld US bauxite tonnages since 1988, so as not to reveal proprietary information. Although the United States was an important source of bauxite in the early 20th century, it now supplies less than one percent of world bauxite production. Uses Bauxite is the only commercial ore of aluminium, and 96 percent of bauxite consumed in the US is used to produce aluminum (metallurgical grade).Bauxite, USGS Minerals Yearbook, 2013. However, since 1981, none of the bauxite mined in the US was used to make metallic aluminium. US bauxite is instead used for abrasives, high-temperature refractory materials, and as a high-strength proppant for hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells. History The American bauxite industry held world importance during World War I, and from 1914 through 1920, supplied more than half the world's bauxite. In 1914 and again in 1915, the US supplied 94 percent of the world's bauxite. Wartime aluminum demand for airplane construction during World War II caused bauxite production to jump more than 16-fold from 1939 to 1943. In 1943, US bauxite production peaked at 6.3 million tons, then fell back to 1.0 million tons in 1945. The US has supplied less than ten percent of world bauxite each year since 1956, and less than one percent each year since 1982. From 1889 through 2013, a total of 94 million metric tons of bauxite were mined in the US, about 90 percent of which came from central Arkansas. In 2013 the US mined 128,000 metric tons of bauxite. Deposits Bauxite forms by the weathering of aluminum-rich and silica-poor rocks in hot, humid, climates, at places with good drainage. Under the proper conditions, weathering disintegrates the aluminium silicate minerals, and dissolves and removes the silica, creating bauxite. The mined US bauxite deposits have all been in the southeastern United States. =Arkansas= About 90 percent of American-mined bauxite has come from deposits in central Arkansas. The Arkansas deposits were formed during the Eocene from weathering of intrusions of nepheline syenite, an aluminium-rich, silicate-poor, igneous rock. Bauxite is still mined in Arkansas, but has not been mined for aluminium metal production since 1981. Alcoa operates a processing plant near Benton, Arkansas, which produces used as a high-strength proppant in hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells. The bauxite is mined by McGeorge Contractors. =Eufaula, Alabama= Bauxite has been mined near Eufaula, Alabama since 1927.

Personal life and education Moriarty was born in County Kerry, Ireland, the second son of Commander Merion Moriarty, R.N. Staying behind to complete his education when his parents migrated to Australia, he completed a Bachelor of Arts and then Master of Arts at Trinity College, Dublin, was engaged as a cadet on the construction of the Isle of Portland breakwater and became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He was articled as a pupil to William Morgan (inventor of the feathering float for paddle-steamers), in the firm of Acraman, Morgan and Company, of Bristol, during which he assisted with the design and construction of a number of steamships including “Little Western”, “Avon”, “Severn”, and a large steam yacht built for the Austrian Government, the “Archduke Frederick”. Moriarty then worked under Sir John Macneill on railways back in Ireland, and passed the examination for County Surveyor in the Board of Works. In 1848 he migrated to New South Wales, initially being employed as assistant in the Surveyor- General's Department undertaking survey work in Queensland under Sir Thomas Mitchell. In 1852 he commenced private engineering practice in Sydney. Moriarty married Leila Helen, née Geary, in Brisbane on 18 May 1853. Engineering career Between 1853 and 1855 he held the position of engineer and surveyor for the Steam Navigation Board and from 1855 to 1858 was engineer on the Hunter River improvements. He was then appointed Engineer-in-Chief for Harbours and River Navigation with the NSW Department of Works from 1858 to 1859. While in the military, in the 1850s (and with approval), he undertook external commissions for the Penrith Nepean Bridge Co. and the first Pyrmont Bridge in 1866. In 1855 Morarity was Engineer Surveyor for the Hunter river improvements and in that capacity made soundings and mapped the Hunter River at the Port of Newcastle which were developed into a plan to improve the entrance to the sea by constructing extended breakwaters and river control walls as well as develop the port faculties to improve the export of coal (Stewart 1983). In particular, Morarity is noted for his involvement in the construction of the Dyke a river training wall on the western bank of the Hunter river at Newcastle which was developed into a coal loading facility and basin equipped with hydraulic cranes for loading coal and an associated rail link. In 1862 Moriarty was made commissioner for roads and engineer-in-chief. He was a Sydney Water Supply Commissioner in 1868, president of the Hunter River Floods Commission in 1869-70, and also responsible for water supply schemes for Albury, Bathurst, Hunter Valley towns, Wagga Wagga and Wollongong. Moriarty was made responsible for the Clarence River Entrance Works between 1862 and 1889, where he proposed short breakwaters and rock training walls. (Powell, 1974). However, this was not entirely successful as sandbars formed near the opening. Moriarty argued with the harbour engineer John Coode about the cause and remedy, but when Moriarty went on leave prior to his retirement, his successor, C.W. Darley, implemented Coode's scheme. Part of the remaining north training wall is still called “Moriarty’s Wall” in recognition of his role. Personal interests Moriarty also had a military career as lieutenant in the Volunteer Artillery, and as a captain from 1869. He was also involved in the board for inspecting and maintaining supply of colonial warlike stores, the commission on defence from foreign aggression and was a Captain of the Engineers Corps Volunteer Rifles in 1871-73. Outside of professional activities Moriarty was also a Philosophical Society councillor, member of the New South Wales Linnean Society and a member of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron. He retired from engineering positions on 31 December 1888 and returned to England, where he died at Southsea, Hampshire, on 18 September 1896, leaving an estate worth £5800.

The fable and its analogues In Classical times the fable only appears in Greek sources, most notably in the Histories of Herodotus, where Cyrus the Younger applies it to Greek envoys who submit to him too late. It tells of a fisherman piping to the fish to make them dance. When they will not oblige, he catches them in a net and mocks their death agonies: “Silly creatures, you would not dance for me before and now that I am no longer playing you do so.” In this context the fable is given the political meaning that those who refuse a benefit when it is first offered will gain nothing by acting as asked when constrained to.Christos A. Zafiropoulos, Ethics in Aesop's Fables, Brill 2001, p.16 Gustave Doré's illustration of the flute- playing shepherd, 1868 The instrument played by the fisherman varies over the ages in the telling. In the Greek it is a reeded pipe (αὐλος), rather like the chanter of a bagpipe. In William Caxton’s collection of fables it is indeed rendered as a bagpipe,VI.7 while in the Neo-Latin of Pantaleon Candidus and Hieronymus Osius it is a tibia, which the illustrator to the latter author makes a trumpet.Fable 206 In La Fontaine’s French version the instrument is referred to as a ‘musette’ which, since his fable is titled “The Fishes and the Shepherd who Played the Flute” (Les poissons et le berger qui joue de la flûte, X.10), must refer to the old piccolo oboe. Nevertheless, it was translated as bagpipe by Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, in her rendering of his poem.Miscellany Poems (1713), pp.28-9 La Fontaine had made of the story an artificial pastoral in which Tircis tried to charm the fishes to the hook of the shepherdess Annette but did not succeed until he used a net to catch them. It ended with the cynical reflection that force accomplishes more than charm in the context of statecraft, which echoes the conclusion in Herodotus.The Complete Fables of La Fontaine, trans Craig Hill, Skyhorse 2013, X.11 However, different morals were drawn by other writers. According to Babrius, only when one succeeds is it time to rejoice.Fable 9 For William Caxton and Roger L'Estrange, the lesson to be learned is that there is a proper time and place for everything.Wikisource Other allusions to or analogues of the fable have varied widely over the centuries. Commentators have seen a likeness to the story, although only in the detail of dancing to the pipe, in Jesus’ parable of the children playing in the market-place who cry to each other, “We piped for you and you would not dance; we wept and wailed and you would not mourn” (Matthew 11.16-17, Luke 7.31-2).Francisco Rodríguez Adrados, History of the Graeco-latin Fable 3, Brill 2003, p.20 There is an echo here too of the criticism of unresponsive behaviour found in Herodotus. In Mediaeval times a story about a peasant who really had the power to charm fishes to the shore with his harp-playing appeared in the Gesta Romanorum,fable 35 while dancing fishes figure in a fable by Ivan Krylov. There the king of the beasts has given the fox guardianship of the rivers but, when he comes on a tour of inspection, discovers the fox cooking the fish. Asked for an explanation, the fox explains that the fish in the boiling water are dancing for joy at the lion’s visit.Original Fables, tr.

Biography  Pancheti Koteswaram was born on 25 March 1915 in Nellore, a coastal Andhra Pradesh town, to Pancheti Subbarayulu Davar and Venkatasubbamma but lost his father before he turned one and was brought up amidst limited financial means, by his mother and grandmother, both widows. He completed his early education in Nellore and passed the Intermediate examination from Andhra University with first rank, winning the Sir R. Venkitaraman Gold Medal. It was during this period, he endured a tropical cyclone which hit Nellore in 1927 when he was twelve, which would, reportedly, influence his future career. He graduated in physics with honours from Presidency College, Chennai of Madras University in 1934 and started his career as a junior lecturer at Andhra-Christian College, Guntur where he worked till 1936 when he moved to Andhra University, Waltair, continuing his teaching career and simultaneously doing research in Raman Effect under the guidance of I. Ramakrishna Rao. In 1939, he secured the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc) for his thesis, Molecular association as studied by the Raman Effect, thus becoming the first non-Brahmin to receive the degree from Madras University. This was followed by two short stints lasting one year and one month each, at the Hindu College, Machilipatnam as the Head of the department of Physics and as the assistant professor at Pachaiyappa's College, Chennai. In August 1940, he joined the India Meteorological Department (I.Met.D.) as an assistant meteorologist by which time he had already published 14 articles in national and international scientific journals. The initial years at India Meteorological Department coincided with World War II and his duties were mainly related to military operations, though he was also engaged in research on the Nor'westers that occurred regularly in Bengal area. At the department, he deputed several notable meteorologists such as Charles Normand, S. K. Banerji, the last British and the first Indian Director-Generals of the organization respectively, as well as N. K. Sul and his stint at the Cyclone Warning Centre, Kolkata assisted him in furthering his researches on cyclone warning systems. He worked at I.Met.D. till 1975, two years past his mandatory superannuation, and headed the organization as its Director-General from 1969 to 1975. In between, he had various stints abroad; as a research associate at University of Chicago (1955–56), as a senior scholar at University of Hawaii (1961), as a consultant on Tropical Cyclones at World Meteorological Organization, Tokyo (1962), as a visiting professor at the School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences of the University of Miami (1964–67), as a professor at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Colorado (1967) and as a visiting faculty at Tehran University (1975–78). Koteswaram married Sarojini on 20 August 1943 and the couple had four daughters and a son. After his retirement from active work, he settled in Waltair, in Andhra Pradesh and it was here he died on 11 January 1997, at the age of 82, survived by his wife and children.  Legacy  = Scientific achievements = The discovery of Easterly Jet Stream is one of the principal contributions of Koteswaram to metereology. He explained the phenomenon in the mid-fifties, defining it as an air current which reaches the speed of about 40m/sec during June–September periods and located near 140N with axis lying between 200-100mb (12-13 km). The discovery earned him an invitation from Herbert Riehl, the German-born US meteorologist, for joint research at the University of Chicago from 1955 to 1956 which returned new findings on the phenomenon. The duo found out that the jet stream was caused by the high levels of heat over Tibetan region and their findings assisted another German meteorologist, Hermann Flohn, in his work, besides providing a tool for predicting the Indian summer monsoon. He published his conclusions in an article, The Easterly Jet Stream over the tropics, published in Tellus A, a Swedish scientific journal in 1958. During this period, he was also involved in research on the variability of monsoon rainfall over India, partnering S. M. A. Alvi, one of his colleagues. Their researches assisted in fixing the frequency of the monsoon variability at around two years and served as a tool in predicting the variability of monsoon in the west coast of India. Prediction of tropical cyclones was another area of his research. He was one of the early researchers in the field and did extensive research on the spiral cloud bands related to a cyclone. It was under his leadership, X-Band and S-Band Cyclone Detection Radars, six of them in the west coast and 4 in the east coast of India, were installed by the Meteorological Department getting them manufactured by the Indian firm, Bharat Electronics Limited. His researches have been published in several articles and presented at various seminars including the Inter-Regional Seminar on Tropical Cyclones of Tokyo in 1962. Besides, he also contributed to the better understanding of \\"hydrogen bond formation in associated liquids\\", \\"the formation of a meridional monsoon cell in the Asian summer monsoon\\" and the long period trends in the rainfall over the Indian west coast. = Other contributions = Koteswaram was credited with the setting up several cyclone distress mitigation committees with government, scientific community and public participation for information dissemination, planning of disaster management operations, setting up of cyclone shelters and the establishment of cyclone warning systems. He was associated with the World Meteorological Organization and served as its vice-president in 1971, the first Indian director-general to be elected to the post. The same year, when the World Meteorological Congress was held in Geneva, he was elected as the chairman of the Expert Committee which established the WMO Tropical Cyclone Project, following the UN resolution in the wake of the 1970 Bhola cyclone which devastated Bangladesh. He was also a member of the WMO Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology (CAeM) and his participation was reported in the preparation of Procedures for Air Navigations Services – Meteorology (PANS- MET). When WMO initiated the World Weather Watch program in 1961, he was associated with the initiative and under the aegis of the I.Met.D, he contributed to the program by establishing a Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) and a Regional Telecommunication Hub (RTH) in New Delhi. He was also credited with re-designing the structure of I.Met.D on a regional basis. Koteswaram was the author of several articles on meteorology and hydrology; his articles were published in many national and international peer-reviewed journals and were cited in several texts on the subjects. Besides, he published a book, The Upper-tropospheric and Lower-stratospheric Structure of Several Hurricanes, brought out in 1967 by the National Hurricane Research Laboratory. He was also a member of the editorial boards of several journals and was the editor of Indian Journal of Meteorology and Geophysics.  Awards and honors  Koteswaram, a recipient of the Sir R. Venkitaraman Gold Medal of the Andhra University, was elected as a fellow of the Andhra Pradesh Academy of Sciences in 1972. The Indian National Science Academy elected him as its fellow in 1974, the same year as he became an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences. A year later, the Government of India included him the Republic Day Honours list for the civilian award of the Padma Bhushan for the year 1975. The Souvenir and abstracts of the International Seminar on Monsoon Meteorology and Water Resources Hydrology held at Visakhapatnam in August 1997 were published in honour of Koteswaram.

The team was formed in 2017 on the Raw brand as a trio called Absolution, which consisted of Paige, Rose and Deville with the latter two jumping to the main roster from NXT. Paige retired from in-ring competition due to her injuries and became the SmackDown General Manager in 2018 and ended her alliance with Rose and Deville, thus dissolving Absolution. Rose and Deville continued teaming together and the team was renamed \\"Fire and Desire\\" in late 2019. The team dissolved in 2020 when Deville betrayed Rose by conniving with Dolph Ziggler to create friction between Rose and Otis. History =Absolution (2017-2018)= On the November 20, 2017 episode of Raw, the night after Survivor Series, Paige made her return to WWE after a year-long hiatus due to injury, along with the debuting Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville from NXT and attacked Bayley, Mickie James and Sasha Banks. The following week, the trio dubbed themselves \\"Absolution\\". They had their first match as a team on the December 11 episode of Raw, in which Rose and Paige defeated Bayley and James in a tag team match. Absolution had their first televised match as a trio at 2017 Tribute to the Troops, in which Paige, Rose and Deville defeated Bayley, Banks and James in a six-woman tag team match. They lost a rematch to Bayley, Banks and James by disqualification on the December 18 episode of Raw but defeated them on the December 25 episode of Raw. On December 27, Paige suffered a neck injury after receiving a kick from Banks during a six-man tag team match between Absolution and the team of Bayley, Banks and James at a house show, which led to the referee stopping the match. Paige's injury put her out of action but she continued to manage Rose and Deville during matches at ringside. Rose and Deville continued to represent Absolution as a tag team and continued to trade wins with Bayley, Mickie James and Sasha Banks in tag team matches and six-man tag team matches throughout early 2018. Paige retired from in-ring competition on the post- WrestleMania 34 episode of Raw on April 9. The following night, on SmackDown, the SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon made Paige, the new General Manager of the SmackDown brand after former General Manager Daniel Bryan resigned from his position due to his in-ring return. On April 17, Rose and Deville joined Paige on the SmackDown brand in the 2018 Superstar Shake-up. However, Paige ended her association with the group by dissolving Absolution on the May 1 episode of SmackDown and refused to grant any favors to Rose and Deville. =Fire and Desire (2018-2020)= Rose (left) and Deville (right) at WrestleMania 34 Following the dissolution of Absolution, Rose and Deville continued their alliance as a tag team. Their first match as a team on SmackDown took place on the June 5 episode of SmackDown, where they lost to Asuka in a handicap match. Rose and Deville sporadically teamed together throughout 2018 and lost their matches to combinations of Asuka, Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair and Naomi before picking up their first win on the December 4 episode of SmackDown by defeating Asuka and Flair. They also represented Team SmackDown against Team Raw in a five-on-five women's elimination match at Survivor Series, which Team SmackDown lost. Rose and Deville would then begin feuding with Naomi which led to Rose flirting with Naomi's husband Jimmy Uso, which led to the two sides exchanging wins with each other in singles competition. On February 17, 2019, Rose and Deville participated in an Elimination Chamber match for the new Women's Tag Team Championship at the namesake event, which was won by The Boss 'n' Hug Connection (Bayley and Sasha Banks). Soon after, Rose and Deville began a feud with Asuka over her SmackDown Women's Championship, which Rose failed to win at Fastlane. Dissolution was teased as both of them had accidentally cost each other matches against Asuka during the feud but maintained their alliance. On the August 5 episode of Raw, Rose and Deville participated in a fatal four-way elimination match for the Women's Tag Team Championship against the defending champions The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce), The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka and Kairi Sane) and the team of Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross. Rose and Deville eliminated IIconics from the match but were eliminated by Kabuki Warriors. Bliss and Cross went on to win the match. Shortly after, Rose and Deville's team was named \\"Fire and Desire\\" and they defeated Bliss and Cross in a non-title match on the September 3 episode of SmackDown, which earned them a title shot against Bliss and Cross for the Women's Tag Team Championship at Clash of Champions, which they lost. On the November 8 episode of SmackDown, Fire and Desire lost to Carmella and Dana Brooke in a qualification match for Team SmackDown at Survivor Series. Fire and Desire would then briefly feud with Bliss and Cross for the next two months which led to both teams exchanging wins. On the March 6, 2020 episode of SmackDown, Fire and Desire wrestled their last match as a team in which they defeated Carmella and Dana Brooke. =Breakup and aftermath (2020)= In late 2019, Rose got involved in a romance storyline with Otis. Rose agreed to go on a Valentine's Day date with Otis on the February 14, 2020 episode of SmackDown, but Dolph Ziggler appeared in Otis's place during the date, which resulted in a romance between Rose and Ziggler. The storyline then evolved into a love triangle involving a feud between Otis and Ziggler over Rose. It was revealed on the April 3 episode of SmackDown that Deville was working with Ziggler to keep Otis from Rose, thus marking the breakup of Fire and Desire. On April 5 at WrestleMania 36, Rose interfered during a match between Otis and Ziggler by attacking Deville, who was at ringside, and Ziggler, which helped Otis score the victory. This resulted in a feud between Rose and Deville, during which Deville branded her selfish out of jealousy and attacked her, vowing to \\"ruin her life\\". Deville would cost Rose, a Money in the Bank qualifying match against Carmella on the May 1 episode of SmackDown. This led to a match between Rose and Deville on the May 8 SmackDown, which Deville won. On the May 22 episode of SmackDown, Rose and Otis were defeated by Deville and Ziggler in a tag team match. On the August 14 edition of SmackDown, Rose challenged Deville to a Hair vs. Hair match at SummerSlam, which the latter accepted. A week later, the stipulation was changed to a Loser Leaves WWE match. On August 23, Deville lost to Rose at SummerSlam, thus forcing Deville to leave WWE.

He studied at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, and obtained a Lady Grace James Scholarship, as a result of which he studied in Italy under Guido Agosti and Sergio Lorenzi. In 1978, he made his name internationally by playing at the Alice Tully Hall in New York City alongside Dong-Suk Kang, and has since been an official accompanist at the Tchaikovsky Competition and the Carl Flesch violin competition, among others. Having accompanied artists such as Yo Yo Ma, Emma Johnson and Sarah Chang, he was appointed head of the Department of Accompaniment at London's Guildhall School of Music in 1980, and became a fellow in 1984. Gordon Back met Menuhin in the 1970s when he accompanied some of the violinist's master classes, and was official accompanist at the first Menuhin Competition in 1983. Following Menuhin's death in 1999, he began taking the competition further afield, to Norway, China and the United States among other locations. He describes it as \\"as much a festival as a competition\\". In 2016 he appeared in a BBC television documentary, \\"Who's Yehudi?\\", to mark the centenary of Menuhin's birth.

He won two of his three starts as a juvenile in 2015 including the Racing Post Trophy. After failing in the 2000 Guineas on his only run of 2016 he was retired from racing. Background Marcel is a dark bay colt with a white sock on his left hind leg, bred by David Hyland at the Oghill House Stud in County Kildare. He is from the fifth crop of foals sired by Lawman who won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Prix Jean Prat in 2006. His other progeny have included Most Improved and Just The Judge (Irish 1000 Guineas and E. P. Taylor Stakes). His dam Mauresmo was unraced daughter of Absaar, a half-sister to At Talaq. Marcel was offered for sale as a foal at Goffs in November 2003 and was bought for €50,000 by the bloodstock agent Mick Flanagan. In October 2014 the yearling returned to the sales ring at Tattersalls and was sold for 26,000 guineas to Troy Steve Bloodstock. The colt entered the ownership of Paul Hancock and was sent into training with Peter Chapple-Hyam at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= Marcel made his first appearance in a seven furlong maiden race at Ascot Racecourse on 11 July in which he started a 16/1 outsider and finished fifth behind Ray's The Bar. The colt reappeared on 31 August in a similar event at Newcastle Racecourse and started the 7/4 joint-favourite against seven opponents. Ridden by James Doyle he took the lead approaching the final furlong and went clear of the field to win by three and three quarter lengths. For his third and final start as a juvenile, Marcel was stepped up sharply in class for the Racing Post Trophy over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse on 24 October. The Royal Lodge Stakes winner Foundation started favourite whilst Marcel was the 33/1 outsider in the seven runner field. The other runners included Deauville (Tyros Stakes), Johannes Vermeer (Juvenile Turf Stakes) and the highly regarded maiden winner Mengli Khan. After being restrained by Andrea Atzeni in the early stages, Marcel made rapid progress and overtook Deauville to take the lead a furlong and a half from the finish. He stayed on well in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths from Johannes Vermeer with Foundation two and a half lengths back in third place. After the race Chapple-Hyam commented \\"I thought we would be placed but I didn't really see us beating John Gosden's horse (Foundation). He is a big horse and he has taken time to come together. His work had been really good coming into the race\\". =2016: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Marcel contested the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley mile at Newmarket on 30 April. After encouraging reports of his training performances he started the 8/1 third favourite but after being in contention for most of the way he faded badly in the final quarter mile and finished last of the thirteen runners behind Galileo Gold. He never raced again and was retired from racing at the end of the year.

Braille Special educational centre for blind children () is a specialized educational institution located at Krasinski street 10 in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Location The centre seats in a 19th-century old brick building, in downtown district, between Krasinski, May 3rd and Mikołaj Rej streets. History =Prussian period= The first Department for Blind Children initially opened in Wolsztyn on July 6, 1853. It has been created on the initiative of a local pharmacist and philanthropist named Józef Knechtel. In 1865, his institution passed under the direct administration of the Province of Posen government. In 1865, a commission proposed the Parliament of Prussia the construction in Bydgoszcz of an establishment able to receive forty blind children of both sexes, regardless of their religion. The rationale for this was the possibility of sponsoring the institution to-be with the local teachers Seminar which opened in Bromberg in 1820 and moved to Bernardyńska Street N°6 in 1825. The proposal was adopted by the Parliament on October 2, 1868. The magistrate of Bydgoszcz donated a 2.13 acres plot for the construction of the institution and the Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Poznan allocated funded 28000 crowns between 1864 and 1870 to fund the construction. The same year, a first class moved from Wolsztyn to Bydgoszcz. The first director of Bydgoszcz specialized school was Mr Kienel, an experienced educator who had been working for 20 years in Wolsztyn. The first 24 pupils arrived on May 4, 1872. In the early 20th century, a majority of the students were Polish children. From the start, the center quickly became a mainstay of life for blind people following the Prussian annexation. Pupils came most from areas Pomerania, Greater Poland and Silesia. After a six years curriculum in the elementary school, students could obtain qualifications as organist, craftsman, or tuner for musical instruments. In 1886, the first organist was qualified, in 1902, the first artisan and in 1906 the first masseuse (a pioneering area for such a school). During the time when Anton Wittig was director (since 1882), an hostel for blind was founded where pupils were employed: it still stands at Kołłątaj street N°9. From 1906 to 1909 new buildings were added: two wings on the sides and an extension in the backyard that allowed the creation of new classrooms, workshop areas and an apartment for the director. In addition, the auditorium was renovated, the building connected to city networks (water, gas, heating, telephone), and an elevator set in the kitchen. =Interwar period= Polish authorities took over the place on April 1, 1920. The facility received the name National Institute for the Blind, then to Provincial Department for the Blind (January 16, 1928), and eventually to Pomeranian Department for Blind - Communal Association in Bydgoszcz () on April 1, 1938. The first director of the new Polish institution was Bronisław Hausner, followed in 1926 by Józef Mencel which served till September 1939. After 1921, the school welcomed children from the northern and western regions of the country. The number of pupils varied, from: 30 boys and 29 girls in 1920-1921 to 77 boys and 46 girls in 1929-1930. In addition to the 7-year elementary school cycle, children were taught the professional skils (weaving, knitting, piano tuning), and the smartest ones were educated as musicians, mainly organists. In 1930, in the establishment was created Poland's first school department for visually impaired children. =World War II years= After the occupation of Bydgoszcz by the Nazi armed forces during World War II, the Institute was closed. On October 26, 1939, the building housed a school for the deaf. The expansion of the war to the East, forced the authorities to liquidate it. From 1943, German citizens from Hamburg lived in the premises, as a result of the bombing of the city by the allies. At the end of the war, the edifice housed a German military hospital. =Post war period= Early after the war, the place housed several different municipal and governmental institutions. In July 1947, however, the department of Education took over the building to dedicate it to the Centre of Educational Training for Authorities (). Eventually, thanks to the lobbying efforts of Wladyslaw Winnicki to drawing attention to the need for training blind people, the building returned to its original function. Re-opening took place on October 16, 1948. It was named Educational Institution for Blind Children in Bydgoszcz and had a primary school, a secondary public vocational school and a dormitory. In 1949, it was taken for management by the Board of Bydgoszcz School District and nationalized. In 1967, it changed its name to Education Centre in Bydgoszcz (). In the school year 1972-73, the number of pupils climbed up to 183, with 77 staff personnel. In 1972, for the 10th anniversary of the establishment in Bydgoszcz, it has been the name of Louis Braille, founder of Braille handwriting. George Kuberski, the Polish Minister for Education a bust and a plaque celebrating this christening. The same year, the Vocational Secondary School opened. In 1977, new professions curriculums were created such as locksmith workshop or mechanical machining. In 1982, the institution was renamed Louis Braille Special Education Centre, one among seven others of this kind in Poland, and welcomed 164 pupils. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the institution provided apprenticeships and jobs for graduates in identified firms like cooperatives in Bydgoszcz and Gdańsk and Regional Transport Company. The school also had a variety of cooperation with companies: ZNTK, Romet, BKBD, Befana and others. =Current data= Since 2009, the center chairs the association Visus Supremus which goal is to lead diagnostic and support for education and rehabilitation of blind and visually impaired. In 2015, the center included the following curriculum: * Early support development for a small child (WWRD); * primary school; * junior high school; * secondary school; * Technical massage; * Basic vocational school (electromechanics, mechanics machinery, cooking and support for hotel staff operations); * School job training; * Post-secondary school (technicians and administrative technicians); * Qualifying vocational courses for adults (gastronomy administration); * Country's first branch for deaf and blind children; The majority of high school graduates take further education at colleges and post-secondary schools. From January 19, 1999, the establishment is associated with the UNESCO, as a specialized institution. Architecture The main building has a \\"E\\" shape, with small wings supported at the corners by prominent buttresses. Avant-corps are topped with triangular gables and adorned with plastered panels. Brick facades are divided by broad timber- framing structures. In 2015, renovation works inside the building near the entry gate unveiled a 19th-century frieze. The central building has two floors: the second and part of the first welcomes children dormitory. Offices are located on the first floor: doctor's, nurse's and ophthalmologist's, working areas (experience, historical study, auditorium), and the division for deafblind children. The ground floor houses classrooms, canteen, director's and deputy director's offices, head of the dormitory, therapist, psychologist, school counselor, teachers' room and school secretariat. In the close vicinity, a workshop pavilion and a junior high school have been built in the 1974-1975. On September 3, 2012, a new three-storey educational pavilion, housing 26 teaching rooms and studio workshop has opened, the day of the 140th anniversary of the institution. Outside are two playgrounds for children, pupils and students. Near the facility stands a gym hall, that has been renovated in 2015.

Early life and army career  Charles Henderson Tidbury was born in Camberley, Surrey,\\"Sir Charles Tidbury\\", Times (London), 22 July 2003 on 26 January 1926, the son of Brigadier O. H. Tidbury, MC, and his wife Beryl, née Pearce.\\"Tidbury, Sir Charles (Henderson)\\", Who Was Who (online edition), Oxford University Press, April 2014. Retrieved 30 April 2016. Following schooling at Eton College, he joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1944 and served in Palestine from 1946 to 1948. When he returned from Palestine, he learnt Russian at London University and trained to be an interpreter, working thereafter in GCHQ and Germany, before leaving the Army in 1952. He signed up to the Territorial Army once he left active service, and stayed with the Queen's Westminsters until 1960.  Brewing  In 1950, Tidbury married Anne, daughter of Brigadier H. E. Russell, DSO; she was the niece of Colonel Bill Whitbread, who was the long-serving Chairman of Whitbread & Co. Ltd, the brewers. After being discharged from active service, Tidbury started work for the firm; he trained at their Mackeson brewery in Hythe, Kent, before training in rotation at the company's Head Office in London. The following year, he informally became an assistant director and was formally appointed to the position in 1957. In 1959, he was appointed managing director, a role in which he served until his promotion to chief executive officer in 1974. Three years later, he became the company's Deputy chairman and between 1978 and 1984 he was its chairman, remaining on the board until 1988. He also served as director of Whitbread Investment Co. Plc (1975–93) and Gales Brewery in Horndean (1989–96). By the 1960s, some larger competitors were beginning to take over and amalgamate with smaller breweries; at first, Whitbread's had provided capital exchanges as part of an \\"umbrella\\" to protect smaller brewers from takeovers, and in 1966 Tidbury was appointed Chairman of one such firm, Brickwoods Brewery Ltd., a post he held until 1971. But many of these smaller breweries would eventually be taken over by Whitbread's over the course of the 1960s as competition intensified. This left Whitbread one of the \\"Big Six\\" brewing companies in the country, but also prompted a rationalisation of the business structure. As the Times summarised, Tidbury's work at the top-tier of this re-organisation \\"helped to steer Whitbread through a difficult period for both the company and the industry as a whole\\". Despite beer and spirit sales decreasing during his Chairmanship, Whitbread increased its sales of soft-drinks, introduced more efficient means of production, formed links with Heineken and supermarkets, bought up hotels and developed the Beefeater gastropub chain. This new management plan saw overall sales increase, but meant 1,800 jobs were cut and several breweries closed, decisions which, according to the Times, were not easy for Tidbury, who as \\"a member of the old school [who] always adhered to rather paternalistic principles of loyalty ... [he] knew his pubs and his people.\\" Tidbury was also involved in his industry's professional associations. He served as President of the Institute of Brewing from 1976 to 1978, and Chairman of the Brewer's Society between 1982 and 1984, after which he was its Vice-President. He was Master of the Brewer's Company in 1988. Other positions included President of the British Institute of Innkeeping (1985–92) and President of the Brewing Research Foundation International from 1993 (having previously been its chairman since 1985).  Later life  Away from brewing, Tidbury was a Conservative supporter and donor; between 1988 and 1993, he was a Director of the Centre for Policy Studies. In 1986, he was asked by Geoffrey Howe to be Chairman of the William and Mary Tercentenary Trust, which would raise money and organise celebrations to mark the 300th anniversary of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. This made him a potential target for the Irish Republican Army, and his name was found on an IRA list of targets in 1988. Two years later, two intruders found in his home were charged with conspiracy to murder him, although they escaped prison before their trial.\\"Sir Charles Tidbury\\", The Daily Telegraph (London), 10 July 2003, p. 27 Tidbury also held directorships on Barclays, ICL Europe, Mercantile Group, Nabisco Group, Pearl Assurance and Vaux Group. On a local level, he was a Governor of Portsmouth University from 1988 to 1996 and chaired the Governing Body at Portsmouth High School from 1992 to 1996, during which time he also served on the Portsmouth and South East Hampshire Health Committee. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Hampshire in 1989, the same year he received a knighthood. He took a keen interest in sailing and maritime history, and was a Trustee of the National Maritime Museum. Tidbury died on 3 July 2003.

The ovate shell is smooth and ventricose. The spire is formed of six slightly convex whorls. The body whorl is very large and slightly canaliculated. The coloring is of a deep violet and oftentimes of a yellowish ash color, with a small white band which borders the base of each whorl of the spire. There exists also at the base of the shell, a large band of a grayish white color. Upon some specimens longitudinal whitish lines are seen, which are the vestiges of the several additions to the shell. The aperture is large and ovular. The columella is strongly arched, and upon all its length is seen a callosity of a yellowish color. The outer lip is of a reddish brown internally. This shell is very different from other species in its form, which is globular, and its color, of a deep violet. In some specimens the spire is more elongated, and sometimes, within the shell, where it is of a paler violet, are delineated deeper bands.

She is an active researcher into acoustic emission and her work has been applied to damage assessment inspections on industrial components. Biography Holford read mechanical engineering at Cardiff University with sponsorship from Rolls-Royce and was the first member of her family to attend a higher education institution. This came after her school art teacher encouraged her to pursue the course, even though her careers advisor had discouraged her from studying engineering, which was perceived as a predominately male area. She later returned to Rolls-Royce where she was persuaded to complete a PhD course. During her time at Rolls-Royce Holford contributed to the construction of the Adour and Pegasus engines with help from engineers across Europe and the United States and development work in advanced engineering. After completing the course Holford was employed at local company AB Electronic Products as a senior engineer.

Holford has published over 160 research papers and over 80 peer-reviewed journals. She has led research projects totaling over £7.5 million funded from a wide variety of sources, including EPSRC, Innovate UK, KTP, EU and industry. Her primary research is damage assessment inspections using acoustic emission (AE) applied across several industrial applications, including bridges, aerospace landing gear and composite materials, concrete and metals. Holford and her team later focussed on the improvement of AE damage location techniques, energy harvesting and embedded sensors aimed at the development of autonomous structural health monitoring systems. She also served as the faculty advisor for Cardiff University's Formula Student team and is currently a member of the EPSRC Strategic Advisory Network, an UpRising ambassador and a Director of the Compound Semiconductor Centre. Outside of academia Holford entered the first rounds of the 2004 Formula Woman Championship behind the wheel of a Caterham 7. =Awards= Holford's work has earned her several awards.

She graduated from the University of Georgia in Athens, GA, in 2002 with dual degrees in journalism and political science.

In 2006, she became a freelance photographer so she could work on personal projects.

In 2015 El-Tantawy self-published her first book, In the Shadow of the Pyramids. Partly supported by Burn magazine and a crowdfunding campaign, it is centered on the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Creative Review described it as \\"close-up photographs of protestors and street scenes of fervent crowds in Cairo during the January revolution in Tahrir Square, are mixed in with local witness accounts, alongside old family photographs from her childhood growing up between Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the US. Shot between 2005-2014, the series is a heady combination of documentary photography, portraits, and more dynamic, abstract images, jarring with the retro, candid shapshots.\\" Gerry Badger, selecting the book for the Best Photobook prize at Fotobookfestival in Kassel (which it won), wrote \\"Her highly impressionistic style is in the best tradition of Japanese protest books, and captures he confusion of the event extremely well – where people where having picnics in the middle of the square while others were dying in the surrounding streets. At first glance, her brightly coloured, semi abstract images seem too ‘aesthetic’, but when you really get into and study the sequence, journeying from hope and exultation to near despair, the toughness of her vision becomes apparent, and the whole is brought together with excellent production values and a beautiful, yet not overinsistent design. For this book she was shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize in 2015, along with Erik Kessels, Trevor Paglen, and Tobias Zielony. Her \\"I'll Die for You\\" series deals with suicide among rural Indian farmers. El-Tantawy's website says her photography is \\"inspired by questions on her identity - exploring social and environmental issues pertaining to her background.\\" She has also said her inspiration \\"primarily comes from music, poetry and impressionistic painters – my photographic influences tend to be poetic and painterly like, such as the work of Gueorgui Pinkhassov, Miguel Rio Branco and Saul Leiter.\\" Publications =Publications by El-Tantawy= *In the Shadow of the Pyramids.

Active between about 9-8 million years ago, it was formerly a stratovolcano or a multi vent volcano. Eventually, erosion removed most of the volcano and exposed the underlying structure including subvolcanic intrusions. The remnants of the volcano are the sites of mining operations.  Geography and structure  Farallon Negro is located in the Argentine Catamarca province, in the Sierra de Belén and north of the Pipanaco basin. It may be the largest volcanic field in the Argentine foreland. Nearby towns are Andalgala approximately south of the Agua Rica deposit, Belen approximately southwest of the volcano and Tucuman approximately northeast. The local climate is arid and temperatures range . It is located between the tectonic region of the Sierras Pampeanas and the Puna. Volcanic activity in this region east of the principal volcanic arc is of unknown origin and was widespread in the past. Said volcanism took place between 12 and 5 mya ago. Farallon Negro probably is a stratovolcano which has been degraded by erosion, resulting in the exposure of intrusive bodies. Before the erosion, the volcano may have been over high and covering a surface area of . Another theory suggests that Farallon Negro was a multi-vent complex. The basement altitude is about . These include the Agua Rica and Bajo de la Alumbrera porphyry centres and the Agua Tapada and Bajo el Durazno intrusion. Most of the volcanic products of Farallon Negro are lava flows and breccia. The volcanic vent for most of the Farallon Negro products appears to be in the general area of Alto de la Blenda, suggesting that it is the location of the vent. Volcanic units at Durazno are somewhat different from those in the main complex. Lava domes are sometimes surrounded by ash and block flows. Intrusive volcanics form much of the exposed complex. In Bayo de la Alumbrera, a dacite complex is embedded within pyroclastic rocks and trachyandesites. Bayo de la Alumbrera was originally buried beneath a high volcanic pile. Around the Alto de la Blenda monzonite a number of stocks ( wide) and dikes originate, which indicates it may be a remnant of the conduit. In some stocks magma mixing appears to have occurred during formation; in Alto de la Alumbrera first felsic and at the end mafic rocks were formed. Several dykes and stocks were injected into andesite during the formation of Bajo de la Alumbrera. Many of these stocks have suffered hydrothermal alteration extending into surrounding rocks shortly after their formation including propylitic alteration, but the later stocks show no evidence of alteration. This pattern probably occurred because strong volcanic activity during the earliest intrusions did leak away fluids before they could trigger alteration. When volcanic activity dropped, trapped fluids could then initiate hydrothermal alteration. This probably coincided with a change in the local stress regime that reduced volcanic activity. Faults and fractures have influenced the alteration. In Bajo de la Alumbrera, this alteration has given place to magnetite and anhydrite inclusions which indicated the rocks were highly oxidized. Phyllic (pyrite-quartz-sericite) and potassic (biotite- orthoclase) alteration is noticeable in satellite images of Bajo de la Alumbrera. Agua Rica, another exposed deposit, is cut by the Quebradas Mina valley. It is subdivided in the Seca and Trampeadero porphyries. Two diatremes are also found, one of which is named El Espanto. Rock chemistry and isotope analysis suggests that at first the Farallon Negro system was not underpinned by a magma chamber. Starting in 8.5 mya then a heterogeneous magma chamber was probably established, with an increasing content of felsic rocks at its roof. A minimum volume of is required to explain the formation of the Alumbrera deposit. This magma chamber probably had a heterogeneous composition.  Geology  Subduction of the Nazca plate between 28° and 33° southern latitude flattened starting 18 million years ago, causing arc volcanism to propagate to the Sierras Pampeanas. Subduction of a segment of the Juan Fernandez Ridge may have triggered this shallowing. 10 million years ago, volcanism ceased in the main Andean chain in this segment, probably because the mantle wedge was thinned by the flattening of the subduction. North and south of this segment subduction is steeper and volcanism persists to the present day. Farallon Negro is located in the border zone between the flat subduction zone and the zone of steeper subduction farther north that has generated the Central Volcanic Zone. A number of volcanoes in this transitional zone are found on northwest trending lineaments; this includes Cerro Negro de Chorillos, Farallon Negro, Galan and Cerro Tuzgle. The Tucuman fault zone is located in the area. = Local = The basement in the Farallon Negro area of the Sierras Pampeanas are schists and gneisses of deep water origin with an intruded batholith of Ordovician-Silurian age. This plutonic activity coincided with the collision of South America with eastern North America during that time. The Sierras Pampeanas are formed by several chains of mountains of Proterozoic-Paleozoic age with valleys separating them. During the Pliocene- Pleistocene separate basement blocks were upfolded. These geological patterns are similar to the Laramide orogeny in North America and may be a general pattern of mountain building over flat subduction. During the Miocene, red beds were deposited in the area forming the El Morterito Formation that reaches a thickness of . This formation was probably formed in episodic events such as flash floods. Rocks of the Paleozoic basement beneath Farallon Negro contain amphibolite, mica schist, phyllite and quartzite. Farallon Negro itself is found between the Sierra de Aconquija in the east and the Sierra de Quilmes in the north. Both of these are Paleozoic basement blocks with Farallon Negro found in a depression between these. The formation of this depression may have occurred after the deposition of red bed sediments, seeing as they form thin layers while the Farallon Negro volcanics are over . The volcanites were erupted through a crystalline basement including batholits and metasedimentary rock. = Geologic record = Farallon Negro is extensively eroded, almost down to its Paleozoic basement. Erosion took place between the Miocene and the Pliocene considering that volcanic rocks are buried beneath Pliocene conglomerates. = Composition = Basaltic andesite and andesite constitute the bulk of Farallon Negro volcanisms. Dacites and basalt also occur. The Bajo de la Alumbrera porphyry deposit is found in shoshonite. They are heterogeneous in composition, with several phases dominated by hornblende, plagioclase and pyroxene. Magnetite and biotite are also present. Generally, early rocks are mafic and the late ones intermediate or silicic. Magma mixing may have played a role in the formation of the rocks; specifically andesites formed from the mixing of basaltic-lamprophyric melts with dacitic-rhyolitic ones within andesitic rocks. Overall composition is potassium-rich calc- alkaline. Isotope compositions are typical for a mature volcanic arc. The total quantity of produced magma is about . The bottom of the volcanic pile forms breccias that were presumably emplaced by flood-like flows. Sedimentary rocks, dykes and lava flows are also found. In the upper layers, lava flows and lava domes are found. Again there are also sedimentary rocks. Some deposits may be debris flow deposits, phreatomagmatic deposits are also found. Alteration products have been analyzed at Bajo de la Alumbrera. Gold- containing pyrite and chalcopyrite, bornite and enargite are the main gold containing minerals. Hydrothermal orthoclase and quartz as well as hydrothermal assemblages of anhydrite, biotite and magnetite are also found. An earlier argyllic (clay) cap over the deposit was eroded away. Alto de la Blenda has shown the presence of chalcopyrite, galena, pyrite, sphalerite, tennantite-tetrahedrite. Agua Rica displays covellite, enargite, galena, marcasite, molybdenite, pyrite, sphalerite, sulfur and tetrahedrite, formed first as a porphyry that was subsequently modified by hydrothermal piping. Some mineralization was directed by fluids which exhaled from the magma chamber into surrounding rocks after a period of volcanic rest. Inclusions in rocks demonstrate that these fluids included brine and sulfide-rich fluids. These sulfide containing brines and fluids extracted much of the gold and copper from the bulk rocks, causing them to be poorer in Au and Cu than the melts. These fluids probably had temperatures of over and formed under rocks about thick.  Eruptive history  The oldest age reported is 9.4±0.3 mya for a lava flow in Bayo el Durazno, but undateable units stratigraphically older than this flow are present. Until 8.05±0.37 mya activity in the central cone occurred, between 8.0±0.2 and 7.27±0.35 mya Cerro Durazno was active. Of the intrusions, the Tampa Tampa andesites between Alto de la Blenda and Bajo el Durazno formed first at 9.0±0.2 mya. Bajo el Durazno formed a porphyry at 8.39±0.18 mya. The Las Casitas rhyolite and the Chilca andesite porphyry have comparable ages of 8.0±0.12 and 8.0±0.11 mya. The Alto de la Blenda stock was formed 7.55±0.3 mya. Agua Tapada was formed 7.35±0.16 mya. Las Pampitas was emplaced 7.22±0.28 mya. Bajo de San Lukas was emplaced 7.1 mya. 6.98±0.08–6.78±0.15 the Bajo de la Alumbrera intrusion was formed. 6.18±0.05 and 6.04±0.07 mya the Loma Morada and Macho Muerto rocks were emplaced. The Quebrada de los Leones rhyolites are the youngest intrusions but aren't dated isotopically. Evidence indicates that in the beginning the Farallon Negro volcano grew rapidly, at least in the northwest sector and then growth petered out. Towards the end of activity around 7.3 mya a caldera collapse may have occurred. Composition of the eruptive products changed over the lifespan of the system. The main volcanism (9.2–6.8 mya) was andesitic-dacitic. During the intrusive phase (8.0–6.2 mya) magma was initially basaltic andesite and later rhyolite.  Mining  A mine of copper and gold is found within Bajo de la Alumbrera, opened in July 1997. It is estimated that it will be one of the ten largest copper mines in the world in full production, and one of the largest gold mines in South America. Some copper mining began already in 1970s but a major open pit mine was opened in February 1998. Two mines are also operated in Alto de la Alumbrera, the Farallon Negro mine opened in 1978 and Alto de la Alumbrera opened in 1986. It is estimated that Bajo de la Alumbrera contains of copper. The mineralization may have originated in mafic magmas. The formation process of these deposits is insofar different from that of other Andean porphyry deposits as it was formed by several hydrothermal systems that were separated only by a few million years, while e.g. the copper porphyry El Salvador formed during episodic magmatic activity.

This is the most ratified international human rights treaty in history which established the widely supported view that children and young persons have the same basic general human rights as adults and also specific rights that recognize their special needs. A further two additional protocols were adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 May 2000 covering the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. In ISIL's rise in the recent years, they have committed various violations of the (CRC) and its protocols, which have been signed and ratified by Iraq and Syria. ISIL not a party to Conventions ISIL has been accepted as a sufficiently organized non-State armed group to be considered as a party to the non-international armed conflicts in Iraq and the Syrian Arab RepublicReport of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, 2013, para.66 and the situations in both countries amount to armed conflicts of a non-international character.Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Iraq in the light of abuses committed by the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and associated groups International humanitarian law is applicable to armed conflicts of a non-international character thus applicable to both Iraq and the Syrian Republic. All parties to the conflict which include ISIL are thus bound by common article 3 of Geneva Conventions. This establishes the minimum standards relating to the treatment and protection of civilians, those no longer actively participating in the hostilities and civilian objects. ISIL currently controls large areas of territory in which millions of individuals live and it has declared itself a “State” which runs both a civil and a military administration including the establishment of a “court” system. Having these in place, the threshold for ISIL to be bound by human rights obligations has clearly been met and so, at the very least, ISIL is bound under international law to respect core human rights obligations, such as the right to life, the absolute prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, the prohibition of slavery and the prohibition of enforced disappearance, as well as the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.President of the Security Council on the situation in Iraq , p. 2, and Security Council resolution 2170 (2014), para. 3 Furthermore, Iraq and The Syrian Arab Republic are parties to major human rights treaties and various optional protocols. It has been established that in situations of armed conflict, international human rights law continues to apply and both international human rights law and international humanitarian law frameworks will act together in a mutually reinforcing way.Report of the independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic , annex 2 Violations = Children's right to life = The right to life is a fundamental inherent right of all children, established in Article 6 of the CRC. The constant attacks by ISIL in Iraq and Syria violate this fundamental right by causing the deaths of hundreds of children.United Nations Security Council: Report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in Iraq, 2015, pg 6 In Iraq, the United Nations reported that killing and maiming continue to be the violations that most affect children. Since 2014, there has been a significant increase in violence which resulted in a conservative estimation of 1,256 children killed and 1,831 children injured as a result of the conflict-related violence from 1 January 2014 to the end of April 2015. In 2014 to 2015, the counter-ISIL operations had intensified resulting in significant increase in documented child casualties due to the clashes between parties to the conflict. Of these documented attacks, it has been alleged that more than half are results of attacks using tactics of extreme violence by ISIL. Also reported was the systematic killing of children belonging religious and ethinic minorities by ISIL, including numerous cases of mass execution of boys.Committee on the Rights of the Child: Concluding observations on the combined second to fourth periodic reports of Iraq, pg 5 In Syria, the United Nations has limited capacity to verify information in the areas under the control of ISIL. There have been reports regarding the execution of children in Hasakah, Raqqah and Dayr Az-Zawr.Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic An estimated one-fifth of child casualties are caused by vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks by ISIL. In April 2014, 69 children were killed and injured in a double improvised explosive device attack in a government-controlled neighbourhood of Homs.General Assembly Security Council: Children and armed Conflict, 69 session, 2015, p 32 Children and armed conflict The violent attacks by ISIL have been in violation of the international Human Rights and Humanitarian laws. = Recruitment and use of children in armed conflict = This act is prohibited under various international treaties and conventions such as Article 77.2 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, Article 4.3.c of Protocol II, additional to the Geneva Conventions and International Labour Organisation's Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention. In summary, they condemn and prohibit the recruitment of children under the age of 18. In 2014 alone, it was verified by the United Nations at least 67 cases of boys being recruited by ISIL and these numbers are not likely to reflect the actual scope of child recruitment.Security Council: Report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in Iraq, 2015, pg 9 From August 2014 to 2015, it has been reported that hundreds of boys were forcibly taken from their homes in NInawa and sent to training centers, where boys as young as the age of 8 received weapons training and combat tactics. In addition, in early February 2015, ISIL imposed compulsory recruitment of children in the Rutba district.Security Council: Report of the Secretary- General on children and armed conflict in Iraq, 2015, pg 11 In Syria, there have been reports of significant increase in the recruitment of young boys. Furthermore, ISIL has reportedly established 3 training camps in Raqqa and have imprisoned hundreds of boys as young as 10 at Aleppo forcing on to them indoctrinated seminars with promised rewards of salaries, a martyr's place in paradise and \\"gift\\" of wife upon joining ISIL.General Assembly Security Council: Children and armed conflict, 69 session, 2015, p. 33 These violations by ISIL are war crimes and in breach of fundamental human rights they are required to uphold. = Slavery and sexual violence = This act is prohibited by international human rights law in instruments such as the CRC, art 34, 37 and 39 and Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. Article 1 provides that \\"States Parties shall prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography as provided for by the present Protocol.\\"http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/crc-sale.pdf The rise of ISIL has led to an increase in reported violations of sexual violence committed against children, particularly girls. These violations are likely to be under reported due to security and access constraints by the United Nations and fear of repercussions by the girls. In one of the reported cases, on 6 August 2014, In Sinjar district over 400 Yezidi women and girls were abducted by ISIL and sent to two ISIL controlled areas, Ghabat al-Mosul and Tal Afar (Ninawa) where they were later forced into sexual slavery. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights later verified \\"clear patterns of sexual violence against Yezidi women and girls, including rape and sexual slavery committed by ISIL in clear violation of international human rights law. In Syria, similar to Iraq, it is difficult to obtain reliable data on the conflict-related sexual violence in ISIL controlled domains as well as fear of stigma and reprisals by the victims. The abducted women and girls, in the attacks on Sinjar on August 2014, were reported to have been taken to Syrian Arab Republic and \\"sold\\" in the markets accoss Raqqa to be used as sex slaves.Report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council, 2015 p. 19 = The freedom of thought, conscience and religion = Children have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion which are core human rights, established in several international conventions such as articles 13 - 17 of the CRC. ISIL has used education as a tool for indoctrination for the purposes of creating a new generation of supporters. In Raqqah, children are gathered to watch screenings of videos showing mass executions of Government soldiers.Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, 2014, p. 10 Its purpose is to desensitize them to extreme violence. On May 2014, there was an abduction of 153 Kurdish boys, aged between 14 –16 years by ISIL. They imprisoned them in the a school in Aleppo and screened videos of beheading and attacks and forced them it a daily instruction on militant ideology for a 5-month period. Those who disagreed were punished with severe beatings.Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, 2014, p. 11 The corroboration of the testimonies collected report that ISIL intends to subjugate children under their control and dominate every aspect of their lives through terror, indoctrination, and provision of services to those who will conform. Their use of surveillance, coercion, fear and punishment are used to prevent any form of disagreement.Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, 2014, p. 13 Accountability =Who enforces= Accountability for all serious or gross violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law is essential to ensure justice, provide redress to the victims and prevent future infringements.Security Council Adopts Resolution 2170 (2014) Condemning Gross, Widespread Abuse of Human Rights by Extremist Groups in Iraq, Syria[violations.http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11520.doc.htm] The Governments of Iraq and Syrian Arab Republic have the responsibility to protect the individuals under their jurisdiction and ensuring justice and accountability in acts of grave crimes. Domestic courts in Iraq and Syrian Arab Republic have jurisdiction over all violations committed within their territories whether by nationals or foreigners.Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, 2015, p. 11 However, as there have been concerns regarding the judicial systems in both Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic,Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, 2015 the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the involvement of the International Criminal Court. Its main purpose for intervention would be to investigate and prosecute the crimes allegedly committed by ISIL. As neither Iraq nor the Syrian Arab Republic are parties to the Rome Statute, the Court has no territorial jurisdiction over the crimes committed in their territory. In the Special Rapporteur report in 2015,Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, 2015, p.11 the Special Rapporteur called on the Governments of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic to become parties without delay to the Rome Statute and to accept the jurisdiction of the Court over the current situation under article 12 (3).

This set includes the Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (also termed epoxide hydrolase 1, EPHX1, mEH, and EH1); the epoxide hydrolase 2 (also termed soluble epoxide hydrolase, EPHX2, sEH and EH2); and the far less well defined enzymatically, epoxide hydrolase 4 (also termed ABHD7 and EH4). All four enzyme contain an Alpha/beta hydrolase fold suggesting that they have Hydrolysis activity. EH1, EH2, and EH3 have been shown to have such activity in that they add water to epoxides of unsaturated fatty acids to form vicinal cis (see cis-trans isomerism) products; the activity of EH4 has not been reported. The former three EH's differ in subcellular location, tissue expression patterns, substrate preferences, and thereby functions. These functions include limiting the biologically actions of certain fatty acid epoxides, increasing the toxicity of other fatty acid epoxides, and contributing to the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. History EH3 was first named ABHD9 owing to its possession of a particular Protein domain, the Alpha/beta hydrolase fold or α/β hydrolase fold domain. This domain is found in more than 30 other human hydrolytic enzymes including the four epoxide hydrolases. The gene for EH3 (EPHX3) was discovered on chromosome locus 19p13.13 in sequencing the human.genome Based on its amino acid sequence, it was projected to encode a protein with an α/β hydrolase fold domain; the encoded protein was therefore dubbed ABHD9. Some 10 years later, ABHD9 was defined to possess the ability to hydrolyze certain fatty acid epoxides. Expression Similar to mEH but unlike sEH, EH3 is membrane-bound enzyme. Based on the expression of its mRNA in mouse tissue, EH3 has a very different distribution than mEH or sEH: EH3 expression is high in skin, lung, tongue, esophagus, and stomach; intermediate in pancreas and eye, visceral fat, lymph nodes, spleen, aortic arch, and heart; low in liver, kidney, testis, ovary intestine, and brain; and very low in skeletal muscle. Its expression in human tissues has not yet been reported. Activity and function ABHD9 first drew attention is studies that validated that its gene, EPHX3, was hypermethylated on CpG sites in its Promoter (genetics) in human prostate cancer tissues, particularly in the tissues of more advanced or, base on morphological criteria (i.e. Gleason score), more aggressive diseases. This allows that the gene silencing of EPHX3 due to promoter hypermethylation may contribute to the onset and/or progression of prostate cancer. Similar CpG site hypermethylations in the promoter of EPHX3 have been validated for colorectal adenocarcinomas. As similar promoter methylation pattern, although not yet validated, was also found in human malignant melanoma tissues and human gastric cancer cell lines. These studies allow but certainly do not prove that the silencing of EPHX (i.e. failure to be expressed as ABHD9 protein) is involved in the development and/or progression of certain cancers in humans. More recently, ABHD9 was characterized as possessing epoxy hydrolase activity for metabolizing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and epoxides of linoleic acid (i.e. vernolic acids [also termed leukotoxins] to their corresponding diols. For example, it metabolizes one particular EET (14,15-epoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z-eicosatrienoic acid) as follows: 14,15-epoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z-eicosatrienoic acid + H2O → 14,15-dihydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z-eicosatrienoic acid In this particular reaction, the enzyme inactivates the EET and thereby may function to limit the biological activity of this as well as the other EETs upon which it acts in, for example, regulating blood pressure (see epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. In its hydrolysis one isomer of vernolic acid (12S,13R-epoxy-cis-9-octadecenoic acid) 12S,13R-epoxy-cis-9-octadecenoic acid + H2O → 12S,13R-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acids to a diol, however, the enzyme increases its toxicity in, for example, contributing to acute respiratory distress syndromes (see vernolic acid). The enzyme thereby may function to limit the cell signaling activity of the EETs yet contribute to the toxic actions of linoleic acid epoxides. While mEH and to a lesser extent sEH metabolize drugs, foreign toxic chemicals, and certain endogenous compounds that are not simple fatty acids (see Microsomal epoxide hydrolase and epoxide hydrolase 2), the activity of EH3 on such substrates, while likely, has not yet been reported.

The illuminated miniatures, work of Taddeo Crivelli and others, were executed between 1455 and 1461. The work is held in the Biblioteca Estense di Modena (Ms. Lat. 422-423.)  History  The Bible of Borso d'Este is one of the most notable illuminated manuscripts of the Renaissance. It was executed over a six-year period by a team of artists directed by Taddeo Crivelli and Franco dei Russi. It was taken from Ferrara to Modena in 1598, where it remained until the end of the duchy in 1859. Then it was taken together with the most precious treasures of the royal house by Francesco V. Carried out of Italy, it was recovered during the First World War when it was acquired by a senator, Giovanni Treccani. It was then donated to the Modena library.  Description and style  Every page of the Bible is decorated with an elegant frame of scrolls and other ornaments, surrounding two columns of texts. The margins contain various scenes, especially in the lower parts, where one often finds scenes drawn in perspective, borrowing from advances in painting of the time. Scenes are also depicted between the columns of text, usually next to the capital or illuminated letters. In the volutes in the corners, there are often animals, depicted with lively imagination that is part of the courtly style of the time, and often tied to heraldic symbols of Borso and his family.

The Voortrekkers, led by Piet Retief, migrated into Natal in 1837 and negotiated a land treaty in February 1838 with Dingane. Upon realizing the ramifications of the imposed contract, Dingane betrayed the Voortrekkers, killing the delegation including Retief on 6 February 1838. The land treaty was later found in Retief's possession. It gave the Voortrekkers the land between the Tugela River and Port St. Johns. This event eventually led to the Battle of Blood River and the eventual defeat of Dingane. Massacre Despite warnings, Retief left the upper Tugela region, 28 January 1838, in the belief that he could negotiate with Dingane for permanent boundaries for the Natal settlement. He eventually met Dingane in Mgungundlovu. He had gotten the impression that Dingane was willing to negotiate but only if Retief returned cattle to him that was stolen by the Batlokwa chief named Sekonyela. Retief eventually was able to find the cattle and brought back a portion of the herd to Dingane. The deed of cession of the Tugela-Umzimvubu region, although dated 4 February 1838 and written by Jan Gerritze Bantjes, (Retief's secretary), was signed by Dingane on 6 February 1838, with the two sides recording three witnesses each. Dingane invited Retief's party to witness a special performance by his soldiers, whereupon Dingane leaped to his feet and ordered his soldiers to capture Retief's party and their colored servants. Retief, his son, men, and servants, about 100 people in all were taken to a nearby hillside, Kwa-Matiwane below the Hlomo Amabuto, which means, \\"mustering of the soldiers\\".Wood, William (1840). \\"An Eyewitness Account of the Massacre of Retief\\". Statements respecting Dingaan, king of the Zulus. Collard & Co. Retrieved 2008-01-04. The Zulus killed the entire party by clubbing them and killed Retief last so as to witness the deaths of his comrades. Their bodies were left on the Kwa-Matiwane hillside to be eaten by vultures and scavengers,Kotzé, D. J. (1950). Letters of the American Missionaries, 1835–1838. Cape Town: Van Riebeeck Society. p. 235. as was Dingane's custom with his enemies. Motives The attack is thought to have been premeditated, and it was unlikely that Dingane was going to concede the land through treaty in the first place since he believed that the land was divinely inherited, despite the agreement. As for the rationale behind his attack, there is no single reason, but a multitude of reasons. One of the most popular reasons given by historians is that Dingane felt threatened because he had gotten news that Voortrekkers that had recently ousted Mzilikazi from the Transvaal region through conquest. The fact that Retief had sent Dingane letters alluding to the expulsion of Mzilikazi which could easily be interpreted as a veiled threat did not help Dingane as seeing the Voortrekkers as being genuine. It is likely that he saw Retief and the settlers with him coming into the land as an invasion. He feared that he could possibly share the same fate if he did not take a pre-emptive strike against the Voortrekkers. There was also reports that the Voortrekkers were encircling around the settlement of Mgungundlovu, which was interpreted as being a reconnaissance. Another reason given is that Dingane's sending Retief and his band out to retrieve the stolen cattle was actually a strategic move to see whether or not Retief could be trusted. According to Dingane's intelligence officers, he did not give back all the cattle that he had gotten from Sekonyela. A reason cited by a few scholars is that is Dingane was also promised horses and guns, along with the return of his cattle. When Retief returned to give Dingane his cattle, he did not give him any guns or horses. Regardless of which event influenced Dingane to take this action, it is very clear that he grew to distrust the Voortrekkers and the other settlers. Aftermath A Voortrekker encampment resisting a surprise attack by an impi of Dingane, as depicted by Charles Bell After the Retief massacre, Dingane directed attacks against several unsuspecting Voortrekker encampments including the one at Bloukrans.Wood, William (1840). \\"An Eyewitness Account of the Massacre of Retief\\". Statements respecting Dingaan, king of the Zulus. Collard & Co. Retrieved 2008-01-04. This plunged the Great Trek into temporary disarray. In total 534 men, women and children were killed in the Weenen massacre. Retief's death and the Weenen massacre eventually led to the decisive Voortrekker victory at Blood River, after which Andries Pretorius and his \\"victory commando\\" recovered the remains of the Retief party. They buried them on 21 December 1838. The twenty-one year old Jan Gerritze Bantjes (1817-1887), Retief's former secretary and now Pretorious' secretary, recorded the battle and the entire December campaign in the \\"Bantjes Journal\\". Recovered was the undamaged deed, \\"The Cession of Natal\\" from Retief's leather pouch, also written by Bantjes, and later verified by a member of the \\"victory commando\\", E.F. Potgieter. Two exact copies of the deed survive, (either of which could be the original) but legend states the original disappeared in transit to the Netherlands during the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902). The site of the Retief grave was more or less forgotten until pointed out in 1896 by J.H. Hattingh, a surviving member of Pretorius's commando. A monument recording the names of the members of Retief's delegation was erected near the grave in 1922.Stander, Eerw. P.P. Dingaanstat: Die Graf van Piet Retief en Sy Sewentig Burgers.

Some of the buildings on the farm date back from the 18th century. In 2004 the then owners were awarded the Norwegian Heritage sign of quality, Olavsrosa, for outreach activities and sustainable use of Norwegian heritage.Norsk Kulturarv's (Norwegian Heritage's) information on Nordre Ekre (in Norwegian) Nordre Ekre has been an agritourism farm since 1995, in the early years based mainly on self-catering. Today the farmland is leased to neighbouring farmers, and the tourist offering has been expanded with a restaurant. The guest rooms have also been upgraded, but with the emphasis on retaining the original style, with exposed log walls and the original soapstone fireplaces. Nordre Ekre farm hotel and restaurant is one of five farms that form the partnership «Gardshotell i Gudbrandsdalen/Farm hotels in Gudbrandsdalen». Nordre Ekre has been designated as «Travellers' choice» four years in a row (2013–2016) by the travel website TripAdvisor.Nordre Ekre on the TripAdvisor list 2016  The farm name  The first part of the name, «Nordre», is Norwegian for Northernmost or Northern. The oldest documented use of the main name, «Ekre», in the dative case and in the spelling of the period, is from 1333 when Sigurd, Hafthor Thoressön's vassal, wrote «Ek var a Eckru» (I was at Ekra).Diplomatarium Norvegicum The name suggests that the farm originally was an arable piece of land, that had been separated from another farm.Teigum (2001), p. 141 Oluf Rygh provided this etymology in Norske Gaardnavne (Norwegian Farm names) from 1897: «Ekra f., to field with grass, derived from Ager, derived from akr.» Rygh listed several documented forms of the name, e.g. «Ekren» in 1520, and «Ecre» in 1578.About the name «Ekre» in Rygh, Oluf (1897) Norske Gaardnavne. Digitized version, 1999  History  Søre Ekre glimpsed between Aurbua to the left and Eldhuset (the bakehouse) at Nordre Ekre The green room Nordre Ekre has roots dating back to the Iron Age.Teigum (2001) pp. 141–146 At that time there was only one Ekre-farm. In the 14th century this farm was a meeting place for things (assemblies) and court proceedings. The Ekre farm has been divided several times. The first documented division was in the early 1600s.Engen (2012) The farm later was divided into NordreProperty unit number 1 and Søre (=southern) Ekre.Property unit number 3 At the time they were located next to one another, where Søre Ekre is still located. In 1851 Nordre Ekre was again divided into two farms, Nordre and Midtre (=middle) Ekre.Property unit number 6 It was after this division that the current yard at Nordre Ekre was established. There are currently no buildings on the Midtre Ekre farm. The land under this farm was placed under Søre Ekre in 1926. There were dairy cows at Nordre Ekre up until 1987, and hay and forestry until 1995, but since then tourism has formed the production basis for the farm. Both land and hunting rights are leased. Nordre Ekre farm hotel and restaurant are owned by a married couple. The wife is the eighth generation of owners in her family. The couple are both trained chefs, and since they took over the farm in 2005, they have upgraded the guest rooms and expanded the tourist offering with a gourmet restaurant in the former barn.Steen, Lars Kr. «Eventyrlig julebord til fjells».

In: Aftenposten, temanr., 12.09.07, s. 6  The oldest buildings  Site plan 2012 Nordre Ekre from the south-west, ca. 2005 The farm seen from the south-west, early 1900s When the current yard was established, after the division in 1851, it was partly with buildings from the former location, partly with new buildings and partly with buildings that were moved from elsewhere. Photographs from the early 1900s show more buildings than those which currently stand on the farm.They also show that Nørdre stu (=The northern house) has had a storey added since then Here were stables, a piggery and several other outbuildings, but the buildings were not so clearly defined in an inner and outer yard, as they are on som of the other Heidal farms. According to Norske gardsbrukNorske gardsbruk is a multipart national register of Norwegian farmsteads (=norske gardsbruk) the farm is thought at one time to have comprised 17 buildings, including the mountain farm (summer pasture) and cabins.Granum & Næss (red.)(1998) Norske gardsbruk, vol. 7. Noresund: Granum. (in Norwegian) As farming changed over the years, more buildings were demolished and relocated. The stables were, for example, taken down and re-erected as a cottage, and the former barn was part of a larger cattle shed and barn, which has now been partly converted into guest rooms, as well as banqueting facilities and a farm museum. The other six buildings from before the twentieth century today, form a not completely closed «firkanttun» (=square yard). The house lived in by the last generation farmers, is from 1976, and is pulled slightly back from the yard. The buildings at Nordre Ekre are not listed or preserved, but the farm is part of the important cultural building environment and cultural landscape in Heidal, with and architectural finish, buildings and location in the terrain typical of the buildings in the valley from the 17th century onwards.Cultural landscapes of great value, from miljøstatus.no (Norwegian) All the buildings around the yard are log houses from before 1900, and all, except for «Aurbua», are registered by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage, in SEFRAK, a national register of old buildings and other national heritage sites and objects. The buildings are dated «1700s» in SEFRAK. The dating, and the fact that no buildings remain on the former site, now Midtre Ekre, makes it likely that most of the buildings were moved to Nordre Ekre with the farm division in 1851. * Søre stu Søre is dialect for søndre=southern or southernmost. Stu is dialect for stue, which in this context means farmhouse. The name, or description, of the building therefore is The southern(-most) farmhouse. The building is said to have been moved here from Lom, but there is no contemporary documentation for this. In the 1953 edition of Norske gardsbruk the actual move is dated to 1848, while the register in the 1998 edition cites 1860 as the year the building was moved to Nordre Ekre. The latter fits most closely with the facts, since the yard was established in 1851. The house was extended in width around 1942, and in length in 1995. The building is the residence of the current owners. Until the spring of 2013 it also housed the restaurant. * Nørdre stu Nørdre stu=Northern farmhouse. This was the original farmhouse on the farm. After the erection of Søre stu, Nødre stu was used as a house for the retired farmer, until around 1960. At the time the building was moved here from its previous location, it only had one storey. The second storey was added in 1940, and the sod roof was also replaced with flat, hewn slate tiles. The building now contains four en suite guest rooms. * Aurbua Aur=gravel, bua=the store room. This was the farm's cold storage. The building originally stood where today's kitchen in Søre stu is located. It was moved to the current location when Søre stu was expanded in 1995. The building is currently used as a farm shop. Aurbua is not mentioned specifically in the SEFRAK register. * Eldhuset Eld=fire, huset=the house. This building is the farm's bakehouse, and has a wood fired traditional flat top baking oven and chimney, although its location, right among the other farm buildings, makes it unlikely that it was meant to be used as a bakehouse when it was moved to this location. Today the building is used for baking traditional flatbrød and lefse for – and on – special occasions, such as during the annual event «Gardmillom». * Stabburet The storehouse. As with the other buildings, the date of the storehouse is uncertain. It is dated to the 1800s in the SEFRAK register and to the 1700s in vol. 2 of Gards- og slektshistorie for Heidal (=Farmstead and family history in Heidal). It was moved to the current location from the old yard. Today it is furnished to provide guest accommodation on both the ground and first floors. * Kårfolkets stabbur The retired generation's storehouse. This building was also moved from the original Ekre yard. It has now been converted into a library lounge on the ground floor, and houses an en suite guest room on the first floor. This building is believed to be the oldest building on the farm. It may have been built as early as the 17th century.Valebrokk (2003) * Steinfjøset Stein=stone, fjøset=the cowshed. This is the oldest part of the barn, dated to the 18th century in SEFRAK, while vol. 2 of Gards- og slektshistorie for Heidal cites 1870 as the year of construction. The barn was rebuilt in 1961 and expanded in 1980. In 2012/2013 it was completely renovated and converted into the farm's restaurant as it is today, as well as providing an additional guest room. The restaurant in the barn was opened in 2013, after having been located in Søre stu for some years. File:Nordre Ekre 11.JPG«Søre stu» File:Nordre Ekre 10.JPGThe two «stabbur».

It is located on the west side of the Sjoa river, at the foot of the mountain Heidalsmuen. The buildings here were set up in the late 19th century. Today the place is no longer in use as a summer pasture, but is rented out for shorter or longer periods.

Raised by Utpala's minister Sura, Anantivarman ascended the throne of Kashmir on 855 CE, establishing the Utpala dynasty and ending the rule of the Karkotas. Avantivarman appointed Suyya, an engineer and architect as his prime minister. The country had been badly affected due to the numerous civil wars over the last forty years and Avantivarman's reign restored the economy. Suyya carried out desilting of the Jhelum river and diverted its course. Arts and architecture Avantivarman was a patron of the arts and the most notable scholar of his time was Anandhavardana, the author of the Dhvanyaloka. He founded the cities of Avantipur and Suyapur, which was named after Suyya. He built many Hindu temples dedicated to both Vishnu and Shiva as well as Buddhist monasteries. Notable among the temples were the temples of Avantiswara and Avantiswami dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu respectively in Avantipur.

It continued operating up to 1960. The island is part of Waconia Township just off the shore from the city of Waconia. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 for its local significance in the themes of commerce and entertainment/recreation. The island site, with its ruins of hotels, cottages, and parks, was nominated for being one of Minnesota's most popular early resorts, and an early expression of the trend of urban dwellers journeying to Minnesota's lakes and parks for recreation. Lambert Naegele (an immigrant from Germany who published German language newspapers), Reinhold Zeglin (also an immigrant from Germany), and Emile Amblard (originally from France) developed resort buildings and attractions on the island. The best preserved building from this era, however, is the Emile Amblard Guest House on the mainland. History The island has received human visitors for over 1,500 years. It is located in a region that was the first home to the Dakota people. Euro-American settlers colonized the area in the mid-19th century, with settlers going to the island during the Dakota War of 1862 in fear of battles in Carver County. The island was sought as a refuge because of its clear distant views, but the war resolved before reaching the county. The St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad purchased the land in 1866. They sold it to private buyers in 1874. The buyers eventually sold the island to Lambert Naegele in March 1884 for $5,200. While Waconia already had several hotels such as the North Star, Lake House, and the Sherman House, the Coney Island Hotel and its resort became the most popular of all of Waconia's hotels and contributed to the town's status as a favorite summer resort. Lambert Naegele developed the island and named it \\"Coney Island of the West\\". The origin of this name is unclear. Some claim it is named after the Coney Island entertainment center on the East Coast. Others think that it comes from the large numbers of \\"coneys\\", or rabbits that lived on the island. Finally, one group claims \\"Coney\\" is just a shortened version of \\"Waconia\\". There is not enough evidence to definitively support one of these claims over the others, however. As part of his initial development, Lambert Naegele divided the island into lots, parks, and streets. He named the streets for famous German authors, such as Goethe, Uhland, Schiller, and Lessing. He sold plots to private owners. Naegele also built a large hotel and private cabins, for either rent or sale. In 1886 a new hotel later known as the boarding house or dormitory, several more cottages, and a boathouse were added. Naegele suffered poor health, forcing a move to better climates in Montana. In 1889 Naegele sold the hotel complex to Reinhold Zeglin, whose family had taken possession of it at the end of the summer season in August 1888. Zeglin, a German immigrant like Naegele, made plans for a third hotel, designed to sleep one to two hundred guests. With this added space, numbers of hotel guests began to rise. Part of the draw was Zeglin's addition of a bowling alley and Sunday concerts to amuse his guests. He also built a laundry, dining room, kitchen, and pavilion as part of his new hotel. In 1895 Zeglin rented Coney Island Hotel and resort to Emil Krueger of Stillwater, Minnesota, but he returned to run it again in 1896. The resort's reputation was growing. Guests came to stay for periods of weeks or months, with many remaining all summer. Some, like Emile Amblard, the \\"Duke of Clearwater Lake\\", stayed permanently. Amblard, a French winemaker and businessman, came to visit and loved the island and town so well that he never left. Guests came from nearby Minneapolis–Saint Paul and elsewhere in Minnesota. Others came from New York, Ohio, and Illinois, or as far away as Europe and South Africa. There were even some famous guests. The guest register from June 20, 1896 shows movie star Sarah Bernhardt staying at the hotel. Between 1903 and 1905, the University of Minnesota Gophers held pre-season practices on the island's football field. Zeglin's sons took over the resort in 1909. However business was beginning to slow by 1919 due to outside factors. The car allowed people to travel farther with more ease than trains. With this new flexibility, vacationers chose to spend summers in other states rather than locally. In 1927 the name was changed from Coney to Paradise Island, to encourage more guest visits. The name would not last. The Zeglin family sold the resort in 1939 to Frank Dvorak. Frank \\"Shorty\\" Dvorak bought land on the island in 1939, soon adding a dance hall, a restaurant, and more cabins. The island became a weekend dinner and dancing spot, rather than a resort. Dvorak sold the complex to the Day Camp Company in 1959. The island deteriorated due to lack of proper maintenance, and their contract defaulted back to Dvorak in 1960. He was the last owner who operated the island as a place for entertainment. Since 1960, the island has had many private owners. Vandalism and time took their toll on the island. In 1975 efforts were started to rehabilitate it, led by the Waconia Bicentennial Committee's Island Committee. In 1976, Coney Island of the West was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Beginning in 2016, the island was placed under development by Carver County to be open to the public as part of Lake Waconia Regional Park. A master plan for the island's development was approved in December 2016. The approved master plan for the island includes trails, camping, a garden, beaches, picnic areas, and a boat ramp.

The brewery had been taken over by his great-great-grandfather, Henry Boddington, in 1853 and remained in the family.Sharratt, Tom (17 October 1989), \\"Sell-off strains brewer's resolve\\", The Guardian In 1971, sales of Boddingtons's ales increased by 5.2%, nearly double the national average.\\"Chairmen's Reports\\", Times (London), 17 March 1971, p. 21 Beer sales continued to rise and in 1974 they were marked by a \\"significant increase\\" on the previous year and the percentages were higher than the national average.\\"Boddington going well\\", Times (London), 16 November 1974, p. 21 In 1977, Boddingtons increased its beer sales by 24%, despite national beer sales stagnating.Clark, Michael (11 November 1977), \\"Boddingtons wants a penny on a pint as it strives to brew enough ale\\", Times (London), p. 22 This occurred at a time when lager sales continued to grow and absorb a larger market share. Boddington himself had said that he thought people visiting his pubs wanted ales, rather than lager, and the company would continue to develop its traditional beers.Hirst, Nicholas (23 March 1977), \\"Boddingtons' flout lager trend but keep house flag on high.\\" Times (London), p. 24 It also planned to increase ale prices by 1p, while a development programme which included the creation of a new laboratory on its Strangeways site, was due to be completed in 1978. In 1981, the company made a 19.8% increase on pre-tax profits, but Boddington announced that prices would have to increase due to rising costs.\\"Price rise warning from Boddingtons' chairman\\", Times (London) 18 September 1981, p. 22 In 1982, Boddingtons took over Oldham Brewery at a cost of £23 million, but still made a pre-tax profit and bucked the national trend of decreasing beer sales.\\"Oldham aids brewer's results\\", The Guardian, 18 September 1982, p. 19.

The company had grown despite stagnant beer sales owing to high unemployment; instead growth in the retail, catering and managed homes operations added to the profit margin.\\"Company Briefing: Some cheer for brewer\\", The Guardian, 20 March 1985 In 1985, Boddingtons took over Higson's, a Liverpool-based lager brewer with 160 pubs in the Merseyside area, for £27 million; the combined annual sales would amount to £65 million. The Guardian reported that \\"The deal will give Boddingtons the presence it wants in the lager market, helped by Higsons' new [£6 million] lager brewery in Liverpool.\\" Boddington said it offers \\"the chance to develop sales of own-produced lager and to position itself for the future in this growing and higher margin sector of the beer market\\".Brasier, Mary (29 May 1985), \\"Higsons agrees Boddingtons' takeover terms\\", The Guardian This enlarged share of the lager market contributed to a rise in profits which saw the company's shares increased by 3p in September 1985; the amount of beer sold continued to fall, but lager sales increased by 10% over the previous six months.May, Tony (21 September 1985), \\"Company Briefing: Brewer keeps analysts happy\\", The Guardian In October 1987, Midsummer Leisure, a rapidly growing company owning fun pubs, disco halls and snooker halls, offered a share swap; the terms valued each Boddington share at 228p (a sharp rise on 61p, which they were valued at prior to the offer) and the whole business at £270 million.Gibbs, Geoffrey (13 October 1987), \\"Now Boddington faces 'bid' move\\", The Guardian The offer was dropped, however, after Whitbread and Britannic Assurance, Boddington shareholders with a combined 34% of the stock, rejected the offer.Rodgers, Peter (16 October 1987), \\"Midsummer drops Boddington offer\\", The Guardian The following January, it was announced that 200 jobs would be cut and the Oldham Brewery, which Boddingtons had acquired in 1982, would be closed as part of an \\"efficiency drive\\"; directors blamed the poor state of the beer market, and Boddington himself said: \\"The industry is, at best, static and it is very competitive\\".Gibbs, Geoffrey (9 January 1988), \\"Brewer plans to shed 200 jobs\\", The Guardian That March, end of year profits were found to be up less than 1%, blamed in part on rationalisation costs and a \\"sluggish\\" regional economy.

It is the busiest rail junction in the United States. It serves trains on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line and Port Washington Branch, which diverge at the junction. Reconstruction work on Harold Interlocking started in 2009, as part of the East Side Access project to bring LIRR service to Grand Central Terminal. As part of the project, two tunnels for Northeast Corridor trains bypassing Harold Interlocking are being built to address congestion problems and occasional accidents. Location and operation The junction is located in Queens, New York, east of the East River Tunnels and next to Amtrak's and NJ Transit Rail Operations' Sunnyside Yard. During the rush hour period, over 40 trains per hour pass through the interlocking; and a total of 783 trains each weekday. In addition to Amtrak trains, the interlocking serves the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), whose Main Line and Port Washington Branch diverge from the Northeast Corridor at Harold Interlocking. View from a nearby overpass Entering the Harold Interlocking on the LIRR from the east The complexity of the junction and the large volume of traffic has caused frequent delays and occasional accidents in this portion of the Northeast Corridor. History The Pennsylvania Railroad built the Harold Interlocking in 1908 as part of the New York Tunnel Extension project, which built Pennsylvania Station, the North River Tunnels (under the Hudson River), the East River Tunnels and Sunnyside Yard. The interlocking was renovated in summer 1990 during a nine-week modernization project. This renovation was conducted several months after a power surge caused trains to be stuck in the interlocking. Since the 1990s, Harold Interlocking has been controlled from a tower at Penn Station. =East Side Access improvements= The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) began construction of several infrastructure improvements to the junction area in 2009, but a major project to redesign and rebuild the interlocking required additional funding. In May 2011, a $294.7 million federal grant was awarded to address congestion at the interlocking. The work will allow for a grade-separated route between the East River Tunnels and the Hell Gate Bridge for Amtrak trains traveling to or from New England, thus avoiding LIRR traffic. Northeast Corridor trains from the Hell Gate Bridge and New England would be able to avoid the junction entirely, while trains to the Hell Gate Bridge and New England would be able to bypass a major section of the junction. As part of the project, Amtrak's car-washing facility within Sunnyside Yard, as well as several small Amtrak buildings, are being relocated. The MTA is constructing and managing the improvement project as part of the adjacent East Side Access project to bring the LIRR to Grand Central Terminal. , the MTA estimated that East Side Access would be substantially complete in 2022. , two of three East Side Access tunnel portals had been built at Harold Interlocking, and only the centermost portal remained to be built. Work on the Northeast Corridor bypass started in 2013. However, by October 2015, the tunnels were behind schedule because Amtrak and the MTA could not cooperate on track access schedules. These delays ultimately raised construction costs by almost $1 billion as of April 2018, and in a report that month, the MTA attributed the delays to a lack of cooperation on Amtrak's part. The work at Harold Interlocking also included the installation of a microprocessor-based interlocking logic, replacing the old relay-based one.

Her performance career with the two institutions spanned the 1870s and 1880s, before she retired in 1890. Potter's impersonations, while preceded by the likes of Fanny Kemble and Mary Scott-Siddons, serves as direct inspiration for actors such as Hal Holbrook and Emlyn Williams. Potter is most well known for her impersonations \\"of well-known actors and lecturers, giving extracts from their principal plays or lectures\\". famously of Susan B. Anthony, John B. Gough, and Abraham Lincoln. Potter was noted for her talent of being able to accurately impersonate both men and women, and for the theatrical nature of her impersonations when compared to the less flavorful performances which generally permeated the Lyceum and the Chautauqua circuits.  Career  Potter began her platform career as a reader, until, under the advisement of James Redpath, she began to do impersonations. In 1873, Potter studied at the Normal Art Training School in Boston. While there, Redpath called on her to recite for him. Years later, an account of the conversation was published in Talent after Potter had become famous. > \\"'No one wants readings or recitations,' [said Redpath] \\"but if some one > could give what I call 'ten lectures in one,'--that is, take a ten-minute > extract from the text of ten of our best lectures and give it one evening-- > it would make a hit.

He played college football at Southern Utah. College career Killebrew reached the triple- digit mark in tackles each of his last two seasons (101 in 2014, 132 in 2015) and also showed an ability to handle pass coverage responsibilities with three interceptions (one returned for a touchdown in 2014) and seven pass breakups in 2015. The four-year starter earned All-Big Sky recognition in each season: honorable mention in 2012 and 2013, second team in 2014, and first team in 2015. Professional career =Pre-draft= NFL analysts had projected Killebrew to be drafted in the third or fourth rounds. Most teams and scouts were impressed by his size, tackling form, and physical play. The only downsides to him were his lack of instincts, minimal coverage range, and lack of anticipation in run direction. With a large frame for a safety and the popularity of hybrid linebackers in the NFL, a lot of analysts expected him to also play a nickel linebacker role in the NFL. Killebrew played in the Reese's Senior Bowl and was also invited to the NFL combine. Between the Senior Bowl and the combine, it was reported he met with multiple teams, including the Cincinnati Bengals, Dallas Cowboys, San Diego Chargers, New York Jets, Detroit Lions, and the Indianapolis Colts' head coach Chuck Pagano. On March 30, 2016, he attended Southern Utah's first ever Pro Day and performed the 40-yard dash (4.51), 20-yard dash (2.63), and 10-yard dash (1.58), improving his numbers from the combine on all three. Over twenty scouts and representatives from NFL teams showed up to evaluate Killebrew and ten other prospects at SUU's Pro Day =Detroit Lions= Washington Redskins The Detroit Lions selected Killebrew in the fourth round (111th overall) in the 2016 NFL Draft. After he had appeared in the senior bowl, the Detroit Lions' safeties coach, Alan Williams, and other representatives from the organization had a meeting with Killebrew and told him that they were not interested in him, he wasn't a right fit for the team, and that they did not want him at all. Once they drafted him, they told him that they had said it to only see how he would respond. 2016 season On May 6, 2016, it was reported that the Detroit Lions had signed Killebrew to a four-year, $2.34 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $578,564. He began his rookie season as the Lions' third strong safety on the depth chart behind veterans Tavon Wilson and Rafael Bush. In the first 11 games, Killebrew mainly saw time on special teams and saw a few snaps as a rotational safety on defense. On November 20, 2016, Killebrew led the Lions with five tackles, while only playing 12 defensive snaps, all on third down, during the Detroit Lions 26-19 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Four days later, he made four tackles on third down, while only appearing on nine of the Lions' defensive snaps during their 16-13 victory over the Minnesota Vikings on Thanksgiving.

Personal life Killebrew was raised by his parents, Lisa and David Killebrew, in Henderson, Nevada. Killebrew and his family are Indianapolis Colts fans, as they lived in Indiana for a few years. He also cites his role models in football as Troy Polamalu, Earl Thomas, and Bob Sanders. On April 30, 2016, Killebrew graduated from Southern Utah University with a degree in engineering. He received the phone call from the Detroit Lions telling him they'd drafted him on the way to his graduation ceremony. In June 2016, a Detroit-based brewery named Fort Street Brewery created Killebrew IPA, a play on words using his last name.

In 2014, Mitchell played in 8 games, making only 3 starts and caught 31 passes for 248 yards; he won the team's Comeback Player of the Year award. In 2015, as a redshirt senior, Mitchell started all 13 games and was named an offensive captain. Mitchell caught 58 receptions for 865 yards (14.9 average). On September 19, against South Carolina, he recorded 122 receiving yards and a touchdown. In the final game of his collegiate career, in the TaxSlayer Bowl against Penn State, he recorded 114 receiving yards and a touchdown. Off the field, Mitchell earned the David Jacobs Award, given annually to the player who best portrays courage, spirit, character and determination; the Haier Achievement Award, the SEC Community Service Team, and the 2016 Community Spirit Award. When he graduated, he ranked third in school history with 174 receptions for 2,350 yards and 16 touchdowns.  Professional career  =2016= Mitchell was selected by the New England Patriots in the fourth round (112th overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was the 11th wide receiver selected. On May 5, 2016, the New England Patriots signed him to a four-year, $2.91 million rookie contract that included a signing bonus of $577,992. Head coach Bill Belichick named Mitchell the starting wide receiver, alongside veteran Julian Edelman. Mitchell made his professional regular season debut and first career start in the New England Patriots' season-opener against the Arizona Cardinals and caught two passes for 33 yards from Jimmy Garoppolo. On November 20, 2016, Mitchell caught his first career touchdown reception from Tom Brady, a 56-yard score in a victory over the San Francisco 49ers. He finished the game with four catches for 98 yards, and one touchdown. A week later, at the New York Jets, Mitchell had his first two- touchdown game, catching five passes for 42 yards and two touchdowns. On December 4, 2016, Mitchell caught a season-high eight passes for 82 yards in a 26–10 victory over the Los Angeles Rams. Mitchell finished his rookie season with 32 receptions for 401 yards and four touchdowns in 14 games and six starts. On February 5, 2017, Mitchell was part of the Patriots team that won Super Bowl LI. In the game, he caught six passes for 70 yards as the Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34–28 in overtime. He caught all five targets from Brady in the pivotal fourth quarter, and converted four of those five receptions into first downs. =2017= On September 7, 2017, Mitchell was placed on injured reserve due to a knee injury. With Mitchell not playing the whole season, the Patriots reached Super Bowl LII, but lost 41-33 to the Philadelphia Eagles. =2018= Throughout the offseason, Mitchell had been dealing with issues with his knee, and underwent a knee procedure in July. On August 6, 2018, Mitchell was waived by the Patriots. On March 23, 2019, Mitchell announced his retirement, citing knee issues.  Writing career  Mitchell was not a strong reader when he began college, then reading only at a middle school level, but grew to love reading; even joining a women's reading club and promoting literacy among youth. He is more proud of his reading accomplishments than of making it to the Super Bowl. In 2016, Mitchell released his first book, The Magician's Hat. This children's picture book features David, the Magician, who loves to perform magic. David knows the magical power of books, which can explore dreams and develop creativity.

Her works have been featured in notable group exhibitions, including the 54th Venice Biennale (2011) and Colombo Art Biennale (2012). She was also the commissioner for the Bangladesh Pavilion at the 54th Venice Biennale (2011). Early life and education Lipi was born in Gaibandha. The relationship with her choice of materials dates back to her childhood. As Lipi is the eleventh of the twelve children, she was often present when her nieces and nephews were brought into the world. Later on, the stainless steel razor blade used by the midwives becomes a significant role in her works. She has used this medium to regenerate everyday objects, including bathtubs, baby perambulators, and handbags. In 1993, she obtained her Master of Fine Arts in Drawing and Painting from the University of Dhaka.  Career  Lipi has exhibited at Alliance Française (1998 and 2004) and Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts in Dhaka (2007). In 2002, Lipi co-founded Britto Arts Trust with her partner, artist Mahbubur Rahman. It is the first artist-run nonprofit organization in Bangladesh, which focuses on experimental and dynamic art. Her works were largely influenced by 11 September attacks in New York in 2001. She encountered racial discrimination in the trip to Europe with her husband, in which they were treated as Bangladeshi Muslims. \\"People felt that they had to stick to only one identity\\", Lipi said.

Pearson is considered the most influential figure in the history of audiophile journalism. Pearson is famous for his philosophy of judging the sound of an audio component on how closely it approximates the \\"absolute sound\\", which he defined as \\"the sound of actual acoustic instruments playing in a real space.\\"  Early years  Harry Hall Pearson, Jr. was born on January 5, 1937, in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina to Harry Pearson (Sr.) and his wife Joyce (née Welborn). Pearson lived in North Wilkesboro until his parents' divorce in 1947. After the divorce, Harry and his younger sister moved to Charlotte, N.C., to live with their mother. After completing high school in Charlotte, Harry attended Duke University. After graduating from Duke University, Harry became a newspaper reporter and columnist, writing for several prominent publications in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. In Arkansas, Pearson was an environmental investigative reporter for the Pine Bluff Commercial where he wrote a series of articles that were influential in the campaign to save the Buffalo National River. Harry left the Pine Bluff Commercial when he was recruited by Bill Moyers to become the environmental writer for Newsday in New York.  The Absolute Sound  While working at Newsday, Harry started an underground magazine for audiophiles from his Victorian home in Sea Cliff, N.Y. The first issue of The Absolute Sound appeared in the spring of 1973 with Pearson acting as editor-in-chief and publisher. Under Pearson, TAS was published every other month from 1973 until the 1990s. Pearson decided to name his magazine after the philosophy behind the idea of an \\"absolute sound\\", which he defined as the \\"sound of actual acoustic instruments playing in a real space.\\" In his reviews, Pearson established the principle that a subjective audio review is not a matter of taste, but that the \\"absolute sound\\" should be the standard in evaluating the qualities of components or recordings. In the early years, TAS accepted no advertising from manufacturers. In reaction to the prevailing mode of audio reviewing at the time, Pearson and TAS reviewed audio equipment based on how it sounded and not relying on measurements. This subjective style of audio reviewing was similar to that of J. Gordon Holt, the founder of the audiophile magazine Stereophile. Pearson has often stated that Holt served as the inspiration for him becoming an audio reviewer and starting TAS. Along with Holt, Pearson developed a new language to describe what he was hearing and thus influenced a generation of audiophiles and manufacturers in their pursuit of better sound. According to The New York Times, Pearson \\"laid the foundations of a philosophy and vocabulary that helped give rise to a worldwide subculture of high-end audiophiles... He wrote about recorded music with the conviction and nuance that food critics brought to haute cuisine.\\" During the rise of digital and the CD, Pearson and TAS remained highly critical of the digital sound technologies. In a 1992 article in The New York Times, Edward Rothstein characterized Pearson as an \\"unofficial spokesman for an impassioned rear guard, a group of music lovers of extreme views, an organization of Luddite fanatics... I am one of them.\\" Beginning with TAS Issue #4, Pearson began printing a list of his reference recordings that he dubbed the Super Disc List. He continued to publish the list annually with updates and new additions. The Super Disc List was revered by his readers and has been credited with driving up the market prices for certain LPs that continually appeared on the list, such as RCA Shaded Dog pressings and the original pressing of the soundtrack to the 1967 film Casino Royale. Titles from his Super Disc List are continually being reissued by audiophile record companies around the world. Beginning in the early 1990s TAS began to experience financial and operational troubles due to mismanagement and the magazine began to struggle to fulfill subscriptions. In 1998, TAS was purchased by Tom Martin, who moved the magazine to Austin, TX. It continues to be published in print and online today (10 issues per year). After relinquishing control of the magazine, Pearson continued to write for TAS in a column called HPsWorkshop, which he published until his departure from the magazine in 2012. On August 31, 2012, Pearson quit TAS. After leaving TAS, Pearson co-founded an online audio journal and newsletter with his protégé Joseph Weiss, called HPSoundings. HPSoundings eventually folded after two years due to Pearson's declining health.  Influence  Over the years, Pearson's influence help substantiate new audio companies in the audiophile community. A good review by Pearson could lead to success, as was the case with manufacturers, such as Nordost Corporation, VPI, Conrad-Johnson and Magnepan, all becoming successful companies that continue to operate today. Likewise, a negative review by Pearson could be harmful for a new or established company. Many of the leading audiophile reviewers of today, including Jonathan Valin (TAS), Michael Fremer (Stereophile, Analog Planet), Art Dudley (Stereophile), and Roy Gregory (The Audio Beat) began their career working under Pearson. According to reviewer Roy Gregory, Pearson's \\"real importance was as a reviewer who defined what a reviewer was, and his legacy lies in the hands of the reviewing community.\\"  Death  On November 4, 2014, Pearson died in his home in Sea Cliff, New York. At the time of his death, Pearson was in frail health following a series of heart and circulatory ailments.

He initially committed to Auburn University, then broke the commitment and committed to Florida State University. He broke that commitment as well, and finally agreed to play for Auburn. Louis \\"was not nearly as productive\\" in college as in high school. Although he often started games, he was never a full-time starter. His most memorable play was a touchdown reception against the Georgia Bulldogs in 2013, known as the \\"Prayer at Jordan-Hare\\".

Louis ended his career at Auburn in 2015 with 98 receptions out of 117 touches for and eight touchdowns. Louis' collegiate career was also plagued by dropped passes, and he had six fumbles.

The Chicago Board of Health was organized in 1835 in response to the threat of a cholera epidemic, and later outbreaks of cholera in 1852 and 1854 killed thousands. In 1863, Ellis S.

It was blown up in 1680 by Ferdinand II of Fürstenberg, Bishop of Münster.  History  = Castle = There are two theories on the construction of the castle. One states that it was built in the early 12th century by the Bishop of Münster; the other that it was constructed during the 14th century by the Count of Tecklenburg. On 25 October 1400, the Count of Tecklenburg had to give up Bevergern Castle and parts of his county to the Bishop of Münster. In the ensuing period it changed hands several times. From December 1535 to January 1536, the Anabaptist, Jan van Leiden, was imprisoned at the castle. He was later executed and his body suspended in a basket on St. Lambert's Church. Other Anabaptists were supposed to have been incarcerated at the castle and hanged in the gallows field between Bevergern and Rodde. = Thirty Years' War = Mosaic of the old Bevergern Castle on the wall of St. Antonius' Primary School in Bevergern As a result of the Thirty Years' War, the castle went through a more turbulent time. From 1634 to 1652 the castle was possessed by the House of Orange, who wanted thereby to establish their claim to the County of Tecklenburg. In 1637 Bevergern returned briefly into the ownership of the Bishop of Münster. With the end of the war and Peace of Westphalia by Osnabrück and Münster, the castle and village were promised to Münster again. In spite of this decision, the castle continued to be occupied. On 28 August 1652 seven soldiers of the Bishop of Münster captured the castle through a ruse.Friedrich Ernst Hunsche, Sagen und Geschichten aus dem Tecklenburger Land, Ibbenbürener Vereinsdr., 2005. The Provost of Rheine and his people were camouflaged in hunting dress in the vicinity of the castle, where their allies overcame the guards on the castle. The castle contingent were sent away with their weapons to Lingen. On 15 February 1659 the Bishop of Münster paid the Prince of Orange 120,000 thalers to give up the castle and Bevergern. In the period 6 to 15 March 1680 the castle was blown up by Bishop Ferdinand II out of concerns that the Dutch could reoccupy it from Lingen. The stones of the castle were used for buildings in the surrounding area. In 1910 remains of the old castle were discovered again during the construction of a house. In the old town, its foundation walls have been uncovered at the surface.

Power-to-X conversion technologies allow for the decoupling of power from the electricity sector for use in other sectors (such as transport or chemicals), possibly using power that has been provided by additional investments in generation. The term is widely used in Germany and may have originated there. The X in the terminology can refer to one of the following: power-to-ammonia, power-to-chemicals, power-to-fuel, power-to-gas, power-to-hydrogen, power-to- liquid, power-to-methane, power to food, power-to-power, and power-to-syngas. Electric vehicle charging, space heating and cooling, and water heating can be shifted in time to match generation, forms of demand response that some term power-to-mobility and power-to-heat. Collectively power-to-X schemes which use surplus power fall under the heading of flexibility measures and are particularly useful in energy systems with high shares of renewable generation and/or with strong decarbonization targets. A large number of pathways and technologies are encompassed by the term. In 2016 the German government funded a €30million first-phase research project into power-to-X options.  Electricity storage concepts  Surplus electric power can be converted to other forms of energy for storage and reconversion. Direct current electrolysis (efficiency 80–85% at best) can be used to produce hydrogen which can, in turn, be converted to methane (CH4) via methanation. Another possibility is converting the hydrogen, along with CO2 to methanol.George Olah's renewable methanol plant Both these fuels can be stored and used to produce electricity again, hours to months later. Reconversion technologies include gas turbines, CCGT plant, reciprocating engines and fuel cells. Power- to-power refers to the round-trip reconversion efficiency. For hydrogen storage, the round-trip efficiency remains limited at 35–50%. Electrolysis is expensive and power-to-gas processes need substantial full-load hours (say 30%) to be economic. However, while round-trip conversion efficiency of power- to-power is lower than with batteries and electrolysis can be expensive, storage of the fuels themselves is quite inexpensive. This means that large amounts of energy can be stored for long periods of time with power-to-power, which is ideal for seasonal storage. This could be particularly useful for systems with high renewable penetration, since many areas have significant seasonal variability of solar, wind, and hydroelectric generation. Grid- dedicated battery storage is not normally considered a power-to-X concept.  Sector coupling concepts  Hydrogen and methane can also be used as downstream fuels, feed into the natural gas grid, or used to make or synthetic fuel. Alternatively they can be used as a chemical feedstock, as can ammonia (). Cartoon by Mwelwa Musonko inspired by \\"sector coupling\\" Power-to-heat involves contributing to the heat sector, either by resistance heating or via a heat pump. Resistance heaters have unity efficiency, and the corresponding coefficient of performance (COP) of heat pumps is 2–5. Back-up immersion heating of both domestic hot water and district heating offers a cheap way of using surplus renewable energy and will often displace carbon-intensive fossil fuels for the task. Large-scale heat pumps in district heating systems with thermal energy storage are an especially attractive option for power-to-heat: they offer exceptionally high efficiency for balancing excess wind and solar power, and they can be profitable investments. Power-to-mobility refers to the charging of battery electric vehicles (EV). Given the expected uptake of EVs, dedicated dispatch will be required. As vehicles are idle for most of the time, shifting the charging time can offer considerable flexibility: the charging window is a relatively long 8–12hours, whereas the charging duration is around 90minutes. The EV batteries can also be discharged to the grid to make them work as electricity storage devices, but this causes additional wear to the battery. Heat pumps with hot water storage and electric vehicles have been found to have higher potential on reduction of emissions and fossil fuel use than several other power-to-X or electricity storage schemes for using surplus wind and solar power. However, while power-to-heat and power-to- mobility through electrification (heat pumps and electric vehicles) have a high emissions reduction potential, if the goal is a 100% clean system, there are some end uses which cannot be economically electrified. These end uses include long distance shipping (trucking, airplanes, barges) and high heat industrial processes. In these cases, using fuels synthesized from clean electricity might be the best option. Biofuels are another option, but they compete with agriculture for water and space. According to the German concept of sector coupling interconnecting all the energy-using sectors will require the digitalisation and automation of numerous processes to synchronise supply and demand.

Her work has explored themes of geopolitics, immigration, and transnational identities. Raised between Tunis, Kiev, Dubai and Paris, she studied at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts and received a Ph.D. in philosophy of art from the Sorbonne. Kaabi-Linke won the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize, which commissioned Flying Carpets, a hanging cage-like sculpture that casts geometric shadows onto the floor akin to the carpets of Venetian street vendors. The piece was acquired by the New York Guggenheim in 2016 as part of their Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative. Kaabi-Linke also won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong. Her works have been collected by the Museum of Modern Art, Dallas Museum of Art, Burger Collection, and Samdani Art Foundation, and exhibited in multiple solo and group shows.  Early life and career  Nadia Kaabi-Linke was born in Tunis in 1978. She is of Ukrainian and Tunisian heritage, her father a sports academic and her mother a chemist. Kaabi-Linke was raised between Kiev and Tunis. She moved to Dubai when she was 12 when her father took a job there. Kaabi-Linke recalled the move as difficult, particularly in losing the opportunity to study modern dance. With her mother's encouragement, Kaabi-Linke began to draw. Later she studied painting at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts, graduated in 1999, and received her Ph.D. from the Sorbonne in 2008 in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. While in France, she met her German husband, Timo, who would later curate many of Kaabi-Linke's shows. Meinstein, 2014 The artist held her first solo show in Tunis in 2009, and subsequent solo shows in Berlin (2010), the Mosaic Rooms of Earl's Court (London, 2014), and the Dallas Contemporary (2015). Kaabi-Linke received the 2009 Alexandria Biennale's Jury Prize and the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize. The latter commissioned her 2011 Flying Carpets, which was shown at the 54th Venice Biennale and later purchased by and exhibited at the New York Guggenheim Museum in 2016. Kaabi-Linke held a residency at the London Delfina Foundation in 2012, where she was inspired after meeting survivors of domestic violence. She won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong, where she exhibited with the Kolkatan Experimenter gallery. One of the judges juxtaposed the social content of her work against the political reservations of other exhibitions in the show. Earlier that year, she completed her Meinstein (\\"My Stone\\") project in the center of Neukölln, a borough of Berlin. Her pavement mosaic uses stones that correspond to the national origins of the borough's residents, which is a largely immigrant population. She described her practice, at that time, as an archaeology of contemporary life. As of 2016, Kaabi-Linke is represented by Lawrie Shabibi of Dubai and Experimenter of Kolkata.  Work  In Kaabi-Linke's 2009 installation, Under Standing Over Views, paint chips from city walls in Tunis, Kiev, Paris, Berlin, Cologne and other Tunisian cities are positioned horizontally and suspended from the ceiling in a cluster. Caitlin Woolsey of Jadaliyya wrote that the work recalled city development-induced displacement policies and symbolized the mass that formed the United Arab Emirates, the country where the piece was installed (Sharjah Art Museum). Kaabi-Linke said that her work is \\"unintentionally autobiographical\\". Flying Carpets, 2011 The 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize commissioned Kaabi-Linke's Flying Carpets the same year. In the installation, a cage-like structure hangs from the ceiling and casts quadrilateral shadows onto the ground. Kaabi-Linke drew inspiration from a bridge in Venice where Arab and African street vendors used carpets to show counterfeit wares. The work was shown at the 54th Venice Biennale and was later purchased by the New York Guggenheim Museum in 2016 as part of the Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative. Laura van Straaten of Artnet News wrote that it was a highlight of the exhibition. The Financial Times said that Flying Carpets established the artist as among the few \\"capable of crafting complex socio-political histories into an organic, autonomous poetry\\". In May 2012, Kaabi-Linke exhibited in \\"Chkoun Ahna\\" at the Tunisian National Museum of Carthage. The show, co-curated by her partner, focused on questions of Tunisian identity following the 2010 Jasmine Revolution. The artist's 2012 commentary work, Smell, displayed the Shahada Muslim declaration of faith in jasmine atop a black flag, symbols of Islamic extremism and Tunisia, respectively. The flowers would decay against the background of the flag. The same year, after meeting many survivors of domestic violence during her 2012 residency in the London Delfina Foundation, Kaabi-Linke wanted to publicize the prevalence of the often marginalized crime. She created a work, Impunities London Originals, in 2012 using prints of scars from domestic violence, depicted in black powder smudges on paper. Impunities London exhibited alongside other works in the theme of masculine overreach at her 2015 second solo show in the Lawrie Shabibi gallery of Dubai. The show explored the emergence of machismo culture from themes of war heroism, exploitation, and violence, and machismo's relation to the seven deadly sins. Its central work, The Altarpiece, is an ink and wax print triptych in a gold leaf frame that visualizes war through its depiction of a World War II-era Berlin bunker. Civilians were forced to build the depicted bunker, which held private artworks from the Boros Collection as of the exhibition. ArtAsiaPacific wrote that the bullet holes on the walls of the bunker symbolized the wounds of Germany's involvement in the war. The magazine compared the work's format to that of early Christian art and considered the work \\"an allegory for the political strategy of covering up the past for a more favorable present\\" (revisionism). Tunisian Americans (2012) invoked the burial of American soldiers from the 1942 Tunisia Campaign, occupying foreign territory even in death. Grindballs, Hardballs, and Bangballs (2015) captured sand, cement, and pollen inside bubble wrap to reflect the masculine impulse to exploit the environment. A Short Story of Salt and Sun (2013), an ink and wax painting, comes from a print of a Tunisian resort's eroded wall to reflect on the inescapable erosion of man's creations and the decline of tourism in Tunisia. Artforum Stephanie Bailey wrote that Kaabi-Linke was both concise and sincere\\", with a \\"severity\\" offset by the \\"lightness\\" with which she navigates topical issues. The Dallas Museum of Art purchased her Tunisian Americans at the April 2016 Dallas Art Fair, and the Burger Collection purchased Impunities, London, in 2014. The M+ Museum of Visual Culture bought Modulor I, part of the Kaabi-Linke's Art Basel Hong Kong Discoveries Prize showing, in 2014. The Museum of Modern Art and Samdani Art Foundation also acquired work by Kaabi-Linke. Among prior works, the artist's 2014 exhibition at the London Mosaic Rooms featured a video piece, No, in which a disembodied mouth chants questions from an immigration visa interrogation, to which church congregants chant the replies. The video installation had previously debuted at the 2012 Liverpool Biennale. Kaabi-Linke's 2015 solo show at the Dallas Contemporary explored themes of international borders. A performance at the show ran its duration, wherein volunteers circled two poles while unraveling the 3,000 kilometers of thread, to create a symbolic wall that represents the length of the border the United States shares with Mexico. In an interview, she said that she was interested in the recent resurgence of geopolitical borders, such as the Mexico–United States border and the separation of the Islamic and Western worlds. She also reflected on her own experiences with immigration bureaucracies. As part of her practice, Kaabi-Linke takes prints of city walls, which she finds expressive of the city's history. Hyperallergic described Kaabi-Linke's six Dallas pieces as having high conceptual impact for addressing heavy political themes (e.g., politics of borders, identity, and military) with delicate media (e.g., hair, language, and thread).  Personal life  Kaabi-Linke is married and has two sons, born in early 2013 and late 2017. She lives in Berlin and Kiev and speaks six languages.

She is best remembered for her decorative painting and delight in children as subjects. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, she was a pupil of Collin, Laurens, Constant, L'Hermitte and Delance in Paris. Her awards include the Revell prize, for school room decoration, St. Louis. Her work includes mural decorations: \\"Sailing of the Claremont,\\" New Amsterdam Theatre, New York; \\"Old Indian Fort,\\" N. W. R. R. Station, Green Bay, Wisconsin; \\"Everlasting Covenant\\" (5 panels), \\"The Songs of David\\" (3 panels), and mosaics, Husser House, Chicago, 111inois; Illustrations for \\"Old Songs for Young America.\\" She exhibited in Champ de Mars Salons (1895, 1896) and was a member of the Society of Western Artists. Biography Drawing by Blanche Ostertag in \\"Old Songs for Young America\\" Drawing in \\"Old Songs for Young America\\" Ostertag was born in St. Louis and became a resident of Chicago. She was of half French parentage. In Paris, she exhibited at both Salons, where she may have been the youngest contributor, and also showed pictures at several American exhibitions before she found her true vein of decorative work. She produced covers, calendars, and posters, which were in demand among collectors. She also designed some elaborate chimney-pieces carried out in glass and gold mosaic. Her later work and first essay in book illustration was “Old Songs for Young America,\\" done in collaboration with the musician, Clarence Forsythe. Her droll and dainty decorations in delicate colors were quite frankly inspired by Boutet de Monvel’s treatment of the nursery songs of France. She spent four years in Paris, after a brief month's preliminary study at the Saint Louis Art Museum. After a few weeks at the St. Louis Museum and a little supplementary study at home, Ostertag studied at Julien's and Delecluse's, summered in Dutch hamlets, and sketched, between times, many phases. She learned much from Jules Guerin, the illustrator; not as his pupil —he had no pupils— but from his untrammelled criticism and from watching him work. \\"He taught me the value of values,\\" she said. Her knowledge of languages gave her an advantage over too many transatlantic pilgrims. Of mixed French and German parentage, she learned both languages from childhood. Speaking French like a native won her the interest of such diversely useful personages as the painter Cazin and the maid-of-allwork Henriette the bonne, who looked after Ostertag, and wrote to her affectionately as \\"her Mademoiselle Blanche.\\" From Paris, she went to Chicago. She took a studio, and exhibited at the Chicago Art Institute: Holland spinners, French boulevards, an occasional portrait, notable for tone and balance. These the critics praised and the public knew not of. Inevitably she experimented in many means of expression: etchings, monotypes, pastels. One of these went into Hamilton McCormick's collection. Twelve small designs were included in a calendar zinc- etched in colors. The pictures were about the size, shape, and style of tiles. Five-inch squares with romantic subjects heavily outlined and colored in flat washes. They had nothing to do with the seasons and the holidays beyond a certain feeling for the appropriate. Thus March was a knight-errant riding a white charger over bare brown hills; April was a green-mantled Elizabethan dame beating her way against a shower in a narrow street of half-timbered houses; July showed two lovers floating in a gondola past the marble steps of an Italian garden, the swain singing rapturously to his lute. And so on. No special Christmas or Valentine's Day or Fourth of July business. Perhaps the absence of these timeworn themes was welcome. Perhaps the public really recognized a fresh and individual touch. Anyhow that calendar had \\"an immense little success.\\" From a few leaflets sent across the ocean to la bonne Henriette in her cremerie certain rising French artists even wrote to America for more. Max Liebermann, the leader of the German Secession, praised them. Actually they were the turning-point for their creator from pictorial to decorative art. Poster drawing for \\"Piano Study\\" On them followed other calendars, other title - pages, other covers, and posters. One advertising a piano course was a charcoal drawing of a demurely attentive boy and girl. Another for a linen sale set forth, in an admirable combination of a few colors, a mother in a white morning robe buttoning her little girl's starched frock beside an open bureau drawer wherein piles of embroidered garments could be seen. The two dainty figures were in themselves winning, but gathered artistic force from the child's carroty tresses against the pink-striped wall- paper, the flowered tester and hangings, the rich red brown of the old mahogany furniture. As usual in Ostertag's pictures, the furniture was of correct design. Another calendar that took like wildfire displayed in a harmony of greens and chromes a small Velasquez-like princess with spreading hoop and parrot on fist. Still another shows a pale boy dreaming by the side of a lily-covered pond while his mother reads a book; on one of the lily-pads a palpable fairyland creature has appeared, a fat frog wearing a golden crown. This is a symphony in sunny green and lemon yellow, with touches of faint lilac in the flowers and the mother's gown. The backgrounds were always architecturally sound. \\"Yankee Doodle\\" rides his pony through the quaintest of step-gabled streets and across a toll-bridge of the real old type. The pretty maid waits for Johnny to come home from the fair\\" in front of a genuine Colonial mansion, buff and white, with a fan-light over its columned portico. Illustration for Max Muller's \\"Memories\\" Such chronological details were noted only as proving conscientious research even in childish matters. For the most part, the artist chose the early Victorian fashions—men in peg-top plaid trousers; women in crinolines, angel sleeves, lockets, and hair-nets; little girls in pig-tails and pantalettes. Here were delectable and varied decorations breathing a sort of innocent drollery, what M. de Monvel called \\"a precious quality of naivete\\". Her illustrations for Max Müller's \\"Memories,\\" were stamped with unusual breadth and proportion. Not unnaturally, Ostertag was associated with some of the leading Western architects; with Frank Lloyd Wright, for instance, in a characteristic residence at Buena Park. From the spacious central hall one sees, through doorways to left and right, two remarkable fireplaces. That in the drawing-room is carried out from her design in glass and gold mosaic— heavily hanging wistaria in creamy white shading to yellowish and greenish hues of opalescent glass on a band of burnished gold. One of its peculiarities is the clever use of a sort of gold crackle in the green leaves, simulating veins, and binding the whole together. The dining- room mantelpiece is painted on oak. The tablet over the fireplace has some verses from the 143d Psalm in gold and colors set in a thick pattern of grapes. The side panels bear each a mediaeval lady in brocade carrying a dish of fruit, with the motto, \\"0 give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good.\\" These vibrate with orange, blue, and green, the pigments laid on pure as the impressionists use it, and the natural golden brown of the wood cunningly planned as part of the color scheme. Among later, more serious work, there were portraits of children, and a series of watercolors setting forth the funny bashfulness or funnier dignity of children in a deep glow of color. In \\"When Love is Young\\", the lad in brown Holland and the blue-frocked lassie stand hand in hand on green turf gemmed with marigolds, and gaze out most seriously from a background of warm yellow leaves. Drawing of 19th-century children Ostertag had a rare feeling for color. She loved costume; her pictures were constantly enriched with the interweavings of Persian embroideries, or the splendid pomegranates of Venetian brocade, or the often piquant and humorous plaids, dots, and stripes—for there can be humor in the truest art when the artist has a sense of humor. She loved architecture, so that balance and mass were in the very structure of her compositions, and she lost no chance of introducing a background of buildings or the fine lines of 18-century cabinet-makers. She loved children and she lifted them out of the commercial into the artistic plane.

He played college football at Texas Christian University, and was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. Early years Derrick Dwayne Kindred, Jr. was born December 15, 1993, in San Antonio, Texas, to Derrick Kindred, Sr. and his then-wife, Karen Randle. His father was a truck driver, and his mother was a physical therapist (although later she became a pharmacy technician). His parents divorced, and Kindred was raised by his mother and attended Karen Wagner High School in San Antonio. In high school, Kindred was both an offensive and defensive player. As an offensive running back, Kindred rushed for and scored 14 touchdowns in his senior year. On defense that same season, he had 71 tackles, two sacks, and returned two kickoffs for touchdowns. He was named the best two-way player among all Class 5A schools by the San Antonio Express-News in 2011. At and during the college draft, Kindred was only recruited by the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), which was just beginning to put together a football program. Kindred initially committed to UTSA as part of its inaugural recruiting class. Before National Signing day, Baylor University and Texas Christian University (TCU) expressed interest in him. Kindred changed his commitment to TCU just before the commitment deadline. College career At TCU, Kindred started one game as a freshman in 2012 and three as a sophomore in 2013. He was a full-time starter in his junior and senior years, starting all 26 games. In his junior season, Kindred had four interceptions and 80 tackles.

Physicians assessed the injury, and said Kindred could continue to play, albeit with additional padding. Members of the TCU football team called Kindred \\"Peanut\\", a nickname given to him by quarterback Trevone Boykin after the shape of Kindred's head. Professional career =Cleveland Browns= The Cleveland Browns selected Kindred in the fourth round (129th overall) of the 2016 NFL draft.

Throughout training camp, Kindred performed well and impressed coaches enough in the preseason to warrant a competition against Jordan Poyer for the starting free safety job. Head coach Hue Jackson named Poyer the starting free safety and Kindred the backup strong safety behind Ibraheim Campbell to start the regular season. He made his professional regular season debut in the Cleveland Browns' season-opener at the Philadelphia Eagles and recorded six combined tackles in the 29-10 loss. On September 25, 2016, Kindred earned his first career start after Ibraheim Campbell was out with a hamstring injury. He made four combined tackles during the Browns' 30-24 loss at the Miami Dolphins. On November 6, 2016, he collected a season-high six combined tackles during the Browns' 35-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. In Week 11, Kindred made six combined tackles and a season-high two pass deflections during a 24-9 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. During the bye week in Week 13, he broke his ankle while training and was placed on the reserve/non-football injury list on December 7, 2016. He appeared in all 12 games with five starts and finished his rookie season with 46 combined tackles (32 solo) and five passes defensed. 2017 Throughout training camp, Kindred competed against Ibraheim Campbell and Calvin Pryor for the job as the starting strong safety. He was named the starting strong safety to begin the regular season. He played in the Cleveland Browns' season-opener Pittsburgh Steelers and made three combined tackles and recorded his first career interception off of a pass attempt by Ben Roethlisberger during their 21-18 loss. The interception occurred in the fourth quarter and stopped a potential scoring drive for the Steelers, who were on the Browns' 29-yard line before the play.

As one of the first photographers who recognized the commercial potential of photography, she became a leading photographer in Berlin during the Weimar Republic. When the Nazi Party came to power, she was forced into working as a radiographer. She was deported by the Gestapo in 1942 and murdered, probably in the Majdanek concentration camp during World War II. Early life Else Ernestine Neuländer was born on 26 January 1900 in Berlin as the youngest child of a Jewish merchant and a milliner. Her father died when she was twelve and her mother supported the nine siblings with her hatmaking. Neuländer probably was a student at the Lettehaus of Berlin, and completed her schooling and a six-month internship to learn her craft. Career In 1925, Neuländer established her own photographic studio using the professional pseudonym Yva in a favorable location, near the avenue of Kurfürstendamm. In 1926, she had a brief collaboration with the painter and photographer Heinz Hajek-Halke, but due to a copyright dispute, they severed their partnership. Her brother, Ernst Neuländer, was a co-owner of the modeling salon Kuhnen and he hired her to shoot his models. She was able to publish ten photographs in Die Dame in 1927, which served as a breakthrough to the top fashion magazines of the day. She embraced the modernist approach using technical composition and avant-garde imagery, both capturing the sexual revolution of the period and emphasizing the female form in ungendered ways, which allowed her flexibility as an artist. Her decision to enter the field was itself a challenge to the accepted norm of the day, which saw men as artists and women as their passive models. paving block on Schlüterstraße #45 for Else Neuländer-Simon By 1927, Yva had become known for specializing in fashion, nudes, and portraiture, but increasingly she recognized the commercial aspects for photography and was one of the first professionals who worked in advertising. One such ad was a campaign done for \\"Amor Skin\\" which utilized multiple exposures of the film, to create dreamlike, surrealist images. Within a short time, she had establish a reputation for her innovative imagery and became a contributor to magazines, photographic journals and periodicals including Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung, Die Dame, the fashion magazine Elegant Welt, and '. She also participated in international exhibitions, including the 1929 \\"Film und Foto\\" exhibit in Stuttgart, the 1930 Das Lichtbild exhibit held in Munich, the 1932 First International Biennial of Photographic Art () held in Rome and then in 1933, she participated in both the annual international Parisian salon of nude photography La Beauté de la femme and the London Royal Photographic Society′s \\"The Modern Spirit in Photography\\" exhibition. Yva was represented by Schostal Photo Agency (Agentur Schostal)Rebecca Madamba (2008) The Schostal Agency: A Finding Aid for the Schostal Agency Collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Thesis of the Honours Bachelors of Arts, Studies in Arts and Culture, Concentration in Curatorial Studies, Brock University. From 1929 Yva's photographic \\"stories\\" appeared in the Ullstein Verlag′s '. She had been contracted to produce 27 montages, but only 20 appeared before the magazine was forced to close. The photo strips told in action sequence the story of young women arriving from the provinces to the Berlin metropolis to seek their fortunes and represent a technical step between static pictures and motion picture films. In 1933, even though the Nazi Party began shutting down Jewish owned businesses and published her name on a list of undesirables, Yva decided to expand her business. In part, the ambiguity of the Nazi policies, her assimilation into the non-Jewish community, and her employment of ten assistants who were not Jewish, led Yva to a false sense of safety. She did not experience anti-Semitism from her advertising and fashion clients, and first moved to a larger studio on Bleibtreustraße before relocating again the following year to Schlüterstraße, shortly after her marriage. In 1934, she married Alfred Simon, who gave up his own career to manage the business aspects of Yva's firm. Yva hired a young assistant, Helmut Neustädter in 1936, who would later become the well-known fashion photographer Helmut Newton. That same year, she Aryanized her firm and transferred ownership to her friend, the art historian Charlotte Weidler, to enable the business to continue operations. Yva made plans to emigrate, after receiving an offer of employment from Life to work in New York City. Her husband convinced her to abandon the plan and remain in Germany, hoping that things would improve, because he could not envision starting over in a new place in which he didn't even speak the language. Simon had guessed wrong, as in 1938 Yva was banned from practicing photography by a new series of regulations and forced to close her studio. She worked as an assistant in the radiography department of the Jewish Hospital of Berlin until 1942. Some efforts were made in 1942 for the couple to leave Germany, as after their arrest 34 crates of their belongings, most full of her photographic furnishings, were identified at the Hamburg port. Twenty-one of the crates were destroyed in a bombing and the other 13 were auctioned to offset the costs of their storage. Else and Alfred Simon were arrested by the Gestapo on 1 June 1942 and on 13 June were sent via \\"15 Osttransport\\" to the extermination camps. Their transport was supposed to go to the Sobibór extermination camp, but on the way the train was moved to a side track at Lublin, Poland and 1030 prisoners were selected to go on to Sobibór. The remaining prisoners, how many remains unclear, were sent to the Majdanek concentration camp. No transport lists for this deportation have clarified the whereabouts of the couple, though the Jewish Registry at Yad Vashem shows Alfred Simon was murdered at Majdanek. No record of Yva's death has surfaced. It is probable that both of them were killed upon arrival at a camp, probably in 1942. Else Ernestine Neuländer was officially declared dead on 31 December 1944 and stone paving blocks were placed outside her last home at Schlüterstraße #45 on 29 November 2005. Legacy In 2001, a retrospective of Yva's work was featured at the Hidden Museum () in Charlottenburg. The following year, her photographs were featured in an exhibit at the Stadtmuseum Berlin. In 2002, Yva: Photographies 1925-1938, a biography and evaluation of her work and contributions to photography was written by Marion Beckers and Elisabeth Moortgat and published in German and English by Wasmuth Publishing.

Hailed as a key work in early modern Polish drama, Zapolska's play tackles issues of social justice, socialism, morality, conscience, and the performative duality of social identity. It has inspired many film adaptations and has appeared on stage in many forms, even as a musical comedy. Mrs. Dulska’s view that \\"a secure living is the base of life... And as for a husband, you can train him\\" perfectly encapsulates the elements of bourgeois realism employed by Zapolska to bitingly skewer the inadequacy and hypocrisy of bourgeois life. As dramatist Alan P. Barr notes, \\"The Morality of Mrs. Dulska belongs to the social-protest literature that irritated the conservative sentiments of turn-of-the-century Europe\\". Zapolska's best known work, the enduringly popular play utilizes satiric wit to address the middle- class sensibilities of turn-of-the-century Galicia. Characters *Aniela Dulska – mistress of the house; a landlady; shrewd, very concerned with appearances, dotes on her son *Felicjan Dulski – her husband; passive and little-heard-from *Zbyszko Dulski – their son; a philandering young man sick of his mother's overbearing tendencies *Mela Dulska – their daughter; compassionate and concerned *Hesia Dulska – their daughter; judgemental, sharp, and somewhat mean *Juliasiewiczowa – a relation of Mrs. Dulska *Tenant – a female tenant (attempts suicide) *Hanka – The Dulski’s servant, an exploited former peasant girl of low class *Tadrachowa – Hanka’s godmother, a washerwoman Plot Mrs. Dulska is the tyrannical landlady of a nice tenement building who is prideful, clever, and above all else, concerned with appearances. Known for her thrifty nature and exploitive treatment of her tenants, she is a merciless embodiment of the bourgeois middle-class. She exercises no sympathy or compassion toward those who rent from her. A first- floor tenant's attempted suicide by phosphorus necrosis is met with indifference, as is the fate of Hanka, her maid, whom she 'effectively prostitutes' to her son in an attempt to contain and control his philandering ways. Mela and Hesia, her daughters, are ignorant to the facts of life which she refuses to impart to them, instead insisting that they practice for their music lessons. Mr. Dulski, battered after years of his ruthless and over- bearing wife, remains neutrally bland. Mrs. Dulska's obsession is with her son, over whom she is wildly possessive. She is so afraid that he will abandon her that she bends to his every whim, especially with his relationship with Hanka that she foists upon them to curb his philandering. Despite this, he still resents her, particularly after she goes to great lengths to prevent his marriage to Hanka as she is horrified at what it will do to their social standing and their bloodline if he marries a poor peasant girl who is also their maid. Hanka is pregnant, and Zbyszko wants to marry her, but Mrs. Dulska tells her to get her registration book and get out, endeavoring to get her and the scandal that accompanies her out of their home. Zbyszko's contempt for his mother and her social sensibilities is evident as he says he will marry Hanka anyway, telling her that her place is on the sofa next to Mrs. Dulska (much to Dulska's horror). While Mela consoles Hanka, saying that she will be happy with Zbyszko, Hesia is unkind to her (primarily for reasons of class). Juliasiewiczowa is the first to posit the idea to Mrs. Dulska that Zbyszko has done all of this to spite her. Tadrachowa, Hanka's godmother, arrives, and makes a case for Hanka, saying that even though she is a bricklayer's daughter, she is an upstanding girl. She refers to herself as Zbyszko's 'mother-in-law' presumptively, a familiarity that horrifies Mrs. Dulska. The play ends with Hanka being paid off (a thousand kronen) so that she will not speak of the engagement or her pregnancy, and so that she will not marry Zbyszko. At the close, Hanka is leaving, as Mela and Hesia reflect on her fate. Sympathetic and concerned, Mela frets that Hanka, a good and decent person, will kill herself. Hesia is laughing hysterically, saying that she has taken the thousand kronen to marry her alleged fiance back in her home village, a customs man. Themes =Class aspiration and social sophistication= Class aspiration and/or social sophistication are at the heart of Mrs. Dulska's public persona, and translator Teresa Murjas utilised the expression of varying degrees of politeness and affectation present in the original Polish text to highlight a constant negotiation between the performed and public selves. =Duality of self= The Dulski family is full of double standards and contradictions in the way they dress and behave privately vs. publicly. Polish actress Emilia Krakowskia says the following of the \\"much- maligned landlady's sinful nature': > \\"Dulskaness confronts us at every step. It is middle-class duplicity, > ignorance- that characteristic dual morality, distinctly dividing our > behaviour between the home and the street. A morality encapsulated by the > phrase 'what will people say?' Zapolska's work received praise for its lack over over-simplification and complex examination of this particular middle-class sensibility, rendering it a well-constructed satire of the bourgeois. Mrs. Dulska’s compartmentalized morals (\\"she can rent to whores, but not greet them; she can accept immorality if it is hidden indoors, but evicts a tenant who creates a scandal by trying to escape her abusive husband\\") reflect the divided lives and roles of her children, particular the son whom she dotes upon to the point of unhealthy possessiveness. =Cleanliness & moral \\"dirt\\"= Zapolska notes that Mrs. Dulska wears dirty, torn apparel when in the presence of her immediate family, but wears incredibly lavish and elaborate costumes in the presence of her 'public'. She has a \\"pathological love of cleanliness\\", polishing the floors in an obsessive manner \\"bordering on ritualistic\\" obligation. Contrasting to the meticulous attention to detail both in her clothing and cleaning, \\"the entire morally filthy, disgusting\\" business at the center of the play takes place Reception & Impact The Morality of Mrs. Dulska was an immediate hit across all of partitioned Poland. During 1906-07 Krakow theatrical season, it had the longest run of the 82 staged texts, and, in March 1907, was seen by a record 5,000 audience members during that month alone. The play and its title character entered quickly into the vernacular, their notoriety cemented by the two follow-up stories Zapolska published in 1907, The Death of Felicjan Dulski and Mrs. Dulska in Court and by the 1909 satirical journal published in Krakow, Mrs. Dulska. As Polish stage writer Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński noted in 1932, she came to represent \\"a whole epoch\\". A new term arose in the Polish language: 'dulszczyna', which roughly translates to \\"Dulska-ness\\" and functions as \\"a catch-all for the litany of reprehensible qualities exhibited by bourgeois philistine Aniela Dulska: double standards, endemic conservatism, excessive self-delusion, poor social conscience, weakness of character, hypocrisy, xenophobia, penny-pinching, vanity, pomposity, crassness, lack of compassion, sadistic self-aggrandizement, and bad taste\\", as notes translator Teresa Murjas. Translation The predominant English language translation was developed by Dr. Teresa Murjas in conjunction with the University of Reading as a research project. Staged at the Centre for Polish Culture (POSK) in Hammersmith, London, Murjas's translation attempts to preserve the formality of address and early 20th century language of the period in which Zapolska wrote the Polish version of the play.  Notable Productions  =Film adaptations= * Boleslaw Niewolin's 1930 film, notable as the first Polish movie with sound (recorded on a gramophone record) * :cs:Morálka paní Dulské (1958) * :pl:Dulscy (1976) * Panie Dulskie (2015) =1967 Krakow Production = Lidia Zamkow's significant 1967 production presented the show with a contemporary set and costumes, departing from the realist depictions of Dulska predominant in theatre. The production also blurred the lines between the unpleasant characteristics of Mrs. Dulska's personality, making their depiction much more subtle, which sharpened the satiric element of Zapolska's work. =Dulska! (1989 Musical) = The 1989 musical adaptation of the play presented the events through an 'erotic cabaret-style set' in the bourgeois drawing room of the Dulski family. The production was viewed largely as an attempt to attract younger audiences to the classics and to reinvigorate audiences and students alike who had been 'overexposed' to the hugely popular work. The production also featured a revival of the undercurent sexuality present throughout the work = 2004 London Production = This first performance of the show in Britain was in Hammersmith, London, and was part of Dr. Teresa Murjas's translation project aimed at bringing this well-known Polish play into the English-speaking world. Staged at the Centre for Polish Culture (POSK) in Hammersmith, London, Murjas modelled the staging and many production elements on the 1967 Krakow production.

It is listed Grade 1 as a medieval church with its fabric, including timber roofs, mainly intact, and having group value with he churchyard cross and Cliff Cottage. History In 1180, William, Earl of Gloucester is recorded as having granted land in the area to William Lageles, from whom the village is thought to have got its name. The current church was built later, to replace the nearby church of St Cewydd, the site of which is known. The nave and chancel are believed to date to the late 13th and 14th centuries, and the southern porch and tower to the later medieval period. During the 16th century the church and the manor of Laleston belonged to Margam Abbey, and in 1522, the parishioners were given a lease on the tithe barn. At the Dissolution, Sir Rice Mansel purchased the manor. Those who officiated as parish priests or curates over the years included John Evans (died 1847) who later turned to Methodism.. Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet, visited the church in 1847, and left a written account of the architecture. Architecture The church is built on a standard plan, with a west tower, nave and lower chancel. It has, probably incorrectly, been attributed to a 12th-century mason called \\"Lalys\\". The tower interior is in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The church underwent restoration by John Prichard in 1871, and the stained glass windows, probably by Clayton and Bell, are from that decade. Interior The interior is limewashed, and features numerous engravings on the walls, dated to the 17th and 18th centuries. The chancel stalls, of oak, and the desk and pulpit date to 1958. William Clarke of Llandaff was hired for wood carvings in the sanctuary; he added the reredos in 1908. St David's Church became a Grade I listed building on 26 July 1963. Memorials Several graves of the Ben(n)et family of Laleston House (located close to the church), a family notable locally in the 17th and 18th centuries, are to be found in the church. In 1762, Thomas Bennet left a legacy of £52 10s for poor relief.

History St Crallo's Church The church is dedicated to the 6th century Celtic saint, Crallo, supposedly related to both Saint Illtyd and Saint Canna. The village in which the church is situated, Coychurch is known in the Welsh language as Llangrallo; Llan – Church, Grallo – Crallo, the church of Crallo. It is believed that the saint founded a church on the site before the construction of the present medieval building. The present church is dated to the mid to late 13th century, when it was built as part of St Crallo's College. The church had undergone no changes since it was built until John Prichard began a restoration in 1870. At the time of the restoration, no work was done on the tower because it appeared to be sound and there was a lack of funds for further restoration work. On 7 February 1877, the tower fell without warning. The south transept of the church was in ruins and the northern transept was badly damaged. The tower's collapse also damaged the cross of Saint Crallo in the church courtyard. In 1888, the church hoped to be able to restore the Saint Crallo cross with the help of a drawing made by F. R Kempson. Fragments of the cross were carefully preserved. The cross was reassembled and is now kept inside the church. At the time the tower fell, a contractor had been removing the remains of those who had been buried near the tower. Some 1,800 remains were being moved to the east side of the church. Since the nave had relatively little damage, a temporary wall was built at its east end to allow the church to conduct services. It remained in this condition until the church was able to fund the rebuilding project. F. R. Kempson was given the responsibility of the rebuilding work in 1888. The stained glass windows of the aisle were installed by Celtic Studios in the mid 20th century, while the western windows of engraved glass were added by Frank Roper in 1963. Architecture Newman describes the St Crallo's as 'large and impressive' while E. A. Freeman, writing in 1857, suggested that the building would make 'an admirable model for small colonial church'. Built in the mid to late 13th century St Crallo's is cruciform in design. The church contains a memorial to lexicographer Thomas Richards, a 14th-century tomb chest featuring an effigy of praying monk with fine detail on a plain tomb chest, and an 18th- century memento mori tablet on the western wall dedicated to Richard Howell. St Crallo's Church became a Grade I listed building on 26 July 1963. In the churchyard is Coychurch Celtic Cross-Shaft, which is a Scheduled Monument.
