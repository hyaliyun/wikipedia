He is best known now as an arranger and editor of the music of J.S. Bach, Mozart and Mendelssohn. He was a friend of Schumann and Brahms, and conducted the first performance of the latter's Alto Rhapsody in 1870. Biography Carl (or Karl) Ernst Naumann was born in Freiberg in Saxony in 1832, the son of mineralogist Carl Friedrich Naumann.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Vol. VI, p. 35, Ernst Naumann He was a cousin of (1827‚Äì1888) and grandson of Johann Gottlieb Naumann (1741‚Äì1801), both composers. Ernst Naumann studied the organ with (1789‚Äì1864) and composition with Moritz Hauptmann and Ernst Richter. He published a treatise, √úber die verschiedenen Bestimmungen der Tonverh√§ltnisse und die Bedeutung des pythagor√§ischen oder reinen Quinten- Systems f√ºr unsere heutige Musik (The Various Definitions of Pitch Proportions and the Meaning of the Pythagorean Perfect Fifths System for Music Today) (Leipzig, 1858). From 1860 until his death 50 years later he was organist and kapellmeister in Jena; from 1877 professor. He made arrangements of the music of Bach, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schumann, and published editions of Bach, Handel and Vivaldi. He prepared six volumes of Bach's cantatas and keyboard pieces for publication as well as a nine-volume edition of his organ works. He did not complete his edition of Haydn's string quartets. Naumann was friendly with Brahms and Schumann. The similarity of Brahms‚Äôs music to that of late Beethoven was first noted in a letter from Albert Dietrich to Ernst Naumann on 5 November 1853. Naumann was one of the people Dietrich wrote to in March 1854, following Schumann's suicide attempt in late February. On 3 March 1870, with the Akademischer Gesangverein of Jena, Naumann conducted the first public performance of Brahms's Alto Rhapsody, with Pauline Viardot as soloist.Peter Clive, Brahms and His World, A Biographical Dictionary He died in 1910 in Jena, aged 78.

Life Poster for a Salon des Cent exhibition in December 1899 Fernand Louis Gottlob was born in Paris in 1873. He studied under the painter-decorator Armand F√©lix Marie Jobb√©-Duval (1821‚Äì1889). He was also taught by Laporte and G. Fuchs. He became a painter, lithographer, caricaturist, commercial artist, illustrator and graphic designer for song scores. He created portraits, illustrations for books and caricatures that appeared in popular magazines in Paris including Le Rire, Le Journal Amusement and Le Sourire. His work began to be shown in the official salons in 1891. Gottlob was among the artists who contributed to L'Estampe Moderne, a limited edition series of portfolios of high-quality lithographs that was published monthly from May 1897 and April 1899. His work first appeared in L'Assiette au Beurre in the second issue, on 11 April 1901. He became a member of the Cornet Society in 1904 and, between then and his death designed twelve menus for the society. He died in Paris in 1935. Works Gottlob's 1900 poster for the 2nd Exposition of Painter- Lithographers on the Rue Drouot in Paris shows a strong influence of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in its composition. A woman is in front of a large illuminated window, and the dramatic back-lighting emphasizes the dark forms of her dress and hat. He created relatively few posters in his life, but this exposition of posters was one in which he participated. In addition to lithographs and portraits, he painted cityscapes of Paris and landscapes of Normandy and Brittany. In one of Gottlob's poignant images for the Assiette au Beurre he shows a mother with her children during a snowstorm, in front of the window of a bakery. The mother is explaining, \\"√áa, mon enfant, c'est du pain\\" (\\"That is bread, my child\\"). In 1916 he designed a poster for the Ligue Souvenez-vous! which they produced in large numbers and also used as a stamp. In the 1970s Irene and Howard Stein began collecting color posters by well- known artists of the early 20th century such as Mucha, Ch√©ret and Gottlob. Their collection grew with the acquisition of work by Toulouse-Lautrec to become one of the largest such collections in the United States. =Posters= * 1899 : Exposition au Salon des Cent. * 1900 : 2e Exposition des Peintres- Lithographes (Imprimeries Lemercier) sur Gallica. * 1905 : Th√©√¢tre National de l'Op√©ra-Comique.

He served under Garibaldi during the Second Italian War of Independence, the Expedition of the Thousand, and the Third Italian War of Independence. After the unification of Italy, he was twice a member of the City Council of Milan. Dizionario biografico degli Italiani: Giuseppe Missori Biography Missori was born in Moscow in 1829, to a family of Bolognese origin, but soon moved to Milan, where he first proved his patriotic enthusiasm in the Five Days of Milan. An admirer of both Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi, at the beginning of the Second Italian War of Independence he enrolled in the Hunters of the Alps corps, being assigned to the \\"Guide a Cavallo\\" (\\"mounted scouts\\") regiment. In 1859 he fought in some of the main battles on the Lombard front. In 1860 he was in the Expedition of the Thousand, and saved Garibaldi's life in the Battle of Milazzo (1860). In 1862, in behalf of Garibaldi, he created the army of volunteers from Reggio Calabria, Catanzaro, and Cosenza that eventually fought the Bersaglieri in the Battle of Aspromonte that same year. Between 1866 and 1867 he was again with Garidaldi in the Third Italian War of Independence, participating in several battles, including Bezzecca, Monterotondo, and Mentana. Missori's grave at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan After the unification of Italy, he declined repeated offers to enter politics (e.g., as a deputee) in the name of his republican ideals (he wouldn't swear loyalty to the Savoy Monarchy). Nevertheless, he eventually accepted to become a member of the City Council of Milan in 1889-1894 and again in 1899-1902. He died of sickness in Milan on 25 March 1911. His funerals were largely attended by the population, political representatives, and a delegation of Martinitt, the boys from the eponymous Milanese orphanage (which Missori had directed for a while). According to his last will, his body was cremated. On 11 June 1929, his remains were placed in the \\"Famedio\\", the main building of the Monumental Cemetery of Milan, reserved for the most eminent Milanese people. Equestrian statue A number of cities in Italy have streets or squares named after Missori; Milan has a central square Piazza Giuseppe Missori (about 500 m south of Piazza del Duomo). A bronze equestrian statue of Missori, by sculptor Riccardo Ripamonti, is located in the centre of this square.Guida ai misteri e segreti di Milano (SugarCo 1977), p. 282 The statue, inaugurated in 1916, features an unusually weary-looking horse, which the Milanese reportedly nicknamed \\"caval de br√ºm\\" (roughly meaning \\"carriage horse\\")El brumista because of its less than martial appearance; a saying \\"te p√†ret el cavall del Missori\\" (\\"you look like Missori's horse\\") is also sometimes used in Milan to address someone who looks sad. That same horse was, reportedly, part of a former work by Ripamonti, entitled Waterloo; the original rider was thus Napoleon, on the occasion of his famous defeat.Equestrian statue of General Giuseppe Missori The inscription on the pedestal of the statue, now almost illegible, commemorates Missori saving Garibaldi's life in Milazzo: Monumento a Giuseppe Missori Footnotes Category:1829 births Category:1911 deaths Category:People from Moscow Category:People from Milan Category:Burials at the Cimitero Monumentale di Milano Category:Italian city councillors Category:Italian people of the Italian unification Category:Members of the Expedition of the Thousand ","title":"Giuseppe Missori"},{"id":"35787507","text":"The PGA National Champion Course is an 18-hole golf course located at the PGA National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, United States.Champion Course at PGA National Resort & Spa The PGA National Champion Course was opened on November 17, 1981.

The band is led by David Rohl who writes, arranges, mixes and produces their material. Rohl is also a somewhat controversial Egyptologist, once featured on the London Sunday Times front page with the caption \\"the real Indiana Jones\\". History =1970s= In 1974, Rohl had taken an interest in Tibetan Buddhism and the Tibetans‚Äô resistance to the Chinese invasion in the 1950s. In the process he had begun writing what became a 20 minute musical piece titled \\"Om Mani Padme Hum\\", and began to build up a team of musicians in order to record the first movement of the piece. These musicians evolved into a band and started to write other songs about the same subject. Demo tapes soon interested Chrysalis Records, who then signed the band. Chrysalis wanted the band to gel together as a live outfit so that the recording would have a ‚Äòband feel‚Äô rather than just a bunch of session musicians playing in a sterile studio environment. Prior to recording an album, the label sent them out as the opening act for Robin Trower‚Äôs first major UK tour, playing to 2,000 fans each night for about twenty shows. The band played all the tracks from what would become their first album (including the whole twenty minutes of \\"Om Mani Padme Hum\\"). The live band consisted of David Rohl on piano, Vic Emerson on Hammond, Moog and Claviolines, Ashley Mulford on guitar, John Stimpson on bass, Tony Cresswell on drums and Dave Durant on lead vocals. Mandalaband's first album, simply titled Mandalaband was released by Chrysalis Records in 1975. It included the 20 minute track entitled \\"Om Mani Padme Hum\\" ‚Äì a four- movement work for rock band and choir. The lineup for this album were lead singer Dave Durant (accompanied by the London Chorale), and original band members Vic Emerson (keyboards), Ashley Mulford (guitars), Tony Cresswell (drums) and John Stimpson (bass), with David Rohl as founder, writer and studio engineer for the band. David Rohl left the band on the first day of recording the album after having been removed by Chrysalis as producer/engineer and replaced by another producer. When the tapes were delivered to the label however, Rohl was asked to remix the album as the record company executives were unhappy with the results. Although the album was released and well received, Rohl was always dissatisfied with the outcome stating \\"I did not record the actual instruments, so the album never got close to the quality I had envisaged and feel could have been achieved\\". The band went its separate ways the following year, and David Rohl went to work at Indigo Sound in Manchester at the time, having left Mandalaband. This studio was closely connected to the TV and film industries and he was asked to write the music for a proposed film version of The Lord of the Rings. This original version was to be made in Ireland but the producers never managed to raise all the necessary funding to undertake such a massive project. \\"The Eye of Wendor\\" overture was written as the title music for the movie, and the track that came to be called \\"Silesandre\\" was originally entitled \\"Black Riders\\". When the movie production was cancelled Rohl decided to write \\"The Eye of Wendor\\" story and compose a whole triple album of music for it. He did not have a working band at that point, so he called on his friends in the UK music industry to help out, and they played most of the instruments and sang the vocals while Rohl engineered and produced the recordings. The result was The Eye of Wendor ‚Äì a concept album based on a Tolkienesque fantasy set in a world of warlocks, witches, battling heroes, and a magical gemstone of supernatural power. Vocalists on this album included: Justin Hayward, Eric Stewart, Maddy Prior, Graham Gouldman, Kevin Godley, Lol Creme, Friday Brown and Paul Young. Musicians included: Ritchie Close, David Rohl and Woolly Wolstenholme on keys; Noel Redding, Les Holroyd, Graham Gouldman on bass; Steve Broomhead and John Lees on guitars; Kim Turner and Mel Pritchard on drums & percussion; plus orchestration from the Halle orchestra for all the classical bits. The Eye of Wendor was released in 1978. The overture of The Eye of Wendor became the trademark closing theme in the Norwegian comedy adventure TV series about Br√∏drene Dal, in all four series. The three first series used Mandalaband's own version, the fourth series used a new rendition recorded by the Norwegian Radio Orchestra (Kringkastingsorkestret). =2000s= Rohl left music in the 1980s to pursue his interest in Egyptology. But eventually he felt that he still had ‚Äòunfinished business‚Äô with his music. He moved to Spain in 2003 and built a studio on top of a mountain overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. He then assembled a new Mandalaband consisting of both new and former band members, and began recording new material. The musicians and singers who played their part in this new Mandalaband project were: David Rohl (writer, engineer, producer, vocalist and keyboards), Ashley Mulford (guitars and vocals), Troy Donockley (Uilleann pipes, whistles, guitars and bouzouki), Marc Atkinson (acoustic guitar and vocals), Jose Manuel Medina (keyboards, Spanish guitar and backing vocals), Sergio Garcia (acoustic guitar), Kim Turner (drums, percussion and mandolin), David Clements (bass guitar), Craig Fletcher (bass guitar and backing vocals), Morten Vestergaard (bass guitar), Pablo Lato (bass guitar), Alison Carter (backing vocals), Lynda Howard (backing vocals), and Barbara & Briony Macanas (backing vocals). Woolly Wolstenholme (keyboards and vocals) who died during the last stages of recording AD - Sangreal, and that album is dedicated to his memory. This line-up of Mandalaband released BC ‚Äì Ancestors in 2009 and a follow-up AD ‚Äì Sangreal in July 2011. The double CD Resurrection (a completely re-mixed and re-mastered special edition of the two original 1970s albums) was released in November 2010.

These saris are worn as bridal & special occasion saris by most women in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka & Andhra Pradesh. It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 20052006. As of 2008, an estimated 5,000 families were involved in sari production. There are 25 silk and cotton yarn industries and 60 dyeing units in the region. Weaving The saris are woven from pure mulberry silk thread. The pure mulberry silk used in the making of Kanchipuram saris comes from South India and the zari comes from Gujarat. To weave a Kanchipuram sari three shuttles are used. While the weaver works on the right side, his aide works on the left side shuttle. The border colour and design are usually quite different from the body. If the pallu (the hanging end of the sari) has to be woven in a different shade, it is first separately woven and then delicately joined to the Sari. The part where the body meets the pallu is often denoted by a zigzag line. In a genuine Kanchipuram Silk Sari, body and border are woven separately and then interlocked together. The joint is woven so strongly that even if the saris tears, the border will not detach. That differentiates the kanchivaram silk saris from the others. Design Saris are distinguished by their wide contrast borders. Temple borders, checks, stripes and floral (buttas) are traditional designs found on a Kanchipuram saris. The patterns and designs in the kanchipuram saris were inspired with images and scriptures in South Indian temples or natural features like leaves, birds and animals. These are saris with rich woven pallu showing paintings of Raja Ravi Varma and epics of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Kanchipuram saris vary widely in cost depending upon the intricacy of work, colours, pattern, material used like zari (gold thread) etc. The silk is also known for its quality and craftsmanship, which has helped earn its name. Significance Kanchipuram saris woven with heavy silk and gold cloth are considered to be special and are worn on occasions and festivities. Geographical Indication In 2005, the Government of Tamil Nadu applied for Geographical Indication for Kanchipuram saris. The Government of India recognized it as a Geographical indication officially since the year 2005-06. In popular culture The Tamil film Kanchivaram released in 2008 depicts the struggles of silk weavers in Kanchipuram.

Life Leakey was born in Exeter in the county of Devon, England. She was the sixth child of a large religious family of eleven children: her parents were James Leakey, an artist, and Eliza Hubbard Woolmer. Suffering from ill health most of her life, Leakey was an avid reader, and when her health allowed her, was active in charitable and religious activities.Horner, J. C., 'Leakey, Caroline Woolmer (1827‚Äì1881)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 11 May 2012. In 1847, she sailed to the British colony of Van Diemen's Land, to join her sister Eliza, who had migrated to Hobart Town several years earlier with her clergyman husband, Reverend James Medland. Shortly after her arrival, her health deteriorated and she was bedridden for much of the remainder of her time in the colony. In 1851, she lived for twelve months at the convict settlement of Port Arthur. When she returned to Hobart, she fell ill again and her family urged her to return to England, which she did in March 1853. Encouraged by Bishop Francis Nixon, whom she had lived with in Hobart, to publish her poetry, Leakey published an anthology of poems titled Lyra Australis, or Attempts to Sing in a Strange Land, which was published in London in 1853 and Hobart in 1854.Mead, Jenna (2006): Caroline Leakey, The Companion to Tasmanian History, Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies. In March 1857, Leakey began writing a novel, which was published in 1859 in London and in 1860 in Hobart. The novel, The Broad Arrow: Being Passages from the History of Maida Gwynnham, a Lifer, was published under the pen name of \\"Olin√© Keese\\".Caroline Woolmer Leaky , Index of Significant Tasmanian Women, Department of Premier and Cabinet, Government of Tasmania. The Broad Arrow is considered a significant social document, and as one of the earliest novels to feature a convict as the main character, was a forerunner of, and influence on, the more well-known For the Term of His Natural Life by Marcus Clarke, who used Leakey's novel as a reference for his book. After Leakey's death a heavily abridged version of The Broad Arrow was published. Her original, unabridged version remained out of print until 2019, when it was re-issued. In 1861, Leakey established a house in Exeter to care for \\"fallen women\\". She wrote numerous religious tracts before she died after an eighteen-month illness in 1881.

The movie theater was initially proposed in 1937 as part of a larger development that would include a five-story, 162-room hotel, which was soon scaled back to the theater with flanking commercial spaces. Built by theater magnate George M. Mann, the theater was designed by noted San Francisco designer William B.

Description The Eureka Theater features a symmetrical stucco facade built of cubic forms rising to a tall vertical pylon sign bearing the letters EUREKA over the theater's marquee. At ground level the lobby entrance is centered between storefronts. The lobby is overhung by a projecting canopy with a rolled edge. A V-shaped attraction board rests on the marquee and appears to support the pylon. The complex pylon mounts in receding block forms as it rises. Although it appears to be a monolith, it is actually supported by a frame structure with a stucco appliqu√©. The second floor features subsidiary blocks with smaller windows and accent lines, housing the owner's apartment. The outer lobby is a shallow semicircle with a mosaic tile floor extending to the sidewalk. The walls have a maroon subway tile wainscot, with chrome tile accent stripes. A large light fixture with chrome accents is centered over the octagonal ticket booth. The booth has tile that matches the outer lobby wainscot. A blue glass pane above the ticket window is designed to be illuminated when the box office is open for business. The lobby is flanked by storefront spaces, whose transom windows are accented by a horizontal grillage. The other elevations are comparatively plain, with large concrete surfaces. The inner foyer is narrow, less than wide, with a number of Art Moderne details. The entrance doors retain their original custom hardware of brass and Bakelite. The ceiling is extensively detailed. The foyer leads to the grand lobby, which is approximately oval, accented by a stepped curving ceiling detail and a central light fixture with multicolored glass. Columns flanking the entrance feature glazed panels that match the light fixture, and which can themselves be illuminated. The Eureka Theater was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 7, 2010.

Born in Glanford he also had two spells at Gainsborough Trinity. Playing career Howlett started his career in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire but was living in Grenoside near Sheffield when Sheffield United placed adverts in the local press announcing the formation of the club and asking for players. Responding to the appeal he was selected as the side's first goalkeeper and remained with the club for five seasons. He appeared in the club's first ever game against Notts Rangers and in their debut FA Cup campaign which saw both the team's biggest ever victory and heaviest ever defeat in the competition, a 13‚Äì0 defeat at the hands of Bolton Wanderers. Howlett had poor eyesight and needed to wear glasses during games and as a consequence tried to avoid being charged by opposition players, often punching away shots instead of catching them, including shots along the ground. During the FA Cup game against Bolton it was reported that he had spent most of the game searching for his glasses in the muddy goalmouth. Despite this Howlett remained first choice keeper for the club's first three seasons but shared goalkeeping duties with Will Lilley for the following two. Following his departure from Bramall Lane Howlett returned to his previous club Gainsborough Trinity where he played for another nine seasons before retiring.

He was the first British Baptist missionary to have started a new station at Puri, Orissa--Baptist Mission was established at Puri, largely due to the efforts of Claudius Buchanan, Vice-Provost of the Fort William College, who visited the town in 1806 - he strongly advocated for an establishment of some Christian institution near the temple, Juggernauth. Early life He was born at Bourne, Lincolnshire, in 1787. After his first twelve years of childhood spent at Bourne and Thirlby, a nearby village, and got his basic learning from village school-masters, he moved to Boston at the age of thirteen. Having been accoustomed with his parents to attend on the ministry of Binns, Baptist Minister at Bourne, he was influenced to attend on the ministry of D. Taylor, a Pastor of the General Baptist Church at Boston; later, was baptised into Christian fellowship, joined the Church, and began preaching occasionally at Swineshead in 1808. From 1809, with superintendence of the affairs of church experience at Boston, he moved to Sutterton in 1811 to work in the ministry as an assistant minister, and after three years at Sutterton he became Minister of the Baptist Church at Goverto, a village nearby to Sutterton. In 1818, he moved to Grand Yarmouth in Norfolk and offered himself to the General Baptist Missionary Society, for missionary service in 1820. With delay in prior designed plans to travel India for missionary service along with William Ward, one of the Serampore Trio, he moved to London in 1820 and attended various courses of lecture, and hospital practice. He was ordained on 15 May 1821 at Loughborough, and sailed to India on 29 May 1821 along with William Ward, James Peggs, fellow-missionary and student at the General Baptist Academy at Wisbeach, and their wives. Missionary work He arrived at Madras(present Chennai on 25 September 1821. From Madras, they travelled to Serampore by 15 November 1821. He along with his fellow missionary James Peggs finally arrived at mission station at Cuttack via Calcutta(present Kolkata) by 12 February 1822. By 1822, Cuttack became a centre of missionary labour with an outstation at Puri‚ÄîIt was largely due to efforts of zealous Christian Claudius Buchanan, who strongly advocated for Christian institution near the temple Juggernaut(colloquial English name for temple Jagannath Temple, Puri - Ratha Yatra temple car), when he visited in 1806 - After his visit to Orissa, he created public opinion in England for sending missionaries to Orissa - By 1812, missionaries started making appeals to British Government for permission - With change in British government policy by 1813, they allowed the missionaries to work in Eastern India, officially - in 1816, New Connexion of General Baptists as a body resolved to do something to enlighten and evangelize the s with knowledge of Christianity. He along with James Peggs, fellow-laborer, were deputed and directed to preach the gospel, superintending native schools, and acquiring the language of Orissa. In September 1823, he and his wife left Cuttack to form a new station at the temple of Jagannath Temple, Puri. On 17 September 1825, Bumpton wrote a letter that speaks the kind of work, he was engaged in day-to-day affairs: He also says \\"On the whole, i never was so happy in the ministry before, and on the whole, i never was so much given up to it.\\" On 31 October 1826, he writes again: In 1825, Bampton metamorphed himself in native dress, but been criticized by other missionaries, and wrote to his friend as Most of the times, his gospel message experienced, an utter rejection. In his own words, addressing his friend in England on 28 March 1827: Between 1828 and 1829, he and his wife spent most of their time in Calcutta, mostly due to ill-health; returned to Puri in autumn of 1829, as his health didn't improve[due to diarrhoea], he died on 17 December 1830 at Puri.

The station opened during the construction of the Main-Lahn Railway () by the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn), initially with a temporary entrance building. The line was opened over its whole length on 15 October 1877. It is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station and is now served only by line S 2 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn. Rail tracks View of the station over the town The line is located in the narrow Lorsbach valley and the resulting topographical limits, set in particular by the Eppstein tunnel, meant that the station was located on the opposite side of the Schwarzbach from the town of Eppstein and had to be connected by a bridge. In fact, the Schwarzbach stream had to be relocated to allow the building of the station. The originally single-track line had a passing loop in the station area and sidings for the parking of rolling stock. The southern track in the station area served freight. The line was prepared from the outset for a second track, but this was delayed until 1914. This required an expansion of the station area: south of the two main tracks two passing tracks were installed. In addition to the ‚Äúhome‚Äù platform (next to the station building) there is now in another island platform with two platform edges. The southern freight track traffic was also redesigned and a new freight hall was built; this was torn down as part of the current construction of a new Eppstein tunnel. In preparation for the opening of the S-Bahn to Niedernhausen the line was electrified and the station area of Eppstein was redeveloped. The building of the new Eppstein tunnel involves changes, including the relocation of the tracks a bit further north than previously and the building of two new platforms and the demolition of the old platforms. Entrance building The original Eppstein station had a temporary, single-story entrance building. Added to this before 1885, was a dormitory building that was demolished in 1971 in preparation for the S-Bahn. In 1903, the temporary entrance building was completely replaced by a building in an historicist style. This building was abandoned in the 1990s; after it had been left largely empty for 10 years, it was taken over by an Eppstein municipal corporation and renovated in 2005. Today it is used for a \\"mobility centre\\", a government shopfront and a restaurant.

Biography  Paunoviƒá was educated in the Serbian Grammar School in Novi Sad (1900‚Äì1908) where he attended his first violin classes. As a final year violin student, he learned at the Conservatory in Prague in 1909. He studied composition with Max Reger at the Conservatory in Leipzig (1909‚Äì1911) and simultaneously attended Hugo Riemann‚Äôs lectures at the University in the same town. He was a choir leader in Ruma and Novi Sad (1913) and in the Academic Singing Society Obiliƒá in Belgrade (1923), a teacher of music in the Male Teaching College in Jagodina (1914; 1918‚Äì1920) and a professor of the Musical School Stankoviƒá (1921‚Äì1922). As a soldier at the Thessalonica front line, he was an active participant in Serbian art in refuge. From 1921 he was a conductor in the Orchestra of the Royal Guard and an officer of the Ministry of the Military where he was successful in improving the material status of army musicians. Paunoviƒá received a Medal of St. Sava of the 4th Order, a Medal of the Romanian Crown of the 5th Degree and the Albanian Certificate of Service. He suddenly died at the age of 35.  Works  Paunoviƒá simultaneously wrote musical and literary works but some of them were destroyed during the First World War. The most important works of his opus are two musical dramas (Divina tragoedia, 1912 and ƒåengiƒá-aga, 1923) and two Yugoslav symphonies (1914‚Äì20; 1924). His preserved piano compositions include early pieces (Praeludim and Ustaj diko, Fugue, Moj ƒçardaƒçe), The Album of piano songs and the unfinished Suite. Also he left several orchestral pieces composed in 1909‚Äì11 (e.g. Serenade, Romance, Ouverture The Death of Jugoviƒá‚Äôs Mother) and one four-mouvement symphonic suite from 1921. He wrote many occasional works (e.g. Wedding March dedicated to king Alexander) that contributed to the elevation of the professional composing in the area of military music. His literary opus consists of seven dramas (People from Sentivan, 1908; Divina tragoedia, 1910; Coastal People, 1911; Devil‚Äôs Tragedy, 1912; Model, 1917; ƒåengiƒá-aga, 1918; Court of Srdja Zlopogledja, 1919) including a short story Dr Witch and many of lyrics and proverbs. Musical and literary works of Paunoviƒá are strongly connected by the same circle of topics and philosophy preoccupations. His musical dramas are based on his own dramatic texts. From the very beginning Paunoviƒá is inspired by the ideas and compositional aspects of Wagner‚Äôs music that could be more or less observed in his dramas, musical dramas, early orchestral works and symphonies. The influence of Nietzsche, especially the part of his philosophy related to the criticism of Christianity, is primarily evident in his dramas. This fact caused him to become close to the spiritual climate which denoted early expressionist impulses in Serbian literature around World War I. His musical art is rooted in late Romantic tradition of the German type, including the elements of the same but younger, Modernistic heritage. These stylistic dimensions have its own physiognomy in works after 1914 when he expresses himself through the communication with elements of the Serbian musical folklore.Milanoviƒá 2006a Musical dramas and symphonies of Paunoviƒá mark a sudden professional and creative leap in relation to previous compositional practice in Serbian music. His first musical drama, one-act Divina tragoedia, already demonstrates his successful approach to the main postulates of the Wagnerian concept. Composer omitted choruses and ensembles, and based the structure on dialogues and monologues, carefully organised leitmotiv and a densely symphonic orchestral texture, with the harmonic language closest to Der fliegende Holl√§der. The libretto was grounded on blasphemous treatment of theme about Christ's resurrection perverted into fraud, so that the first musical drama in the Serbian musical history has got one specific avant-garde dimension.Milanoviƒá 2006c Paunoviƒá titled both of his symphonies in relation to the Yugoslav ideology. Thus, the genre stands as a signifier of current national identity construction in the context of the then newly formed state. At the same time, the subtitle of the first symphony On Lipar shows his prevailing moments of introspection led by the poetry of ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá. Composer writes his own programme discourse and turned himself to the philosophical topics of his other works, that he kept returning to, thinking about destiny, alienation, love and peace under the general umbrella of nature. Both of his symphonies are based on a cyclic principle and monothematism. Paunoviƒá creates a type of non-standard, three-part symphonic cycle with the final movement signed by the folk character the dance kolo. Like Mahler, he uses stereotypical illustrative elements (imitations of the cuckoo) in his first symphony and turns these into abstract musical material that is given the role of a monothematic nucleus, incorporating it thus into the very structure of the work. The similar approach is evident related to musical quotation as well as to self quotation which has an important function in his second symphony. Paunoviƒá develops a special variation treatment of folklore. The folk music in his symphonies and second musical drama goes through various stages of transformation ranging from folk-sounding to the abstract, from dance character to the powerful drama. Such approach makes the heterogeneous musical material to become –∞ part of the integral sound corpus and a potent tool of the musical dramaturgy.Milanoviƒá 2002a Paunoviƒá's works are rarely published and performed. Musical facilities of local context at the time when his first musical drama appeared were not sufficiently developed to perform a work with a predominantly quadruple woodwind symphonic orchestra. On the other side, the death of the composer interrupted his work on instrumentation of musical drama ƒåengiƒá-aga and of the second symphony. Among his significant works only the first symphony was presented (in Ljubljana 1924 and Belgrade 1925, 1932, 1940, 1956), but its successful performances did not affect more permanent reception of his work.Milanoviƒá 2006b Almost forgotten by decades, Paunoviƒá's opus has become the topic of the recent musicological studies. The publishing of his first symphony (2009) is a part of the same endeavors, too.

But few eyes beheld that little band of men risking life and health through the long nights. bringing the boats to Washington. A large portion of New Jersey Route 29 is named the Daniel Bray Highway in honor of Captain Bray's vital role in this critical phase of the Revolutionary War. In 1903 Joseph F. Folsom wrote \\"The Ballad of Daniel Bray\\", which is printed in \\"Patriotic Poems of New Jersey\\" compiled by W. C. Armstrong, and in \\"Historic Trenton\\" by Louise Hewitt. Author: Rev. Joseph F. Folsom \\"Many patriots who in the long struggle did less for their country's freedom than Daniel Bray are to-day more honored and sung, although he, through many perils, gathered by night the fleet of boats by which Washington crossed the icy Delaware. Even had the battle of Trenton proved a disaster for the Americans, instead of the glorious victory it actually became, the dangerous descent of the swiftly flowing river, from the mouth of the Lehigh to Malta Island, a journey of fifty miles through long wintry nights, accomplished by Captain Bray and his compatriots, should at least give his name a place beside those of Paul Revere, Sergeant Jasper and Molly Pitcher.\\" After the war, Daniel Bray, like Cincinnatus, went back to being a Hunterdon County farmer, on his homestead farm in Kingwood Township. He and his wife Mary Woolverton already had four children by the end of the war.

His masterwork was a set of illustrations for Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. Early years Armand Rassenfosse was born in Li√®ge on 6 August 1862. For generations his family had run a store selling home furnishings and decorative art works: crystal, porcelain, bronze and oriental rugs. Armand was expected to continue the family business. However, for the last years of his secondary education he went to Namur to study, living with his uncle, who gave him a few etchings by F√©licien Rops from his collection. Already interested in art from his family background, he became intrigued with etching. After completing secondary school Rassenfosse joined the family business. Auguste Donnay, whom Rassenfosse's father had hired to decorate a home, became a friend of Armand and introduced him to other students of the Academy of Fine Arts in Liege including Gustave Serrurier, √âmile Berchmans and Oscar Berchmans. Unknown to his family, by 1882 Rassenfosse was contributing drawings signed \\"Zig\\" to the satirical journal Le Frondeur, and was experimenting with etching using crude tools. In 1884 he married. The same year he showed his work to Adrien de Witte, an art teacher at the Li√®ge Academy of Fine Arts. de Witte encouraged him to try out new techniques, including pyrography. This is a decorative technique in which a line drawing is burned into the wood. He made his first painting this year. In 1886, he began contributing illustrations to the magazine Wallonia. Poster for the Grande Brasserie Van Velsen fr√®res In 1887 Rassenfosse started to submit work to August B√©nard, who had just founded his printing house in Liege. Over the years Rassenfosse would make many works for this house that he considered run of the mill, although some passed the test of time among the best of his works. At the age of 25 Rassenfosse was in Paris on family business and was introduced to Felicien Rops, his first inspiration, who was then at the height of his career. This was the start of a long friendship between the two men, who shared a common search for technical mastery in etching. Etching techniques Rassenfosse was always interested in improved techniques. He only began to etch at the age of twenty-seven, but later became distinguished for his mastery of the different skills and techniques of engraving. Around 1890 Rassenfosse developed a new recipe for a special ink for etching, an ink that can be dissolved to expose the metal of the plate. Felicien Rops had been an early adopter of soft ground etching, using several types of paper in a single plate. Rassenfosse worked with him to develop a special soft ground mixture for reworking intaglio plates to which crayon drawings had been transferred photomechanically. The formula, which they called \\"Ropsenfosse\\", was finalized in 1892. Later, Rassenfosse may have been the first to make color prints from soft ground, using two or more plates. Around 1923 he developed a new technique that eliminated the problem of printing a mirror image. He drew on smooth paper with the special ink, then laid the paper over the plate and ran it through the press to transfer the ink to the plate. He offset the drawing, powdered the plate with zinc oxide or whiting and coated the plate with a very thin layer of varnish. When treated with acid the effect was to create crayon-like lines. Full-time artist 1909 Frontispiece for Le Solitaire de la lune by Fran√ßois de Curel (1854‚Äì1928) At the age of twenty-eight Rassenfosse decided to leave the family business and devote himself entirely to art. His work for B√©nard provided a living, and B√©nard also introduced him to the practice of lithography. In 1896, he became an intern under Jules Ch√©ret, a lithographer known for his high-quality artistic posters, at the Chaix printing works in Paris. The same year he exhibited in the third salon of \\"La Libre Esthetique\\" in Brussels. From then on his reputation continued to grow, with more exhibitions and commissions, particularly for publications. Rassenfosse illustrated the supplement to the 1895 catalog of Rops' engravings published by Eugene Rodrigues in 1895. Between 1899 and 1901, Rassenfosse undertook a major contract with Rodrigues's \\"Societe des Cent Bibliophiles\\" to illustrate Charles Baudelaire's poems Les Fleurs du mal. He created 160 color etchings for the book. The book was published in an edition of only 130 copies. It is not only the magnum opus of Armand Rassenfosse, but is also generally considered one of the highlights in the field of book illustration. Rassenfosse was appointed Secretary of the Section of Fine Arts as part of the Li√®ge International Expo 1905, and a member of the administrative committee of the Liege Academy of Fine Arts. He participated in several international exhibitions in 1906. When B√©nard died in 1907 he had to undertake greater responsibilities with the printing house, leaving him less time for artistic work, leading to a temporary period of stagnation. The death of his son in 1913 and the rigors of World War I caused another crisis. In response he locked himself away for days at a time, absorbed in his work. He began to work with oil on cardboard, with a smoother, more confident technique. Many of his paintings at this time were of women, mostly nudes in an intimate setting, but he also portrayed dancers in the rich scenery of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes or dancers in the style of Isadora Duncan. He was interested in the theme of \\"hiercheuses\\", as the young girls and women from the Liege coal industry were called. In some of his portraits of these women Rassenfosse depicts them as partly nude trollops, reflecting the traditional view of working women as being sexually promiscuous. The paintings showed them as younger and more attractive than the reality. After the war ended, Rassenfosse continued to research new techniques of engraving and producing bookplates, and continued to make many illustrations for books. He received numerous titles and awards, including Commander of the Order of Leopold. Rassenfosse died in Liege on 28 January 1934. A bronze bust of Rassenfosse, executed by his friend Pierre-F√©lix Masseau, stands in the Parc de la Boverie.  Honours  * 1931: Grand Officer in the Order of the Crown (Belgium).

One author has said, for example, that while Rops portrayed courtesans, Rassenfosse depicted the daughters of working people. In his intimate nude studies the women have natural elegance, but are not purely objects of desire, as Rops would have made them. However, talking of Rassenfosse's earlier work another writer said that in his advertisements he and others of the time \\"exploited the image of the sensuous, beautiful young woman ... in a serenely dreamy state ... the stylised embodiment of temptation...\\"  Gallery  File:Salon affiche 2 Rassenfosse.jpgPosted for Salon des Cent exhibition in 1896 File:Rassenfosse.JPG1899 illustration for 'Promesses d'un visage' in Charles Baudelaire's 'Les Fleurs du mal' File:Armand Rassenfosse (1862-1934).jpgPoyette (1912) File:Le peignoir jaune (1912).jpgLe peignoir jaune (1912) File:Le bonnet hongrois (1914).jpgLe bonnet hongrois (1914) File:La marchande masque (1917).jpgLa marchande de masques (1917) File:Femme √† l'√©ponge .jpgFemme √† l'√©ponge File:Rassenfosse, Armand - Ex Libris E R, 1921.jpgErotic bookplate (1921) References ;Citations ;Sources   * External links *Maurice Des Ombiaux \\"Quatre Artistes Li√©geois.

Whilst the Stirling Prize celebrates the big and the bold, the capacity of The Stephen Lawrence Prize to celebrate the craft, skill and invention of smaller schemes continues to inspire. I am tremendously proud to look back on the projects that have been given special recognition by the Prize.

His family had weekly musical evenings, in which the boy took part at a very early age. As a teenager he played the guitar in various bands in North London pubs. In the mid-sixties, Marshall left England to go to Paris. There, he met the American drummer Alvin Sykes, a nephew of Cab Calloway, with whose band he toured the whole of Europe for some years. After that he made numerous appearances for the American Special Services (Entertainment) as the guitarist accompanying many American artists engaged to entertain the US troops. Among these were Big Mama Thornton, Dinah Washington, Ben E. King and Brook Benton. In 1972 he settled down for some years in Amsterdam, taking part in the very active jazz scene there.

At the time when Brown was developing his style, many dancers in Omaha were dancing to swing music. This music consisted of fairly slow tempos, and the dancers were able to fit more beats into each bar of music. As Brown began to understand this style of tap dancing, he realized that it all came down to rhythm. After performing with Robinson, Brown danced successfully as a soloist for years and developed his signature style. He was a master of improvisation, and his dances were filled with syncopated steps and complex patterns. The specific style of tap that he performed and later taught to students was called ‚Äúscientific rhythm.‚Äù Brown explained, ‚ÄúYou heard all this music and rhythm but couldn‚Äôt see where it was coming from.‚ÄùHill, Constance V.

New Faubourg Lafitte is a residential development in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.A.. It largely occupies the area formerly filled by the since demolished Lafitte Projects public housing. In 2011, the first homes were constructed on a 27-acre site between the Trem√©/Lafitte and Tulane-Gravier neighborhoods of New Orleans. The project includes the replacement of subsidized housing from the old Lafitte housing project with affordable new homes on a redeveloped site, as well as the addition of 900-1000 units that will be constructed on infill lots in adjacent neighborhoods. The homes range in size and cost, and 600 new units will be for sale for working families and first-time homeowners. The new construction reflects the character of the existing communities, and is a result of the mobilization of a spirited local residential council in response to a HUD mandate that their homes be demolished in the wake of two devastating hurricanes. This project exemplifies local groups taking action, the preservation of cultural character, and the pursuit of environmental justice in a city that is rebuilding from the ground up in the wake of disaster.  History  = History of the Trem√© neighborhood = The Carondolet Canal (since filled in) formerly was a barrier marking the upriver boundary of the Trem√© section of New Orleans. The area formerly occupied by the canal and multiple railroad tracks has been repurposed as a linear park, the Lafitte Greenway. It is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, and has a rich and dynamic past. Historically, its residents were primarily free people of color; today, it remains an important core of the city's African-American and Cr√©ole cultures. The original \\"Old Treme\\" ran from Rampart to Claiborne; additional area lakewards from Claiborne is sometimes considered \\"New Treme\\" (dating from later in the 19th century). It has long been known as one of the city's centers of musical culture. \\" Trem√©/Lafitte\\" is a comparatively recent designation by the New Orleans City Planning Commission; a sub-district of the Mid-City District of New Orleans, and is bounded by Esplanade Avenue to the north, St. Louis Street to the south, North Rampart Street to the east and North Broad Street to the west. Numbering among the cultural landmarks in the area are institutions like the New Orleans African American Museum, the Mahalia Jackson Theatre and Armstrong Park. It is home to the Zulu Social and Pleasure Club and the Mardi Super Krewe. = Hurricane damage: Both tangible and intangible = In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, and was followed in September by a second hurricane of the same caliber, Hurricane Rita. The severity of the physical damage was exacerbated by the comparable damage to the political and social infrastructure. Hurricane Katrina brought about a terrible loss of life, and many who did not lose their lives still suffered devastating blows to their homes and livelihoods; it was perhaps the deadliest natural disaster in the US since 1928, and the most expensive in the country's history. While the active 2005 Atlantic hurricane season has raised ecological questions about the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones, Hurricane Katrina has elicited further inquiries of a more political nature. Such disastrous results despite adequate warnings from the US National Hurricane Center led to concerns about complex socio-economic issues. Two factors ultimately influence vulnerability to hurricanes: event incidence and societal infrastructure. While one is the product of nature, the other is totally within the control of man and consequently subject to its due scrutiny. More than a million people were displaced by the storm, and consequently both public sector institutions and private sector relief organizations were unable to match the high level of need. The strain was felt socially and culturally, as people were removed from their communities and separated from their households and extended families. Ethnic tensions, too, surfaced to a greater degree. Because of the failure of public authorities to adequately prepare for the disaster, poor, predominantly Black communities ultimately bore the brunt of the damages. Furthermore, recovery policies in many ways reinforced discriminatory practices, and the city's poor black residents were often not seen as having a place in the \\"new\\" New Orleans that officials hoped would rise from the blank slate left in Katrina's wake. In many instances, public authorities have not only failed to rebuild homes in some of the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods, but policies adopted by such organizations as HANO and HUD have seemingly been purposefully designed to prevent members of poor communities from returning home. The availability in New Orleans of affordable housing, which was not adequate before Hurricane Katrina, was greatly reduced by the storm. 142,000 housing units were damaged by the hurricane, and of those, 112,000 (79%) were officially considered affordable for low-income residents. In 2008, three years after the storm, only 8,900 affordable housing units had been funded for redevelopment. Additionally, HANO, with the support of HUD, instituted a campaign of systematically demolishing public housing projects that survived the hurricane in conditions that were relatively intact. This purposeful destruction of homes on top of the already great losses caused by the hurricane was costly in both social and monetary senses. The thousands of units that were demolished (at price tag of well over $700 million) were to be replaced by mixed-income housing, to be put up at an additional cost. This inequity against poor communities violates a myriad of human rights principles, including environmental protection, health, and education rights. It is, in particular, a violation of the right to housing that exists even in international law, and acknowledges the fundamental need for safety and security that all people have. This right to housing extends beyond simply four walls and a roof that protect one from the elements; it implies a need for the connections that people make to a place and to each other within a community. In addition to losing their homes and communities, many of the city's poor residents, and in particular those who lived in public housing, were excluded from the decision- making process with respect to rebuilding; they have had few opportunities to participate in decisions in which they are necessarily very much invested any tangible or meaningful way.  The New Faubourg Lafitte Project  = Goals and guiding principles for the New Faubourg Lafitte Project = The development of the new Faubourg Lafitte neighborhood stands contrary to many of the impediments to achieving balanced and appropriate redevelopment in the city. One major goal for the project was a one-for-one replacement of each pre-Katrina subsidized apartment with a comparable apartment in the same community. This would be done with a guaranteed opportunity for former Lafitte residents to return to their neighborhood. The design team also hoped to engage the residents in active participation so that they could make meaningful contributions to the planning process for the redevelopment. Also included in the goals for the projects is the provision of community supportive services for all residents. Thus far, counseling and direct assistance has been provided for hundreds of former Lafitte families living both locally and across the country. The project was planned with safety in mind. The integral public spaces are both clearly defined and overlooked by housing so as to promote security. The houses feature porches and large windows, which, while also being architecturally consistent with the character of the neighborhood, also provide a sense of residents being able to watch the street. There is even a type of sentinel building that was designed to flank the lane access to parking that occurs within the blocks to provide an additional sense of security in the semi-private areas. In terms of sustainability, the project is designed to meet Enterprise Green Communities criteria. This is the only national standard for green affordable housing in the country. Lighting and ventilation adhere to the strict energy efficient standards for wall assemblies and HVAC systems, and all homes and apartments feature Energy Star appliances. The project team also looked to adhere to a number of charter principles from the Congress for New Urbanism. These include (among many others): 13\\\\. Within neighborhoods, a broad range of housing types and price levels can bring people of diverse ages, races, and incomes into daily interaction. 16\\\\. Concentrations of civic, institutional, and commercial activity should be embedded in neighborhoods and districts. 21\\\\. The revitalization of urban places depends on safety and security. The design of streets and buildings should reinforce safe environments, but not at the expense of accessibility and openness. 26\\\\. All buildings should provide their inhabitants with a clear sense of location, weather, and time. 27\\\\. Preservation and renewal of historic buildings, districts, and landscapes which affirm the continuity and evolution of urban society. These goals for New Urbanism were achieve through design decisions like the retention of trees and the reuse of some historic structures as civic buildings (27), or the inclusion of affordable and subsidized housing, and plans for a senior building to be erected in the next phase of development (13). The amenities described for the housing units also fall neatly in line with these goals. They include spacious, open floors, Energy Star appliances, (including refrigerators, dishwashers, washers, and dryers), energy efficient central heat and air conditioning, off-street parking, front porches, balconies, back yards, community gardens, extensive landscaping, 100 year oaks, proximity to the Lafitte Greenway. = A collaborative effort = A particularly impassioned residential council has been instrumental in the redevelopment effort and level of community involvement; they perpetuated an attitude of hope and the belief that a better home - and consequently a better life - was possible. After five years, during which time the wills of residents, federal mandates, advocacy groups, and preservation and design politics aligned, the first homes have been constructed. The project was generated in collaboration with the residents, and their needs, and their input were taken into consideration on many levels. Project manager Don Kaliszewski said that the planning of the new Faubourg Lafitte was informed by meetings with former Lafitte residents in New Orleans, Atlanta, and Houston. He recalled that the residents expressed desires to live in \\"houses,\\" not \\"buildings,\\" and that in particular they were more inclined towards the types of detached houses that are found surrounding the 6th Ward neighborhood. The residents talked about the significance of community, and shared their fond childhood memories of walking down streets lined with houses with large windows and porches where they felt safe because they were among people they knew. The streets of these memories were lost to housing projects that were made up of super-block and that had internal greens and little street frontage. During the design process, members of the community were invited to join the charettes, and even some children attended with their parents. Magic Street, a green feature that spans the entire site, is so named because it honors the hope seen by the children whose drawings served as the basis for its inspiration. Plans and elevations were developed for various housing types, and then large-scale versions were pinned to a gymnasium wall where neighborhood participants were asked to place green dots on the housing types they liked, and red dots on those that they disliked. Single and double houses received the most green dots, and the drawings for proposed shot-guns and long rows of attached houses and apartments were less desirable to the residents. Additionally, the houses that resembled the traditional houses in Trem√© received green dots, while those that seemed out of character (because they were either avant-garde or non-Trem√© styles) received red dots. In this way, the people who were the most invested in the outcome of the project, in a more substantial way than public authorities, anonymous federal agencies, or even the designers, were given a say in shaping the neighborhood. They were also the possessors of unique insights into the problems and solutions for the neighborhood, and their input would certainly help to create a more successful project for all parties involved. One example of this is that a concern about safe parking expressed in charettes led to the creation of blocks with interior parking courts. These courts - which became elevated above grade in the design - were integrated into solutions to the requirements by FEMA for entrances to be up to four feet above ground level, a mandate which had posed challenges in designing with respect to accessibility. = Architectural character = While the buildings are unmistakably new, every effort was made to create a seamless continuity with the existing character of the place that is so integral a reflection of its rich culture and history; the buildings are made to look as if they had always been there. A myriad of colors, historic details, and building orientations are used to suggest organic growth of the neighborhood. Elements such as arched neoclassical pediments and paired columns on the porches additionally imply that the neighborhood has historic ties. After a careful study of the architectural patterns that exist in the area, characteristic features that were strategically used in the new buildings included tall windows, narrow front porches, large cornices with brackets on the front facades, siding and a variety of colors. The street plan has been restored to the original grid of circulating traffic, and the cul-de-sacs are being removed. The houses have the same relationship to the sidewalks as in Trem√©: the porches are close to the sidewalk with small front gardens. In order to achieve a truer and more traditional neighborhood as opposed to another set of housing projects, the design incorporates a variety of building types. Each block makes use of a combination of types, which include double houses that look like large houses, single camelback houses and double camelback houses, cottages, and small apartment buildings that are similar in appearance to the grand houses on Esplanade Ave. Additionally, there is a focus in the plan of development around existing schools, emphasizing education as a means of emphasizing their integral role within a strong the community. = Development and funding = The developers for the project are Providence Community Housing, Enterprise Community Partners, and L&M; Development. The master plan for the neighborhood was designed by Urban Design Associates of Pittsburgh. The budget for the first phase of the project, which included 134 units, was $32 million, and the units average between 740 and 1,470 square feet. The Lafitte redevelopment project is being financed by a myriad of sources. Funding comes from a combination of low-income housing tax credits provided by the Louisiana Housing Finance Agency, community development block grant funds from the Louisiana Office of Community Development, HUD capital grant dollars, and additional public and private sources. Goldman Sachs and Iberiabank have become the primary construction lenders for the redevelopment project. = Reception = The New York Times Editorial Board wrote that \\"the Lafitte design shows that it is possible to satisfy the need to replace destroyed public housing and to create vibrant new communities of mixed incomes.\\" From a more local perspective, New Orleans architect Steve Bingler, a consultant on the Iberbeille redesign project and a contributor to Brad Pitt's Make It Right development in the Lower 9th Ward, offered a hopeful commentary about the projects. While he asserted that it would be impossible to conclusively assess the project before its completion, it exhibited careful studies of nuanced archetypes and avoided mere cartoons of them. The architectural styles of the Make It Right houses in no way try to imitate the character of the buildings around them, but Bingler conceded that if one is going to make a copy of something, it is best to do it as authentically as possible. The project has also received some more critical responses. Even some residents have expressed skepticism because of what they had heard about a discrepancy that can exist between what New Urbanists plan to do and what they actually do. They also found something unnatural about a place being planned all at once. = The role of New Urbanism = New Urbanism seeks to redress the economic, environmental and social costs of urban sprawl. It is about reviving traditional typologies and patterns, and creating a balance of land uses, household types, building and architectural types, and socioeconomic and age groups. Its governing ideals include the promotion of walking, bicycling, and public transportation through a cohesive network of streets, paths, greenways, and waterways, and the creation of denser, clearly bounded communities that preserve open spaces and natural systems. These principles also look to strengthen the public realm by encouraging and facilitating interaction between people. Additionally, its principles promote diversity within a community, rather than separation based on socioeconomic factors. While city planning is such a dynamic and intricate undertaking that it is hard to ensure success, New Urbanism is based on principles that promote strong communities. The implications of this on social and political spheres, as well as on health, education and happiness can be great.

Local health departments may be entities of local or state government and often report to a mayor, city council, county board of health or county commission. There are approximately 2,800 local health departments across the United States. These city, county, metropolitan, district, and tribal departments work every single day to ensure the safety of the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. Members of a community may not always see the work done by local health departments, but people live healthier lives and are safer because of the work of local health departments. Local health departments help create and maintain conditions in communities that support healthier choices in areas such as diet, exercise, and tobacco. They lead efforts that prevent and reduce the effects of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. They detect and stop outbreaks of diseases like measles, tuberculosis, and foodborne illnesses. They protect children and adults from infectious diseases through immunization. Local health departments also conduct programs that are shown to effectively make communities healthier. Some local health departments programs include:NACCHO naccho.org, May 2012 *Helping ensure clean drinking water, access to safe and healthy foods, and children‚Äôs safety through use of car seats. *Enforcing laws and regulations that keep people safe (e.g. smoke-free air laws, restaurant inspections, water and sewer treatment, etc.). *Tracking, investigating and stopping diseases and other public health threats (e.g. foodborne illness, HIV/AIDS, etc.). *Developing emergency plans and responding to disasters when they strike (e.g. bioterrorism, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, etc.). *Mobilizing community partners to work together to address local public health challenges (e.g. a lack of safe places for kids to play after school, limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables, etc.). *Inspecting restaurants, community farmers‚Äô markets, street fair vendors, and other venues where the public gathers to eat. *Informing the public about health problems in the community and how to stay safe. Local health departments play a central role in providing essential public health services in communities that fall into the following ten categories: #Monitor health status to identify and solve community health problems. #Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community. #Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues. #Mobilize community partnerships and action to identify and solve health problems. #Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts. #Enforce laws and regulations that protect health and ensure safety. #Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of healthcare when otherwise unavailable. #Assure competent public and personal healthcare workforce. #Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services. #Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems.

At the age of 14, he and his twin brother, the future Archimandrite Elpidios, left their home to become monks at the Stavrovouni Monastery in Cyprus where they stayed for 6 years and then left for the Holy Land to continue their monastic life and attended the local High School. He was ordained a priest and became a trusted priest of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, later being raised to the office of archimandrite. In 1979, he was assigned as the guardian of the Monastery of Jacob's Well. Death Philoumenos was murdered on 29 November 1979. His assailant, Asher Raby (spelled \\"Rabi\\" in some newspaper accounts), a mentally ill 37-year-old resident of Tel Aviv, had intruded the monastery and threw a hand grenade inside, which caused substantial damage. Philoumenos is said by investigators to have been fleeing the explosion and fire caused by the grenade when he was pursued by Raby and hit multiple times with an axe. Investigators stated that Philoumenos appeared to have been trying to protect his face with his hands when a blow to his face or head severed the one finger on each hand. Raby escaped the scene of the crime undetected. Raby was subsequently found to have acted alone, \\"without any connection to a religious or political entity.\\"David Gurevich, and Yisca Harani. \\"Philoumenos of Jacob's Well: The Birth of a Contemporary Ritual Murder Narrative.\\" Israel Studies, vol. 22, no. 2, 2017, pp. 26‚Äì54. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/israelstudies.22.2.02. An investigation launched by the Israeli police initially failed to identify the killer. Raby was arrested on 17 November 1982 as he again attempted enter the Monastery at Jacob's Well illicitly by climbing over a wall; he was carrying hand grenades. Raby supplied the police with accurate details of his earlier, previously unsolved, crimes. These were the murder of Philoumenos; a March 1979 murder of a Jewish gynecologist in Tel-Aviv; the murder of the family of a woman in Lod, Israel in April 1979 who claimed to have clairvoyant powers; and an assault on a nun at the Jacob's Well holy site in April 1982. The nun was seriously wounded in the attack. Both she and the gynecologist were attacked by axe, according to prosecutors. Raby, a newly religious Jew, was described as unwashed, dressed in worn-out clothing, and audibly muttered passages of scripture in a strange manner. Psychiatric evaluations found that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial; he and committed to a mental hospital; details of his subsequent whereabouts are restricted by privacy regulations. At a court hearing after his arrest, an Israeli prosecutor told the court that Raby was convinced that the monastery was the site of the ancient Jewish Temple, and that he made an attempt on the life of the nun \\"in response to a divine command.\\" =Erroneous accounts= Initial accounts depicted the murder as an anti-Christian hate attack carried out by a group of Jewish settlers, the result was what Maariv described as \\"a wave of hatred\\" in Greece. Reports indicating that \\"radical Jews\\" had tortured Philoumenos and \\"cut off the fingers of his hand\\" before killing him had appeared in Greek newspapers. Maariv also quoted an official in the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem asserting that \\"the murder was carried out by radical religious Jews\\" claiming that \\"the Well does not belong to Christians but to Jews\\". In a 2017 article in the journal Israel Studies, researchers David Gurevich and Yisca Harani found that false accounts blaming the slaying on \\"settlers\\" and \\"Zionist extremists\\" persisted even after the arrest of the assailant and his confinement in a mental institution, and that there were \\"patterns of ritual murder accusation in the popular narrative.\\" The same theme was echoed in parts of the Eastern Orthodox community and by some secular sources, including Blackwell's Dictionary of Eastern Christianity, the Encyclopedia of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, The Spectator and Times Literary Supplement, as well as wikipedia. Gurevich and Harani contended that a 1989 account of the murder, published in Orthodox America, a publication of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, became the basis of an anti-Semitic ritual murder narrative, according to which a group of anti-Christianity Jews first harassed Philoumenos and destroyed Christian holy objects at the monastery, then murdered him.  Veneration  In 2009 the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem recognised him as a holy martyr of the Eastern Orthodox Church, thirty years after his martyrdom. The \\"careful\\" wording of the pronouncement of the Jerusalem Patriarchate that canonized Philoumenos makes no mention of murderer's faith or ethnicity; he is described as a \\"vile man\\" a \\"heterodox fanatic visitor\\" and, inaccurately, as an individual who \\"with an axe, opened a deep cut across his forehead, cut off the fingers of his right hand, and upon escaping threw a grenade which ended the Father's life.\\" Philoumenos was buried in Jerusalem in the Orthodox cemetery on Mt. Zion. Veneration extended to an alleged exhumation of Philoumenos' body four years after his death by members of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem who testified that Patriarch Diodoros confirmed that the body was \\"producing a pleasant fragrance\\" and that \\"the rest of the body was incorrupt.\\" The body was translated from the cemetery on Mt. Zion to the newly rebuilt pilgrimage church at Jacob's Well in 2008. Philoumenos' relics have traveled to locations including his home island of Cyprus where they have been venerated. A new church in Nicosia, Cyprus, was dedicated to Philoumenos in 2004. In 2008 reports of an anti-Semitic painting in Cyprus' Machairas Monastery that shows a stereotyped image of an ultra- orthodox Jew about to attack Philoumenos with an ax produced a promise from Cypriot Church authorities that the painting would be altered to remove the antisemitic imagery; as of 2016 it was still unaltered.

The city was founded in early 4th century after Goguryeo conquered the area, and received its name from a Han dynasty prefecture of the same name. The ruins of the city are identified with a site at Yingchengzi (), to the southeast of Haicheng. Ansi was a major city of the Goguryeo and the scene of a major siege and battle between the Goguryeo and Tang dynasty China in 645 AD.  Siege of Ansi  First campaign in the Goguryeo-Tang War. The Goguryeo controlled an area that covered the north part of the Korean Peninsula, most of Liaoyang and Jilin province in modern China and part of what is now Primorsky Krai in Russia. They neighboured Silla to the south and China to the west. In 643 AD, the Goguryeo attacked Silla who then appealed to the Chinese emperor for help. In response, Emperor Taizong of Tang sent an army to attack the Goguryeo in 645. This invasion was initially successful with the capture of Liaodong and Baicun Goguryeo cities by the Tang. Following this victory, there was discussion as to whether to march directly to Pyongyang, the Goguryeo capital city, or to face the Goguryeo army in the Liaodong region. After the battle of Mount Zhubi, the Goguryeo fell back on their city of Ansi and the Tang army pursued. Emperor Taizong next prepared to put Ansi under siege, but he had reservations about it. When he discussed the matter with Li Shiji, he stated: (The name of the defending general of Ansi has been lost to history, but is traditionally rendered in Korean popular accounts as Yang Manchun, even though some Korean historical sources indicated that the name was lost.) Li Shiji disagreed, however, arguing that as Geonan was to Ansi's south and that the main Tang food supply was coming from Liaodong, that if he attacked Geonan first, the defenders of Ansi would try to cut his supply lines. Emperor Taizong agreed, and Li Shiji began to siege Ansi. When Emperor Taizong and Li Shiji arrived at Ansi, it was said that the Ansi defenders, upon seeing the banner of the Tang emperor, began to yell insults from the walls. Emperor Taizong was insulted, and Li Shiji received permission to slaughter the city's male inhabitants when it fell‚Äîwhich led to the Ansi defenders fighting even harder. Li Shiji was unable to capture the city for some time. Go Yeonsu and Go Hyezin, who had by now accepted Tang titles, suggested: Some other officials also suggested: Emperor Taizong was inclined to accept these proposals, but Zhangsun opposed, stating: Emperor Taizong agreed with Zhangsun and did not head toward Ogol. As the siege continued, on an occasion, when Emperor Taizong heard the sounds of chickens and pigs coming out of the city, he opined to Li Shiji that it must be that the Goguryeo defenders were preparing an assault and were slaughtering animals beforehand to feast on them. Li Shiji therefore prepared for a night assault, which came that very night. Emperor Taizong himself led soldiers to repel the assault, and the Goguryeo forces withdrew within the city again. Meanwhile, Li Daozong was building a dirt mound to the southeast of the city to use as an attack mechanism, and in response, the Ansi defenders added to the height of the wall to the southeast. This process continued for 60 days, and eventually, the dirt mound got so high that from it, one could easily see inside the city. Li Daozong had his officer Fu Fu'ai () take position on the dirt mound. Suddenly, the mound had a partial collapse and fell onto the city walls, and the walls collapsed as well. At this moment, Fu, for reasons unexplained in history, left his position, and the Goguryeo forces took the opportunity to attack and capture the dirt mound, and instead used it as part of the defensive bulwarks. Emperor Taizong, in anger, executed Fu in public and ordered a heavy assault on the dirt mound, but could not capture it within three days. Li Daozong bared his feet and begged punishment, but Emperor Taizong pardoned him. Meanwhile, winter was approaching, and the grass was drying up. Also, the food supplies were running out. On October 13, 645,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Emperor Taizong ordered a withdrawal. He gave a demonstration ceremony next to Ansi before withdrawing. In popular culture The 2018 South Korean film The Great Battle is based on the battle of Ansi Fortress in 645 AD.

It was the heart of the Seraphimite Church. Founded in Winnipeg, it had no affiliation with any church in Europe. Ukrainian immigrants began arriving in Canada in 1891 mainly from the Austro-Hungarian provinces, the regions of Bukovyna and Galicia. The new arrivals from Bukovyna were Eastern Orthodox, those from Galicia Eastern Catholic. In either case it was the Byzantine Rite with which they were familiar. By 1903 the Ukrainian immigrant population in Western Canada had become large enough to attract the attention of religious leaders, politicians, and educationalists.  Principals  Cyril Genik (1857‚Äì1925) The central character in the Ukrainian community in Winnipeg at the time was Cyril Genik (1857‚Äì1925). He came from Galicia, having graduated from the Ukrainian Academic Gymnasium in Lviv and studied law briefly at the University of Chernivtsi.Martynowych, Orest T. Ukrainians in Canada: The Formative Period, 1891-1924. Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press, University of Alberta, Edmonton, 1991, page 170. Genik was a friend of Ivan Franko, the Ukrainian author of \\"–õ–∏—Å –ú–∏–∫–∏—Ç–∞\\" (Fox Mykyta)Franko, Ivan; Kurelek, William; Melnyk, Bohdan (1978). Fox Mykyta. Tundra Books, Montreal. . who was nominated for the Nobel Prize In Literature. Franko's biting satire on the Western Ukrainian clergy of his day and his socialist leanings were probably shared by Genik who happened to be best man at the author's wedding. Freeing the populace of the clergy, along with land reform, was a way to free the peasantry from the yoke of absentee-landlords who maintained control of the land with the collusion of the hierarchy of the church. Upon his arrival in Canada, Genik became the first Ukrainian to be employed by the Canadian government, and worked as an immigration agent taking new settlers out to their homesteads. Genik's cousin Ivan Bodrug (1874‚Äì1952) and Bodrug's friend Ivan Negrich (1875‚Äì1946) also came from the village of Bereziv in the county of Kolomyia and were qualified as primary school teachers in Galicia. These three men constituted the nucleus of the intelligentsia in the Ukrainian community, and were known as the \\"–ë–µ—Ä–µ–∑—ñ–≤—Å—å–∫–∞ –¢—Ä—ñ–π—Ü—è\\" ( Berezivs'ka Triitsya) (the \\"Bereziv Triumvirate\\"). Genik, the oldest, was the only one of the three already married. His wife Pauline (n√©e Tsurkowsky) was the daughter of a priest, an educated woman, and they had three sons and three daughters. The other principal character was Bishop Seraphim, whose real name was Stefan Ustvolsky. Ustvolsky ended by being defrocked by the Russian Holy Synod in the Imperial capital of Saint Petersburg. But his story begins when, for personal reasons, he traveled to Mount Athos where he was consecrated a Bishop by the Holy Anphim, who claimed to be a bishop. The Holy Anphim ordained Ustvolsky to spite the Czar, as at this time there was a struggle taking place between the Holy Synod and the Czar for control of the Russian Orthodox Church (or at least this was the story he brought with him to the New World).Mitchell, Nick. Ukrainian-Canadian History as Theatre in The Ukrainian Experience in Canada: Reflections 1994, Editors: Gerus, Oleh W.; Gerus-Tarnawecka, Iraida; Jarmus, Stephan, The Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences in Canada, Winnipeg. Having been consecrated a bishop, Seraphim traveled to North America, briefly staying with Ukrainian priests in Philadelphia. By the time he arrived in Winnipeg, he had no allegiances to the Russian Orthodox Church or anyone else. The Ukrainians on the prairies accepted him as a traveling holy man, a tradition which goes back to the very beginnings of Christianity.Mitchell, Nick. The Mythology of Exile in Jewish, Mennonite and Ukrainian Canadian Writing in A Sharing of Diversities, Proceedings of the Jewish Mennonite Ukrainian Conference, \\"Building Bridges\\", General Editor: Stambrook, Fred, Canadian Plains Research Center, University of Regina, 1999, page 188. Dr. William Patrick (1852-1911) Another person who participated in the events which culminated in the creation of the Tin Can Cathedral was Seraphim's assistant Makarii Marchenko. Marchenko acted as a deacon or cantor, helping Seraphim with the church services which he knew well. He arrived with Seraphim from the United States. Archbishop Langevin, who was located in St. Boniface, was the head of the Roman Catholic diocese in Western Canada, in direct contact with Pope Pius X in Rome. He believed that his priests were more than adequate for the needs of the Ukrainian population.Martynowych, Orest T. Ukrainians in Canada: The Formative Period, 1891-1924. Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press, University of Alberta, Edmonton, 1991 Other players included Dr. William Patrick, head of Manitoba College, a Presbyterian college in Winnipeg; the Liberal Party of Manitoba; and Russian Orthodox missionaries with Bishop Tikhon as the Head of the Russian Orthodox Mission in North America.  Events  In 1902, a member of the Manitoba legislature, Joseph Bernier, introduced a bill \\"conveying properties of the Greek Ruthenian (Ukrainians were also known as Ruthenians) Church in Communion with Rome into the control of corporations under control of the Church of Rome.\\" Archbishop Langevin declared \\"the Ruthenians must prove themselves Catholics by turning property over to the church, and not like Protestants ‚Ä¶to an individual or committee of laymen, independent of the priest or bishop.\\"Winnipeg Tribune 25 February 1903. The size of the Ukrainian population on the prairies had also attracted the interest of Russian Orthodox Missionaries. At this time the Russian Orthodox Church was spending $100,000 a year for missionary work in North America. As well, the Presbyterian Church had become interested and invited young men from the Ukrainian community to attend Manitoba College (today the University of Winnipeg) where special classes were established for young Ukrainians who wished to become school teachers (and later Independent Greek Church ministers). Fluent in the German language, Dr. King, the Principal of the College, interviewed the candidates Bodrug and Negrich in German. Genik translated their scholastic documents in writing from Polish into English. They became the first Ukrainian students of a university in North America ‚Äì Manitoba College at this time was part of the University of Manitoba. Dr. J.M. King (1829-1899) Interior of the Tin Can Cathedral, 1905 Genik, Bodrug, and Negrich moved quickly to try to secure their community.Yereniuk, Roman, A Short Historical Outline of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, www.uocc.ca/pdf, page 9 They brought in Seraphim. He arrived in Winnipeg in April 1903Martynowych, Orest T. Ukrainians in Canada: The Formative Period, 1891-1924. Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press, University of Alberta, Edmonton, 1991, page 190 to set up a Church that was independent of any churches in Europe, and would have no loyalty to any of the religious interest groups vying for the souls of the new Ukrainian immigrants on the prairies. To their satisfaction, Seraphim set up an Orthodox Russian Church (not Russian Orthodox) of which he declared himself the head, and to placate the Ukrainians it was also called the Seraphimite Church. He provided the parishioners with an Eastern Rite with which the immigrants were familiar, began to ordain cantors and deacons, and \\"‚Ä¶on 13th December 1903, a small frame building on the east side of McGregor Street between Manitoba and Pritchard Avenues, that may have been called the Holy Ghost church, was officially blessed by Seraphim and opened for worship.\\"Martynowych, Orest T., The Seraphimite, Independent Greek, Presbyterian and United Churches, page 1 & 2 \\"In November 1904 he started building his notorious 'tin can cathedral' at the corner of King Street and Stella Avenue,‚Ä¶\\" made of scrap metal and wood. Charismatic, Seraphim \\"‚Ä¶ordained some 50 priests and numerous deacons, many semi-illiterate, who carried out priestly duties throughout the [Ukrainian] settlements, preaching independent Orthodoxy and trustee ownership of church property. In two years this church claimed nearly 60,000 adherents‚Ä¶\\"Bodrug, Ivan. Independent Orthodox Church: Memoirs Pertaining to the History of a Ukrainian Canadian Church in the Years 1903-1913, translators: Bodrug, Edward; Biddle, Lydia, Toronto, Ukrainian Research Foundation, 1982, page xiii. \\"Due to various indiscretions and problems with alcohol\\" he lost the trust of the intelligentsia who had invited him to Winnipeg, and a coup took place in which they moved to get rid of him while not losing his congregation. Seraphim went to the Russian capital city of Saint Petersburg to try to get recognition and further funding from the Russian Holy Synod for the thriving Seraphimite Church. In his absence Ivan Bodrug and Ivan Negrich, already students of theology at Manitoba College, as well as priests in the Seraphimite Church, were able to obtain guarantees of Presbyterian funding for Seraphim's Church on the grounds that it would be shifted onto a Presbyterian model over the course of time. \\"In the late autumn of 1904, Seraphim returned from Russia, but brought no posobiye with him.\\"Bodrug, Ivan. Independent Orthodox Church: Memoirs Pertaining to the History of a Ukrainian Canadian Church in the Years 1903-1913, translators: Bodrug, Edward; Biddle, Lydia, Toronto, Ukrainian Research Foundation, 1982, page 81 Upon his return, he discovered the betrayal and promptly excommunicated all the priests involved in this treachery. He published pictures of them in the local newspapers with their names printed across their chests, as if they were criminals. His revenge turned out to be short-lived when he received word that he had been excommunicated himself by the Russian Holy Synod: \\"‚Ä¶when the Holy Synod excommunicated Seraphim and all his priests, he left in 1908 never to return.\\"  Aftermath  Ivan Bodrug (1874‚Äì1952) In the aftermath of this social and spiritual brushfire that swept the prairie, a Ukrainian Canadian community arose. Ivan Bodrug, one of the mutineers in the Seraphimite Church became the head of the new Independent Church, and was quite a charismatic priest in his own right, preaching an evangelical Christianity because of the Presbyterian influence. He lived right into the 1950s. The Independent Church buildings were located on the corner of Pritchard Avenue and McGregor Street, and though the first has since been demolished ‚Äì the one Seraphim used for his first Church ‚Äì the second building built with Presbyterian funding still stands there today across from the Labour Temple in Winnipeg's North End.Martynowych, Orest T. Ukrainians in Canada: The Formative Period, 1891-1924. Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press, University of Alberta, Edmonton, 1991, photograph 47. Archbishop Langevin increased his efforts to try to assimilate the Winnipeg Ukrainian community into the Roman Catholic fold. He set up the Basilian Church of St. Nicholas and brought in Belgian priests, Father Achille Delaere and others, who read the Liturgy in Old Church Slavonic, dressed according to Greek ritual, and delivered sermons in Polish. The Basilian Church of St. Nicholas was across the street from the Apostolic Exarchate of Canada's Cathedral of St. Vladimir and Olga on McGregor Street in the North End of the city. Such competition provided greater opportunity for Ukrainian Canadian children to learn to speak the Ukrainian language. The Liberal Party, aware that the Ukrainians were no longer allied with Archbishop Langevin and the Roman Catholics who happened to be aligned with the Conservative Party, stepped forward and funded the very first Ukrainian language newspaper in Canada, Kanadiskyi Farmer (The Canadian Farmer), of which the first editor was none other than Ivan Negrich. Seraphim disappeared by 1908, but there are accounts of him in Ukrainskyi Holos (the Ukrainian Voice newspaper, still being published today in Winnipeg) selling Bibles to workers building railroads in British Columbia as late as 1913. In other versions of history, he returned to Russia. Cyril Genik moved with his eldest daughter and one of his sons to the United States, to North Dakota for a time, then returned and died in 1925. Makarii Marchenko, upon Seraphim's departure, declared himself not only the new Bishop of the Seraphimite Church, but also Arch-Patriarch, Arch-Pope, Arch-Hetman, and Arch-Prince. Not to take any chances, or show any favouritism, for good measure he ex-communicated the Pope and the Russian Holy Synod. There are records of him traveling the rural areas and ministering to the Ukrainians who were very much in want of their Eastern rite as late as the 1930s.

NEXT affords larger delivered payloads, smaller launch vehicle size, and other mission enhancements compared to chemical and other electric propulsion technologies for Discovery, New Frontiers, Mars Exploration, and Flagship outer-planet exploration missions. Glenn Research Center manufactured the test engine's core ionization chamber, and Aerojet Rocketdyne designed and built the ion acceleration assembly.NASA Thruster Achieves World-Record 5+Years of Operation. NASA. June 24, 2013. The first two flight units will be available in early 2019. Performance The NEXT engine is a type of solar electric propulsion in which thruster systems use the electricity generated by the spacecraft's solar panel to accelerate the xenon propellant to speeds of up to 90,000 mph (145,000 km/h or 40 km/s). NEXT can consume 6.9 kW power and produce 236 mN thrust. It can be throttled down to 0.5 kW power, and has a specific impulse of 4190 seconds (compared to 3120 for NSTAR). The NEXT thruster has demonstrated a total impulse of 17 MN¬∑s; which is the highest total impulse ever demonstrated by an ion thruster. A beam extraction area 1.6 times that of NSTAR allows higher thruster input power while maintaining low voltages and ion current densities, thus maintaining thruster longevity. Tests In November 2010, it was revealed that the prototype had completed a 48,000 hours (5.5 years) test in December 2009. Thruster performance characteristics, measured over the entire throttle range of the thruster, were within predictions and the engine showed little signs of degradation and is ready for mission opportunities. Status NEXT completed its System Requirement Review in July 2015 and Preliminary Design Review in February 2016. The first two flight units will be available in early 2019. The CAESAR mission concept to comet 67P/Churyumov‚ÄìGerasimenko was a finalist for the New Frontiers program mission #4, and if selected it would have been propelled by the NEXT ion engine. However, on 27 June 2019, the other finalist, the Dragonfly mission, was chosen instead. After that, it will be a commercial product for purchase by NASA and non-NASA customers.

Life George Gauld was born in Ardbrack, Banffshire, Scotland, in 1731, and was educated at King's College in Aberdeen, where he received his Master of Arts degree. He became a cartographer and painter, and was on in 1761, same ship that proved John Harrison's marine chronometer to be correct. Prior to the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War) the British possessed few detailed maps of the interior of North America. The land beyond the Appalachian Mountains had been dominated by the French and their Indian allies. However, British colonial expansion and the military operations led to a flurry of mapping in the form of reconnaissance and route maps, fortification plans, and map depicting engagements. \\"At the conclusion of the war in 1763, Britain was left in possession of a vast and little known addition to its seaboard colonies. To facilitate the administration and development of Canada and the western territory, topographical surveys were initiated. Notable examples are the James Murray survey of the St. Lawrence River valley (1761‚Äì63), the first detailed hydrographic survey of the Ohio River by Harry Gordon and Thomas Hutchins (1766), Philip Pittman's surveys of the Mississippi and Iberville River (now known as Bayou Manchac) (1765), and the surveys of East and West Florida by David Taitt, George Gauld and Bernard Romans (1772‚Äì73).\\"Bosse, David. 1989. \\"Dartmouth on the Mississippi: Speculators and Surveyors in British North America in the Eighteenth Century.\\" Imago Mundi. Volume 41, page 9. Between 1764 and 1781, George Gauld was assigned by the British Admiralty to chart the waters off the coast of the British colony of West Florida. \\"After Florida came into the possession of Great Britain, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, sent out Mr George Gauld to make a thorough survey of the whole coast. He was employed in surveying the coasts and harbours of West Florida, and the west coast of East Florida from the summer of 1764, to the year 1781, when he was made prisoner by the Spaniards, in their invasion of Florida. These surveys were not published until the year 1790, after the death of Mr Gauld. Much remains to be done by our own government in improving the charts of this dangerous coast. It does not appear precisely at what time.\\"Sketches, Historical and Topographical, of the Floridas; More Particularly of East Florida by James Grant Forbes; Memoir on the Geography, and Natural and Civil History of Florida, Attended by a Map of That Country, &c.; by William Darby. 1821.

A description of Jamaica mentions Gauld's early work. \\"Modern charts give only the outline of this area; but there is a particularly interesting chart, \\"Plan of Port Royal Harbour,\\" by George Gauld, \\"Surveyor General of the Coast of West Florida,\\" the field work for which was apparently completed in I772, which shows the probable make-up of the Plum Point area at the time. The chart was published in London by W. Faden in I798 and gives the impression of careful work.\\"Steers, J. A. 1940. \\"The Cays and the Palisadoes, Port Royal, Jamaica.\\" Geographical Review, Vol. 30, No. 2 (Apr., 1940), pp. 279‚Äì296. In 1773, Gauld submitted some of his findings to the American Philosophical Society, hoping they would be published in the Transactions. Although his report was not published, it became one of the first submissions entered into the Society's collections. This manuscript also includes a letter from Dr. John Lorimer to Gauld, and a sketch of the Middle and Yellow Rivers of West Florida by Thomas Hutchins. In 1774, George Gauld, Dr. John Lorimer (doctor), Thomas Hutchins, Captain Thomas Davey, RN, and Major Alexander Dickson of the 16th Regiment of Foot, made a mapping expedition from Manchac to the mouth of the Yazoo River. Major Dickson went with them for the first part of the survey, and helped them investigate the Manchac region, but evidently left the group at Natchez. Dr. Lorimer made careful measurements of latitude at Natchez, and then the remainder of the party continued further north to the mouth of the Yazoo River. Major Dickson was back in Pensacola by 30 April, although it is unknown if he returned by going up the Manchac to the Iberville River, or south to New Orleans. He appeared back in Pensacola almost two weeks after the return of the main party that went up further north.Ware, John D., and Robert Right Rea. 1982. George Gauld, surveyor and cartographer of the Gulf Coast. Pages 161‚Äì162. They had hoped to be able to find a route up the Mississippi River without having to go through Spanish controlled New Orleans. The second reason for this map is to show the landholdings of various planters and speculators. Many were speculators, including George Guald and Dr. Lorimer. The land they owned on Thompson's Creek were acquired by Dr. Lorimer and George Gauld in 1772, and then visited by them, perhaps for the first time, during this trip. This cheap land was mostly purchased for speculation, because running the property profitably as a plantation would have been too difficult as absentee landlords from their homes on the Gulf Coast.Ware, John D., and Robert Right Rea. 1982. George Gauld, surveyor and cartographer of the Gulf Coast. Pages 190‚Äì191. Later, Thomas Hutchins would write an account of this journey, with acknowledgment to the information he had received from George Gauld: \\"It may be proper to observe that I have had the assistance of the remarks and surveys, so far as relates to the mouths of the Mississippi and the coast and foundings of West Florida, of the late ingenious Mr. George Gauld, a Gentleman who was employed by the Lords of the Admiralty for the express purpose of making an accurate chart of the above mentioned places.\\"Hutchins, Thomas. 1784. \\"An Historical Narrative and Topographical Description of Louisiana and West Florida.\\" Philadelphia. Page 3. Many people copied his maps and charts in those days before strict copyright laws. A book by William Stork reputedly featured a plagiarised copy of a map by Gauld, who later wrote (speaking of himself in the third person):Gauld, George. 1790. \\"An account of the surveys of Florida, &c;: with directions for sailing from Jamaica or the West Indies, by the west end of Cuba, and through the Gulph of Florida.

In 1776, Gauld was forced to suspend his work in the Dry Tortugas and Florida Keys due to the depredations of American privateers, and he was taken prisoner at the Siege of Pensacola in 1781. Carried off first to Cuba and then to New York. Return to England and Death He was later repatriated to Britain, and died shortly afterwards in London. He is buried at the cemetery of Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road, London. His memorial, of plain Portland stone, reads: \\"In memory of George Gauld, A.M. Surveyor of the Coasts of Florida &c.; Who was born at Ardbrack in the parish of Botriphny (now known as Drummuir), Banffshire, North Britain; and educated at King's College, Aberdeen.

A stationary package of yarn is used to supply the weft yarns in the rapier machine. One end of a rapier, a rod or steel tape, carries the weft yarn. The other end of the rapier is connected to the control system. The rapier moves across the width of the fabric, carrying the weft yarn across through the shed to the opposite side. The rapier is then retracted, leaving the new pick in place. In some versions of the loom, two rapiers are used, each half the width of the fabric in size. One rapier carries the yarn to the centre of the shed, where the opposing rapier picks up the yarn and carries it the remainder of the way across the shed.Weave Tech, India The double rapier is used more frequently than the single rapier due to its increased pick insertion speed and ability to weave wider widths of fabric. The housing for the rapiers must take up as much space as the width of the machine. To overcome this problem, looms with flexible rapiers have been devised. The flexible rapier can be coiled as it is withdrawn, therefore requiring less storage space. If, however, the rapier is too stiff then it will not coil; if it is too flexible, it will buckle. Rigid and flexible rapier machines operate at speeds ranging from about 200 to 260 ppm, using up to 1,300 metres of weft yarn every minute. They have a noise level similar to that of modern projectile looms. They can produce a wide variety of fabrics ranging from muslin to drapery and upholstery materials. Newer rapier machines are built with two distinct weaving areas for two separate fabrics. On such machines, one rapier picks up the yarn from the centre, between the two fabrics, and carries it across one weaving area; as it finishes laying that pick, the opposite end of the rapier picks up another yarn from the centre, and the rapier moves in the other direction to lay a pick for the second weaving area, on the other half of the machine. The above figure shows the action on a single width of fabric for a single rigid rapier system, a double rigid rapier system, and a double flexible rapier system . Rapier machines weave more rapidly than most shuttle machines but more slowly than most other projectile machines. An important advantage of rapier machines is their flexibility, which permits the laying of picks of different colours. They also weave yarns of any type of fibre and can weave fabrics up to 110 inches in width without modification.  History of the rapier loom  The development of the rapier loom began in 1844, when John Smith of Salford was granted a patent on a loom design that eliminated the shuttle typical of earlier models of looms. Subsequent patents were taken out by Phillippe and Maurice in 1855, W.S. Laycock in 1869, and W. Glover in 1874, with rigid rapiers being perfected by O. Hallensleben in 1899. The main breakthrough came in 1922 when John Gabler invented the principle of loop transfer in the middle of the shed. Flexible rapiers of the type used today were proposed in 1925 by the Spanish inventor R.G. Moya, while R. Dewas introduced the idea of grasping the weft at its tip by the giver or a carrier rapier and transferring it to the taker or a receiver in the middle of the shed. It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that rapier weaving became fully commercialized, with loom technology developing rapidly.

The poster, and Clark himself‚Äìat the time a bar owner in Goose Hollow‚Äìbecame widely known. Poster Former mayor of Portland, Oregon, Bud Clark was pictured in the poster flashing Kvinneakt. The \\"Expose Yourself to Art\\" poster showed Bud Clark apparently flashing an artwork, titled Kvinneakt, Norman J. Taylor's bronze sculpture of a nude woman. Clark appeared to be wearing only a raincoat, but it was later revealed that he was wearing shorts and a T-shirt under his raincoat. The photo was taken by Mike Ryerson in 1978, then a staff member of The Northwest Neighbor. Ryerson and Clark originally intended to create a poster for the Venereal Disease Action Council until a reader submitted the caption \\"expose yourself to art\\". With $500, Ryerson printed posters, then sold 800 for one dollar each by manning a booth at Waterfront Park. By 1984, the year Clark was elected mayor, Ryerson had sold more than 250,000 posters, with profits supporting The Northwest Neighbor. Ryerson later sold rights to the poster to Mike Beard, owner of Errol Graphics. In 2010, Clark sold the coat he wore in the poster, among other household items, by secret bid. =Reaction= Prior to Clark's later bid for the office of mayor, he was chiefly known outside of his neighborhood of Goose Hollow for his appearance on the controversial poster. In 1984, six years after the poster's publication, Clark, running as a political outsider, began a long-shot campaign for Portland mayor against incumbent Frank Ivancie. Ivancie cited Clark's appearance on the poster as proof that he was not a serious candidate, and that his only claim to fame was \\"exposing himself to a downtown statue.\\" Clark handily defeated Ivancie and served two terms as mayor. Following the election, Clark sold autographed copies of the poster to eliminate his campaign debt. The poster has been referred to historically as being part of an arts advocacy campaign. As of 2013, the image's photographer, Mike Ryerson, had retired from the Northwest Examiner (successor paper to The Northwest Neighbor), and became noted as an oral historian who led walking tours of Northwest Portland in the neighborhoods where he and Clark documented, lived, and worked for most of their lives. Ryerson died on January 6, 2015. Recreations The slogan and poster have been parodied on several occasions. In 2011, Willamette Week published the article \\"Expose Yourself to Bikes\\", which included a cover image of a woman wearing an orange coat \\"flashing\\" a bike.

He lived in Europe for many years, and exhibited in the United States after World War II. Biography Urushibara Yoshijir√¥ was born in Tokyo in 1888 and studied mokuhan as a young man. In 1908, aged nineteen, he travelled to London, where he was among a group of woodblock print craftsmen who demonstrated printing techniques at the Anglo-Japanese Exhibition of 1910. He remained in London after the exhibition, restoring prints, making reproductions of prints, and mounting scrolls at the British Museum. In 1912, the British Museum employed Urushibara to make accurate copies of a famous Chinese scroll painting by Gu Kaizhi (c. 344‚Äì406 AD), the Admonitions Scroll. After the museum job, Urushibara worked independently, becoming a significant member of a growing group of Japanese artists based in London, including Yoshio Markino and Ryuson Chuso Matsuyama. He collaborated with English and French designers on prints‚Äînotably with Frank Brangwyn. He carved and printed many prints from Frank Brangwyn's designs of horses, landscapes, and flowers. In a portfolio called \\"Bruges\\" (1919) he reproduced several of Brangwyn's watercolours as large woodblock prints. Especially interesting within the Bruges portfolio is The Bridge at Predikheren, which is published in two different sizes. The artists applied this practice to six other subjects during their period of collaboration: The Beguinage, Bruges, of c. 1919; Ruins of a Roman Bridge over the Loire River, also of 1919; The Devil's Bridge, c. 1924; Messina, Life Among the Ruins, c. 1927; Outside the Walls of Avignon, c. 1927; and The Dance of Death Bridge at Lucerne, c. 1928.Hilary Chapman, 'Yoshijiro Ushibara and Frank Brangwyn: A Question of Size', Print Quarterly, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1 (March, 2016): p. 33. It is unclear whether the smaller prints are contemporaneous to the larger impressions, and archival materials suggest that they were made later.Chapman, 'Yoshijiro Urushibara and Frank Brangwyn', p. 35. The purpose of the scaling exercise is similarly ambiguous. Hilary Chapman hypothesises that the popularity of the subjects may have motivated Brangwyn to commission the smaller prints.Chapman, 'Yoshijiro Urushibara and Frank Brangwyn', p. 36. In 1924, Urushibara produced with Brangwyn the portfolio Ten Woodcuts by Yoshijir√¥ Urushibara after Designs by Frank Brangwyn. The two artists worked together until Urushibara's departure for Japan in 1940.Chapman, 'Yoshijiro Urushibara and Frank Brangwyn', p. 33. Urushibara was influential in the English revival of colour woodblock printing in the 1920s and 1930s. At first he carved and printed to other artists' designs, but later printed many of his own designs. He took up the 'art name' of Mokuchu (Êú®Ëô´), which appears on some of his print seals. The American artist Andrew Kay Womrath studied printmaking under Urushibara, and Urushibara bought several of Womrath's creations. Later Urushibara donated some of these works to the British Museum.

The camera was announced on May 10, 2012. Delivery started September 2012 in black finish only. A Leica M Monochrom in Silver was announced May 22, 2014. The camera was succeeded by the Leica M Monochrom (Typ 246) in 2015. Details The nickname for the camera through design and development at Leica Camera AG was \\"Henri\\" as a tribute to Henri Cartier-Bresson but at introduction, Leica Camera AG decided on the name Leica M Monochrom. The camera is based on the same Kodak CCD sensor as the Leica M9 but without the color filter array. This makes the sensor one stop faster and the base ISO of the sensor is 320 ISO instead of the 160 ISO of the Leica M9. The body of the Leica M Monochrom is likewise based on the Leica M9 with few changes of the metals, leather and paint used. Leica claim that the camera delivers 100% sharper images than monochrome images derived from a camera with a color sensor (of comparable megapixels). The camera is able to alter the captured image to apply three toning effects (called sepia, cold, and selenium). The achieved sharpness is due to the lack of a color filter array, thus avoiding the process of demosaicing by capturing the true luminance value of each photosensor. The removal of the color filter array also means that no incoming light is filtered, making the sensor more light sensitive, which explains the high native ISO of 320.

First published for Methuen Drama in 1982, it was originally commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1981 and was subsequently seen all over the world. Good has been described as the definitive piece written about the Holocaust in the English-speaking theatre. Set in pre-war Germany, it shows how John Halder, a liberal-minded professor whose best friend is the Jewish Maurice, could not only be seduced into joining the Nazism, but step-by- rationalised-step end up embracing the final solution justifying to his conscience the terrible actions. Plot overview John Halder is a Frankfurt literary professor and an example of the good man: he is apparently devoted to his wife and children and he does his best to look after his aged mother. He even tells his best friend, who is a Jewish psychiatrist, that the anti- Semitism of the National Socialists is \\"just a balloon they throw up in the air to distract the masses.\\" But this is Germany in 1933, and men can change. Cecil P. Taylor, in tracing his hero's progress over eight years towards the upper echelons of the SS, plausibly explains the private flaws that lead to endorsement of public monstrosity. Beneath Halder's surface 'goodness' lies a chilling moral detachment: he can abandon his distracted wife for a devoted student, he has written a pro-euthanasia novel, he hears in his head a continuous musical score that helps blot out daily reality. Taylor's point is that Nazism preyed on individual character flaws and on a missing moral dimension in otherwise educated and intelligent people. At first Halder believes he can help 'push the Nazis towards humanity'. Slowly he succumbs to vanity, careerism and the desire for an easy life. Above all, he remains curiously detached from reality. At the end Halder not only becomes a member of the Nazi party but also plays a direct role in SS book burnings, in euthanasia experiments, in the night of the Broken Glass, and, finally, in Adolf Eichmann's genocide at Auschwitz, where Maurice, the sole source of a Jewish perspective in the play and original force of \\"good\\" in Halder, ends up being deported. Themes Good is a play about the causes rather than the consequences of Nazism, about morality and seduction. It explores how a \\"good\\" man gets caught up in the intricate web of personal and social reasons why the average person might be seduced in to what we see as abhorrent. The author thus rejects the view that the Nazi atrocities are explained as a result of the simple conspiracy of criminals and psychopaths. Further the lesson of Nazism and the play are not just about the revulsion of six million dead but a warning about popular movements that lead to holocausts. Not judgmental of its protagonist, Good invites to question just what a \\"good\\" man is and does and where the bounds of responsibility lie. Historical moments referred to in the play are included: *January 1933 ‚Äì Hitler took office *May 1933 ‚Äì Book burning at the University of Berlin The play is situated in Frankfurt. Also there has been a book burning. In the city center at the R√∂merberg you will find a memorial for that. *January 1934 ‚Äì Murder of SA Leader Ernst R√∂hm *November 1938 ‚Äì Shooting of Ernst vom Rath *November 1938 ‚Äì The night of the Broken Glass (the Anti-Jewish Pogroms) *June 1941 ‚Äì Nazi War against the Soviet Union *June 1941 ‚Äì Rudolf H√∂ss ordered to establish extermination facilities at Auschwitz. Productions Good was originally commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company and premiered on 9 September 1981 at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden, London. The play, directed by Howard Davies with Alan Howard in the role of Hadler and Timothy Walker as Maurice, was subsequently seen all over the world, obtaining excellent reviews from critics and journalists, such as The New York Times. In 1998, it secured joint 85th place in the Royal National Theatre's Survey of the Twentieth-Century \\"Most Significant\\" Plays. A year later, Michael Grandage directed in its original theatre a new successful play in two acts, with Charles Dance playing John Halder, Ian Gelder as Maurice, and Faith Brook as Halder's mother. The London Evening Standard described the event \\"one of the most powerful, politically pointed nights at the theatre.\\" The play has been largely performed by many theatre companies, including the Havant Arts Centre in 1986, the North Wall Arts Centre in 2008, the Hilberry Theater in 2010, the Royal Exchange Theatre, Everyman Theatre in 2011, and the Burning Coal Theatre Company in 2013. The play will play at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London's West End for a limited 12 week run from 21 April 2021. The play was originally scheduled to play for 10 weeks at the Playhouse Theatre with previews beginning 6 October 2020. However, the production was rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. David Tennant will lead the cast. Film Adaptation A film adaptation of the play, featuring Viggo Mortensen as John Halder and directed by Vicente Amorim, was released in December 2008.

After attending California State University, Long Beach, he was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in 2010. He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Braves in 2013. Early life and career Of Croatian descent, Joseph Thomas Terdoslavich was born in Sarasota, Florida on September 9, 1988. He and his brother Tyler were raised in a single-parent household by Joe Terdoslavich Sr. When Joey learned to walk at eight months old, his father began teaching him how to hit. Terdoslavich started using a Wiffle ball bat and tee at ten months of age and first threw a baseball at three years of age. He attended Sarasota High School in his hometown and was teammates with Eric Erickson and Mark Sobolewski. Terdoslavich's high school teams were coached by Clyde Metcalf. As a junior in 2006, Terdoslavich hit .411 with three homers, 29 RBI and set a school record with 23 doubles. That year Sarasota lost the state championship to Charles W. Flanagan High School. After the season, he was named to the second All-State team. In his senior season, Terdoslavich won a state title and hit .411 with five homers, leading his team with 32 RBI. His 2007 performance netted him a second team Louisville Slugger All-American award. Baseball America ranked him the 87th best prospect of the year, and he was drafted in the 35th round of the 2007 MLB draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Terdoslavich did not sign, choosing instead to attend the University of Miami where high school teammates Erickson and Sobolewski were playing baseball, after visits to Florida and Central Florida. In his lone freshman season with the Miami Hurricanes baseball team, Terdoslavich roomed with D.J. Swatscheno, who had pitched for the 2006 Flanagan High baseball team. He later transferred to California State University, Long Beach, where he played for the Long Beach State Dirtbags baseball team. In 2009, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham Anglers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the sixth round of the 2010 MLB draft and signed with the Braves for $125,000. Terdoslavich had a successful season in 2011 for the high-A Lynchburg Hillcats in the Braves minor league system (he hit a Carolina League record 52 doubles) and was sent to the Surprise Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League, making the Fall League All Star team. He started the 2012 season playing with the Triple-A Gwinnett Braves, making the jump from A to AAA. He split the 2012 season between Gwinnett and the Double-A Mississippi Braves. Terdoslavich began playing the outfield in 2013 and started the season at Triple-A Gwinnett. He was named to the All-Star Futures Game, but did not appear in the contest, as he had been called up to the Atlanta Braves on July 4, 2013. MLB career =Atlanta Braves= The Braves promoted him to the major leagues on July 4, 2013 to replace the injured Jordan Schafer. Terdoslavich recorded a hit in his second major league at-bat, a pinch-hit single off of Jonathan Papelbon. He spent the rest of the year with Atlanta used mostly as a pinch-hitter. In 55 games (14 starts), Terdoslavich hit .215 with 4 RBI, 4 doubles and 12 walks. Terdoslavich played with the Toros del Este in the offseason, hitting .291 with 2 HR and a .762 OPS. In 85 games with Gwinnett, Terdoslavich hit .318 with 18 HR, 58 RBI, and a .926 OPS. He was named an International League Postseason All-Star, as well as Gwinnett's MVP. With the Gwinnett Braves in 2013 Terdoslavich began 2014 with Gwinnett for the third consecutive season. He was named the International League Batter of the Week for August 18 to 24. He was promoted to the major league team on September 1, 2014. He started the 2015 season with Gwinnett, then was reinstated in June 2015 to replace Eric Young Jr., who was designated for assignment. He hit his first major league home run on June 9, 2015, off of San Diego Padres' relief pitcher, Joaqu√≠n Benoit in the Braves' 6-5 win. He was sent back to Gwinnett on the following day, when Kelly Johnson was activated from the DL. He was recalled to the Braves on June 23, when Freddie Freeman was placed on the 15-day DL. Terdslavich was optioned back to Gwinnett on July 7, 2015, in order to make room on the roster for Mike Foltynewicz, who was called up for the purpose of providing extra relief help in Atlanta's bullpen. Terdoslavich was called up again on July 17, 2015, after closer Jason Grilli suffered a season-ending injury. On July 25, 2015, the Braves made a series of roster moves following the trade of Johnson and Juan Uribe to the New York Mets on the previous day. Freeman was activated from the disabled list and infielders Daniel Castro and Adonis Garc√≠a were called up from Gwinnett. Terdoslavich was sent down to Gwinnett in order to clear the extra roster spot. He was recalled to Atlanta on August 4, 2015, when Freeman was again placed on the DL. When Freeman returned from the disabled list on August 19, Terdoslavich was sent down to Gwinnett, where he spent the rest of the minor league 2015 season. Terdoslavich was not among the players who were called up for roster expansions in September 2015. On January 8, 2016, the Braves waived Terdoslavich to make room on the 40 man roster for Kelly Johnson, who had re- signed with the Braves. =Baltimore Orioles= He was claimed by the Baltimore Orioles on the same day. The Orioles designated Terdoslavich for assignment on January 21, 2016 in order to make room on the roster for Chris Davis, who had re-signed with the team. On January 28, 2016, the Orioles outrighted Terdoslavich to their Triple A affiliate, the Norfolk Tides.

Since gaining its independence from the United Kingdom in 1961, Tanzania has been continuously developing in terms of its economy and modern industry. However, the country‚Äôs economic success has been limited. Environmental obstacles, such as the mismanagement of natural resources and industrial waste, have been contributing factors and results of the relatively low economic status of the country. Tanzania‚Äôs annual output still falls below the average world GDP. In 2010, the GDP for Tanzania was US $23.3 billion and the GDP per capita was US $1,515. Comparatively, the GDP for the United States was $15.1 trillion and the GDP per capita was approximately $47,153. Eighty percent of the workers accounting for this annual output in Tanzania work in agriculture, while the remaining 20% work in industry, commerce, and government organizations. Such a heavy reliance on agriculture has placed a huge amount of strain on an already limited supply of viable land. Land use and degradation Land in Tanzania is a valuable resource. Since most of the country is dry and arid, the wetlands surrounding Lake Victoria are the most fertile and consequently, in high demand for farming.Hongo, H and M. Masikini. 2003 Impact of immigrant pastoral herds to fringing wetlands of lake Victoria in Magu district Mwanza region, Tanzania. Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C 28(20-27): 1001-1007. The results have shown that these wetlands are indeed very productive ecosystems, rich in nutrients and capable of sustaining crop growth. Land degradation is one of the leading environmental problems resulting from a mostly agricultural nation. Tanzania among other states in southern Africa is being adversely affected by inappropriate farming methods and overgrazing.Dahlberg, Annika. 1994 Contesting Views and Changing Paradigms: The Land Degradation Debate in Southern Africa. Uppsala: Reprocentralen HSC. Most of the eastern region of Africa, of which Tanzania is a significant part, gets less than 600 mm of rainfall each year. Regions with an average rainfall of 500‚Äì1000 mm are classified as semiarid climates. There are many economic benefits for raising livestock in developing countries. Typically, the monetary value for raising cattle and other associated animals is higher than the income potential from producing crops. Additionally, less manual labor is involved. Producing crops such as wheat, beans, and grains generates more food for large populations than does raising livestock. These vegetative food sources can be made to feed a much larger group of people than slaughtering individual animals. Suggestions for increased integration of crop and livestock production have been put forth in an attempt to maintain a balance between the two methods. Ellis, Jim and Kathleen A. Galvin. 1994 Climate Patterns and Land Use Practices in the Dry Zones of Africa. BioScience 44(5): 340-349. A different, possibly viable, solution has also been proposed: sustainable agriculture. The concept of sustainable agriculture is one that is not fully understood throughout the world and has many definitions.Schaller, Neill. 2003 The concept of agricultural sustainability. Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment 46(1-4): 89-97. These can range from the idea of producing strictly organic crops to instituting fertilizing practices which better the environment rather than deplete it. The desire for economic success is important, yet the heavy use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in raising crops and livestock is not eco-friendly. Conventional farming‚Äôs heavy reliance on chemicals is believed to produce a much higher overall output than alternative farming methods. The crops produced would be less exposed to chemical toxins and better able to feed the human population. Effects on human health Research has shown that many parts of the world affected by land degradation and human interference are experiencing much higher rates of infectious disease.Collins, A.E. 2001 \\"Health Ecology, Land Degradation and Development,\\" Land Degradation & Development 12: 237-250. As land degradation increases across the globe, the status of human health is affected by the changing ecological systems that play host to various pathogens. By incorporating sustainable living practices into daily life, many forerunners of biological disease can be avoided, thus preventing instances of epidemics or premature death. These include the contraction of tetanus from spores found in soil and water-related diseases caused by agricultural runoff contaminants. Management of toxic chemicals Another growing problem in Tanzania is the stems from the mismanagement of chemical resources. An increasing number of studies have been done on the levels of toxic substances in the soil, water systems, and atmosphere of the region. For instance, one of Tanzania‚Äôs main exports is gold, the mining of which requires excess amounts of mercury. It has been estimated that approximately 1.32 kg of mercury is lost to the environment for every 1 kg of gold mined.Harada, Masazumi, et al. 1999 \\"Monitoring of mercury pollution in Tanzania: relation between head hair mercury and health,\\" Science of the Total Environment 227(2-3): 249-256. The unregulated use of mercury in the mines has led to high quantities of the element being released into the atmosphere, exposing the miners to harmful toxins. Using a mercury detector test, each subject‚Äôs hair was examined to detect traces of the chemical. Fourteen of the subjects had extremely high readings, the highest being 953 ppm. On average, the mercury level found in these 14 subjects was 48.3 ppm per person. Keeping this information in context, the value considered critical for Minamata disease is 50 ppm. The expected exposure level for a typical person is about 10 ppm. The remaining 258 participants had levels at roughly 10 ppm suggesting no increase in mercury exposure. The reasoning behind choosing miners as test subjects is clear. The gold mines release an enormous amount of mercury on a daily basis. Approximately 60% of the total generated mercury is released in a gaseous form and exposes the miners via inhalation or absorption through the skin. Fishermen, their families, and residents of Mwanza City were also test subjects to exhibit the far-reaching effects of the remaining 40% of the mercury released from the mines. In addition to testing for mercury contamination, studies have been conducted in Tanzania to test for levels of pesticides in the environment. Kishimba, M.A., L. Henry, H. Mwevura, A.J Mmochi, M. Mihale, and H. Hellar. 2004 \\"The status of pesticide pollution in Tanzania,\\" Talanta 64(1): 48-53. The bodies of water accompanying the farms and plantations tested positive for both DDT and HCH (two common insecticides) .They provide a feasible method to increase crop yield which is important for economic success regardless of environmental impact. While the agricultural areas did not show intense pollution, the former pesticide storage site contained residue levels that were considerably greater. Approximately 40% of the site‚Äôs surrounding soil was saturated with pesticides. While evidence from the previous case study does not indicate hazardous agricultural practices, a second study was conducted testing the toxicity of soil used in the farming of maize. This research focused on determining levels of the potentially toxic elements (PTEs) arsenic, lead, chromium, and nickel.Marwa, Ernest M.M., Andrew A. Meharg, and Clive M. Rice. 2011 \\"Risk assessment of potentially toxic elements in agricultural soils and maize tissues from selected districts in Tanzania,\\" Science of the Total Environment 416: 180-186. Samples were taken from 40 farms throughout the country and toxic levels of these elements were found in several samples from different farms. The likely causes of this increase in toxins are increased use of pesticides, mining, and improper waste disposal. Crops that are high in lead and nickel are seen as unfit for human consumption which could pose a potential health risk in Tanzanian people. While it is true that PTEs pollute crops, they also inhibit the soil from taking up nutrients which further reduces the overall yield. Water management and sanitation In addition to soil contamination and general land degradation, Tanzania has a long history of water mismanagement. Inherently, water management is a complex process in that it involves the authority of many people from different sectors of governing bodies.Stein, C., H. Ernstson, and J. Barron. 2011 A social network approach to analyzing water governance. Management of solid waste Waste management, like natural and chemical resource management, is continuously evolving in developing countries including Tanzania. The country's profile in Waste Atlas Platform shows that currently (2012) 16.9 million tonnes of MSW or 365 kg/cap/year are produced.Waste Atlas (2012). Country Data: TANZANIA The current practice of solid waste disposal is to simply remove it from cities and other metropolitan areas and dump it in rural or deserted areas to be forgotten.Kaseva, M.E. and S.K. Gupta. 1999 \\"Recycling ‚Äî an environmentally friendly and income generating activity towards sustainable solid waste management. Case study ‚Äî Dar es Salaam City, Tanzania,\\" Resources, Conservation and Recycling 17(4): 299-309. Solid waste is defined as any solid, discarded material generated by municipal, industrial, or agricultural practices. Over the past 30 years, urban areas such as Dar es Salaam have grown both in terms of population and physical size.Yhdego, Michael. 1999 \\"Urban solid waste management in Tanzania Issues, concepts and challenges,\\" Resources, Conservation and Recycling 14(1): 1-10. In Dar es Salaam, the largest city in Tanzania, residents generate approximately 0.31 kg of waste per capita. In comparison, residents of squatter areas ‚Äì rural regions between cities ‚Äì produce only 0.17 kg per capita on average. Although there are not many immediate health risks correlated with dumping solid wastes such as paper and plastic, there are potential hazards associated the improper disposal of medical and other toxic waste from hospitals.Mato, R.R.A.M and G.R. Kassenga. 1998 \\"A study on problems of management of medical solid wastes in Dar es Salaam and their remedial measures,\\" Resources, Conservation, and Recycling 21(1): 1-16. While Tanzania has made efforts to further develop its urban centers by allowing private hospitals, there has been a lack of infrastructure generated to accommodate the growing amounts of bio-hazardous waste. Currently, the more dangerous medical wastes are simply mixed with municipal solid waste and dumped at the disposal sites discussed above. Tanzania is undergoing changes in making a comprehensive, functioning waste disposal system a pre-requisite for the development of new hospitals. Future solutions It is especially crucial for developing nations, such as Tanzania, to develop sound infrastructure in order to progress toward complete development.Mbuligwe, Stephen E. and Gabriel R. Kassenga. 2004 \\"Feasibility and strategies for anaerobic digestion of solid waste for energy production in Dar es Salaam city, Tanzania,\\" Resources, Conservation and Recycling 42(2): 183-203. More specifically, Tanzania is under to pressure to either significantly reduce the amount of waste generated or develop a sustainable plan for disposing of the waste without environmental repercussions. Ideally, the final solution will involve both. Additionally, progressive research is being conducted on converting solid waste into usable energy. Since waste is continually being generated, inventing a method for converting such waste into a usable resource would supply essentially limitless energy. Furthermore, if the program is successful, overall waste will be reduced and an efficient method of disposal will be in place. In fact, researchers in the field have predicted that waste could be reduced by 50-60% with the success of such a program. An organization called the Taka Gas Project has been researching methods for converting solid waste into biogas to be used for generating electrical energy. The biogas will be created using anaerobic digestion of organic materials (most of the waste is organic).  Bibliography  *Collins, A.E. 2001 Health Ecology, Land Degradation and Development.

Ecuador became the first country in the world to codify the Rights of Nature and to inform a more clarified content to those rights. Articles 10 and 71‚Äì74 of the Ecuadorian Constitution recognize the inalienable rights of ecosystems to exist and flourish, give people the authority to petition on the behalf of nature, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights. Sumac Kawsay, or buen vivir in Spanish, meaning \\"good living\\", rooted in the cosmovisi√≥n (or worldview) of the Quechua peoples of the Andes, describes a way of life that is community-centric, ecologically-balanced and culturally-sensitive. The concept is related to tradition of legal and political scholarship advocating legal standing for the natural environment.Stone CD, Should Trees Have Standing? Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects. Southern California Law Review 1972;45:450; W Kaufmann, Los Altos, 1974 p 8 The rights approach is a break away from traditional environmental regulatory systems, which regard nature as property. Ecuador‚Äôs Rights of Nature embodies the indigenous Sumak Kawsay principles, giving Pachamama constitutional rights to protect and restore its environment. History and context President Rafael Correa entered into office on January 2007 with the help of 'La Revolucion Ciudadana' (the Citizens' Revolution promising a new anti-neoliberalist Ecuador. A country that would unify and harmonize the broken relationships between the state, the economy, society, and its vital resources. Being the eighth president in 10 years, Correa called for a Constitutional Assembly to create a new constitution for Ecuador. Ecuador relies heavily on the income gained from exploiting its natural resources. The country's largest export, crude petroleum, represents 29% of Ecuador's GDP, coming in with a total value of $5.63 billion. This has caused the country to suffer from vast deforestation in the Amazon, contaminated water and widespread illness. Ecuador is also home to at least eight tribes of indigenous peoples, most of which reside in the Amazon, that have suffered from the negative environmental consequences of the extraction of oil. After several years of worsening economic and environmental conditions, uprisings from various indigenous communities, who found themselves receiving less support from the state, while simultaneously their land was being increasingly encroached upon by oil companies, brought attention to their concerns. After historically being excluded from the political process, indigenous groups, especially concerned about the worsening environmental devastation of the extraction business and global climate change, started social movements aimed at creating a new approach to development that would protect the environment and harmonize its relationship with people. CONAIE (National Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador), the largest federation of indigenous movements focused on social justice began lobbying for a new constitution that incorporated recognition of the nation's indigenous groups, their language, culture, history, and land rights, and inherently their concepts of sumak kawsay and Pachamama (English: \\"Mother Nature\\").Becker, Marc. 2011 Correa, Indigenous Movements, and the Writing of a New Constitution in Ecuador. Latin American Perspectives 38(1):47-62. The economy, based on the exportation of the country's raw materials, mainly oil, was also wreaking havoc on the nation's environment, an area with valuable biological and cultural diversity.Arsel, Murat 2012. Between 'Marx and Markets'? The State, The 'Left Turn' And Nature In Ecuador. Tijdschrift Voor Economische En Sociale Geografie (Journal of Economic & Social Geography) 103(2):150-163. The global economic crisis of 2008 revealed the vulnerabilities of an extractive economy, and led to a period of political turmoil in the country that made obviously the need for a new more inclusive government that embodied a post-oil, post-neoliberal development paradigm.Acosta, Alberto, Eduardo Gudynas, Esperanza Mart√≠nez, and Joseph H. Vogel 2009\\\\. Leaving the Oil in the Ground: A Political, Economic, and Ecological Initiative in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Americas Program Policy Report. In late 2006, the election of leftist Rafael Correa, who ran on an anti-neoliberal platform, showed the emergence of a new political era for Ecuador.  Development  =Sumak Kawsay / Buen Vivir= Buen Vivir (\\"good living\\") emerged as a response to the traditional strategies for development and their negative environmental, social, or economic effects. Sumak kawsay, meaning a full life and signifies living in harmony with other people and nature. Buen Vivir has gained new popularity, spreading throughout parts of South America and evolving as a multicultural concept. The constitution outlines Buen Vivir as a set of rights, one of which is the rights of nature.Gudynas, Eduardo. 2011. Buen Vivir: Today's Tomorrow Development 54(4):441-447. In line with the assertion of these rights, Buen Vivir changes the relationship between nature and humans to a more bio-pluralistic view, eliminating the separation between nature and society.SENPLADES. 2009 National Plan for Good Living. Electronic document, http://plan2009.senplades.gob.ec/web/en/presentation, accessed May, 2012. In Andean communities in Latin America development is expressed through the notion of sumak kawsay, the Quechua word for ‚Äòbuen vivir‚Äô, has been proposed as an alternative conception of development and has been incorporated into the constitutions of Ecuador. It connotes a harmonious collective development that conceives of the individual within the context of the social and cultural communities and his or her natural environment. Rooted in the indigenous belief system of the Quechua, the concept incorporates western critiques of dominant development models to offer an alternative paradigm based on harmony between human beings including the natural environment. = The idea = The Rights of Nature is not a new concept. Christopher Stone is widely credited with creating its first written work. In his famous book, \\"Should Trees Have Standing?\\", Stone presented the case for conferring legal personality and rights on the environment. As Stone explained, the natural object would ‚Äúhave a legally recognized worth and dignity in its own right, and not merely to serve as a means to benefit ‚Äòus‚Äô‚Äù. He also pointed out that just like \\"streams and forests\\" do not have the power to speak for themselves, neither do corporations, or states, infants, municipalities and universities. \\"Lawyers speak for them, as they customarily do for the ordinary citizen with legal problems.\\" Environmental activist and President of the Constitutional Assembly, Alberto Acosta published Nature as a Subject of Rights that first brought attention to the idea to the public and the government. Acosta proclaimed the Rights of Nature as a concept of historical progressivism. He compares it to when women were not thought of as subjects until they in fact became subjects of rights - so nature does not seem palpable in having rights- status until the concept is brought up and realized. The subject of rights are altogether inconstruable unless the concept is put into perspective and does in fact become a subject that is arguable, agreeable, or simply just talk- able. =Drafting= President Rafael Correa included calling for a Constitutional Assembly in his 2006 campaign. On April 15, 2007, over 80% of Ecuadorians voted in favor of calling a new assembly, thanks in large part to the support of indigenous communities. Indigenous groups had been pressuring for a new, more inclusive constitution for years, and were therefore actively involved in the drafting process. Alberto Acosta, the elected Assembly President, pledged to make the assembly more inclusive and incorporate the concerns of the indigenous into the constitution. In the end, a few indigenous representatives were elected to the assembly. To create a constitution based on the principles of Buen Vivir, the Constitutional Assembly, with the advice of the Pachamama Alliance, enlisted the help of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF) to draft language for the new provisions of the constitution detailing the Rights of Nature. Specifically the US lawyers Mari Margil (associate director) and Thomas Linzey (executive director) were asked to use their experience to help the Ecuadorean environmental groups draft the amendments. Indigenous groups also played a role in the drafting process. Fundaci√≥n Pachamama, in conjunction with leaders in CONAIE, met with members of the assembly to present their ideas for the constitution and gain support. A national media campaign detailing the tenets of the new constitution and the Rights of Nature was also launched to inform and gain support from the public.Fundaci√≥n Pachamama (FP). 2011 \\"Recognizing Rights for Nature in the Ecuadorian Constitution\\" Multiple Roundtables were held in order to discuss the feasibility of the Rights of Nature into the constitution. An important argument would be that of consent vs consultation. The indigenous communities and some members of the Constitutional Assembly advocated for a right to consent, meaning they wanted a clear right to oppose or approve development projects, whereas the government opposed with promoting only consultation. In conclusion, the government stance prevailed and Article 408 confirms that all natural resources are the state's property. The state can decide to exploit any natural resources that it recognizes to be of national importance, solely as long as it consults the affected communities, without having any obligation to an agreement. Assembly members Guillem Humberto and Ortiz Alfredo contended for the creation of an Ombudsman for Pachamama. This would replace the Minister of Environment, who was seen as inadequate, and would act as a legal guardian of nature's rights. In the end, Nature's Ombudsman was not added into the new constitution. In the end there were many reasons for wanting the Rights of Nature. As previously mentioned, indigenous groups, specifically the four members of the Pachakutik within the Constitutional Assembly, advocated for judiciary rights of their communities' way of living. A less sincere take would be that illustrated by Rafael Esteves, a member of the populist right. He said that it was greatly known that they would be the first to give nature its legal rights within their constitution, the mere fact of this is what drove some members into agreement with its passing. =Adoption= On April 10, 2008, with 91 votes out of 130, the Constitutional Assembly approved Article 10 for inclusion in the new constitution. On June 7, the language of Articles 71 through 74, compiling the Rights of Nature, were presented and debated on, before receiving approval for inclusion in the constitution. On September 28, 2008, a mandatory referendum was held to vote on the new constitution, where the adoption of the constitution was approved by 65% of voters.Smith, Gar. 2009, \\"In Ecuador, Trees Now Have Rights\\", Earth Island Journal 23(4):15-15. Articles of the Rights of Nature The following articles are found under Title II: Rights in the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador published in the Official Register on October 20, 2008. =Chapter One: Principles for the Enforcement of Rights= Article 10. Persons, communities, peoples, nations and communities are bearers of rights and shall enjoy the rights guaranteed to them in the Constitution and in international instruments. Nature shall be the subject of those rights that the Constitution recognizes for it. =Chapter Seven: Rights of Nature= Article 71. Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes. All persons, communities, peoples and nations can call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature. To enforce and interpret these rights, the principles set forth in the Constitution shall be observed, as appropriate. The State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an ecosystem. Article 72. Nature has the right to be restored. This restoration shall be apart from the obligation of the State and natural persons or legal entities to compensate individuals and communities that depend on affected natural systems. In those cases of severe or permanent environmental impact, including those caused by the exploitation of nonrenewable natural resources, the State shall establish the most effective mechanisms to achieve the restoration and shall adopt adequate measures to eliminate or mitigate harmful environmental consequences. Article 73. The State shall apply preventive and restrictive measures on activities that might lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems and the permanent alteration of natural cycles. The introduction of organisms and organic and inorganic material that might definitively alter the nation‚Äôs genetic assets is forbidden. Article 74. Persons, communities, peoples, and nations shall have the right to benefit from the environment and the natural wealth enabling them to enjoy the good way of living. Environmental services shall not be subject to appropriation; their production, delivery, use and development shall be regulated by the State.\\"2008 Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador. Political Database of the Americas (PDBA)\\". Philosophy The Rights of Nature is significant as it is the first case where this concept has been evoked at the national level. The articles set out a rights-based system that recognizes Nature, or Pachamama, as a right-bearing entity that holds value in itself, apart from human use. This differs from traditional systems that see nature as property, giving landowners the right to damage or destroy ecosystems that depend on their land. The rights-based approach spelled out in the Rights of Nature expands on previous laws for regulation and conservation by recognizing that nature has fundamental and inalienable rights as a valuable entity in and of itself. The system also assigns liability for damage to the environment and holds the government responsible for the reparation of any damage. Additionally, if an ecosystem's rights are violated, it gives people the authority to petition on behalf of the ecosystem to ensure that its interests are not subverted to the interests of individuals or corporations. The inclusion of the Rights of Nature also makes the constitution more democratic and inclusive, as it reflects the indigenes' idea of Nature as a mother that must be respected and celebrated. This is the first constitution that has incorporated indigenous concepts of sumak kawsay and Pachamama, as well as recognized the plurinationality of Ecuador. This has broad significance for the recognition of indigenous groups and their right to preserve their land and culture. The combination of human rights with the rights of nature will allow for more effective protection of indigenous communities. The Rights of Nature are further incorporated in the updated National Plan for Good Living, which states guaranteeing the Rights of Nature and promoting a healthy and sustainable environment as one of its twelve objectives. Policies under the objective include aims to preserve and manage biodiversity, diversify the national energy matrix with renewable sources, prevent, control and mitigate environmental damage, promote adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, and incorporate environmental approach in all public policies. = From Anthropocentric to Ecocentric = The environmental laws that exist in the Anthropocene are geared toward the advantage of the human race. The rules to protect the environment are set for the health and wellness of humanity. Nature is seen as a property to humans. The Anthropocene is catered to humans of privilege. Throughout history, it is evident that the government and powerful people have specified an otherness. \\"Like women, homosexuals and non- whites, nature is 'othered' by people through privileging law and rights that distinguish between subject and object.\\" Ecuador has taken action towards an ecocentric influenced constitution, giving nature legal, constitutional rights. This means that Ecuador has recognized nature, or Pachamama, as a capable and deserving right-bearing entity that is equal to humans. The Rights of Nature also transforms the relationship between nature and humans by asserting that nature is not just an object.Mychalejko, Cyril. 2008 Ecuador's Constitution Gives Rights to Nature. Philadelphia Independent Media Center. By putting ecosystems on an equal footing with humans, the conception of humans as masters or as separate from nature is dismissed. Instead, this system celebrates nature and recognizes that humans are a part of it. Many have thought this to be part of progressivism and related it to other examples of progression such as homosexual rights and the rights of women.  Outcomes / implementation  =Legal effects= The Rights of Nature has been applied to several legal disputes and considered in government development initiatives. Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja was the first case in history to vindicate the Rights of Nature. The lawsuit was filed against the local government near Rio Vilcabamba in March 2011, who were responsible for a road expansion project that dumped debris into the river, narrowing its width and thereby doubling its speed. The project was also done without the completion of an environmental impact assessment or consent of the local residents. The case was filed by two such residents, citing the violation of the Rights of Nature, rather than property rights, for the damage done to the river. The case was important because the court stated that the rights of nature would prevail over other constitutional rights if they were in conflict with each other, setting an important precedent. The proceedings also confirmed that the burden of proof to show there is no damage lies with the defendant. Though the plaintiffs were granted a victory in court, the enforcement of the ruling has been lacking, as the local government has been slow to comply with the mandated reparations.Daly, Erin. 2012, \\"Ecuadorian Exemplar: The First Ever Vindications of Constitutional Rights\\", Review of European Community & International Environmental Law 21(1): 63-66. Rep√∫blica del Ecuador Asamblea Nacional, Comisi√≥n de la Biodiversidad y Recursos Naturales In March 2011, right after the ruling on the Wheeler case, the government of Ecuador filed a case against illegal gold mining operations in northern Ecuador, in the remote districts San Lorenzo and Eloy Alfaro. The rights of nature were violated by the mining operations, which were argued to be polluting the nearby rivers. This case is different from the previous in that it was the government addressing the violation of the rights of nature. It was also swiftly enforced, as military operation to destroy the machinery used for illegal mining was ordered and implemented. Yasuni ITT initiative The Yasuni-Ishpingo, Tambococha, and Tiputini (ITT) Initiative, referring to the corridor of oil reserves within the Yasuni National Park, is the first post-oil development initiative that recognizes that the benefits gained from the Amazon are greater than the economic benefits from oil extraction. The aim of the initiative is therefore to protect the biodiversity of the area, which UNESCO has declared a biodiversity reserve, by keeping the oil reserves in the ground, in return for compensation from the international community for at least half of the projected benefit Ecuador would receive from the oil extraction (approximately $3.5 billion). These funds would be used to fund other economic initiatives to alleviate poverty and develop the renewable energy sector. The importance of keeping the oil in the ITT area in the ground has been argued as of international importance to mitigate the effects of global climate change by preventing CO2 emissions and the local environmental devastation the extraction would cause. The Rights of Nature and other articles of the new constitution also make the protection of the park a legal imperative, as the extraction would be a violation of nature's rights. Though there originally was some difficulty evoking a sense of international responsibility to fund the initiative, especially with the national constitution requiring this law already, eventually in August 2010 Ecuador came to an arrangement with the UNDP for funding of the initiative through the issue of Yasun√≠ Guarantee Certificates, denoting the amount of CO2 emissions avoided and their monetary value, which can potentially be used in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme. Reactions =Praise= The adoption of the Rights of Nature by Ecuador has received praise internationally by many countries who see this as a revolutionary way to conceptualize the environment and a way for Ecuador to move beyond the extractive economy of its past. Initiatives to adopt the concept of ecosystem rights have been taken or are being taken in various parts of the world, including Bolivia, Turkey, Nepal, and various municipalities in the United States. In 2010, Bolivia adopted the Law of the Rights of Mother Earth to recognize rights of nature at the national level. The Colombian Constitutional and Supreme Courts recognized rights for the Atrato river and Amazon ecosystem in 2016 and 2018, respectively. =Criticisms= Criticisms of the Rights of Nature have generally centered on the mechanisms of enforcement of the provision. One criticism is that though the constitution establishes stronger regulations for the environment, it also gives the state the power to relax these regulations if found to be in the national interest. Therefore, much of the enforcement of the ecosystem's rights depends on the will of the government, or an active citizenry. Indigenous groups have also expressed dissatisfaction that the constitution does not give local communities veto power over projects affecting their land. The amendments only call for consultation of the projects, rather than consent by the surrounding communities, which can undermine their ability to uphold the rights of nature. There are also concerns that the Rights of Nature could negatively affect foreign direct investment since companies will not want to comply with the more stringent regulations. On the other hand, people are skeptical of the Correa administration for still approving projects by foreign extraction companies violating the Rights of Nature. This skepticism comes from the history of corruption within the Ecuadorean government. As well as the facts that Correa is shutting down any environmental groups that stand for the Rights of Nature such as the Accion Ecologica (AE) as well as the Development Council of the Indigenous Nationalities and Peoples of Ecuador (CODENPE). There is much criticism on the text itself of the Rights of Nature, specifically on their content and structure. Some argue the controversy or clashing of articles and the lack of hierarchy between them. There is no clear understanding whether human's constitutional rights or nature's constitutional rights has more power. Another thing would be the vagueness of the text that leaves a lot of important factors without specific definition. Ecuador does not define \\"la naturaleza\\" or \\"Pachamama,\\" making the extents of the groups involved unclear. It also leaves to question who is given judicial standing to represent nature, and who is going to enforce those rights. Along those same lines, the extent of protection or remediation is unspecified.

The statue depicts Jiz≈ç (Ksitigarbha in Sanskrit), who in Japanese Buddhism is the bodhisattva of the earth, and is considered a protector of children and travelers. He is also a rescuer of beings in hell and is considered a guardian of souls for children that have died before their parents.  Description  Jiz≈ç is garbed in traditional monk's attire, lacking ornate jewelry and adornments typically seen on images of Bodhisattvas. He is shown in a standing position, with his right foot slightly forward, a common pose for this bodhisattva used to indicate his physical presence walking through the present world. In his right hand Jiz≈ç carries a six ringed alarum staff, or khakkhara, used to warn insects of his presence, and in his left hand he carries a cintamani jewel, believed to light up the dark as well as grant wishes. Below Jiz≈ç is situated an open lotus flower, a traditional Buddhist symbol of purity amidst the imperfections of the physical world.  Style  The style of this statue is reflective of the transioning attitudes and ideals observed in the early Kamakura period. During this time Japan faced a shift from the nobility that governed the late Fujiwara period to the \\"landowning military men\\" that seized power at the start of the Kamakura period. Dramatic shifts in politics, society, and culture resulted in a transformation of artistic design, with focus placed heavily on realism and honesty. Additionally, the Kamakura era marked a turning point in religious activity, with Buddhism becoming more heavily practiced among the masses Stylistically, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva (Jiz≈ç Bosatsu) reflects this shift towards Buddhism in its depiction of the Bodhisattva, as well as the realism of early Kamakura art in the \\"highly stylized geometric\\" shaping of the statue's head and torso.  Acquisition  A detailed history of this statue is unknown. The work has however been dated to approximately 1175; it was acquired through the Evans Woollen Jr. Memorial Fund in 1959.

Web. 6 May 2012. History In 2007, Benjamin Shapiro, Pamela Abshire, Elisabeth Smela, and Denis Wirtz were granted a patent entitled ‚ÄúCell Canaries for Biochemical Pathogen Detection. They have successfully manipulated the sensors so that they are sensitive to exposure of certain dangers, such as explosive materials or biological pathogens. What sets CANARY apart from the other methods is that the system is quicker and has a lower number of false readings.New Cell-Based Sensors Sniff Out Danger Like Bloodhounds. Science Daily [Internet]. 2008 May 6 [cited 2011 December 5]. Existing pathogen detection methods required that a sample be packaged and sent to a lab where techniques such as mass spectrometry and Polymerase Chain Reaction ultimately provided a blueprint of the nucleotide sequences present in a sample. The pathogen was then determined based on a database of pathogen nucleotides on file. This often resulted in a large amount of false positives and false negatives due to the non-specific nature of nucleotide binding. These techniques also required time that is not feasible in imminent situations.P. Belgrader, M. Okuzumi, F. Pourahmadi, D.A. Borkholder, and M.A. Northrup, ‚ÄúA Microfluidic Cartridge to Prepare Spores for PCR Analysis,‚Äù Biosens. Bioelectron., vol. 14, nos. 10‚Äì11, 2000, pp. 849‚Äì852.

It has the ability to detect pathogens in a variety of media, both liquid and air, at a fraction of the concentration that older methods required to produce a viable signal. CANARY uses the B cell, a form of white blood cell that forms the basis for natural human defense.T.H. Rider, M.S. Petrovick, F.E. Nargi, et al., ‚ÄúA B Cell‚ÄìBased Sensor for Rapid Identification of Pathogens,‚Äù Science, vol. 301, 11 July 2003, pp. 213‚Äì215 An array of these b-cells is attached to a chip. Genes for producing antibodies are naturally on in these b-cells, which allow antibodies to coat the exterior surface of the cells. The genes for coding antibodies are then up-regulated in these cells, which allows for greater antibody production and therefore more of the cell surface to be coated in antibodies.Petrovick, Martha S., James D. Harper, Frances E. Nargi, Eric D. Schwoebel, Mark C. Hennessy, Todd H. Rider, and Mark A. Hollis. \\"Rapid Sensors for Biological-Agent Identification.\\" http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/journal/pdf/vol17_no1/17_1_3Petrovick.pdf . Web. 6 May 2012. This engineering principle allows lower concentrations of antigen to be detected by the cells. Antigens can then bind to the antibodies, resulting in a few naturally occurring B-cell reactions. At the final step of these reactions, Ca2+ ions are released, and in the presence of aequorin, photons are emitted. Aequorin is a photoprotein that can be extracted from marine organisms such as luminescent fish.M.J. Cormier, D.C. Prasher, M. Longiaru, and R.O. McCann,‚ÄúThe Enzymology and Molecular Biology of the Ca2+-Activated Photoprotein, Aequorin,‚Äù Photochem. Photobiol., vol. 49, no. 4, 1989, pp. 509‚Äì512. The emitted photons can then be read by a chip, on which the array of modified B cells have been attached to, ultimately providing a readout of the pathogen(s) present. Step1: B cells are exposed around by antigens. Step2: antigens are attached with antibodies. Step3: tyrosine kinase leads to IP3 and DAG, Ca2+ is released. Step4: Ca2+ channel is opened and aequorin emits photons. Step 5, photons are detected. A unique set of responses is exhibited after exposure to each individual pathogen.Petrovick, Martha S., James D. Harper, Frances E. Nargi, Eric D. Schwoebel, Mark C. Hennessy, Todd H. Rider, and Mark A. Hollis. \\"Rapid Sensors for Biological- Agent Identification.\\" http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/journal/pdf/vol17_no1/17_1_3Petrovick.pdf . Web. 6 May 2012. Therefore, cells will react differently to the introduction of a specific pathogen, the specific nature in which the ‚Äúcanary‚Äù cells respond to the pathogen indicates the unique identity of the pathogen that has been introduced. The more responses of a cell to a pathogen that are measured the more precisely the pathogen can be identified. Finally, after determining the presence and identity of the pathogen, all infected people can be effectively treated.Shapiro Benjamin, Abshire Pamela, Smela Elisabeth, Wirtz Denis, Inventors. Cell Canaries For Biochemical Pathogen Detection. United States patent US 20070212681. 2007 September 13. Application There still need improvements on specific aspects of this complicated process. Some of the challenges include \\"building circuits that can interact with the cells and transmit alerts about their condition\\", developing technology to control the position of the cells on the chip, keeping the cells viable once on the chip and creating a living environment that supports the cells but protects the sensitive parts of the sensor.Shapiro Benjamin, Abshire Pamela, Smela Elisabeth, Wirtz Denis, Inventors. Cell Canaries For Biochemical Pathogen Detection. United States patent US 20070212681. 2007 September 13. The implications of a faster pathogen detection technology are widespread. A patient would be able to visit a medical professional, provide a sample of blood or urine, and get an analysis within minutes.Petrovick, Martha S., James D. Harper, Frances E. Nargi, Eric D. Schwoebel, Mark C. Hennessy, Todd H. Rider, and Mark A. Hollis. \\"Rapid Sensors for Biological-Agent Identification.\\" http://www.ll.mit.edu/publications/journal/pdf/vol17_no1/17_1_3Petrovick.pdf . Web. 6 May 2012. No longer would the patient and doctor have to wait on lab results to determine the presence of foreign bodies. The military would be able to test air samples and water samples to discover threats immediately before dispatching. High profile and even regular office buildings could have these sensors in every corridor to proactively hunt out air-borne pathogens, leaving enough time for evacuation.Petrovick, Martha S., James D.

The school was established in 1904 and is part of the ESIEE network of graduate schools. ESIEE Paris offers its students general engineering training with the aim of enabling them to design, produce and oversee complex industrial systems while meeting strict economic constraints and dealing with an international environment. To accomplish this, the school renders advanced scientific and technological training, which is frequently updated to keep pace with changes in the leading edge technologies and supplemented by its association with language, general culture, economics and humanities teaching. ESIEE Paris belongs to the Paris √éle-de-France Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The school is also a member of the Conf√©rence des Grandes √âcoles, and University of Paris-Est. The 'modernist' school building located at Marne-la-Vall√©e has been designed and conceived by the famed French architect Dominique Perrault. ESIEE Paris History It was founded in 1904 and was known until the 1960s as the Breguet school. Created in 1904, under the patronage of a family whose three generations contributed to the progress of electricity in the nineteenth century, their descendants accepted that the new school be called Breguet School. The school, from its inception, is intended to constitute in the field of science and technology of electricity, the equivalent of what had been for a long time, the National Schools of Arts and Crafts for mechanics, and delivers an engineering degree. Recognized by the State by decree of January 3, 1922, the order of diploma is signed by the Minister of Supervision in 1926. Following the law of July 10, 1934, which specified the conditions of issue and the use of the title of qualified engineer, the Breguet School continues to appear on the list of establishments entitled to issue the title of engineer, after three years of consecutive studies at an entrance examination, aligned with the admission requirements of similar public schools. At the very beginning, in 1904, it was not about electronics, let alone about computers and systems, but about electricity and mechanics. As the technical and technological evolution progressed, the School's teaching was adapted. Terrestrial television and radio courses appeared in the 30s and 40s and were replaced and strongly developed after the war under the general term of electronics. The scientific and technical education, supplemented by a broad general education allowed some 4 000 engineers from the 60 promotions, to adapt to all the circumstances of their professional life. Breguet is found in a wide range of industries, in its first place, obviously, in electrical or mechanical construction, electronics, aeronautics, but also in national services such as EDF, Public Works, Transport, etc. In 1960, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Paris, anxious to add to its teaching work a training of engineers, chooses Breguet School, which develops from that time a wide collaboration company-school. The last class of engineers from √âcole Breguet was released in 1965. In 1968, the School became known as √âcole Sup√©rieure d'Ing√©nieurs in Electrical Engineering and Electronics; however, the first engineers with the title of ESIEE engineers came out in 1966. It is presently operated by the Paris Chamber of Commerce. Some of the students come directly from high school and graduate after five years while others, who follow the traditional path to the Grandes √©coles, come from a preparatory classes and graduate in three years. Academics Approximately 400 of the 1,800 students in Paris graduate every year and 60% of them have spent at least three months studying or working outside France. Depending on their specialization, they can attend classes in its 650 m2 (7000 ft2) clean room. It is known as the first engineering school to have students design and launch an artificial satellite, named SARA, in 1991, as part of extracurricular work in ESIEESPACE, a student club. During the last two years, students choose a specialization among the following subjects: * Computer science * Signal processing and telecommunications * Network engineering * Electronics and microelectronics * Embedded systems * Manufacturing systems engineering thumbDuring the last two years at ESIEE Paris, students choose a specialization among the following subjects: Computer science, Signal processing and telecommunications, Network engineering, Electronics and microelectronics, Embedded systems, Manufacturing systems engineering etc. ESIEE launched several masters of science programs in nano- science, MEMS, electronic engineering and system on a chip, programs to which international students and 4th and 5th-year ESIEE students may participate. =Partnership agreements with international institutions= In addition to the European Erasmus Programme, two main exchange programs are offered to the students: * The Tripartite Programme, offered to outstanding candidates, operates with the Karlsruher Institut f√ºr Technologie, the University of Southampton, and the ICAI in the Universidad Pontificia Comillas. Under this program, students spend their last two years in two universities of their choice. * The Entree Programme, allows students to transfer to 17 other European universities. Under this program, students spend the first semesters of the last two years in two universities of their choice.

The department has several research activities including Architecture and parallelism for image processing and virtual reality, Discrete geometry, computational geometry, Mathematical morphology and image processing, Optimisation, modelling and machine learning & Signal processing etc. =Sensors, Health, Energy and Environment= The research activity in this area is focused, primarily on the issues of sustainable cities and the well-being of the person. While considering the assortment of data that sensors can deliver, 'Examination Microsystems' is more intense than straightforward sensors. At the point when lessened to the 'Lab-on-chip' scaled down configuration, they turn out to be minimal effort and gain a critical place for supportable city instrumentation. The EquipEx ‚ÄòSenseCity' project is well-regarded in this context.

He is best known for his collaboration with British military historian Shelford Bidwell. A wartime graduate of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Graham served in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War. He was wounded twice, spent time as a prisoner of war in Italy, and was awarded the Military Cross in 1945. After the war he served with the British Army of the Rhine, and represented Great Britain in cross-country skiing at the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. After leaving the army in 1958, Graham moved to Canada, where he taught high school maths in Saint John, New Brunswick. He earned his Master's degree from the University of New Brunswick in 1965, and a Doctor of Philosophy from the University of London in 1969. He taught military history at the University of New Brunswick until his 1986 retirement, at which point he was named professor emeritus, and returned to England. Early life Dominick Stuart Graham was born in Yeovil, England, on 24 July 1920, the son of Colonel Fergus Reginald Winsford Graham and Egeria Marion Spottiswood Baker. His father was a soldier who had served in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and China. His family nicknamed him \\"Toby\\" because when he was a baby they thought he looked like Toby the Dog in Punch and Judy. He was educated at Bradfield College, and entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in January 1939. Military career Graham's training was shortened by the outbreak of the Second World War. He graduated from Woolwich on 4 November 1939, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. In 1940 he was sent to Narvik during the Norwegian campaign to command an anti-aircraft battery, and was wounded during an air raid. He was promoted to lieutenant on 4 May 1941. In July 1942, Graham was serving as a Forward Observer (FOO) near Tobruk, Libya, during the Western Desert campaign, when his vehicle was hit, and he was taken prisoner by the Germans, and sent to a prisoner of war camp in Italy. His first escape attempt was through a sewer near Chieti, but was unsuccessful. He was then taken to a camp at Fontanellato, from which he again escaped. This time he made it as far as the railway station before he was recaptured. He was freed after the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943, and made his way back to Allied lines through Italy, evading German patrols, and eventually reaching a village near Ortona, where he was discovered by a Canadian patrol. Graham returned home to the School of Gunnery to bring his skills up to date, and then served in the North-West Europe campaign of 1944‚Äì45 as a battery commander in the Guards Armoured Division, reaching the temporary rank of major. On 16 February 1945, while serving as a FOO, he was again wounded during a German counterattack, but refused to be evacuated until the attack was repelled. For this he was mentioned in despatches on 22 March 1945, and awarded the Military Cross on 19 April 1945. After the war Graham served as instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and then as a staff officer with the 6th Armoured Division in the British Army of the Rhine. He commanded the British Army's first missile-equipped artillery battery. He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 1 July 1946, and major on 4 November 1952. He married Valerie Mary Greig on 18 October 1947; they had two daughters, Anita Caroline and Patricia Robin. He retired from the British Army on 20 December 1958. Skiing career Graham represented Great Britain in cross-country skiing at the 1956 Winter Olympics at Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, where he finished 29th of 33 competitors in the men's 50 kilometres. Academic career After leaving the army, Graham moved to Canada, where he taught high school mathematics in Saint John, New Brunswick. He earned his master's degree from the University of New Brunswick in 1965, writing his master's thesis on \\"British intervention in defence of the American colonies, 1748‚Äì1756\\", and a Doctor of Philosophy from the University of London on the same topic in 1969. Graham taught military history at the University of New Brunswick until 1986, when his marriage broke up and he decided to retire and return to England. He received the news of his appointment as emeritus while climbing K2 in the Himalayas. He married his childhood sweetheart, Mary Hawson in 1991, and they settled in Yorkshire, where he worked on her family estate and gardens. After she died he travelled by container ship to visit his daughter in New Zealand. The only other passenger aboard the ship was Ursula Behringer, and they were married in 2002. Graham is best known for his collaboration with British military historian Shelford Bidwell, a fellow military historian and former Royal Artillery officer, whom he first met at a bar near Sandhurst after a seminar on the use of artillery on the Western Front of the First World War. The two had a long and close collaboration despite living on different sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Their first book, Fire-Power (1982) was about the development of artillery in the two world wars. Their second, Tug of War (1986), was about the Italian campaign during the Second World War.

The name comes from the village where the theatre is located. The group gained international critical acclaim, and is classified as an experimental anthropological theater. In 1997 the association established the Academy for Theatre Practices. This carries out numerous projects: research, arts, music, and cultural investigation into the humanities. W≈Çodzimierz Staniewski was a former collaborator of Jerzy Grotowski, and in his choice of just such an isolated environment, Staniewski may have been inspired by his work with Grotwoski in Brzezinka, but with an important difference: rather than emphasising an isolating escape from urban existence, Gardzienice represented for him a pursuit of integrative existence within a community, albeit of a different sort. From the outset, Gardzienice sought to work with the local people, taking interaction with them as both inspiration for a way of life, and for a way of developing performance. It was in this environment that the whole basis for the group's early work, the 'expedition', was born. Staniewski describes the expedition as having \\"the character of a permanent journey through a chosen territory, with the possibility of not only touching on the culture of people, but also the \\"culture of the earth\\" . This may not constitute a strict anthropological exercise in the purely academic sense, and Staniewski may insist on a less clinical term, but at its heart is arguably an interest in the study of people. According to Richard Schechner, Gardzienice constitutes \\"the very heart and essence of Polish experimental and anthropological performance.\\"  Constellation  Staniewski uses the term \\"constellation\\" to describe a particular arrangement of actors/collaborators who come together to create a performance.[48] This is to emphasize the individuality of each actor, who personality contributes to the creation of a work. Each performance is matched to the predisposition of the actor, rather than the other way around. The director builds a constellation for each performance from scratch, inviting actors to cooperate with the Centre. Despite this practice, many artists remain in \\"Gardzienice\\" for many years. Staniewski does not look for professional theatre actors (he himself studied Polish language), but what matters is the personality of the candidate. Since the founding of the Academy for Theatre Practices, new actors are recruited mainly from among its graduates. The first constellation in 1977 was created by Staniewski with Henryk Andruszka, Jan Bernad, Tomasz Rodowicz, Waldemar Sidor, Jan Tabaka oraz Wanda Wr√≥bel. Since then, \\"Gardzienice\\" has included of over 50 actors, with none but Staniewski remaining from the original group. The longest-standing collaborator is Mariusz Go≈Çaj, who joined the team in 1979.

Brazil is the tenth largest energy consumer and the third largest in the Western Hemisphere, Coal accounts for approximately 5.8 percent of the country's total primary energy supply. It is the country's largest source of non-renewable energy (50 percent), followed by nuclear energy (27 percent), petroleum (eight percent), and natural gas (2.5 percent). Brazil produces about 6 million tons of coal per year, and total coal reserves are estimated at approximately 32.3 billion tons. It is also important in reducing reliance on imported oil and gas.Glauser, et al. 2005Zancan 2002 Brazil's coal-mining region is located in the southern part of the country, and the reserves are distributed among the states of Paran√° (1 percent), Santa Catarina (46 percent), and Rio Grande do Sul (53 percent). The southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul has majority of the coal reserves, but Santa Catarina is the largest producer of coal. The total Brazilian coal production in 2007 was 12,144,564 short tons, with the state of Santa Catarina producing 7,228,895 of those. The coal mining industry is of tremendous importance to these regions given the rapid expansion of Brazil's national economy. It is also important in reducing reliance on hydropower from other regions. While the coal mining industry helped spur the regional economies in southern Brazil, in turn impacting their respective societies, but this has come at a high price. Severe environmental degradation has resulted from poor mining practices, improper waste disposal, poor regulation, and lack of research. In the state of Santa Catarina alone, 3.5 million tons of coal are rejected annually and disposed of in landfills. This is more than half of Brazil's total annual coal extraction. The environmental problems have also translated into adverse effects for the mineworkers and those living in surrounding areas. A number of health, social, economic, and political concerns have arisen as a result of the mining industry. The Brazilian federal government even declared the state of Santa Catarina a site of environmental concern.Silva, Izquierdo, et al.: 2010 History Coal was discovered in the southern region of Brazil in 1822, and in the city of Lauro M√ºller in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil in 1827 by an English company. The industry was underdeveloped until the middle of the 20th century, however, because the coal was of poor quality and expensive to transport domestically. Therefore, higher quality and cheaper coal was imported from England and Germany. It was not until World War I that the mining industry in southern Brazil began to take off. Railway lines were extended, and a number of new mining companies were created. Get√∫lio Vargas‚Äôs government furthered the spur in coal exploration with its policies mandating the use of domestic coal. By 1960, there were more than twenty exploration mines in the Santa Catarina region. The petroleum crisis of 1973 further spurred the industry's growth. As a result, Brazil's coal mining processes underwent technological modernization and greater concern for the effects of coal exploitation, cleaning, transportation, mining, and combustion on human and environmental health. In spite of these advancements, though, low quality coal production continued to be characterized by poor working conditions and little regard for environmental and health impacts.Silva, Wollenschlager, Oliveira: 2010Silva, Oliveira, da Boit, and Finkelman 2008SATC Environmental impact Coal mining activity has a large impact on the environment, especially in the areas directly surrounding the mines. These environmental problems are the result of over 120 years of unregulated mining activity, lack of accountability and enforcement in regards to waste disposal, lack of knowledge, and different economic priorities. Since the first boom coal exploration in the mid-20th century, immediate and long-term physical, chemical, and biological changes in local ecosystems have resulted. (Zocche, et al. 2010) One of the biggest environmental threats related to coal mining is posed by waste disposal. Brazilian coal is characterized by high sulfide contents, pyrite and marcasite. The waste contains a broad array of elements including metals such as copper, cobalt, mercury, arsenic, and zinc among others. The contact of this waste material with air and water results in acid mine drainage (AMD), which can be detrimental to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Intense rains contribute to the seepage of waste deposits into the groundwater supply, generating and carrying the acid drainage from abandoned mines into the nearby rivers and streams. It increases turbidity and siltation, which in turn affects the food supply for the organisms in the affected areas. Seriously polluted sites may be environmentally hazardous despite the natural capacity of soils to reduce the solubility and bioavailability of toxic metals. Despite this capacity, environmental risks may persist at seriously polluted sites, including those that were abandoned decades ago. This is of relevance considering the 1000 abandoned mines in the state of Santa Catarina alone.Silva, Izquierdo, et al. 2010 Waste disposal is the principal cause of water pollution in the state of Santa Catarina. Coal strip mining methods and the surface disposal of waste rock results in the contamination of surface and ground waters. The Tubur√£o, Urussanga, and Ararangu√° Rivers in the state of Santa Catarina comprise the state's coal basin where there are 134 strip mine sites, 115 waste deposit areas, 77 sites with acidic pools, and hundreds of mines, and thus receive the majority of the waste generated. Coal drainage from each of these locations is responsible for high levels of water contamination. The resulting acidic streams affect local vegetation and prevent re-vegetation of affected areas.Silva, Wollenschlager, and Oliveira 2010Zocche, et al. 2010 Polluted water sources also means that the plants and sediments within them are contaminated. Organisms that feed off of these elements as well as terrestrial animals that are higher up in the food chain may accumulate toxic levels in their tissues. Open mines may fill with water and become lakes, and the toxic levels of heavy metals are thus transmitted to animals that drink and eat from the water source. Accumulation of these elements may also destroy the physical habitat by encrusting streambeds and aquatic plants. Soil degradation is another concern. Coal mining changes the morphology of the land and requires deforestation and vegetation removal. This, combined with improper waste disposal, increased erosion and instability of river and stream slopes, and the opening of caves, is responsible for soil degradation. In addition, thousands of hectares of land are now infertile and unusable for agriculture and other farming activities.Gomes, et al. 2011 Improper management of chemicals used in the mining process has led to incidences of spontaneous combustion, thus contributing to air pollution. The extraction and transportation of coal also causes atmospheric pollution. Coal fires from poor mining practices release fly ash, greenhouse gases, and toxic chemicals into the atmosphere, the results of which may be long lasting considering that these fires may burn for decades. Mining also releases coalmine methane, a greenhouse gas twenty times more powerful than carbon dioxide.Greenpeace International 2010 =Impact on humans= Coal mining activity has a negative impact on the health of both workers and the people in communities close to the mines. Chronic inhalation of coal dust has been linked to increased incidences of oxidative stress conditions that may result in lung damage; potentially toxic accumulation of metals in body tissues; diseases like pneumoconiosis (black lung disease), bronchitis, emphysema, fibrosis, and cancer; generation of proinflammatory factors; premature aging; prooxidant and antioxidant alterations that lead to cellular damage; cardiopulmonary disease; hypertension; skin lesions; and other lung and kidney diseases. Coal fires emit toxic levels of arsenic, fluorine, mercury, and selenium, which enter the local food chain via contamination of the air and water supplies. High concentrations of various trace elements like copper, uranium, nickel, and arsenic have been found in local water supplies, which could lead to serious health effects for people in the area.J√∫nior, et al. 2009; Glauser, et al. 2005 In the city of Lauro M√ºller in the state of Santa Catarina, studies show that respiratory diseases are responsible for an estimated thirty percent of medical procedures, and four percent were related to various forms of cancer. Higher incidences of metal-related cancer have been found among coal mine workers.J√∫nior, et al. 2009 Subsidence is another problem posed by coal extraction. The ‚Äúpillar‚Äù extraction mode was used until the 1990s. This method leaves behind pillars of coal to support the root of the mine. The mined-out areas frequently cave in, however, which may cause the foundations of houses above the mines to crack and leave fractures, and therefore render useless, areas often used for plowing. Coal mining also has a number of social and cultural impacts on the communities in the surrounding area. Societies and cultures have been displaced, which has resulted in the loss of traditional practices and other forms of cultural capital. Contaminated air and water supplies forces many to migrate in order to avoid the health consequences. The extraction of the coal through the pillar method often results in mine collapses, which are responsible for the deaths and injuries of hundreds of workers every year. Closure of a mining site results in job loss, which could in turn lead to immigration in search of new job opportunities, cultural disturbance, and social instability. Local economies are also affected. Wealth disparities result due to the lack of income in these single resource dependent regions. Coal-related activities affect the quality of land and water in surrounding areas, compromising large portions of needed land such as that in the watershed basin in southern Santa Catarina State. Thousands of families in the communities of the coastal ecosystem of the Laguna area depend on fisheries and other oceanic resources, but the marine ecosystem has been degraded by mining and other industrial activities. The storage of waste materials near urban and suburban areas may also cause a number of other problems for nearby populations, including bad odors, property devaluation, loss of crops, loss of land for recreation and leisure, and health related expenses. Government The Brazilian government has historically implemented legislation to address the environmental concerns related to coal mining activities. In 1980, for example, the Santa Catarina Coal Region was designated a ‚ÄúCritical National Area for Pollution Control and Environmental Conservation,‚Äù an early indication of effort on behalf of the government to recognize the problems in the region. The Federal Attorney General filed suit against the federal and state governments and coal companies in 1993, demanding the termination of environmental degradation by the active mines in the region and the environmental recovery of affected areas.Silva, Wollenschlager, Oliveira 2010 Legal framework also exists to pressure companies to assume responsibility for the environmental impacts of coal industry activities. The National Environmental Act of 1981 allowed for the creation of several government organizations in charge of evaluating the impact of practices potentially harmful to the environment and local communities. It allowed each state and municipality to establish its own environmental regulation system. It also introduced the idea of environmental impact assessment into Brazilian environmental legislation. The Brazilian Constitution (as of 1988) upheld this by obliging mining companies ‚Äúto reclaim the degraded environment, in accordance with the technical solution demanded by the competent public organization‚Äù by repairing environmental damages caused by their activity. They are required to maintain water quality within legal limits and are bound by these requirements even after the closure of the mine. The federal court has taken action to uphold this provision. In 2000, a federal judge in Crici√∫ma, Santa Catarina, ordered the establishment of a three-year recovery project by government-run companies that encompasses damages caused by coal mining activities in the state's entire coal region. The Supreme Federal Court condemned mining companies and the federal government for not abiding by these obligations and demanded that they take action. The remediation costs can total $20,000 to $40,000 per hectare according to the levels of degradation and intentions for future use. A technical advisory board was created in 2006 to assist the federal court in addressing reclamation actions based on environmental indicators. Future The environmental and human concerns arising from coal mining activity mandate immediate action and research in search of more sustainable practices. For example, mining companies like Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), Brazil's largest mining company, have invested large amounts of capital in clean technology. The company has also accepted a higher degree of social responsibility in the regions where its mines are located. Better working conditions, more proficient production, a healthier environment, an increased market value, a strong global reputation, and appreciation on behalf of the affected communities have all resulted from the company's actions. A number of other suggestions to address these issues have arisen. Because political and civil organizations at different government levels have influenced the Brazilian mining industry, the development of a sustainable mining region would require a multifaceted approach to address the social, political, and economic concerns of the international community, the Brazilian government (at the national, regional, municipal, and local levels), the mining companies, and the local communities. Long-term planning to include post-mine community development would also help ensure more sustainable practices. Reclamation projects on behalf of joint efforts between the government and mining companies have included surface and groundwater analyses and geological, hydrogeological, and structural mapping. About 818 abandoned mines have been mapped, and other pollution sources are being identified. The diversification of local economies to include non-coal related industries such as ceramics and agriculture has proven successful in regions like the Ararangu√° watershed. Improved mitigation procedures like confinement, dry covers, and vegetation have been found to significantly reduce the amount of pollution released from these sites. Selective spoil site management has proven to be one of the most successful measures to protect surface and groundwater supplies from contamination, and may be a valid practice to apply in the future construction of dump sites. The improvement of drainage system quality through this procedure can also significantly reduce the cost of purification treatment prior to discharge into the receiving catchment zones. The residue released during the waste removal process could be further processed and recycled, or it could be sent to safe disposal sites that would not risk human health in the communities surrounding the site. Coal projects are being developed using the ECOPLEX concept. This means that the projects use the by-products from one industry as raw material for other industries. This results in lower production costs, less energy consumption, and a decreased impact on local communities and the environment. The projects related to the Brazilian coal industry would recycle the waste for use in Brazil's growing hydrothermal industry. Procedures to reclaim abandoned mining sites have also been proposed. Using the coal pit as a landfill for other waste would help limit the areas impacted by mining activity. Using the area for forest and grassland development could help restore the ecosystems damaged by deforestation and contamination. Developing grassland areas and constructing ponds could help stimulate other forms of local economic ability like cattle raising and fishing. Given the extreme degradation caused by mining activities and the tremendous costs of reclaiming affected land and water areas, these measures face a number of challenges in their successful implementation.Koppe, et al. 2005 Other measures such as the restriction of truck traffic at night, the watering of roads to reduce dust formation, and the covering of trucks to prevent spilling have also been implemented by mining companies. These have not proven to be sufficient in providing any substantial change, but they should not be dismissed as viable environmental protection measures.

Geography  The castle, a small fortress, was built on a small hill in the Vosges Mountains facing the Jura plateaux. At an altitude of 736 m, it dominated the entry to Burgundy.  History  The castle belonged to the Counts of Ferrette and was built around the end of the 12th century. It protected an ancient Roman road from Langres that crosses the Vosges and passes by Rougemont. The castle watched over the southern entry to Alsace and symbolised the strength of the rulers of the region. With the extinction of the Ferrette line in 1324, the property passed to the Habsburgs. Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy (and Earl of Bedford) destroyed the castle at the end of the 14th century. Excavations began in 1977 preceding a complete restoration of the castle.

He worked in Major League Baseball during 1987‚Äì1999 (in the National League) and 2002‚Äì2010. His uniform number was 29.  Umpiring career  Prior to joining MLB, Hohn served in numerous other professional baseball leagues during 1977‚Äì1988. He umpired four MLB games during 1987, 32 in 1988, then 96 in 1989; during his 21 seasons as an MLB umpire, he worked a total of 2195 regular season games, 10 postseason games, and one All-Star Game. He umpired in the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and the National League Division Series in 1996, 1998, and 2005. He issued a total of 89 ejections, leading MLB umpires in ejections twice, with eight in 2008 and nine in 2009. Hohn was the home plate umpire for Hideo Nomo's no-hitter on September 17, 1996.

January 27, 2012. =Controversies= On July 5, 1992, while umpiring a game between the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs, Hohn approached the Braves dugout while arguing with Atlanta player Terry Pendleton, with the dispute leading to the ejection of Braves manager Bobby Cox. After a fan made a gesture with his hand toward Hohn, the umpire called for security to have the fan removed from the stadium. However, the fan would only be required to move 29 rows back. On June 21, 2009, Hohn ejected Braves players Eric O'Flaherty and Chipper Jones, and manager Cox, for arguing balls and strikes. O'Flaherty, on an 0‚Äì2, pitch seemingly struck out J. D. Drew in Boston. Hohn called the pitch a ball (visual evidence showed otherwise) and then ejected the three Braves following Drew's single off the Green Monster. A run would score on the play to make the score 5‚Äì4 in favor of Boston. On July 29, 2009, Hohn again roused the ire of the Braves after he exchanged a fist-bump with Florida Marlins catcher John Baker at the conclusion of a Braves‚ÄìMarlins game. Hohn had ejected Braves manager Cox and catcher Brian McCann from the game. Terry Pendleton, then Braves hitting coach, called the fist-bump \\"shocking\\", while Chipper Jones said, \\"I've never seen it before in my 16 years.\\" Hohn declined to comment on the situation, other than to state that the league had reviewed it. On May 31, 2010, Hohn ejected Houston Astros pitcher Roy Oswalt from a game against the Washington Nationals, although Oswalt told Hohn that he was not talking to him. MLB executive Bob Watson stated that Oswalt would not receive more punishment, while Hohn would be addressed \\"in a very stern way.\\" It was the first time Oswalt had been ejected since August 2004, when he was thrown out by Hohn after a hit batsman.

It is native to the southeastern United States, where it grows on the coastal plain.Ctenium aromaticum. Grass Manual Treatment. This is a perennial grass that forms clumps of stems reaching 1 to 1.5 meters in maximum height. The leaves are up to 46 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a panicle with one branch that is up to 15 centimeters long and lined on one side with two rows of spikelets. Each spikelet is roughly a centimeter long. It is not known whether or not the grass was ever used as a remedy for toothache. It has, however, been used as a sialagogue, an agent that increases saliva.

This is not a commercial brand, but a marketing strategy. Fair trade is based on higher prices paid by consumers that allow an equitable distribution of gains from trade over the chain partners.La Cruz, G. \\"The Contribution of Fair Trade Towards Market Access by Smallholder Banana Producers.\\" Agro-Food Chains and Networks for Development, 14 (2006): 69-78. There are many of organizations involved in producing fair trade bananas; for example, an organization called Banafair began importing uncertified/unlabeled fair trade bananas into Germany in the mid-1980s (from 500 to 1 000 tonnes annually). In 1997 Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International (FLO) was established in Bonn, Germany to consolidate various labeling initiatives and establish worldwide standards for fair trade bananas. The first fair trade labelled bananas imported to Germany were by TransFair in April 1998. Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International, (now renamed Fair Trade International), is a large importer whose bananas bear the International FairTrade Certification Mark. FLO-CERT is the international body that inspects the farms to ensure they meet the proper social and environmental according to Fair Trade international standards. Global banana industry Five companies control about 80% of the conventional banana trade. This situation, plus the intervention of various governments, has kept the price paid to banana growers and wages to workers a small percentage of the supermarket price.Wiley, James.

In Colombia, banana companies have been known to get involved with paramilitaries that kill human rights activists and confrontations with labor unions.(seeParamilitarism in Colombia for more information.)  Fair trade certification  FLO has different standards for small banana farms and larger banana plantations. To be eligible to display a Fair Trade Certification Mark, small farmers must create a panel of both workers and management to determine the best use of the fair trade premiums. Revenues to banana farmers must be equally shared between the working members of the cooperative or association. On larger plantations, the premiums can only be used for improving working and living conditions. Forced labor and labor of children under 16 years of age is prohibited, as is dangerous work. Young adults 16 years of age or older must not work so many hours that they have no time for education. Workers must be allowed to join a union, and be paid at least regional industry average or minimum wage. Although fair trade banana workers‚Äô wages are not significantly above industry averages, they receive wage related benefits which increase their overall livelihood. However, many small banana farmers barely make living wages themselves, and the restriction of premiums to community development projects may prevent them from covering basic living expenses.  Fair trade price and premium  Monetary premiums are paid for fair trade banana growers to improve their communities. In 2013, FairTrade Certified banana producers receive a FairTrade Minimum Premium of $1 US dollar per 18.14 kilogram box of bananas to invest in community projects. FairTrade farmers are guaranteed a minimum price to help cover the costs of sustainable production, but the price differs between regions and is subject to market fluctuations in the sustainable cost of agricultural production. Although FairTrade minimum prices vary, FairTrade Minimum premiums do not. Both FairTrade prices and premiums are set at the same level for FairTrade certified plantations and small farms.  Environmental impacts  The agricultural production of bananas on a large scale often uses more pesticides (and fungicides, fertilizers) than any other fresh fruit commodity.Koeppel, Dan.Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World.

Early life Born in Iowa, Spratt was the grandson of a house painter from whom he received his first lessons in painting. He later built upon this early training during his adolescence as a sign painter. He received his MA in Studio Art from University of Iowa in 1951, and in 1954 he began teaching in the Art Department at San Jose State University,Artshift San Jose ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Recalling The Momentious Sixties And Seventies where he taught the American figurative artist, Robert Graham (1938‚Äì2008) in 1961. In 1962 he took a sabbatical in England for one year, where he lived and painted representationally in St. Ives Cornwall, United Kingdom. During this period he created several figurative and landscape paintings.Contemporary Art America (1969 University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign), page 158 He returned to San Jose, California, in 1963 and continued to teach at San Jose State University where he served as the Chairman of the Art Department and as the interim Dean of Humanities and Arts.ArtSlant ‚Äì February 16th, 2008 ‚Äì July 6th, 2008, San Jose Museum of Art, Fred Spratt Color theory painting In 1970, he moved to Los Angeles and began to experiment with color theory, but continued teaching classes part- time at San Jose State University. Spratt was informed by the formalist art of Josef Albers, minimalist painting by Ellsworth Kelly and Ad Reinhardt, and abstract expressionist painting by Barnett Newman; his work was also deeply influenced by his early days as a sign painter.Peter Selz, West Coast Report: Plastics into Art (New York: Art in America, May‚ÄìJune 1968) 114 Spratt's color theory work is regarded for its mutability‚Äîchanging with the available light, time of day and season of year, with each viewer and with each viewing. During the 1960s in Los Angeles, many California artists were creating work that focused on the surface qualities of a work of art‚Äîa tendency that generated the descriptive phrase \\"finish fetish\\"‚Äîan immaculate, glistening, often translucent surface which conveys the look of a refined industrial process.Peter Plagens, Unslick in L.A. (New York: Art in America, 1978) 85 For thirty years he experimented with color theory in three main series: Semaphores, Scrolls and Diptychs, all of which are characterized by their flat application of acrylic lacquer onto aluminum. In 2004 Spratt described his artistic endeavor in the following way: ‚ÄúIt seemed I was seeking a way to put paint in the service of art while freeing it from the harness of depiction or narration. To let color be its own narrative through its combination and by the palpability of painted fields.‚Äù Frederick Spratt, Trooping the Colors (Santa Clara: Triton Museum of Art, 2004) 8 Several of his paintings from the 1970s were exhibited nationally at O.K.

The body was part of the Department for Communities and Local Government (DC&LG;) and was abolished in the 2010 UK quango reforms.  History  Founded in 2006 in response to increasing house prices, lack of affordable housing and as the result of the direct recommendation of Kate Barker‚Äôs March 2004 Review of Housing Supply, in which it was recommended that a body be created which could offer expert advice on housing matters, particularly that of affordability. Officially launched in June 2007, the body was originally chaired by Professor Stephen Nickell CBE, FBA (former warden of Nuffield College, Oxford), he held this role until November 2009 when Dr. Peter Williams became the body's chair. According to then Secretary of State Yvette Cooper, the body had a budget of ¬£1,459,000 for its first year of operation in 2007/2008 and had twelve full time equivalent paid staff. The then secretary of state also gave details of the original board members, them being: *Professor Stephen Nickell CBE FBA (Chair) *Prof. Glen Bramley, Professor of Housing and Urban Planning, Heriot-Watt University *Prof. Paul Cheshire, Professor of Economic Geography, LSE *Bob Lane, Chief Executive for Catalyst Corby/North Northants Development Co. *Max Steinberg, Chief Executive of Elevate East Lancashire *Dr. Peter Williams, Independent consultant on housing and mortgage markets and housing policy and acts as Executive Director of the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association.\\" The body's original purpose was to advise government, planners and other regional bodies on the subject of housing affordability and on the consequences of different housing level provision when they carried out works pertaining to the provision of planned housing (which they had been required to do since April 2007), to conduct and commission research relating to the housing market to gain a greater understanding of the housing situation, and to assist in the implementation of Kate Barker‚Äôs housing supply review . The unit's logo was designed by Lindsay Robertson of design collective Words and Stuff ‚Äì the logo was designed to be a simple demonstration of the unit's functions ‚Äì a speech bubble containing a graphical representation of a house; the unit aims to comment and advise on issues pertaining to housing so the logo was designed to reflect as such. The unit's board met monthly to discuss the unit's currents performance and to steer it in the right direction. Initial board appointments were made on 1 November 2006 ‚Äì appointments being made on behalf of Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government through open competition for a term of three years. These terms were extended in October 2009 for a further sixteen months, but Prof. Stephen Nickell chose to step down to 'concentrate on other interests', the office of Chair was filled by existing board member Dr Peter Williams. The Chief Executive was Neil McDonald, who managed a team of technical professionals such as economists, statisticians, geographers or planners.Neil McDonald took over from the first Chief Executive Kevin Williamson who set up the unit. The unit held a Parliamentary Reception in the House of Commons in May 2009 to raise awareness of the work carried out by the NHPAU, which was opened by David Drew. A review of the unit in autumn 2009 found that the organisation was performing well, and suggested it should also consider conducting research for local authorities into the housing market, improve the level of accessibility of the unit's publication and work closer with local bodies. In response to the review of the unit, and also to their paper published in February 2010 entitled Evaluating the requirements for market and affordable housing ‚Äì which provides an alternative to expensive local income surveys, by providing model guidance on Strategic Housing Market Assessments ‚Äì on 1 April 2010 a ministerial statement from the DC&LG; announced that the NHPAU had a new, extended remit. The remit was expanded to enable the unit to work closer with local authorities, at local and sub- regional levels, and a new project was announced which will research whether the availability of low-cost housing could be affected by activities other than simply property building. Then Minister of State for Housing and Planning John Healey said that the changes will ensure \\"the unit will help to make sure that we build more homes and in the right places\\", and then chair of the unit Dr. Peter Williams went on to say this: Shortly after the extension of the unit's remit, the 2010 general election was held, which saw a new Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government take office, which undertook the quango reforms (often referred to by the media as the bonfire of the quangos). As a result of these reforms, the NHPAU was listed for closure. The decision was announced on 28 June 2010, a DC&LG; spokesperson stated that: The DC&LG; made clear that the closure did not in any way show a lack of commitment on housing or understanding of the important issue of housing affordability, but that it was a stage in moving away from a \\"bottom-up rather than top-down approach that allowed local communities to control the way in which villages, towns and cities developed through local plans\\".

It is the southern terminus of SunRail, the commuter rail service of Greater Orlando. The station opened on July 30, 2018. The site was briefly used by Amtrak from 1974 to 1975. History In the mid 1970s, the site was planned as the southern terminus for Amtrak's inaugural auto ferry service called AutoTrak connecting Florida to Indianapolis Union Station, in competition with the Auto-Train Corporation's Auto-Train service. Amtrak initially built a complex with a 1,600 square foot modular building, a parking lot and two spur- lines with eventual plans for a 7,000 square foot facility. The initial complex opened on September 16, 1974 with the simultaneous arrival of the Floridian and the Champion trains. It was envisioned to be the official stop for tourists bound for Walt Disney World. The AutoTrak service never came to life, however, and the station was used for just over a year as a stop for the Champion and the Floridian until December 12, 1975 when those trains began stopping at Kissimmee instead. Sometime in the 1980s, the station building was demolished, the spur-lines were removed and the parking lot along with the access road into the site were abandoned and eventually overgrew with vegetation over the years. The site sat vacant until construction of the Poinciana SunRail station began in early 2016.

It was developed from an earlier system known as Elektra, and therefore the system is also known as Elektra-sonnen. When the British learned of the system they started using it as well, under the name Consol, meaning \\"by the sun\\". Elektra was an updated version of the beam-based low- frequency radio range (LFR) used in the United States during the 1930s. This was further modified to create Sonne by electronically rotating the signal to create a series of beams sweeping across the sky. Using simple timing of the signal, the navigator could determine the angle to the station. Two such measurements then provided a radio fix. Accuracy and range were excellent, with fixes around ¬º of a degree being possible at range. Sonne was so useful that it found widespread use by UK forces as well, and they took over operation after the war. The system was used for long-range navigation under the Consol name, and supported by ICAO as one of the suggested long-range air navigation systems. New stations were constructed around the world over the next twenty years. The system remained in partial use into the 1990s, with the last transmitter in Norway turned off in 1991. Background The bearing- bearing method of taking a fix using a nautical chart. In this case the navigator has taken three measurements, one against a prominent fuel tank on the shore, and two others against either side of a small island. The use of a third measure allows the position to be more accurately determined, but is not necessary. In navigation, the determination of a \\"fix\\" requires two measurements to be taken. Using classical methods, this was normally the measurement of two angles, or bearings, along the line-of-sight to prominent landmarks, like a lighthouse. After taking the two measurements, lines of position are drawn radiating from the landmarks along the reverse angle. The lines will cross at some point, and their intersection determines the location of the navigator.Charles Husick, \\"Chapman Piloting and Seamanship\\" (64th ed.), Hearst Communications, December 2003, p. 618 RDF The introduction of portable radio systems in the early 20th century gave rise to the possibility of using radio broadcasters (beacons) as a landmark that would be visible to a radio receiver at very great ranges, hundreds of miles or more. The angle between the navigator and the beacon can be measured by using a simple mechanism known as a loop antenna. As the antenna is rotated around a vertical axis, the strength of the received signal varies, and drops to zero (the null) when the loop is perpendicular to the line to the beacon.Joseph Moell and Thomas Curlee, \\"Transmitter Hunting: Radio Direction Finding Simplified\\", TAB Books, 1978, pp. 1‚Äì5. This technique, known as radio direction finding (RDF), is useful but only moderately accurate. Measurements better than a few degrees are difficult with a small loop antenna, and because of the electrical characteristics, it is not always easy to make a larger version that might provide more accuracy. Moreover, the addition of a loop antenna may not be possible on smaller vehicles, or difficult to operate for those without a dedicated navigator. Radio Range, Lorenz and Elektra  alt=White diagram with four rows: first is the letter N followed by a repeating sequence of dash-dot-space; second is the letter A with repeating dot-dash-space; third is A+N followed by a solid line; last line has the word 'time' followed by a right arrow Another solution to the radio navigation problem is to use a directional \\"beam\\" signal that can only be received in a certain area. Aircraft flying within the beam will hear the signal on a conventional radio. This presents a problem; the beam should be wide enough that an aircraft can find it, but narrow enough to be an accurate guide. The first attempts to address this issue were made in Germany as early as 1904. O. Scheller of the Lorenz company proposed a system using four signals in an overall fan-shaped pattern. Each of the signals was modulated audibly with the Morse code signal for N (dash-dot) or A (dot-dash), so a radio tuned to the broadcast frequency would hear one of these signals. The signals deliberately overlapped slightly, so there were areas where the listener would hear both at the same time. In this case the gaps in one signal would be filled in by the other, producing a steady tone known as the \\"equisignal\\". Several developments of this basic concept followed, but it did not become practical until World War I. By that time Germany's economy was limited and their aviation activities strictly curtailed. Practical development then moved to the United States, where it was used in modified form with two wide figure-8 shaped broadcast patterns that allowed easy capture of the signal. Instead of the short-range landing system proposed by Scheller, the US system was used to build the low-frequency radio range (LFR) system starting in 1928, offering wide-area navigation between airports\\"Blind Flying on the Beam: Aeronautical communication, navigation and surveillance, Its origins and the politics of technology\\", Journal of Air Transportation, 2003 To use the system, the aircraft would tune in the station on a conventional radio. They would then listen for the signal, and depending on whether they heard the A or N, would turn until they were flying in the middle of the beam where they heard the equisignal. The system was set up so the beam pointing to the west from one station had the opposite dot-dash pattern as the one pointing east from the next, so the pilot could tune in the stations on either end of a particular leg and hear the same signal from both. As they flew from station to station they would hear the signal from one fade and the other grow, until they passed over the station where they entered the \\"cone of silence\\".'\\"ICAO History: Canada\\" The Lorenz beam blind-landing system As the German economy recovered, development of the Lorenz system was picked up again in the late 1930s. Ernst Kramar was asked to develop a blind landing system more along the lines of Scheller's original concept. This emerged as a system generically known as a \\"Lorenz beam\\", which used three antennas and phasing techniques to produce highly directional signals only a few degrees wide. The transmitters were placed off the end of runways and the pilot could listen to the signals to fly down the fan-shaped signal to the runway. During World War II, even more accurate and long-range versions were used as night bombing aids; see the Battle of the Beams for details. As the German economy improved and Luft Hansa started a wider schedule, Kramar was asked to develop a system similar to LFF for use in Europe. He named this Elektra, after the character in Richard Strauss's opera of the same name. Using Lorenz beams, Elektra allowed each signal to be narrower, so a single station could provide a number of incoming and outgoing paths, instead of just four. In this way a smaller number of stations could be used in order to produce a series of airways that more directly connected airports. However, no deployment effort had taken place by the time the war started. Orfordness Beam systems like Radio Range or Elektra allowed an aircraft to fly along a line in space. If the aircraft flew out of the beam, no navigation information was available. Other techniques would have to be used to calculate their rough position, and try to tune in a suitable station to recapture the airway. RDF was a common solution, but this presented the problem of requiring RDF equipment. A solution to this problem was introduced by the UK in the late 1920s, and tested experimentally at the Orfordness Beacon. This system essentially reversed the RDF concept, placing the rotating antenna on the ground instead of the vehicle, spinning it slowly at 1 rpm (6 degrees a second). Any radio tuned to the station would hear the nulls as the antenna's pattern passed them. The trick, however, was knowing what angle the antenna was pointed at that instant. Orfordness solved this by sending out a Morse code \\"V\\" whenever the antenna was aligned directly north. By timing the delay between receiving the V and the null in seconds and then multiplying by 6, the bearing of the station was revealed. A second bearing to a similar station at RAE Farnborough provided a fix. Sonne Early in the war the Luftwaffe approached Kramar to see if Elektra could be adapted to allow general navigation, rather than beam- flying. He responded by adapting the Orfordness concept, but did so in a unique fashion that represented a dramatic advance in form. Instead of rotating a loop antenna, Sonne used three separate fixed antennas, spread along a line with each antenna 1 km from the next, a distance of three wavelengths at the 300 kHz operational frequency (several frequencies were used between 250‚Äì350 kHz). A single transmitter produced a signal that was sent directly to the centre antenna. The signal was also split off from the main feed and sent to a \\"keying unit\\". This further split the signal into one of two paths, each connected to one of the two side antennas. The keying unit sent the signal briefly to one antenna and then for a longer duration to the second, producing the dot-dash pattern used in the Lorenz systems. As the centre and one of the two side antennas were powered at any given time, the resulting radiation pattern was a cardioid. The key to the Sonne system was a further modification of the signal before it reached the antennas. A phase shifter was used to retard the signal by 90 degrees when it was sent to one of the side antennas, or advance it 90 from the other. This created a series of spikes, or lobes, within the cardioid radiation pattern, each about 7.5 degrees wide. As the antennas were physically separated, the spikes did not precisely overlap, producing the dots, dashes and equisignal zones of the Lorenz system. Finally, the phase delay signal was slowly \\"rotated\\". Over a period of 30 seconds, the advanced signal was retarded by 180 degrees, and the retarded signal advanced by the same 180 degrees. This caused the entire cardioid pattern to slowly rotate, dots clockwise, dashes counterclockwise. Navigating with Sonne This portion of a 1946 UK Consol map illustrates the basic concept of the Sonne system. Navigators would determine their rough location using any form of navigation, then tune in the Consol station and start counting the dots or dashes they heard. They would then look up this number on the chart, selecting the line that was closest to their estimated location. The green lines indicate the bearings from the new Bush Mills station in Northern Ireland, red from the Stavanger station in Norway. Once a minute the signal to the side antennae was cut off, producing a pure tone that was broadcast omni-directionally from the centre antenna. This was keyed with a Morse code station identifier. The navigator could use this 6 second period to find the general location using RDF. This allowed them to determine which of the lobes of the pattern they expected to be located within. When the phase delays started up again, 2 seconds after the station identifier ended, the dot-dash keying started with it. The receiver would normally be located to one side or the other of the equisignal, so they would hear either dots or dashes - for this example let's say dots. As the pattern was rotated, the dots lobe moved away from the receiver while the dashes signal approached it. So over the 30 second period, the receiver will hear dots, then the equisignal (briefly), and then dashes. By timing the arrival of the equisignal, the navigator could determine their location within the lobe. Whereas Orfordness required this delay to be timed on a clock, Sonne keyed the signal once per second, allowing the timing to be captured simply by counting the number of dots or dashes. To make this process even easier, a series of nautical charts were produced with the counts listed on them. The navigator simply looked up the number on the chart to reveal the bearing. As the pattern rotated only 7.5 degrees over 30 seconds, and the timing was accurate only to a second, the accuracy of the system was theoretically 7.5 / 30, or ¬º of a degree. In practice, during the day at 300 nautical miles, accuracies of ¬±¬Ω degree were common when the receiver was located at right angles to the station's baseline, and ¬±1 degree at 70 degrees to the normal. Like most medium- and long-wave systems, accuracy degraded at night due to atmospheric effects, to ¬±1 degree on the normal and ¬±2 degrees at 70 degrees. Deployment It is a general rule in navigation that the most accurate results are measured when the two bearings are as close to 90 degrees apart as possible. As Sonne was a long-range system, it made sense to locate the stations at long distances from each other, to enlarge the area where there would be large angles between the stations. This led to deployments starting in 1940 with two stations in Spain and one in Norway. Additional stations were added throughout the war, including examples in the Netherlands, France, Spain and Germany. A total of 18 broadcasters were eventually constructed, some referred to as Sonne and others Elektra, although the reason for this naming is not clear in modern sources.J. van Tongeren, \\"Elektra-Sonne\\" The system was compromised by the capture of the German U-boat U-505 in 1944, leading to a complete understanding of the system in the UK. This proved so useful that Sonne was quickly adopted by RAF Coastal Command, who needed a longer-range system than Gee offered. To keep their use less obvious, all British records refer to the system as \\"Consol\\". Coastal Command's use became so widespread that they became completely dependent on the system. Late in the war, when the Germans lost access to Spain, a lack of parts led to one of the Spanish stations going offline. Edward Fennessy arranged a supply of spare parts provided by the RAF to keep it operational. Postwar use Sonne, now known by its UK code name Consol, was widely used in the post-war era. Compared to systems like VOR or RDF, Consol required nothing more in the navigating vessel than a conventional radio and the ability to count. This proved so attractive that new Consol stations were set up in France, Northern Ireland, and even three in the US (where it was known as Consolan) and several in the USSR. It was one of the ICAO's recommended long-range navigation systems. Although more accurate and easier to use systems were introduced, notably LORAN-C, Consol's low cost of implementation (a radio) kept it in use as a pleasure boating system for many years. Most Consol broadcasters remained in use until the 1980s, with the Stavanger station remaining online until 1991. By this point LORAN and GPS systems were falling in cost, and these had replaced most forms of radio navigation by 2000. =List of Consol stations= * Ploneis, France , call sign TRQ later FRQ, frequency 257 kHz * And√∏ya, Norway , call sign LEX, frequency 332.5 kHz * Bj√∏rn√∏ya, Norway , call sign LJS, frequency 332.5 kHz * Stavanger-Varhaug, Norway , call sign LEC, frequency 319 kHz * Lugo-Outeiro de Rei, Galicia, Spain , call sign LG, frequency 303 then 285 kHz * Sevilla, Spain , call sign SL, frequency 311 then 315 kHz * Jan Mayen Island, Svalbard and Jan Mayen , call sign LMC, frequency 332.5 kHz * Bushmills, Northern Ireland, UK , call sign MWN, frequency 263 then 266 kHz * Miami, FL, USA , call sign MMF, frequency 190 kHz * Nantucket, MA, USA , call sign TUK, frequency 194 kHz * San Francisco, CA, USA , call sign SFI, frequency 192 kHz * Kanin Nos, Russian SFSR, USSR , call sign KN, frequency 269 kHz * Ostrov Pankrat'yeva, Russian SFSR, USSR , call sign PA, frequency 280 kHz * Rybachi, Russian SFSR, USSR , call sign RB, frequency 363 kHz And√∏ya, Bj√∏rn√∏ya and Jan Mayen Island shared the same frequency.

Varigotti is a frazione (locality) of the comune of Finale Ligure, in Liguria, northern Italy. Panorama di Varigotti History In late antiquity times, it was known as Varicottis. In 643, when it was home to a Byzantine fortification, it was destroyed by the Lombard king Rothari. Later it suffered from Saracen raids, and in the 12th century it was contended between the marquisses of Noli and the Del Carretto family. Later it was a possession of the Republic of Genoa, and became an autonomous commune after the French Revolution. In 1869, during the construction of the Genoa- Ventimiglia railroad, it was annexed to the Final Pia commune, and was subsequently part of the comune of Finale Ligure. Tourism Varigotti is a popular tourist destination, with both seaside and natural attractions.

It is operated by the company Midttrafik. The first line opened in December 2017, but the system is under continuous development and expansion. Service on the intercity section Odder to Lisbjergskolen opened on August 25, 2018. A third intercity line to Gren√• opened on 30 April 2019. More lines are being planned. On 8 May 2012, the Danish Parliament approved the construction of the first line; work to build Phase 1 commenced during September 2013. It was originally planned to open in August 2016, but this was delayed, in part due to legislative issues in relation to railway safety. Two types of rolling stock have been operated over the first line, conventional trams which are slower and restricted to only running along some parts of the route and hybrid tram-trains that can be operated on the conventional heavy rail network, the latter being used for the long-distance services. The Aarhus Letbane is the only operational light rail system in Denmark.The Copenhagen Metro is categorised as Light Metro Light rail systems are planned or under construction in both Odense and Greater Copenhagen. History =Background= The development of a light rail system around Aarhus, the second biggest city in Denmark, was originally proposed as early as 2006. In response to rising interest in the concept, during January 2009, the Danish Parliament granted an allocation of DKK500 million ($85 million) to support the light rail project as part of a wider green transport package. During October 2010, work commenced upon several studies.\\"Aarhus Light Rail Project, Aarhus.\\" railway-technology.com, Retrieved: 9 June 2018. According to transport authority Midttrafik, who later operated the completed network, the Aarhus light rail programme had drawn considerable inspiration from tram-train operations on the tram network in Kassel, Germany. In addition, consultancy firms COWI A/S and SYSTRA contributed their own studies and technical support for the project, including an initial feasibility study and development of tender documentation. The project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report was produced by C. F. Moller; it was estimated that establishing the light rail network would result in annual energy savings of 47 gigawatts and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 7,300 tonnes during each year of operation. Various different approaches for the network were being considered at one stage, including the full electrification of the route, the procurement of a combination of 750 V DC trams and electro-diesel tram-trains. It was recognised that, if the option of full electrification was to be exercised, a catenary-free system may be chosen for the harbour-side element of Phase 1. By late 2012, it had already been decided that Germany's BOStrab light rail regulations would be applied to the tentative network, while Lloyd's Register was appointed to serve as the independent safety assessor. By mid-2012, construction activity was scheduled to begin during June 2013, while the light rail network's opening was planned to occur during August 2016. On 8 May 2012, the Danish Parliament gave its approval for the construction of the Aarhus light rail line, which would be the first such modern line in Denmark, and granted the legal powers to proceed with the initiative. As a consequence, the Aarhus Letbane joint venture between the local municipality, the Ministry of Transport and the Midtjylland region was formally established to promote and further the project during August 2012. The construction of Phase 1 has been estimated to have cost DKK 2.4 billion ($408 million); financing was provided by the City of Aarhus (47.2 per cent), the Danish central government (47 per cent) and the Central Denmark Region (5.8 per cent). Additionally, the European Investment Bank provided DKK14.2 million to the initiative as part of the European Commission‚Äôs European Local Energy Assistance programme (ELENA).Benabdelaziz-Tair, Fatima. \\"Energy efficiency: Trams gain traction in Denmark.\\" European Investment Bank, 4 May 2017. The competitive tendering process for the network's construction was launched shortly after the formation of the joint venture. The contracts for the construction of Aarhus light rail line were awarded in three separate packages; these included a negotiated design-and-build contract that covered both the railway systems and rolling stock, valued at between ‚Ç¨150 million and ‚Ç¨180 million, along with a pair of lower value contracts to build the related civil works for the line. During July 2014, a German-Italian consortium, comprising Stadler Rail and Ansaldo STS, was awarded the contract for the construction and outfitting of Phase 1 of the Aarhus light rail. Stadler supplied the rolling stock for the line while Ansaldo STS provided the associated infrastructure, such as the tracks, signalling systems, control centre, and maintenance facility.\\"German- Italian consortium signs contract for the first LRT-system in Denmark.\\" intelligenttransport.com, 4 August 2014. =Phase 1= Phase 1 is a 12 km double-track tramway running from Aarhus H station, via Skejby and Lisbjerg to Lystrup. The line forms a loop spanning across Aarhus' city centre, linking into the existing regional railways running to Odder in the south and Grenaa in the northeast; to facilitate such operations, the existing Odderbanen railway from Aarhus to Odder and Grenaabanen to Grenaa has been adapted to accommodate tram-train services. The two existing local lines have been electrified and adapted in other ways to Phase 1, but these alterations have not involved any change to their alignment. Furthermore, the heavy rail station at Aarhus, along with existing park and ride facilities near major stops along the route have been refurbished. Various pieces of infrastructure and civil works were performed during the construction phase of the project. During October 2014, work commenced on the boring of a pair of tunnels to carry the tramway between Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital in N√∏rrebrogade. In the following year, both the Randers Way and N√∏rrebro Street had to be reduced in width in order to allocate space between the lanes for the installation of the new double-track line. In total, eight bridges had to be constructed during Phase 1; of these, the bridge over the Egaa valley, possessing a length of 347 meters, is the largest bridge to be built in the programme. Overall, Phase 1 is to have a total of 110 kilometres long and serve 51 stops once it has been completed. The opening of Phase 1 was originally scheduled to occur on 23 September 2017;\\"Aarhus light rail to open in September.\\" metro-report.com, 3 May 2017. however, the event was cancelled only a few hours before the event as a result of missing security clearances from the Danish government authority. Accordingly, the opening date was pushed back to the following month, before being further delayed thereafter. It was said that both the government and the city were inexperienced with tramway operation, since no tramways existed in Denmark 1972‚Äì2017, resulting in problems in interpreting the rules. Especially for the old lines, it was unclear whether they could be grandfathered or must obey rules for new lines. On 20 December 2017, it was announced that approval for the new lines had finally been issued, allowing for services on the central tram section to commence during the following day.\\"Aarhus opens Denmark‚Äôs first modern light rail line.\\" metro-report.com, 21 December 2017.

In 2004 she moved to Sportitalia, anchoring the first live news on the national TV and following with the sister company features Eurosport and several ‚ÄúCalcio Serie A e B‚Äù programmes. The big turning point came in 2007 when she anchored the International Rugby Board (IRB)'s official magazine program, Total Rugby, with Luca Tramontin. The show had been broadcast in over a hundred countries without any anchors, but Scalia and Tramontin were given the opportunity to change the format to \\"docu- talk\\".http://www.sportincondotta.it/wordpress/interviste-daniela-scalia-dieci- anni-dopo-total-rugby-grandi-ricordi-e-retroscena-shock/ Correspondent at the 2007 World Cup, and often traveling for the edgy and colourful ‚ÄúSi Rugby‚Äù she presented and wrote with Luca Tramontin, Gianluca Veneziano and rugby record- man Stefano Bettarello, magazine which often involved also Australian Football, Rugby League and other less known codes, she soon became a familiar face to the oval Italian community. 2008 to 2010 Scalia tied her public image to the daily live night show ‚ÄúPrima Ora‚Äù moving then to the massive afternoon news programmes of Sportitalia. In 2011 she wrote and hosted with Luca Tramontin a show called the Oval Bin. Oval Bin was co-anchored by Gianluca Veneziano. During Summer 2011, ahead of the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, she anchored a surreal but historically accurate News Program called \\"Story Kiwi TG\\". She time-machined \\"reporters\\" Luca Tramontin and Gianluca Veneziano through the centuries of colonization and development of rugby in New Zealand \\"witnessing\\" facts like the 1st rugby match in Nelson or Captain Cook landing. In an interview to \\"Sportincondotta\\" Scalia said she regrets that such a successful and appreciated program had been closed as many others of hers, and even the fact it has been removed from the web. In January 2013 she started anchoring the Ice Hockey magazine ESP Hockey on Espansione TV with her long term tv partner Luca Tramontin. right Sport Crime During 2013, Tramontin and Scalia invented and registered a new TV series called SPORT CRIME. They kept it hidden until the trailer's shooting took them to Polcenigo (PN), Rovigo (with Rugby Rovigo Delta), Rijeka (with Primorje) and London (at the Marylebone Cricket Club Academy of Lord's Cricket Ground). SPORT CRIME is the first ever series based on sports investigations, it tells the story of 'Seams Agency', based in Lugano and ready to intervene when an alleged crime or infraction endangers a team, a sport venue or an athlete. Any episode is based on a different sport. She is actively working on writing and plotting the episodes of the TV Series which she potentially rates the hottest and by far best TV product ever. Scalia also acts as main character, while Tramontin declares to be still undecided on the matter. The trailer gave evidence that all actors are active or former athletes that often try or re-enact the facts risking their bodies in real actions like smashing tackles, high velocity crashes and bodychecks. Though SPORT CRIME is a fictional work designed for TV consumption, most of the plots come from the long experience of the authors as sportsmen, coaches, tv commentators, presenters or analysts. SPORT CRIME musics are produced by Walter Dal Farra, frequent session-man with former \\"Le Orme\\" Tolo Marton and Deep Purple Ian Paice that also features in the TV series trailer. The first episode of Sport Crime has been extensively rehearsed in Rijeka (Fiume) e Opatija (Abbazia), with Tramontin e Scalia in most of the real location of the effective shooting that Tramontin gave for \\"nearly imminent\\" in a long interview in the Novi List. The plot runs around the alleged kidnapping of a waterpolo star shortly before Primorje has to face the Champions League semifinals. Tramontin also revealed the surprising connection he has with the Kvarnar area and with Croatian language and culture. Daniela Scalia interview with HRT1 The magazine Teklic.hr stated that Prijmorije Waterpolo Club will have a world promotional push (Svjetska promocija kluba) from Sport Crime and pushed the concept comparing Sport Crime to CSI (Nesto kao CSI). Primorje Club itself echoed the thing, pretending that a player was really kidnapped like in the plot, only to eventually reveal it was an April fool. On April 4, 2016, at Cannes Mip Festival, Scalia and Tramontin revealed that the TV movie \\"The Legacy Run\\", introducing Sport Crime themes, atmosphere and characters, had been produced and edited. Curiously, no shooting had been done in Italy but only in Switzerland and Croatia with extensive media coverage on national TVs, radio, magazines and newspapers. December 4, 2016, \\"The Legacy Run\\" had its world premier at Swiss national tv reaching share numbers close to the historic \\"Sunday Sport Show /Domenica Sportiva\\". Scalia's brainy and charming character had several accolades as the whole movie had an extremely positive reception.

ORULES AND OTHER DISABLED SPORTS Scalia helped her colleague Luca Tramontin in coaching and training disabled people in a new full contact oval ball formula. It has been well documented on TV and media in order to expand the code. For serious mental and perceptive diseases the game consists in a code half way between rugby and Australian Football, while for medium degree of disability, the teams created by Tramontin adopt the Orules/Australian Football rules except for number of players and length of the periods.

Naming is the Irish name for a \\"beehive\\", although it can also mean cone (the shape of a traditional beehive). Cartographer Tim Robinson noted that \\"the Ordnance Survey has been incorrectly calling this mountain 'Leckavrea' for a hundred and fifty years\\", with Leckavrea () being a mountain to the east of Corcogemore. Geography Corcogemore (l), Mullach Glas (c), and Binn Mhor (r) from the North Corcogemore lies on a small massif in the southeast sector of the Maumturks range, which is separated from the main range by a deep east-west mountain pass called M√°m√©an, a site of pilgrimage dedicated to Saint Patrick since the 5th-century. To the west, along a high winding ridge across this massif is Mullach Glas , and then Binn Mh√≥r . To the east of Corcogemore, apart from the massif and across the R336 road, which runs through the pass of , is the isolated Maumturk peak of Lackavrea . Hill walking The most straightforward route to the summit Corcogemore is the 5-kilometre 2-3 hour roundtrip route from the R336 road, just after Maam Cross, and back; however, because of its positioning on a high ridge of its own small massif, it can also be climbed as an alternative 10-kilometre 4‚Äì5 hour route from Corcogemore in the west, across Mullach Glas, to the summit of Binn Mh√≥r, and then finishing down at M√°m√©an (i.e. the route requires two cars). Corcogemore is also climbed as part of the Maamturks Challenge, a 25-kilometre 10‚Äì12 hour walk over the full Maumturks range (from Maam Cross to Leenaun), which is considered one of the \\"great classic ridge- walks of Ireland\\", but of \\"extreme grade\\" due to the circa 7,600 feet of total ascent. Since 1975, the University College Galway Mountaineering Club has run the annual \\"Maamturks Challenge Walk\\" (MCW), and mans a checkpoint on Corcogemore, which is the first major checkpoint on the Maumturks range.

In 1930, he became the first monk wearing yellow robes to be seen in Kathmandu since the 14th century.LeVine and Gellner (2005), p. 45. Pragyananda served Buddhism and wrote religious literature in Nepal Bhasa when both the religion and language were being suppressed by the autocratic Rana regime.

Pragyananda also became the first Sangha Mahanayaka (Patriarch) of Nepal in modern times. Page 10. Early life Pragyananda was born in Itum Bahal, Kathmandu to a family of herbalists. His father was Harsha Bir Singh and his mother was Mohan Maya Tuladhar. Pragyananda's given name was Kul Man Singh Tuladhar. He was educated at Durbar High School in Kathmandu. After high school, he pursued further studies in Ayurvedic medicine and joined his ancestral occupation of dispensing herbal medicines. Ordination Kul Man Singh went to Lhasa, Tibet at the age of 16 and engaged in business. He was married and running a flourishing business house when he met Mahapragya, a Nepalese monk of the Tibetan Buddhism school. He had been expelled from Nepal in 1926 for converting to Buddhism. Inspired by Mahapragya, he renounced the life of a householder and became a Tibetan novice monk, taking the name Karmasheel. Subsequently, Karmasheel and Mahapragya went to Shigatse where they spent almost a year meditating in a cave. Not finding what they were searching for, the two travelled to Kushinagar in India, and in 1928, were reordained as Theravada monks.LeVine and Gellner (2005), p. 43. Mahapragya later became known as Bauddha Rishi Mahapragya. Karmasheel returned to Nepal in 1930 as the first Theravada monk. A year later, he went to Myanmar and received full ordination in 1932, and was given the name Pragyananda. Returning to Kathmandu, Pragyananda lived at the monastery of Kindo Baha and gave religious discourses. The crowds coming to listen to his sermons kept growing which attracted the ire of the government. Into exile The Rana regime ordered the monks to stop preaching Buddhism and writing in Nepal Bhasa. They refused, and on 30 July 1944, were ordered out of the country. Eight monks, including Pragyananda, Dhammalok Mahasthavir and Kumar Kashyap Mahasthavir left for India. In Sarnath, they founded a Buddhist association named Dharmodaya Sabha (Society for the Rise of the Teaching).LeVine and Gellner (2005), p. 48.Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999).

Pragyananda and the other monks returned to Nepal in 1946 after the ban was lifted following international pressure, and they resumed their work to spread Theravada Buddhism. Pragyananda spent a lot of his time at Pranidhipurna Mahavihar at Balambu which he had started in 1942. After the fall of the Rana regime and establishment of democracy in 1951,Brown, T.

Pragyananda was named the first Sangha Mahanayaka (Patriarch) of modern Nepal. He was fluent in Nepal Bhasa, Nepali, Hindi, Tibetan, Bengali, Pali and Burmese. He has published 19 books related to Buddhism and also written a number of plays. In 1950, the play Dirghayu Rajkumar was staged at Nagam. Pragyananda was also a skilled artist, and he painted paubha scroll paintings. He died in Lalitpur. In 2001, the Postal Service Department of the government of Nepal issued a commemorative postage stamp depicting his portrait.

It was discovered in 1892 and has been dated back to either 540‚Äì530 BC or 530‚Äì520 BC. According to an inscription Arath Spuriana apparently commissioned the construction of the tomb. It is named after the two bulls which appear on one of its frescoes. It is the earliest example of a tomb with complex frescoes in the necropolis. Like other Etruscan tombs, it would originally have contained many grave goods, especially Etruscan pottery, now removed. Description The entrance to the tomb The right scene of the erotic fresco The fresco of the ambush of Troilus The entrance to the tomb leads to the main chamber. The back wall of the main chamber is opposite to the entrance and contains two doorways that lead to two other chambers. Frescoes with brightly colored animals adorn the gabled areas at the top of the front and back walls of the chambers. These include bulls, birds, hippocampi, a panther, a lion and a goat. The back wall of main chamber is the only wall with frescoes painted below the gable. The tympanum of this wall is decorated with a fresco of a man on a horse on the right. He is opposed to the Chimaera on the left. Below the tympanum and above the two doorways is a fresco with two erotic scenes. In the left scene one man rests on his knees and forearms, facing to the right. A woman lies on his back. A man standing behind them to the left has sexual intercourse with the woman. They pay no attention to a calm bull which lies further to the left. In the right scene two men have sexual intercourse, which angers a bearded, man-headed bull with a phallus. The man who is being penetrated sees that the bull is charging at them from the left. He is not in a good position to flee because he is being held by the man penetrating him from behind, who looks the other way. Along with the frescoes of the Tomb of the Whipping these paintings are relatively rare examples of explicit sexual scenes in Etruscan art, which were far more common in Ancient Greek art. Another fresco is situated horizontally between the two doorways, in the center of the wall. It portrays the ambush of Troilus by Achilles, which is described in the Cypria. On the left, Achilles is shown armed with a sword and spear and wearing a helmet, greaves and a loincloth. He hides behind several plants and a large fountain. Troilus approaches from the right on a horse, unaware of the presence of Achilles. Achilles is naked but armed with a long spear. The event precedes the pursuit and slaying of Troilus by Achilles at the altar of Apollo. Below this ambush scene are nine trees that depict the changing seasons. Interpretations of the frescoes Over time the tomb's paintings have been interpreted quite differently by archaeologists. The tomb has also served as an example in the discussion of the degree of Greek influence on Etruscan culture. =The Troilus fresco= In the first half of the 19th century, art historians thought that the Etruscan artist who created the fresco of the ambush of Troilus primarily copied Greek iconography. John Peter Oleson disagrees and argues that the Etruscan influence should not be underestimated. The careful representation of the event indicates that the artist must have been familiar with the story of the myth rather than only its artistic representations. At the same time, the fresco also has characteristics which make it uniquely Etruscan. Most obviously, the drawing style of the figures is typical for Etruscan frescoes. The fountain has a unique form and might represent a local Etruscan design. A more subtle characteristic is the vegetation near Achilles, between the front legs of the horse and above the tail of the horse. It is seen on many other archaic Etruscan tomb frescoes, often yielding dark blue berries. It is probably symbolic of rebirth or a Chthonic transformation. Yet, Oleson regards the dark-red semicircle below the horse of Troilus as the most important symbolism. Ten long, thin rays of the same color spread from its center. Previously seen as a badly drawn or unknown kind of plant by most, Oleson interprets it as the setting sun. It is unique because a setting sun does not appear on any Greek or Etruscan vase paintings dealing with Troilus. He proposes the setting sun is symbolic of the death of Troilus, just like the rising sun is symbolic of rebirth. The symbolism is mirrored by the trees below the ambush scene. Their variation in size and foliage may signify the cycle of seasons as a parallel to the cycle of life and death. In addition, the sun was associated with Apollo and Helios, who were conflated in Greek and Etruscan art. They were in turn connected with and responsible for the care and supervision of the dead. R. Ross Holloway similarly notes the Etruscan influence on the portrayal of Greek mythology. However, he proposes that the scene emphasizes the death of Troilus as a sacrifice. This image would have served to honor and placate the dead in perpetuity. He points out that the sword of Achilles is a single-edged sacrificial knife rather than a double- edged sword. Scenes of slaughter are not uncommon in Etruscan funerary art. A fresco of the sacrifice of the Trojan youths by Achilles at the pyre of Patroclus in the Fran√ßois Tomb is an example of this. Holloway disagrees with the Oleson's interpretation of the red object below the horse as the setting sun. He thinks it unlikely because a sun god is always portrayed in an anthropomorphic form in Etruscan art. =The erotic fresco= Oleson connects the two erotic groups with the ambush scene. According to Servius, Achilles was pursuing Troilus out of love instead of an intent to kill him. In these versions Troilus was said to have died as a consequence of a brutal rape or killed for his refusal of Achilles' love. The two bulls might correspond to the sacred bulls of Helios, one vigilant and one angry at the recreation of the sacrilege committed in the sanctuary of Apollo. Holloway dismisses the connection of the erotic scenes with the ambush scene. Servius lived in 4th and 5th century AD, which makes the use of his work to interpret Etruscan art from the 6th century BC questionable. In addition, the groups don't emphasize the homosexual love between Achilles and Troilus because one of them is heterosexual. Instead, Holloway proposes that the erotic groups have an apotropaic purpose to protect from the evil eye. This is consistent with the presence of animals which protect against the evil eye on the frescoes. He identifies the man-headed bull as Achelous, adding that the horns of the bulls and the phallus are weapons against the evil eye. An entirely different theory is given by Jane Whitehead, who argues that the scene has a humorous meaning. The Etruscans often removed artistic forms from their context for humorous effect. Another option is given by Stefan Steingr√§ber, who thinks the scenes were life-affirming, to be interpreted in clear contrast to the symbolism of death. =The Chimaera fresco= Oleson sees the rider in the tympanum fresco as Bellerophon. According to Holloway the Etruscan artist did not copy the Greek iconography of Bellerophon and the Chimaera, but adapted it to an Etruscan setting. He identifies the rider as Troilus because he wears a Phrygian cap and has a large knot of hair. The scene signifies his voyage to the underworld after his sacrificial death.

He painted it in July 1992. It is the only quotation of another painting that Lichtenstein did of an interior. It is located on the Fitzhugh Farm in Maryland in the Robert and Jane Meyerhoff Collection. History , the painting was part of the Robert and Jane Meyerhoff Collection housed at Fitzhugh Farm located an hour and a half north of Washington, DC. After Andrew Mellon and the original founders, the Meyerhoffs are the largest donors to the National Gallery of Art. The painting was on display at the National Gallery of art from October 1, 2009 through May 2, 2010. Drawings for the painting were donated by Lichtenstein's heirs and the Lichtenstein Foundation to the National Gallery of art in 2005. Details Second version of Bedroom in Arles, Vincent van Gogh, September 1889. Oil on canvas, 72 x 90 cm, Art Institute of Chicago Lichtenstein has updated the original work by van Gogh with contemporary chairs and replaced casual shirts with businessmen's white shirts. He uses Ben-Day dots on one wall and pays homage to Expressionism's woodcuts, using wavy lines on the floor. The painting is part of Lichtenstein's early 1990s domestic interiors phase, and is supposedly based on the Art Institute of Chicago-housed second version rather than the other two versions in the series. Lichtenstein dramatically enlarged the scale of van Gogh's work from 72 cm x 90 cm to 320 cm √ó 420 cm (130 in √ó 170 in) and changed the tone from rustic to bourgeois, using Mies van der Rohe-inspired bright yellow Barcelona chairs. In fact, Lichtenstein supposedly worked from a 1993 Vincent van Gogh Calendar that included the Art Institute version. Lichtenstein says that he cleaned up Van Gogh's version and jokes that it would be to Van Gogh's liking, although he notes that the vast contrast between his cartoonish style and the original is in and of itself humorous. He notes that his work is meticulous, while Van Gogh's was spontaneous. He also notes that his translation is no more debasing to the master than were Pablo Picasso's translations of Diego Vel√°zquez. Critical review Carol Vogel of The New York Times described the work as a \\"humorous interpretation\\". Aleid Head describes the color selection, which includes acid yellow and bright turquoise, as garish. According to Diane Waldman of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the painting, which presents a pedestrian perspective, successfully distances his version from the original.  Popular culture  Roy Lichtenstein's painting has been adapted into a 3D installation bedroom on view in 2020 at the MOCO Museum. This installation is a response to the A 3D installation of Van Gogh's painting which was presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2016 among other locations.

In fact there are several Hofstadter points associated with a triangle. All of them are triangle centers. Two of them, the Hofstadter zero-point and Hofstadter one-point, are particularly interesting. They are two transcendental triangle centers. Hofstadter zero-point is the center designated as X(360) and the Hofstafter one-point is the center denoted as X(359) in Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. The Hofstadter zero-point was discovered by Douglas Hofstadter in 1992. Hofstadter triangles 400px Let ABC be a given triangle. Let r be a positive real constant. Rotate the line segment BC about B through an angle rB towards A and let LBC be the line containing this line segment. Next rotate the line segment BC about C through an angle rC towards A. Let L'BC be the line containing this line segment. Let the lines LBC and L'BC intersect at A(r). In a similar way the points B(r) and C(r) are constructed. The triangle whose vertices are A(r), B(r), C(r) is the Hofstadter r-triangle (or, the r-Hofstadter triangle) of triangle ABC. =Special case= *The Hofstadter 1/3-triangle of triangle ABC is the first Morley's triangle of triangle ABC. Morley's triangle is always an equilateral triangle. *The Hofstadter 1/2-triangle is simply the incentre of the triangle. =Trilinear coordinates of the vertices of Hofstadter triangles= The trilinear coordinates of the vertices of the Hofstadter r-triangle are given below: :A(r) = ( 1 , sin rB / sin (1 ‚àí r)B , sin rC / sin (1 ‚àí r)C ) :B(r) = ( sin rA / sin (1 ‚àí r)A , 1 , sin rC / sin (1 ‚àí r)C ) :C(r) = ( sin rA / sin (1 ‚àí r)A , sin (1 ‚àí r)B / sin rB , 1 ) Hofstadter points Animation showing various Hofstadter points. H0 is the Hofstadter zero-point. H1 is the Hofstadter one-point. The little red arc in the center of the triangle is the locus of the Hofstadter r-points for 0 < r < 1\\\\. This locus passes through the incenter I of the triangle. For a positive real constant r > 0, let A(r) B(r) C(r) be the Hofstadter r-triangle of triangle ABC. Then the lines AA(r), BB(r), CC(r) are concurrent. The point of concurrence is the Hofstdter r-point of triangle ABC. =Trilinear coordinates of Hofstadter r-point= The trilinear coordinates of Hofstadter r-point are given below. :( sin rA / sin ( A ‚àí rA) , sin rB / sin ( B ‚àí rB ) , sin rC / sin ( C ‚àí rC) )  Hofstadter zero- and one-points The trilinear coordinates of these points cannot be obtained by plugging in the values 0 and 1 for r in the expressions for the trilinear coordinates for the Hofstdter r-point. :Hofstadter zero-point is the limit of the Hofstadter r-point as r approaches zero. :Hofstadter one-point is the limit of the Hofstadter r-point as r approaches one.

Bent was a member of Zion's Camp, and spent time between Michigan and Kirtland, Ohio, for the next few years. In 1836 he moved to Liberty, Missouri. He was one of the main targets of the mobs in that place that caused the Latter Day Saints to relocate to Caldwell County, Missouri, where Bent was a key figure in the founding of Far West, Missouri. After going to Nauvoo, Illinois, at the time the Latter Day Saints were driven out of Missouri, Bent served as a colonel in the Nauvoo Legion and as a member of the Council of Fifty. In 1846 he was appointed as president of the Latter Day Saints in Garden Grove, Iowa, an office he filled until his death. References *Andrew Jenson. Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia.

Selvamani, an erstwhile assistant of Manivannan decided to make a film with Sathyaraj. But Sathyaraj was not interested to act under the direction of a newcomer but he promised that he would act only if Selvamani establishes himself as a director. Selvamani decided to narrate a storyline to Vijayakanth. Vijayakanth insisted to narrate the story to his friend producer Ibrahim Rowther, but Rowther said that Vijayakanth was booked for 2 years.http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2013/09/02224002/selvamani-cinema- history.html Selvamani with the help of his friend Jothi decided to narrate the story through drawn pictures by having Hollywood films as reference.http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2013/09/03231730/selvamani-cinema- history.html Selvamani led many rules and conditions which led to the cancelling of shooting for 6 months, with the help of Manivannan shooting was continued.http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2013/09/04213332/Director-dream- fulfilled-Selva.html Sarathkumar portrayed the antagonist character after he was recommended to the film's team by Vijayakanth's personal make-up man Raju.http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/lf/2002/03/31/stories/2002033100300200.htm Release The film was released on 14 January 1990 on the occasion of Pongal festival and became one of the successful films at box-office. Success of the film led G. Venkateswaran to give chance to Selvamani for another project. Selvamani rejected the project as he expressed his gratitude to Rowther to make another film with him. The team again collaborated with Captain Prabhakaran which also became successful. Soundtrack The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Ilaiyaraaja. The soundtrack, released in 1990, features 3 tracks with lyrics written by Gangai Amaran. Sequel Selvamani began working on Pulan Visaranai 2 in November 2005, a sequel to his 1990 film, and cast Prashanth in the leading role of the investigative cop. He revealed that the idea had come to him in the early 2000s and Vijayakanth's unavailability had meant the film only materialised after a delay. Prashanth underwent strength training for the venture, while beauty pageant winner Medha Raghunathan was briefly signed on to play the lead female role, before opting out again. The film progressed slowly, also a result of Prashanth's marital problems, and reports in May 2007 suggested that Rowther was unhappy with the film's content and felt the film lacked a proper storyline unlike the previous version. The film ran into problems during its censor in April 2008, with the committee highlighting twenty six objectionable scenes. Selvamani subsequently appealed and compromised by agreeing to remove controversial dialogues and a sequence which involved an actress depicting Indian tennis player Sania Mirza. The producer subsequently accepted an \\"A\\" certificate for the film, with the soundtrack releasing the following week. The team also revealed that the film would be released the following month, though this proved to be untrue. The film has since remained unreleased, with little news regarding its chances of having a theatrical release, Prashanth indicated that the film was still delayed due to producer's financial problems.http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/telugu/article/19446.html The sequel was released in 2015.

On 14 July 1855 he opened a shop advertised in Notes & Queries as ‚Äúselling everything relating to aquaria‚Äù at 164 St John Street Road, Clerkenwell, London. In 1856 he opened a new shop ‚ÄúThe Aquarium Warehouse‚Äù at 20, Portland Road, Regent's Park and in 1860 he supervised the installation of an aquarium The Gardens of the Society of Acclimatation in Bois de Boulogne in Paris. By the 1860s the aquarium craze was over, at least in England, and Lloyd went bankrupt and in 1862 supported by Richard Owen he moved to Grindel Dammthor, Hamburg to supervise the installation of the circulating system and tanks at the Hamburg Aquarium. Success in Germany led to his appointment as Superintendent of the Crystal Palace Aquarium two years before it opened in 1871. Anton Dohrn who had made Lloyd's acquaintance in 1866 at the Hamburg aquarium invited him to install the aquaria at Stazione Zoologica at Naples in the spring of 1873. Here some of Lloyd's circulating system was still operating well into the 20th century. Anton Dohrn's professional biological station flourished and the Swedish Professor Loven of Sweden, who planned a research establishment sent a representative to London to consult with Lloyd. In England Lloyd's last post was as superintendent at the Aston Aquarium, Birmingham. References *Edmund Gosse (1890). The Life of Philip Henry Gosse.

( - 19 September 1834) was a Royal Navy officer of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century who is best known for his service as commander of the frigate HMS Hebrus, in the Battle of Jobourg off the Normandy Coast, in the last frigate ship-to-ship battle of the Napoleonic Wars on 27 March 1814. Chasing down the frigate Etoile, which was making for Saint Malo, Palmer cornered and defeated the French ship in a fierce engagement. Life Palmer was born in c. 1781, the son of a Post Office official with political influence. He joined the Royal Navy in 1793 at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars and served aboard HMS Gibraltar and then the frigate HMS Aigle under her destruction on the North African coast in 1798. He subsequently served in HMS Ville de Paris, HMS Princess Royal and HMS Pictou before being placed in reserve at the Peace of Amiens in 1801.United Service Journal, \\"Captain Edmund Palmer, CB\\" At the start of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803 he returned to service as a lieutenant in HMS Childers in the fleet of Earl St. Vincent. His connections enabled him to become acquainted with the Earl and in 1804 he was promoted to commander, captaining HMS Wizard in the Mediterranean for two years until promoted to post captain in 1807. Due to a dearth of available ships, Palmer subsequently spent seven years in reserve, where despite political and even royal influence in his favour he was unable to secure employment. Finally in January 1814, with the War of the Sixth Coalition coming to an end, he was appointed to the newly built frigate HMS Hebrus and joined the blockade of the French Channel ports. It was while employed on this service that he encountered two French frigates off the √éle de Batz on 26 March in company with the ship of the line HMS Hannibal. While Hannibal captured Sultane, Palmer was sent in pursuit of Etoile, cornering the French ship near the Normandy town of Jobourg. In a furious night action fought close inshore Palmer's ship was badly damaged, but he was able to repeatedly rake the French frigate, inflicting sufficient damage to force its surrender. The captured Etoile was taken to Plymouth and the war ended a week later. It was the last single-ship frigate action of the entire 23 year conflict. The following year Palmer and Hebrus were active during the Hundred Days. After Napoleon's return to France, Palmer was ordered to convey French Royalist politicians to Bordeaux in an attempt to force the city to declare for King Louis XVIII. On arrival the city was found to be strongly held by Imperial supporters and it was only after the arrival of reinforcements that Palmer was confident enough to attempt to force his way into the city, attacking the defences on 13 July 1815. By 23 July the city had declared for the King, and Palmer was rewarded by being made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In August 1816, Palmer and Hebrus were with the fleet which conducted the Bombardment of Algiers, but at the conclusion of the campaign it was discovered that the ship was rotten and Hebrus was paid off and broken up. Palmer married Henrietta Jervis, a grandniece of Earl St. Vincent in November 1817 and the marriage, which produced eight children was noted for its happiness. His family situation led Palmer to turn down a coveted offer of a ship, HMS Liverpool in January 1818, and he entered semi-retirement in Brighton, refusing another offer of a ship in 1830 due to ill-health caused by a liver complaint and extensive financial commitments. he died in September 1834 from an illness of the liver at his home.

It was the seventeenth UFC event of the year. The card consisted of eleven bouts, with six televised live on pay-per-view, four preliminary bouts on FX, and one on Facebook. The card's main event featured UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva defending his title against Chael Sonnen in a highly anticipated bout. The contest was heavily promoted, featuring the International Fight Week, as well as the preview show UFC Primetime. Tito Ortiz was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame during the UFC Fan Expo in conjunction with the event, and fought fellow former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Forrest Griffin in the co-main event of the evening. Background =Card changes= Urijah Faber was expected to challenge Dominick Cruz for the UFC Bantamweight Championship in the co-main event (after their stint as opposing coaches on The Ultimate Fighter: Live), but a torn ACL forced Cruz off the card. Faber was then expected to face replacement Renan Bar√£o for the Interim UFC Bantamweight Championship, but that fight was moved to the main event of UFC 149 in Calgary, Alberta. Bar√£o was originally scheduled to fight Ivan Menjivar on the UFC 148 preliminary card, and Mike Easton replaced Bar√£o in the opening bout of the main card. Rich Franklin was expected to return to the middleweight ranks in a bout against Cung Le. However, due to an injury sustained by UFC 147 headliner Vitor Belfort, Franklin was pulled from the bout with Le to replace Belfort in a rematch against Wanderlei Silva. =International Fight Week= In conjunction with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the UFC planned five days of festivities (known as International Fight Week) leading up to UFC 148. International Fight Week is expected to be an annual July occurrence, coinciding with a Las Vegas UFC event. UFC President Dana White stated, \\"The first annual International Fight Week will be awesome, the fans are going to have a fight week experience better than anything they've ever had before, and each year we are going to build this thing to the point where every fan on the planet knows they have to come to Vegas for this July fight week at least once in their lives.\\" The UFC Fan Expo (two days of fighter meet-and-greets, training seminars, a Grapplers Quest tournament, autograph sessions and other events) also occurred on July 6 and 7. =Weigh-in= Regarded as the most notable weigh-in event in the history of combat sports, it was held at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. All fighters on the card made their required weight. Silva threw a shoulder at Chael Sonnen. The move (which connected with Sonnen's face) led to a tense moment, when the two had to be separated by UFC president Dana White. It was later reported by the Nevada State Athletic Commission that Silva would not be sanctioned for his actions. Event The event consisted of 11 mixed-martial-arts bouts sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and contested under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. All bouts consisted of three five-minute rounds, except for the main-event championship match between Silva and Sonnen (which was scheduled for five five-minute rounds). Six bouts were televised live on pay- per-view. Four preliminary bouts were televised live on FX, and one was streamed live on Facebook. UFC 148 set a mixed-martial-arts gate record in Nevada. The event earned $6,901,655 in ticket sales, beating the previous record set at UFC 66. Attendance was 15,104. It sold an estimated 925,000 pay- per-view buys, the most in 2012 for any UFC event. =Preliminary card= All fights took place inside a cage, the UFC's Octagon. The event's five preliminary fights all went the full three rounds, ending in decisions. In the first bout of the evening, Rafaello Oliveira outpointed Yoislandy Izquierdo to win 29‚Äì28 in all three judges' scorecards. After taking down Izquierdo early in the first round, Oliveira was hit by a strong knee in the following stanza, but put his opponent in the ground again. The final round saw both fighters grappling, with Oliveira reigning victorious. In the second bout, Shane Roller rebounded from three losses in a row with a unanimous decision victory over John Alessio. Roller, a former four-time Oklahoma high school state wrestling champion and a Big 12 Conference Champion at Oklahoma State University, was able to take Alessio down and control his opponent's back on the ground, but was hurt on the feet in the first and third rounds. The three judges scored the fight 29‚Äì28 in favor of Roller. The other middleweight bout of the night saw Costas Philippou defeating Riki Fukuda by unanimous decision. Philippou successfully defended all of Fukuda's takedown attempts and landed the more solid strikes. The judges saw it 30‚Äì27, 30‚Äì27 and 29‚Äì28 for Philippou. Khabib Nurmagomedov defeated Gleison Tibau by unanimous decision in their lightweight contest. In an uneventful bout, which saw 19 unsuccessful takedowns in 19 attempts by both fighters combined, Nurmagomedov won 30‚Äì27, 30‚Äì27 and 30‚Äì27 in the judges' scorecards. In the preliminary card's final match, Melvin Guillard faced Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt Fabr√≠cio Cam√µes. Despite being mounted in the first round by Camoes, Guillard picked apart his opponent in the rest of the fight by exercising good takedown defense and outstriking Camoes. The judges awarded the Imperial Athletics representative the unanimous decision (30‚Äì27, 30‚Äì27, 30‚Äì27). =Main card= The first bout on the pay-per-view portion of the event saw Mike Easton taking on Ivan Menjivar in a bantamweight contest. The entire fight remained on the feet, with both fighter throwing 317 combined strikes. All three judges scored the bout in favor of Easton, with two scoring it 30‚Äì27 while one judge seeing it 29‚Äì28 giving Easton the unanimous decision victory. The second bout saw former title contender Chad Mendes fighting The Ultimate Fighter: Team GSP vs. Team Koscheck contestant Cody McKenzie. Early in the first round, Mendes caught his opponent with a straight right hand to the midsection. McKenzie collapsed to his knees and Mendes attacked him with ground-and-pound, forcing the referee to stop the contest at thirty-one seconds. It was the first knockout victory for Mendes since 2009. In his first fight as a welterweight, former UFC Middleweight title challenger Demian Maia faced Judo black belt Dong Hyun Kim. The bout was stopped in forty-seven seconds by referee Mario Yamasaki, after Maia took Kim down and finished him with strikes from the mounted position. UFC commentator Joe Rogan said that Kim had broken a rib, but it was later revealed that he suffered a major muscle spasm. The fourth fight featured the former Strikeforce Middleweight Champion Cung Le meeting veteran Patrick C√¥t√© at middleweight. This was Le's second fight in the promotion, after losing his first to Wanderlei Silva by TKO at UFC 139. C√¥t√© was returning to the UFC after last losing a decision to Tom Lawlor at UFC 121 in October 2010. He was on a four-fight winning streak, undefeated since leaving the organization. Le won a unanimous decision by exercising great footwork, trips and takedowns and effective striking. Hours before the long-awaited rubber match and co-main event of the evening between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champions Tito Ortiz and Forrest Griffin, Ortiz was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame. The history of the two fighters started when Ortiz won their first bout at UFC 59, and Griffin won the rematch at UFC 106; both fights ended in a split decision. As in the first two fights, Ortiz came out strong, but Griffin countered his attacks and ultimately won via unanimous decision. Silva vs. Sonnen The sixth and final bout of the main card was the UFC Middleweight Championship match between Anderson SIlva and Chael Sonnen, regulated by referee Yves Lavigne. The fight was a rematch of the main event at UFC 117, also a contest for the UFC Middleweight Championship. In that match, Silva (after losing four rounds on points) made Sonnen submit to a triangle choke with 1:50 left in the fight. Sonnen landed 320 strikes against Silva, more than any other fighter since UFC 5 (when Royce Gracie landed 355 strikes against Ken Shamrock). Silva had only absorbed 166 strikes (combined) in his previous 11 matches. With the win Silva retained the UFC Middleweight Championship, his undefeated record in the UFC and extended his winning streak to 13. The bout received the Fight of the Year award at the 2010 World MMA Awards. After UFC 117 Silva defended the title twice, with KO and TKO wins over Vitor Belfort and Yushin Okami respectively. Sonnen is also undefeated since UFC 117, defeating Brian Stann and Michael Bisping and setting the stage for the most-anticipated rematch of the year. The UFC Middleweight Championship main-event match between Silva and Sonnen was originally scheduled for UFC 147 at Havelange Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Due to a scheduling conflict with the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, the bout was moved to headline UFC 148 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. At this point in their careers Sonnen was ranked as the number-two middleweight in the world by Sherdog, while Silva is ranked number-one middleweight and the number-one pound-for-pound fighter in the world according to Sherdog, Yahoo! Sports, and ESPN. In an effort to further promote the contest, UFC Primetime returned on Fuel TV. UFC 148 took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. After Sonnen's win over Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a polarizing figure due to his criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: \\"Chael Sonnen's going to get his ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's going to change the image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry. I'm going to make sure that every one of his teeth are broken, that his arms are broken and his legs are broken. He's not going to be able to walk out of the Octagon by himself. I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards. And I know that he's listening, so the game's over. No more shit talking. It's on now.\\" This caught some by surprise, who perceived his remarks as out of character. As the fight finally took place, Sonnen quickly took the champion down in the first round and maintained a dominant position throughout, eventually gaining full mount while attacking with ground-and-pound. One cageside judge scored it a 10‚Äì8 round as Silva was credited with zero strikes. Sonnen connected with 76 strikes from the top position in the opening round, and held a 22-to-15 edge in significant strikes against Silva. However, Sonnen was unable to inflict substantial damage to the champion, and as the fight resumed Silva was repeatedly admonished by the ref for holding Chael's shorts. Being unable to score a takedown due to Silva's takedown defense, Sonnen failed to connect with a high-risk spinning backfist strike, leaving Sonnen in a scooting position for Silva to land a knee to the chest, then with punches to stop Sonnen with a TKO at 1:55 of the second round.

Typically, this means power forward and center, since these are usually the two biggest player positions on any basketball team, and therefore more often overlap each other. Forward‚Äìcenter came into the basketball jargon as the game evolved and became more specialized in the 1960s. The five positions on court were originally known only as guards, forwards, and the center, but it is now generally accepted that the five primary positions are point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. Typically, a forward‚Äìcenter is a talented forward who also came to play minutes at center on teams that need help at that position. The player could also be a somewhat floor-bound center, under seven feet tall at the NBA level, whose skills suit him to a power forward position, especially if that team has a better center. One such player is Marcus Camby of the New York Knicks. At 6‚Ä≤ 11‚Ä≥ (211 cm), he generally plays as a center, but when he played for the New York Knicks earlier in his career, he mostly played power forward because his team had one of the best pure centers in the league in 7‚Ä≤ 0‚Ä≥ (213 cm) Patrick Ewing. Ewing himself was used as a forward‚Äìcenter early in his career to complement the then-incumbent Knicks center, 7‚Ä≤ 1‚Ä≥ (216 cm) Bill Cartwright. Ralph Sampson, at 7‚Ä≤ 4‚Ä≥ (224 cm), was another notable forward‚Äìcenter who played center his rookie year in 1983. In 1984, he moved to power forward when 7‚Ä≤ 0‚Ä≥ (213 cm) Hakeem Olajuwon was drafted that year. Most forward-centers range from 6‚Ä≤ 9‚Ä≥ (2.06 m) to 7‚Ä≤ 0‚Ä≥ (2.13 m) in height.

Early travels Fendler first attended preparatory school at the age of 12. After four years, he discontinued his education for financial reasons and apprenticed for the town clerk. He disliked the work, and yearned for travel.William Marriott Canby: An Autobiographie and Some Reminiscences of the Late August Fendler. I. In: Botanical Gazette. Band 10, Nummer 6, 1885, S. 285‚Äì290, (online). Fendler gained his first taste of exploration as a physician's assistant. He partook in an inspection trip of the cholera quarantine camps on the Russian border of Prussia. Upon his return, he briefly worked as a tanner, then spent a year in a polytechnical school based in Berlin. He dropped out and found his way to Bremen, eventually sailing to Baltimore, Maryland in 1836. Fendler initially found work as a tanner in Philadelphia, then moved to New York City and pursued lamp manufacturing. The panic of 1837 lead to the closing of his shop, and consequently, he left New York for St. Louis in 1838. He resumed working in the lamp business, but left the city shortly before Christmas the same year. Fendler continued south through New Orleans, before heading west to Texas.

JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2399191. Yellow fever drove Fendler from Texas, and he became a school teacher in Illinois. Suddenly driven by the desire for a solitary life, he settled in a dilapidated log cabin on an island on the Missouri River near Wellington. He remained here for six months, surviving off of wild game and reading. He left after the island became flooded. In 1841, he returned to K√∂nigsberg, Prussia. Initial collections Ernst Heinrich Friedrich Meyer, professor of botany at the University of K√∂nigsberg, convinced Fendler that he could make a profit collecting plant specimens. He went back to St. Louis with his brother, making the acquaintance of Georg Engelmann. Fendler began sending his specimens to Asa Gray at the behest of Engelmann. During the Mexican American War in 1846, Fendler traveled with the U.S Army to Santa Fe, New Mexico. He collected specimens throughout the year, once again returning to St. Louis in 1847. His collection is hailed as the first from this part of the country, and he collected over 17,000 specimens during this trip. In 1849, he attempted to travel to the Great Salt Lake, but a flood stymied his progress. On his return to St. Louis, he found a fire destroyed all his possessions, personal collections, and travel journals. He left the city with his brother, and continued to New Orleans. He gathered supplies for a collecting trip at Englemann's expense, and sailed to Chagres, Panama. Fendler collected at the mouth of the Chagres River for four months. He arrived back in New Orleans on April 20, 1850, but continued up to Camden, Arkansas to make further collections. The Fendler brothers, running low on funds, opened up a gas lamp business in Memphis, Tennessee. Fendler continued to collect plants in his spare time, and began running horticultural experiments with some of the specimens he collected. He reported his data to Englemann and the Smithsonian Institution. By late 1853, the lamp business became unprofitable and Fendler sought to move again. Venezuelan collections On the December 24, 1853, the Fendlers left New York harbor for Venezuela. They arrived at La Guaira on January 21, 1854, and Fendler immediately began collecting plants. Although initially hoping to settle in Caracas, the expensive cost of living in the city prompted them to purchase a small farm near Colonia Tovar. In Venezuela, he not only collected plants, but also operated meteorological studies during his stay. He collaborated with Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, who published his observations.Todzia, Carol A. ‚ÄúAugustus Fendler's Venezuelan Plant Collections.‚Äù Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, vol. 76, no. 1, 1989, pp. 310‚Äì329. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2399350. After two years of collecting in Colonia Tovar, Fendler was forced to take longer excursions to find new specimens. He traveled from Maracai to Puerto Colombia, as well as from Valencia to San Estevan. He also traveled from Petaquire to the Atlantic coast. Fendler visited the United States in 1856, selling moss specimens to William Starling Sullivant and lichen specimens to Edward Tuckerman. Later life Fendler's house in Allentown, Mo. The Fendlers returned to St. Louis in 1864, and they purchased a densely wooded tract of land in Allenton, Missouri. They cleared the land and homesteaded for the next 7 years. Fendler accepted a short-term offer from Asa Gray to work as his curator in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The brothers sold the farm in 1871, and visited Germany. Here, Fendler improved his botanical knowledge through visits with Johann Caspary and Alexander Braun. The brothers returned to the United States in 1873. The brothers initially settled in Wilmington, Delaware, with Fendler finding employment arranging herbarium specimens for William Marriott Canby. Here he continued making meteorological observations for Engelmann. Discomfort caused by rheumatism had Fendler searching for a place with a fairer climate. Fendler therefore moved to Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1877. Fendler continued collecting plants and corresponding with Canby, Gray and Engelmann until his death on November 27, 1883.

Harris holds a bachelor's degree in economics and business administration from Bar-Ilan University (1982), a master's degree in public policy from Tel-Aviv University (1986), and a Ph.D. in public policy from Indiana University (1993). After initially specializing in electoral politics and public policy, Harris' current research focuses on academic decision-making and developing learner-centered curricula within universities to improve student performance outcomes. Harris served in the Israel Defense Forces and retired at the rank of major with active combat experience. Leadership and academic career Prior to being appointed Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, Harris was Dean of and Professor of Public Administration and Policy in the College of Public Service at Tennessee State University.

While serving as Chancellor, Harris was presented the Phoenix II (a sculpture and plaque) from the faculty, staff, and students of the university's fine arts program. Reflecting on his time as Chancellor at IUK, Kokomo Perspective Publisher, Don Wilson, said of Harris, \\"The university is much better off for his time here. Student housing, new degree programs, record enrollment, a new fitness center, the athletic program -- they all originated on his watch\\".

Harris also built partnerships with other Michigan colleges and universities to ensure that Kettering University students had the best opportunities. One such partnership was an agreement signed by Kettering University and Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, which provided an enhanced opportunity for Kettering pre-med students to attend medical school. Additionally, Harris was a vital member of the delegation that built unprecedented partnerships between Kettering and Chinese universities, government institutions, and businesses. In one of his final acts before leaving the university to become chancellor of Indiana University Kokomo, Harris led a four-hour negotiation session that resulted in Kettering becoming one of the first few universities in the world to form an agreement with the Chinese Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC), one of the most prestigious automotive research centers in China.

The game was originally announced for iOS devices but has since expanded to Android, Microsoft Windows and OS X. A PlayStation 4 version, containing all five episodes, was released on March 22, 2016, while a version for the Stadia cloud gaming service was released on September 15, 2020. A VR version debuted on the Oculus Go, followed by a release onto Oculus Quest in July 2019, and Steam on 15 June 2020 (for HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and Valve Index) and Oculus Go. Gameplay Players communicate with the main character, Hope, through their phone or computer, in order to help her escape. The player controls surveillance cameras in the fictional totalitarian state or corporate republic of R√©publique in order to monitor Hope's actions, as well as hack into various electronic devices. The interface that the player must use is the \\"OMNI View\\" software, which allows them to lock and unlock doors, distract patrolling enemies, and obtain information. In some situations, the player must upgrade their OMNI View to higher versions, enabling them to access areas and nodes with stronger security. In the OS X and Windows versions, players will be able to access multiple cameras at once. Plot R√©publique takes place in an unnamed totalitarian state (similar to George Orwell's 1984), led by its sinister \\"Overseer\\"/\\"Headmaster\\" named Treglazov (voiced by Dwight Schultz), a powerhouse technology and security mogul with an insane ideology he has peddled most of his life, mostly through books. His latest book, a manifesto he has concocted, is what he has used to initiate his utopia, and has given them to everyone who lives in, and works for it. Within a facility a part of it called \\"Metamorphosis\\", Prizrak, the hired guards of the totalitarian state, protect from intruders, and keep in line the adolescents called \\"Pre- Cals\\" (short for Pre-Calibration), who are getting mysterious experiments performed on them, and are people who were born and raised in the facility. One Pre-Cal teenager, Hope (voiced by Rena Strober), manages to contact the player through their phone, and requests them to help her escape from Metamorphosis. Hope and the player receive assistance from Cooper (voiced by James Holloway), an American who works as a Prizrak in Metamorphosis, and has grown a strong hate for it. Other characters include Daniel Markus Zager (voiced by David Hayter), a deceased journalist/revolutionary who leaves audio logs behind for Hope and the player; and Mireille Prideaux (voiced by Jennifer Hale), who serves as a high-ranking official for the facility, and as Hope and every other Pre-Cal's caretaker, and may or may not be an infiltrator who is against Treglazov. Development Ryan Payton, founder of Camouflaj, initiated the project because he wanted to \\"stop complaining about the lack of real games on mobile and start making one\\". The idea for Hope came about when he was performing a thought experiment about how to make Love Plus for a Western audience. Payton cites Nineteen Eighty-Four as a major influence on the atmosphere. The game also draws inspiration from Metal Gear, the first Resident Evil, and Demon's Souls. The central themes are \\"voyeurism, paranoia, censorship, and control\\". Logan co-founder Alexei Tylevich serves as art director; Logan will focus on visual development while Camouflaj handles the gameplay and systems. On April 11, 2012, Camouflaj launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to raise $500,000 to help with development costs. The project was funded on May 11, 2012 with a total of $555,662.

An estimated 300 Bengali Hindus, from 5-year-old child to 80 years old men and women were killed in the massacre. More than 500 houses were burnt to ashes. According to eyewitnesses, Rameez Ahmed Chowdhury, the then Chairman of Kharna Union, and his aides were responsible for the massacre.  Background  The village of Muzaffarabad is located under the Kharna Union, in the south eastern extremity of Patiya Upazila in Chittagong District. In 1971, Muzaffarabad was one of the many predominantly Hindu villages under Patiya police station. In the 1970 elections, 95% of the voters of Muzaffarabad voted for Awami League. When the army crackdown started on 25 March, many people from Chittagong took shelter at their relative's place in Muzaffarabad. On 16 April, the Pakistani occupation army bombed Patiya and subsequently took control of the southern part of Chittagong district. They camped at Dohazari and Patiya. At Patiya, the Pakistani occupation army camped at the Primary Training Institute. The used to arrest unarmed villagers and torture them at the camp. Many were killed and buried underneath the PTI grounds. Towards the end of April, the Razakars from Kharna and Elahabad villages targeted the Hindu village for persecution and loot. As the anti- social elements began to be seen frequently in the village, the elders decided to set up a village defence. Twenty camps were set up along the border of the village, each having twenty men for vigil. In the event of an attack, the men in the camp would set an alarm so that men from the other camps can come together to resist the attackers. The all round vigil at the camps helped the villagers foil attacks from the Razakars more than once. Having failed, the Razakars persuaded the Pakistani occupation army at the Dohazari camp to attack Muzaffarabad.  Events  On 3 May, at the onset of dawn at around 5-20 A.M., while the people of Muzaffarabad were still asleep, the Pakistani military and the Razakars surrounded the village from three sides. There was a light drizzle in the morning. At around 7 A.M., the Pakistani army entered the village in military trucks. At around 8 A.M., they began to go from door to door and started killing the villagers. Seventy-year-old Rajani Sen was reading the Ramayana for the peace and prosperity of the country. When the Pakistani army and the Razakars arrived at his place, he seated them as guests. One of the Razakars asked Sen to say Jai Bangla. As soon as he had uttered Jai Bangla, a Pakistani soldier put the barrel of his rifle into the throat of Sen and shot him to death. Nabin Sadhu, a 75-year-old hermit who was reciting from the Gita was similarly shot to death. The attackers rounded up the priests of the village and force them to break the images they worshipped. After that, the priests were shot to death. Social worker Nirmal Sen was dragged along with his father Upendralal Sen to a nearby paddy field. There they were tied together with a gamchha and shot to death. Raimohan, a teacher at the Muzaffarabad High School, who had begun fishing in a village pond, was tied within the fish net along with his son and then shot to death. The villagers who went into hiding, when the Pakistani occupation army launched the killing spree were rounded up the Razakars one by one. In order to test whether they were Hindu or Muslim, the villagers were asked to recite the kalma. When they failed, they were butchered to death in the manner of zabiha.  Aftermath  The killing spree went on till 2 P.M. in the afternoon. After the Pakistani army left, the local Razakars looted the remaining houses. Targeted killing continued even after the massacre on 3 May. On the 7th or 8 May, Natun Chandra Chaudhuri was brutally beaten to death by few Razakars from Elahabad. A few days later, Baren Ray Chaudhuri, a teacher of the Muzaffarabad High School was killed. He had gone to Joara Munsirhat to buy medicines for his ailing mother. On his way back, he was waylaid and killed by the Razakars near Mohammadpur.  Memorial  Every year the people of Muzaffarabad commemorate 3 May by paying respect to the victims. Lectures, seminars and cultural programmes are held throughout the day in memory of the victims. A new memorial structure has been built in 2010. No initiative has been taken to preserve the mass burial site.

Charges filed against him on March 15, 2011, were reported to have been the first time a Canadian had faced terrorism charges for offences alleged to have been committed outside of Canada. Life in Canada According to The Globe and Mail In grade 7 Ferid was an \\"immigrant from East Africa\\" in the 1990s. They report he was popular in high school and was on the honor roll and soccer team. One The Globe and Mail article says he studied biochemistry at the University of Manitoba, while another article says he studied pharmacy. He voiced an opinion during the debates of the publication of cartoons that depicted Mohammed, Islam's prophet, calling the publication \\"a crisis rather than a controversy.\\" In 2006, he made a pilgrimage to Mecca. Alleged jihadi activities In 2007 Imam and two of his friends from Winnipeg, Muhannad al- Farekh and Miawand Yar, traveled to Waziristan, one of Pakistan's loosely controlled Federally Administered Tribal Agencies, where it is believed they sought out jihadis for military training. On March 15, 2011, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police charged Imam with terrorism related offenses. The Globe and Mail called the charges a \\"crucial test\\" of a new anti-terrorism law. They reported it was the first time in Canadian history a Canadian had been charged with a terrorism related offense committed outside Canada. However, The Globe and Mail reported that Canadian and American security officials had sought Imam for years, and the formal charges merely made the search official. A Bosian-American named Adis Medunjanin was convicted in 2012. At his trial further allegations against Imam emerged. Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay testified at Medunjanin's trial that the three were friends, who had travelled to Pakistan together, to train for Jihad, and that they were trained by an English speaking individual they knew as \\"Yousef\\". Colin Freeze, writing in The Globe and Mail, reported security officials believe \\"Yousef\\" is Imam's nom de guerre. According to that testimony, Imam provided training in the use of hand grenades, rocket propelled grenades and the use, maintenance and assembly and disassembly of AK-47 rifles. Whereabouts Imam remains at large. He has been indicted in both the Canadian and US Civil justice systems. Although journalist Colin Freeze speculated that Imam may have been killed by a missile fired from a Predator drone, the United States Department of Justice confirmed in a statement on Farekh's arrest on April 2, 2015 that Imam is still alive and under indictment.

There are examples of order p^{2n} for every prime p and every positive integer n provided p^{2n}>4.Although the constructions will provide a projective plane of order 4, the unique such plane is Desarguesian and is generally not considered to be a Hall plane. Algebraic construction via Hall systems The original construction of Hall planes was based on a Hall quasifield (also called a Hall system), H of order p^{2n} for p a prime. The construction of the plane is the standard construction based on a quasifield (see Quasifield#Projective planes for the details.). To build a Hall quasifield, start with a Galois field, F = \\\\operatorname{GF}(p^n) for p a prime and a quadratic irreducible polynomial f(x) = x^2 - rx - s over F. Extend H=F\\\\times F, a two-dimensional vector space over F, to a quasifield by defining a multiplication on the vectors by (a,b)\\\\circ (c,d) = (ac -bd^{-1}f(c), ad - bc + br) when d eq 0 and (a,b) \\\\circ (c,0) = (ac, bc) otherwise. Writing the elements of H in terms of a basis <1, Œª>, that is, identifying (x,y) with x + Œªy as x and y vary over F, we can identify the elements of F as the ordered pairs (x, 0), i.e. x + Œª0. The properties of the defined multiplication which turn the right vector space H into a quasifield are: # every element Œ± of H not in F satisfies the quadratic equation f(Œ±) = 0; # F is in the kernel of H (meaning that (Œ± + Œ≤)c = Œ±c + Œ≤c, and (Œ±Œ≤)c = Œ±(Œ≤c) for all Œ±, Œ≤ in H and all c in F); and # every element of F commutes (multiplicatively) with all the elements of H. Derivation Another construction that produces Hall planes is obtained by applying derivation to Desarguesian planes. A process, due to T. G. Ostrom, which replaces certain sets of lines in a projective plane by alternate sets in such a way that the new structure is still a projective plane is called derivation. We give the details of this process. Start with a projective plane \\\\pi of order n^2 and designate one line \\\\ell as its line at infinity. Let A be the affine plane \\\\pi \\\\setminus \\\\ell. A set D of n + 1 points of \\\\ell is called a derivation set if for every pair of distinct points X and Y of A which determine a line meeting \\\\ell in a point of D, there is a Baer subplane containing X, Y and D (we say that such Baer subplanes belong to D.) Define a new affine plane \\\\operatorname{D}(A) as follows: The points of \\\\operatorname{D}(A) are the points of A. The lines of \\\\operatorname{D}(A) are the lines of \\\\pi which do not meet \\\\ell at a point of D (restricted to A) and the Baer subplanes that belong to D (restricted to A). The set \\\\operatorname{D}(A) is an affine plane of order n^2 and it, or its projective completion, is called a derived plane. Properties # Hall planes are translation planes. # All finite Hall planes of the same order are isomorphic. # Hall planes are not self-dual. # All finite Hall planes contain subplanes of order 2 (Fano subplanes). # All finite Hall planes contain subplanes of order different from 2. # Hall planes are Andr√© planes. The smallest Hall plane (order 9) The Hall plane of order 9 was actually found earlier by Oswald Veblen and Joseph Wedderburn in 1907. There are four quasifields of order nine which can be used to construct the Hall plane of order nine. Three of these are Hall systems generated by the irreducible polynomials f(x) = x^2 + 1, g(x) = x^2 - x - 1 or h(x) = x^2 + x - 1. The first of these produces an associative quasifield, that is, a near-field, and it was in this context that the plane was discovered by Veblen and Wedderburn. This plane is often referred to as the nearfield plane of order nine.

However a substantial donation came from Eliza and Ann Harrison of Weston Hall, daughters of Thomas Harrison an eminent Sheffield sawmaker. At the time of its construction Christ Church was within the Chapelry of Bradfield which was within the Bishopric of Ecclesfield, Stannington did not become a separate parish until 1843. Initially Christ Church did not have a vicar but used a curate, Mr. William Gill who lived in Bradfield, three miles to the north-west. Mr Gill conducted a morning service along with his other duties for six years but resigned in 1836 when he was asked to perform an evening service as well. These events led to the building of a much needed vicarage adjacent to the church as well as the provision of a stipend of ¬£100 per annum. In 1843 Stannington became a separate parish with Christ Church as the parish church; William Gill became the first vicar with the stipend increasing to ¬£129 per annum. The church has had several notable vicars over the years: Samuel Parkes was in office for 28 years between 1879 and 1908, Francis Augustine Stebbing was the longest serving vicar between 1916 and 1963, the last incumbent Canon Philip West had, until very recently, been Christ Church‚Äôs vicar for over 20 years.\\"Stannington\\", Stannington Local History Group, no ISBN, Page 28/29, Gives history of church.

Architecture and features The church is built from coarse gritstone blocks in a symmetrical Gothic style. There is a low square bell tower with a weather vane on top and a three-faced clock and louvres below. Among the eye catching exterior features are the seven embattled turrets which stand on top of corner piers. The lychgate at the front entrance to the churchyard was erected in July 1940 by Rebecca Nichols in memory of her husband John who died in December 1914. The graveyard was enlarged in 1919 but is now almost full with very little space for new graves. The exterior of the church has had very few changes while the interior has been re-ordered several times. There was originally seating for 1,000 people but this is now greatly reduced, two long side balconies which went across the windows making the church very dark were removed in 1964 by the Reverend Trevor Hudson. A third balcony still remains along the back wall; at one time it housed the organ and the choir sang from there. The original font was brought from Bradfield by the Reverend Gill in 1927. It was replaced by the Angel Font in July 1945 with the original then installed as a feature in the churchyard; unfortunately it was stolen in 2001.\\"Around Stannington\\", Stannington Local History Group, , Gives history of church and interior. A major renovation of the interior was undertaken in 1992/93 when the pews were removed and replaced by chairs; a new floor was laid and carpeted throughout and the church was rewired. At the same time a new vestry was added, the font was brought to the front of the church and the baptistery at the rear was enlarged to form a narthex. A large open space was also created at the front of the church by the removal of the choir stalls.

Biography After studies in Padua, he returned to his birthplace of Venice, where he worked as a journalist. He contributed to the daily newspaper Caff√® Pedrocchi, a pro- unification publication that promoted Italian unification. During the 1848 uprisings, during which a failed attempt was made to free Venice from Austrian rule, Stefani was imprisoned. He was exiled, along with 86 other political prisoners condemned by Austria for their \\"perseverance in unjustifiable intrigues and revolutionary for their subversive tendencies\\". He went to Turin, where he was the Editor-in-Chief of the Piedmont newspaper Gazzetta piemontese. Stefani continued as director of the newspaper from 1849 to 1857. Agenzia Stefani (Agenzia Telegrafica Stefani) was founded by Stefani in Turin, Italy on 26 January 1853,\\"News Agencies from Pigeon to Internet\\" by K.M. Shrivastava at a time when news agencies were also being established in other major European cities: Charles-Louis Havas established the Havas agency in Paris in 1836, Dr. Bernard Wolff established an agency in Berlin in 1849, and Paul Reuter established Reuters in London in 1858 (relocating from Aachen, where it had been established in 1851). These agencies made it easier to circulate news coverage between reporters whose work was originally done in English, French, German, or Italian. They pooled their own translation and research resources, and newspapers came to them as a centralized conduit for foreign news coverage in particular. Agenzia Stefani was founded with assistance from Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, who was Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. Along with the Count de Cavour, Guglielmo Stefani supported Italian unification efforts. The Kingdom of Italy (1861‚Äì1946) would be established in the same year that both Cavour and Stefani died. The Agenzia Stefani continued after Stefani's death, and was known as a propaganda tool of the ruling regime in Italy, including during the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. Agenzia Stefani was originally focussed on gathering news from Turin and the surrounding Piedmont area, but it increased in size and scope of news coverage as Italy was united during the mid- to late-19th century. For gathering foreign news, Agenzia Stefani held a contract with Paris news agency Havas. Agenzia Stefani transferred its headquarters, following the change in Italian capital cities, to Florence. In 1881, the headquarters of Agenzia Stefani moved from Turin to Rome, which already had a large community of journalists covering news related to the Vatican. Agenzia Stefani was less autonomous than other European news agencies, and in fact, operated much as a government agency in Italy, serving as a mouthpiece for the government regime.

Her work was recognized by various awards. Life L√≥pez de Jes√∫s was born into a poor Amuzgo family in Xochislahuaca, in the Costa Chica region of the state of Guerrero, Mexico. Like most Amuzgo girls, she learned to weave cotton garments by watching and imitating her mother starting at age six. When she was fourteen, she went to work as a maid to help the family's finances. She was still able to weave during this time, but not as much as she would have liked. The experience gave her the idea of creating pieces to sell in nearby Ometepec, not just for family use. Known as ‚ÄúTina‚Äù by friends and family, she worked to promote Amuzgo textiles and the rights of indigenous women. In 1969, she founded the first cooperative for women weavers in her hometown, called La Flor de Xochistlahuaca, which is still functioning. In 1971 she was elected as a community representative for the municipality of Xochistlahuaca. She gave formal and informal classes others in the town and region, and participated in a class on natural dyes given by Spanish expert Ana Roquer in 1994 and a course in spinning in 1995 L√≥pez de Jes√∫s died at age 74 from a heart attack. Most of the town attended her funeral as well as a representative from the INBA. She was buried in the community cemetery. Career L√≥pez de Jes√∫s began her weaving career by selling pieces at the nearby city of Ometepec to earn money to help her family. Her work caught the attention of FONART and from 1969 and 1971, she sold her work through this government agency. She was involved in production from the growing of cotton to creating the final product, researching methods of weaving and dyeing with plants and minerals from the area around Xochistlahuaca. She also attended seminars on natural dyes and mastered various weaving techniques such as taffeta, simple weave, talet√≥n (a variation of taffeta) and variations of gauze. Her particular specialty was the weaving of brocade in white and coyuche (a local brown variation) cotton with the design woven in using variously colored weft threads. In addition to traditional huipils, she produces napkins, tablecloths, rebozos and bedspreads. By special order, she has made garments with other fibers such as silk and synthetics. Her work has won a number of awards including 2nd place Gran Premio de Arte Popular, FONART in 1987, 1st place Gran Premio de Arte Popular, FONART in 1991 and Premio Nacional de Artesanias de SECOFI in 1993. In 2001 she won the UNESCO Handcrafts Prize. Her work has been exhibited in museums and various international exhibits, including one in Spain in 2001 that attracted the attention of Queen Sofia.

It explains Branden's theories of human psychology, focusing on the role of self-esteem. Most of the book was written during Branden's association with Ayn Rand, and it reflects some of her philosophical ideas. The book's success helped to popularize the idea of self-esteem as an important element of self-improvement. Synopsis The book is divided into two parts. In Part One (\\"The Foundations\\"), Branden explains his views on human nature and the science of psychology. He discusses his theories about consciousness, volition, emotions (with particular attention to emotional repression) and mental health. The material in Part One is about philosophical and psychological theory and does not focus on self-esteem, which is the predominant subject in Part Two (\\"The Psychology of Self-Esteem\\"). He describes self-esteem as \\"the integrated sum of self-confidence and self- respect\\", which he describes respectively as \\"a sense of personal efficacy and a sense of personal worth.\\" Branden considers self-esteem to be one of the most important factors in human psychology. Branden contrasts healthy self- esteem with conditions that he views as psychological problems. First is what he calls \\"pseudo-self-esteem,\\" which he describes as \\"an irrational pretense at self-value,\\" and \\"a nonrational, self-protective device to diminish anxiety and to provide a spurious sense of security\\". Next he discusses pathological anxiety, which he traces to a lack of self-esteem, particularly a lack of self-confidence. He further connects this to feelings of guilt and depression, which he views as aspects of anxiety. The last problem he discusses is one he calls \\"social metaphysics\\", which he describes as \\"the psychological syndrome that characterizes a person who holds the minds of other men, not objective reality, as his ultimate psycho-epistemological frame of reference.\\" The final chapter discusses psychotherapy. Branden emphasizes the importance of moral values, stating that \\"there is no way for a psychotherapist to keep his own moral convictions out of his professional work.\\" He does not view this as a flaw, but rather argues that the therapist should guide patients towards values that will improve their self-esteem. \\"Effective psychotherapy requires a conscious, rational, scientific code of ethics\\", says Branden, and he identifies that code as the Objectivist ethics of Ayn Rand. He then briefly discusses five different therapeutic techniques and wraps up the book with a concluding section. The thirty-second anniversary edition adds a preface in which Branden explains that although his views have changed in some ways, he has chosen not to alter the original text. Instead he added an epilogue on \\"Working with Self-Esteem in Psychotherapy\\". The epilogue updates his views on self-esteem, which have changed in some particulars since the book was first written. He also describes his more recent therapeutic methods, focusing on the use of sentence-completion exercises. Background The Psychology of Self-Esteem was largely written while Branden was associated with Ayn Rand. It was Branden's first solo book, although he had previously written essays for two of Rand's books and for Who Is Ayn Rand?, which he co-wrote with his then- wife Barbara Branden. Some of the material comes from Who Is Ayn Rand? and from articles he wrote for The Objectivist, a magazine he and Rand co-edited. Rand was Branden's mentor and former lover, but in 1968 she had broken off all relations with him. In his memoirs, Branden recalled that important parts of the book were written during the \\"agonizing chaos\\" of the collapse of their relationship. Rand had helped Branden obtain a contract with World Publishing, which was affiliated with her own publisher, and had offered to write an introduction for the book. When their relationship ended, she pressured the publisher to cancel his contract, which they did after he missed a deadline for delivering the completed manuscript. She also threatened to withhold the use of material that had been copyrighted by The Objectivist, although she took no legal action when Branden used the material anyway. Publication history Despite Rand's effort's to prevent the book's publication, the newly founded Nash Publishing released it in the fall of 1969. The paperback rights were subsequently sold to Bantam Books. In 2001, a thirty-second anniversary edition was published by Jossey-Bass, with a new introduction and epilogue by Branden. =Editions= * First edition (hardcover). 1969. Los Angeles: Nash Publishing. . . * First paperback edition. 1971. New York: Bantam Books. . . * 32nd anniversary edition. 2001. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. . . Reception The book was a popular success and has sold over a million copies. It has been credited with spreading ideas about self-esteem to general audiences. Self- help expert Tom Butler-Bowdon warned that \\"readers find this book tough going\\", particularly in the earlier chapters, but described it as \\"one of the earliest classics of the popular psychology genre\\". Critics such as sociologist Frank Furedi and neuropsychologist Paul Pearsall cited the book as an example of what they see as a cultural trend of over-emphasizing the significance of self-esteem. Psychology professor Robyn Dawes said that Branden propagated a false \\"belief that human distress can be traced to deficient self-esteem\\", which Dawes describes as based in bias rather than evidence. Author Charles Murray, although critical of the self-esteem movement in general, is somewhat more positive about Branden. Murray said it would have been better if other promoters of self-esteem \\"had focused on self-esteem as Branden described it--an internalized sense of self-responsibility and self- sufficiency.\\" In contrast, author Alfie Kohn supported the idea that self- esteem was important, but criticized Branden for founding his work \\"in Ayn Rand's glorification of selfishness.\\" Branden's connection to Rand was also criticized by psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, who said the book wrongly ignores the work of those outside Rand's Objectivist movement, especially other psychologists and therapists besides Branden himself. He accuses Branden of \\"an exaggerated sense of self-importance and an uncritical reverence for Rand as a psychologist.\\" In The Myth of Self-Esteem, psychologist Albert Ellis faulted the book for focusing on \\"reason and competence\\" as the only sources of self-esteem, a position he describes Branden as moving away from later.

It is widely associated with a set of six identical sculptures but is also associated with a series of paintings. Sculptures In the 1980s and 1990s, Lichtenstein created painted bronze sculptures that were based on his earlier paintings. Expressionist Head was among the earliest of these sculptural adaptations. The sculpture is composed of painted and patinated bronze with painted wooden base. Expressionist Head reflects rootings of German Expressionist prints because of its \\"angular anatomies and bold contours\\", but Lichtenstein swapped out his characteristic Ben-Day dots with hatch marks to in his favored primary colors. Like many Lichtenstein sculptures, this set is essentially two-dimensional rather than volumetric. Lichtenstein replaced Ben-Day dots with stripes in some of his sketches because it was more efficient. Stripes did not become common in his finished goods until he began working with sculptures. In Expressionist Head, stripes accentuate the sculpture's linear aspects. Like almost all 20 of his sculptures produced up to 1980, this \\"...began as a line drawing, in elevation; proceeded to full-scale blacktape layout; and then to a magna- painted, handcrafted wooden maquette, which established the mold for the casting...in bronze by lost-wax process.\\" Paintings One element of the painting series (pictured in infobox) was sold at Sotheby's on May 12, 2010 for $4,282,500. In the subsequent months that element of the painting series was exhibited at the Nevada Museum of Art in a four-month single-painting exhibition. There are five different paintings listed on the Lichtenstein Foundation website under the title Expressionist Head. Three are from 1980, while one each is from 1982 and 1984. Another work by the same name had sold at Christie's, New York on November 18, 1997 for $ 300,000 USD.

Andr√© Bollier (May 30, 1920 ‚Äì June 17, 1944) was a member of the French Resistance during World War II. Bollier was born in Paris, and enrolled in the √âcole Polytechnique in 1938. He was called up for military service after his first year of studies, in September 1939, at the start of the Phoney War. He trained in Fontainebleau, and was sent to Alsace in February 1940, assigned to the 68th Artillery Regiment of the 70th Infantry Division. He saw combat there, and was severely wounded and captured in an engagement with German troops on June 21, 1940. Due to his injuries he was released by the Germans in November 1940, and returned to study at the Polytechnique. In 1941, Bollier became active in the resistance, participating in the distribution of the underground newspaper Les Petites Ailes (Small Wings). Following his graduation from the Polytechnique, he made contact with the resistance organization Combat. He wrote in the group's newspaper, also named Combat, under the pseudonym Lefranc, among other activities. His participation in effecting the escape of Berty Albrecht on December 23, 1942, caused him to be briefly arrested, and subsequently to go underground. In 1943‚Äì44 he devoted himself to organizing the printing of Combat, taking over as printer from the first printer, Martinet, and turning it into a significant operation that printed over a million newspapers in several regions. During this period he used the pseudonyms Carton and V√©lin. Bollier was arrested in Lyon on March 8, 1944, and subjected to interrogation and torture. He eventually escaped on May 2, 1944, and rejoined the resistance. A little over a month later, however, on June 17, 1944, a large Gestapo and Milice force surrounded his clandestine printing office. In a shootout, Bollier was shot, and then shot himself to avoid being taken alive. Following the war, he was posthumously awarded the Ordre de la Lib√©ration.

Background Morgagni was born in Forl√¨-Cesena in 1879. His father was Andrea Morgagni, and his mother was Giulitta Monti. He is the brother of another prominent journalist, Tullio Morgagni. Morgagni gained a diploma from a commercial college. He was initially a supporter of socialist trade unions. He supported Italian intervention in World War I. From 15 November 1914 to 1919, he was administrative director of Il Popolo d'Italia, a newspaper he co-founded with Benito Mussolini. He turned the illustrated newspaper toward support of Fascism, including publishing lavish coverage of Fascist rallies, using foldout panorama images. Along with his brother, Tullio Morgagni, he was one of the founders of the Italian long-distance bicycle race, the Giro d'Italia, under the sponsorship of rival newspapers. In 1919, Arnaldo Mussolini became director of the newspaper, while Morgagni remained in charge of advertising. Morgagni became active in civic politics in Milan, serving as a city councillor from 1923 to 1926, and then as mayor of Milan from 1927 to 1928. In 1928, he founded the agricultural newspaper Nature. Agenzia Stefani and Mussolini Manlio Morgagni has been described as an \\"acolyte\\" of Mussolini, and was an avowed supporter of Fascism. As Chairman of Agenzia Stefani from 1924 to 1943, he steered the news agency towards hardline propaganda in support of Mussolini. Journalists in Italy who opposed the Fascist regime were arrested and imprisoned at the islands Lipari and Lampedusa along with other political prisoners. Agenzia Stefani \\"systematically distorted the news\\" under Morgagni. While Italy lacked a propagandist with the individual influence of Joseph Goebbels, Mussolini was active in turning journalists into supporters of his regime, including foreign journalists, who he courted and flattered to gain positive coverage in American and European newspapers. In 1924, Mussolini merged the existing radio broadcasters in Italy to form the Unione Radiofonica Italiana (URI), with Enrico Marchesi as its president. The agreement between the government and URI gave the government full censorship powers over URI broadcasts, and the only news to be broadcast by URI was from Agenzia Stefani. Morgagni was nominated to the Senate of Italy by the Minister of Culture in 1939, and was named to the Senate the same year. During his career, Morgagni was decorated by the Fascist regime several times, receiving the following distinctions: image:Cavaliere di Gran Croce OCI Kingdom BAR.svgCavaliere di Gran Croce dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia, received April 24, 1935 image:Grande ufficiale SSML Regno BAR.svgGrand'Ufficiale dell'Ordine dei Santi Maurizio e Lazzaro, received June 11, 1936 Death Morgagni committed suicide on July 25, 1943, remaining a supporter of Mussolini to the end. Morgagni's suicide note was written to Mussolini: Morgagni is buried in Milan. Agenzia Stefani had remained privately owned and ostensibly independent, despite many decades of close alignment with Italy's ruling regimes. This nominal independence ended with the death of Morgagni. Agenzia Stefani was appropriated outright by the Fascist government regime, and relocated to Northern Italy in 1943. Its last director, Ernesto Daquanno, was executed on April 28, 1945, shot with several other Fascist leaders.

Collyns stated the earliest actual record of a pack of staghounds on Exmoor was 1598. In 1803, the \\"North Devon Staghounds\\" became a subscription pack. In 1824/5 30 couples of hounds, the last of the true staghounds, were sold to a baron in Germany.Collyns, p. 14 Today, the Devon and Somerset is one of three staghounds packs in the U.K., the others being the Quantock Staghounds and the Tiverton Staghounds.

A stag hunt has been for many years kept up in this vicinity. The hounds were formerly kept by Mr. Dyke, of Somersetshire, whose heiress married Sir Thomas Acland's grandfather, and afterwards by the Aclands. After the death of the late Sir Thomas Acland, they were kept for a while by Mr. Basset. After this, they were kept for several years by Lord Fortescue, at Castlehill, who, about three years ago, made them over to R. Lucas, Esq., of Baronshill, in Somersetshire. The average number of deer killed in a season has been about 10 stags, and about double that number of hinds. (fn. 3) Marshall, in his Rural ≈íconomy of the Western Counties, observes, that wild deer abounded in the woods of the west of Devon; but that through the good offices of the Duke of Bedford, the country was then (about 1795) nearly free from them.\\" of Pixton, in Somerset, (eldest brother of Thomas Dyke (d. 1745) of Tetton and of John Dyke (d. 1732) of Holnicote, all in Somerset), was the warden and lesee of the royal forest of Exmoor and Master of Staghounds, which office usually was held by the warder.Acland, Anne, A Devon Family: The Story of the Aclands, London and Chichester, 1981, pp. 17-18 He married Margaret Trevelyan, a daughter of Sir John Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet (1670‚Äì1755), of Nettlecombe in Somerset, and widow of Alexander Luttrell (1705‚Äì1737) of Dunster Castle. Edward inherited Holnicote and estates in Bampton from his brother John Dyke (d. 1732), who died without progeny. He too died without progeny and bequeathed Pixton and Holnicote to his niece Elizabeth Dyke (d. 1753), whom he appointed his sole executor, daughter and sole heiress of his brother Thomas Dyke (d. 1745) of Tetton, Kingston St Mary, Somerset. The bequest stipulated that Elizabeth and her husband Sir Thomas Acland, 7th Baronet (1722‚Äì1785) of Killerton in Devon and Petherton Park in Somerset, should adopt the additional surname of Dyke. Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet (1723‚Äì1785) painted in 1767 by Sir Joshua Reynolds. The bloodline of the large staghound with its head on his knee was lost when the pack was sold to Germany in 1824, and later rebuilt from foxhounds. Two identical versions exist, both owned by the National Trust, one at Saltram House, the other at Killerton House, both in Devon * 1746-1775Acland, 1981, pp. 18, 22 Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet (1722‚Äì1785), of Killerton in Devon and of Petherton Park, Tetton, Holnicote and Pixton, all in Somerset, kept his own pack of staghounds.

Respected and beloved by all the countryside, he was solicited at the same time to allow himself to be returned as member of Parliament for the counties of Devon and Somerset. He preferred, however, the duties and pleasures of life in the country, where he bore without abuse the grand old name of gentleman\\".Collyns, p. 9 Although he had three of his own kennels on his huge estates, at Holnicote in the north and at Jury and Highercombe near Pixton in the south, he had a further method of keeping hounds, which was to make the keeping of one hound a term in many of the tenancy contracts he granted. In his manor of Bossington (near Holnicote) alone an estate survey of 1746‚Äì7 lists twelve tenements let, either by Acland or Dyke, with the requirement to keep a hound.Ravenhill, Mary & Rowe, Margery, The Acland Family: Maps and Surveys 1720-1840, Devon & Cornwall Record Society, New Series, Vol. 49, Exeter, 2006, p. 8 In 1775 he handed over the mastership to the then Major Basset, and in 1779 his beloved collection of stag heads and antlers at Holnicote was lost in a fire which also destroyed the house. He declared that \\"he minded the destruction of his valuables less bitterly than the loss of his fine collection of stags' heads\\".Acland, 1981, p. 25 He was known on his estates as \\"Sir Thomas his Honour\\"Acland, 1981, p. 26 (as later was his son the 9th Baronet) and was renowned for his generous hospitality at Holnicote or at Pixton, whichever was closest, to all riders \\"in at the death\\",Acland, 1981, p. 18 and it is said that \\"open house was kept at Pixton and Holnicote throughout the hunting season\\".Acland, 1981, p. 19 Pixton was the larger establishment, richly equipped with silver-plate and linen, including 73 tablecloths, but both houses had silver dinner services of five dozen plates and any number of tankards, cups, bowls, dishes and salvers.

He died unmarried, being the last in the male line of the Heanton branch of the ancient Basset family. His heir was his nephew Joseph Davie (1764-1846) of Orleigh Court, near Bideford, who took the name Basset in lieu of his patronymic and built Watermouth Castle, near Lynmouth.He was the son of John Davie of Orleigh by his wife Eleanora Bassett, sister of Col.

When the war started on the 3rd of August and on the 4th or 5th they took the hounds to the meet, he says in his diary that he went in mufti and the staff in uniform. They sang 'God save the King', and he sent the hounds home. He went straight off to his regiment, which was the Royal North Devon Yeomanry. In due course he went to Gallipoli and was killed. He was aged 53 (in fact 50twgpp). How many people of 43 or even 33, do you know who went to the last war? It was amazing fortitude. They wouldn't have let him go now.

In 2003, after being nominated for the Lexmark European Art Prize, (and while still studying at the Royal College of Art), Meredith Etherington-Smith, former editor of Art Review, said of his short-listed piece: \\"David Wightman frames his picture perfect Swiss postcard in the cool collateral of a Ben Nicholson modernist painting\\". In 2009, he showed a large site-specific painting: Behemoth at Cornerhouse, Manchester (2009) and went on to exhibit with Sumarria Lunn Gallery at The Hempel, London (2010). In 2010-11 he was one of two artists (the other being Hannah Maybank) selected for the Berwick Gymnasium Arts Fellowships - a six-month residency supported by English Heritage and Arts Council England. The residency took place in a Nicholas Hawksmoor designed former military gymnasium in Berwick- upon-Tweed, Northumberland. In 2013, he was commissioned by HOUSE Festival in Brighton (selected by artist Mariele Neudecker) to make a site-specific painting for a disused pavilion on Brighton's seafront.

He is best remembered for his books, including music textbooks, music history and biographies of famous musicians. Life and career Rockstro was born William Smyth Rackstraw in North Cheam, Surrey. (He adopted an older form of his family name from 1846).Williamson, Rosemary. \\"Rockstro, W.S.\\", Grove Music Online., Oxford Music Online, accessed 12 May 2012 He studied composition and piano with William Sterndale Bennett, and from 1845 to 1846 he studied at the Leipzig Conservatory under Felix Mendelssohn (composition and piano). His contemporaries there included Joseph Joachim and Otto Goldschmidt.\\"Obituary: William Smyth Rockstro\\", The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular , Vol. 36, No. 630 (August 1895), p. 549 After his studies in Leipzig, Rockstro established himself as a teacher of piano and singing in London, and he secured a regular appointment as an accompanist at a recital series. In the early 1860s he moved to the West Country, where he lived for nearly 30 years. Rockstro was an enthusiast for early music. In 1885 he conducted a concert of sacred music of the 16th and 17th centuries at the Royal Albert Hall. His own compositions, conservative in style, include operatic fantasias, short piano pieces, and songs. In 1886, he conducted his oratorio The Good Shepherd at the Three Choirs Festival, though it was not considered a success. The Times praised its obvious sincerity but complained of its conspicuous debt to Mendelssohn and its lack of good tunes.\\"The Gloucester Music Festival\\", The Times, 9 September 1886, p. 6 Together with his former pupil J A Fuller Maitland,Dibble, Jeremy, \\"Maitland, John Alexander Fuller (1856‚Äì1936)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2009, accessed 16 May 2012 Rockstro collaborated on a collection, English Carols of the 15th Century (1891). As an editor of music of earlier centuries he was far from scholarly in his changes: The Times commented that his edition of the St Matthew Passion \\"introduced marks of expression in a wholesale fashion not likely to meet with the approval of purists\\".\\"The Bach Choir\\", The Times, 27 March 1884, p. 6 In 1891 he moved from the West Country back to London, where he taught both privately and at the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music. Rockstro's later years were marred by ill health, but his death at the age of 72 was nonetheless sudden and unexpected. Publications Rockstro is best known for his books. Books about musical practice were A Key to Practical Harmony (1881), Practical Harmony: a Manual for the Use of Young Students (1881), and The Rules of Counterpoint Systematically Arranged for the Use of Young Students (1882). His books on musical history were A History of Music for the Use of Young Students (1879) and A General History of Music from the Infancy of the Greek Drama to the Present Period (1886). He published biographical studies of Handel (1883) and Mendelssohn (1884) and two books about Jenny Lind, Memoir of Madame Jenny Lind-Goldschmidt: her Early Art-Life and Dramatic Career, 1820‚Äì1851 (with H.S. Holland, 1891) and Jenny Lind, her Vocal Art and Culture (1894).

The cell for a given circle C consists of all the points for which the power distance to C is smaller than the power distance to the other circles. The power diagram is a form of generalized Voronoi diagram, and coincides with the Voronoi diagram of the circle centers in the case that all the circles have equal radii..... Definition The power of a point P outside of a given circle If C is a circle and P is a point outside C, then the power of P with respect to C is the square of the length of a line segment from P to a point T of tangency with C. Equivalently, if P has distance d from the center of the circle, and the circle has radius r, then (by the Pythagorean theorem) the power is d2 ‚àí r2. The same formula d2 ‚àí r2 may be extended to all points in the plane, regardless of whether they are inside or outside of C: points on C have zero power, and points inside C have negative power. The power diagram of a set of n circles Ci is a partition of the plane into n regions Ri (called cells), such that a point P belongs to Ri whenever circle Ci is the circle minimizing the power of P. The radical axis of two intersecting circles. The power diagram of the two circles is the partition of the plane into two halfplanes formed by this line. In the case n = 2, the power diagram consists of two halfplanes, separated by a line called the radical axis or chordale of the two circles. Along the radical axis, both circles have equal power. More generally, in any power diagram, each cell Ri is a convex polygon, the intersection of the halfspaces bounded by the radical axes of circle Ci with each other circle. Triples of cells meet at vertices of the diagram, which are the radical centers of the three circles whose cells meet at the vertex. Related constructions The power diagram may be seen as a weighted form of the Voronoi diagram of a set of point sites, a partition of the plane into cells within which one of the sites is closer than all the other sites. Other forms of weighted Voronoi diagram include the additively weighted Voronoi diagram, in which each site has a weight that is added to its distance before comparing it to the distances to the other sites, and the multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram, in which the weight of a site is multiplied by its distance before comparing it to the distances to the other sites. In contrast, in the power diagram, we may view each circle center as a site, and each circle's squared radius as a weight that is subtracted from the squared Euclidean distance before comparing it to other squared distances. In the case that all the circle radii are equal, this subtraction makes no difference to the comparison, and the power diagram coincides with the Voronoi diagram. A planar power diagram may also be interpreted as a planar cross-section of an unweighted three-dimensional Voronoi diagram. In this interpretation, the set of circle centers in the cross-section plane are the perpendicular projections of the three-dimensional Voronoi sites, and the squared radius of each circle is a constant K minus the squared distance of the corresponding site from the cross-section plane, where K is chosen large enough to make all these radii positive.. Like the Voronoi diagram, the power diagram may be generalized to Euclidean spaces of any dimension. The power diagram of n spheres in d dimensions is combinatorially equivalent to the intersection of a set of n upward-facing halfspaces in d + 1 dimensions, and vice versa. Algorithms and applications Two-dimensional power diagrams may be constructed by an algorithm that runs in time O(n log n). More generally, because of the equivalence with higher-dimensional halfspace intersections, d-dimensional power diagrams (for d > 2) may be constructed by an algorithm that runs in time O(n^{\\\\lceil d/2\\\\rceil}). The power diagram may be used as part of an efficient algorithm for computing the volume of a union of spheres. Intersecting each sphere with its power diagram cell gives its contribution to the total union, from which the volume may be computed in time proportional to the complexity of the power diagram.. Other applications of power diagrams include data structures for testing whether a point belongs to a union of disks, algorithms for constructing the boundary of a union of disks, and algorithms for finding the closest two balls in a set of balls.. History traces the definition of the power distance to the work of 19th-century mathematicians Edmond Laguerre and Georgy Voronoy. defined power diagrams and used them to show that the boundary of a union of n circular disks can always be illuminated from at most 2n point light sources..

During the Jacobite rising of 1745, McDonald fought as a lieutenant under the command of Charles Edward Stuart in the Battle of Culloden, after which he was \\"attainted of treason\\". He fled Scotland, departing from Inverness for the Colony of Virginia in 1746 at the age of 18. Following his arrival in Virginia, McDonald worked as a merchant in Falmouth for two or three years. McDonald moved west into Virginia's interior and entered the military service of the colonial government under Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie, receiving the rank of captain. McDonald served in the French and Indian War under General John Forbes, in which he was in command of a company of Scottish Highlanders. Following the war, McDonald retired with the rank of captain in 1763. In 1765, McDonald returned to military service when he was commissioned by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as a major in command of the Frederick County militia. Lord Fairfax also appointed McDonald as an attorney and land agent for his Northern Neck Proprietary. Governor John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore commissioned McDonald in 1774 as a ranking military officer of an expedition (known as \\"McDonald's Expedition\\") to promptly organize and recruit settlers west of the Allegheny Mountains to defend settlements from Native American attacks. McDonald completed the expedition, which met its goal of temporarily relieving western Virginia frontier settlements from attack. McDonald received a personal letter from General George Washington in 1777 appointing him a lieutenant colonel in a battalion of Thruston's Additional Continental Regiment under the command of Colonel Charles Mynn Thruston. Despite his loyalty to the American Revolutionary cause, McDonald refused Washington's appointment. McDonald was later appointed by Washington to serve as a lieutenant colonel in command of Virginia revolutionary militia forces during the American Revolutionary War. He also served on various revolutionary committees throughout the war. Early life Angus McDonald was born in 1727 in the Scottish Highlands. He was an immediate family member of a chief of the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, whose clan seat was Invergarry Castle. He was probably the son of Angus McDonald, who was a younger son of Alastair Dubh McDonald, the commander of the Glengarry clan in the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689 during the early Jacobite risings. McDonald was a lineal descendant of a long line of military heroes of the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry and of Somerled, Lord of the Isles. McDonald was raised and educated in Glasgow. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, McDonald fought as a lieutenant under the command of Charles Edward Stuart in the Battle of Culloden, after which he was \\"attainted of treason\\". He fled Scotland, departing from Inverness for the Colony of Virginia in 1746 at the age of 18. Colonial military service =Early colonial military career= McDonald arrived in Virginia at the port of Falmouth on the Rappahannock River. Among the belongings he brought with him were the short sword, sash and gorget bearing the Glengarry coat of arms that he had worn at the Battle of Culloden. Following his arrival, McDonald remained in Falmouth for two or three years where he worked as a merchant. McDonald moved west into Virginia's interior and entered the military service of the colonial government under Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie, receiving the rank of captain. In return for his \\"meritorious service\\" in conflicts against Native Americans, McDonald received of land from the colonial government of Virginia in 1754. Around that same year, McDonald moved further west to the settlement of Winchester where he established the first Masonic Lodge in 1760. While in Winchester, McDonald served as a member of the Committee of Safety. McDonald's grandfather, Alastair Dubh McDonald (pictured), served as the commander of the Glengarry clan in the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689 during the early Jacobite risings. McDonald served in the French and Indian War under General John Forbes in which he was in command of a company of Scottish Highlanders. McDonald and his company marched against Fort Duquesne in the autumn of 1758. Following the war, McDonald retired with the rank of captain in 1763. Upon his retirement, Governor John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore granted McDonald an additional of land, which were surveyed by Hancock Taylor. On October 29, 1762, prior to his land grant from Lord Dunmore, McDonald purchased from Brian Bruin east of Winchester on which he built the original McDonald family residence in the region, which he named Glengarry after his ancestral homeland. In 1765, McDonald returned to military service when he was commissioned by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as a major in command of the Frederick County militia. That same year, Lord Fairfax appointed McDonald as an attorney and land agent for his Northern Neck Proprietary. By 1769, McDonald was a magistrate of the Frederick County court along with associate magistrates Lord Fairfax, Samuel Washington (brother of George Washington), Warner Washington (Washington's first cousin), Taverner Beale and Reverend Charles Mynn Thruston. In early 1774, McDonald participated in an expedition surveying the \\"military bounty lands\\" lying along the Ohio and Kanawha rivers to be granted by the colonial government of Virginia to soldiers and officers in exchange for their military service in the French and Indian War. The expedition was cut short due to hostilities with Native Americans, and McDonald provided an account of these hostilities and reports he received of attacks against settlers to Lord Dunmore. McDonald's accounts along with those of other settlers resulted in Lord Dunmore's decision to wage a war against the Native Americans to pacify the frontier lands of western Virginia for continued settlement. McDonald was an immediate family member of a chief of the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, whose clan seat was Invergarry Castle (pictured) overlooking Loch Oich. =McDonald's Expedition and Dunmore's War= In early June 1774, Lord Dunmore further commissioned McDonald as a ranking military officer of an expedition (known as \\"McDonald's Expedition\\") to promptly organize and recruit settlers west of the Allegheny Mountains along the Youghiogheny and Monongahela rivers in order to defend European American settlements from Native American attacks. Lord Dunmore commissioned Michael Cresap as a captain under McDonald's command and placed him in charge of the enlistment of a force from Hampshire County. McDonald and Cresap's combined forces numbered approximately 400 men following their convergence near present-day Wheeling on the Ohio River. In addition to Cresap, other captains in the expedition included Michael Cresap, Jr., Hancock Lee, Daniel Morgan, James Wood and Henry Hoagland. Once the entire force had converged near Wheeling, McDonald and Captain William Crawford directed the construction of Fort Fincastle in July 1774. Following the erection of the stockade, McDonald ordered each of his soldiers to pack seven days' worth of provisions. On July 26, 1774, his forces crossed the Ohio River at the mouth of Fish Creek about south of Fort Fincastle. McDonald's forces continued down the Ohio River in boats and canoes until they reached the mouth of Captina Creek, from which they marched toward the Shawnee villages of Wakatomika (also known as Wapatomica) near the mouth of Wakatomika Creek (modern-day Dresden, Ohio) on the Muskingum River. McDonald's forces had not encountered any enemy Native American forces on their expedition until about from Wakatomika, where they were ambushed by a force of approximately 30 to 50 Shawnee arranged in columns at the head of a swampy crossing. The ambush resulted in the deaths of two soldiers and the wounding of up to eight or nine more. Following the ambush, McDonald and his forces reached the Muskingum River around nightfall on August 2, 1774. McDonald and his forces arrived at the \\"chief Wakatomika town\\" only to discover that it had been evacuated by its Shawnee inhabitants, who were found nearby preparing to ambush McDonald's forces. The Shawnee in ambuscade surrendered to McDonald in exchange for peace. McDonald's forces continued their march onto the next Wakatomika settlement, where a further ambush ensued resulting in the burning of Shawnee cabins and villages. The ambush also resulted in the destruction of Shawnee plantations and maize fields. McDonald and his forces took three Shawnee scalps and one prisoner. McDonald and his forces returned to Wheeling with three Shawnee tribal chiefs as captives, who were then sent on to the colonial Virginia seat of government, Williamsburg. McDonald completed the expedition, which met its goal of temporarily relieving western Virginia frontier settlements from Native American attack. He continued to serve under Lord Dunmore until the end of the war. In a letter dated January 8, 1775, following his return to Winchester from Williamsburg, McDonald recounted of the war, \\"all the Country is well pleased with the Governours Expeditions.\\" Following Dunmore's War in December 1774, McDonald was further promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. On August 6, 1776, McDonald was appointed and took the oath of the sheriff and justice of Frederick County by the county court under an ordinance of the Virginia Convention of 1776. While serving as sheriff, he was placed in command of the militias of both Augusta and Frederick counties. At the time of his command of the Frederick and Augusta militias, the two counties encompassed much of the territory of Virginia between the Ohio River, the Tennessee boundary and the Blue Ridge Mountains, with the exception of Hampshire County which had been created from parts of Frederick and Augusta counties in 1754. American Revolutionary War During the onset of the American Revolution, McDonald was an ardent Whig. In March 1777, McDonald received a personal letter from General George Washington appointing him a lieutenant colonel in a battalion of Thruston's Additional Continental Regiment under the command of Colonel Charles Mynn Thruston, a former rector of Cunningham Chapel in present-day Clarke County, Virginia, and a former associate magistrate of the Frederick County court, where he served alongside McDonald. Despite his loyalty to the American Revolutionary cause, McDonald refused the appointment for either of two reasons: he would have been second- in-command to a colonel lacking prior military experience and McDonald had previously been a member of the vestry of Cunningham Chapel and resigned following a dispute with Thruston over \\"a matter of business with the church\\". General Adam Stephen, a fellow Scotsman, wrote a letter to McDonald dated March 15, 1777, in which he implored him to accept Washington's appointment, stating \\"Your appointment comes entirely from your own merit.\\" Stephen warned McDonald not to let his \\"Highland pride\\" dissuade him from serving under Thruston and in the event McDonald still refused Washington's offer, Stephen wrote: \\"Write a polite letter to General Washington thanking his excellency for his notice and making the best excuse you can.\\" McDonald was later appointed by Washington to serve as a lieutenant colonel in command of Virginia revolutionary militia forces during the American Revolutionary War. He also served on various revolutionary committees throughout the war. McDonald died on August 19, 1778, at his home Glengarry near Winchester after receiving an incorrect dosage of the medication potassium antimonyl tartrate. Legacy An article published in the Winchester Star in 1967 said of McDonald, \\"fearsome or not, he founded in the Shenandoah Valley a dynasty of military men as distinguished as their forebears had been in the Scottish Highlands.\\" In its documentation of Dunmore's War, the Wisconsin Historical Society stated, \\"McDonald was a man of commanding figure and strong personality and a rigid disciplinarian with his troops.\\" Marriage and children McDonald married Anna Thompson (1748 ‚Äì about 1832) of Hancock, Maryland on June 20, 1766. Anna was a daughter of John Thompson and his wife, Yocomanche Eltinge. The Eltinge family was of Dutch descent.
