The monastery is located approximately northwest of the village center. There are other churches in the vicinity, most notably the 13th-century monastic/church ruins of Ghuki Vank, the church ruins of S. Astvatsatsin (1207), and the 13th-century ruins of Surb Gevorg.  Architecture  South entrance to the adjoining gavit of S. Astvatsatsin Church The monastery consists of the Church of Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) with a large adjoining gavit. Just south of and adjacent to the church and gavit, are the remains of a rectangular depression of a building that had once consisted of two rooms. There are the remnants of a large doorway and four columns. It may have served as a small church with a gavit. Further upon the hill east of the main church, is a medieval cemetery with a small chapel. S. Astvatsatsin Church has three walls that have remained intact, while its southern wall and most of the drum and dome have since collapsed. The structure is relatively unadorned in comparison to its adjoining gavit. It has narrow windows at the north wall and altar, and would have presumably had another at the south wall. A portal leads into the gavit of the church from the west, directly across from the altar. The gavit abuts the hillside at its northwestern wall. All of the original walls, ceiling, and parts of the dome remain standing, while the exterior has not fared so well. Access to the gavit is through either the main and elaborately decorated entry at the south wall, an alternative entry at the opposite (north) wall, or from S. Astvatsatsin as mentioned earlier. Four very large columns support the vaulting that bears the weight of the roof above. The vaulting for the dome consists of six intersecting arches that form an oculus in the center to let light into the space. Several 13th-century inscriptions may be found upon the walls, columns, capitals, and arches. There are some large low-relief carvings of khachkars on the walls as well.

Plot A group of reporters visit the Great Ape Language Lab - a laboratory where bonobos are trained to communicate with humans by using American Sign Language and computer software to communicate with the scientist involved. Perhaps the most amazing phenomenon is that the bonobos actually want to communicate with humans, so much so that they pass it down to their young. But soon after the reporters leave, the lab is blown up, with the bonobos and a scientist (Isabel Duncan) inside. Isabel is badly injured and taken to a hospital. The bonobos escape from the lab only to be sold to a man named Ken Faulks. He is a famous for making pornography and devises a plan to put the apes on the air, in a show called Ape House. When Isabel discovers the bonobos' predicament, she travels to Lizard, New Mexico, where Ape House is shooting.

The downy wattle is classified as vulnerable; much of its habitat has vanished with the growth of the city of Sydney. Description It grows as a shrub to small tree from 1 to 5 m (3.3 to 16.4 ft) high. As with all wattles, it has leaf-like structures known as phyllodes instead of leaves, which are compound (pinnate) and measure in length. The globular yellow flowers appear in spring (August to October). Taxonomy French botanist √âtienne Pierre Ventenat described the downy wattle in 1803, in his Jardin de la Malmaison as Mimosa pubescens. It had been grown at the Ch√¢teau de Malmaison in the garden of the Empress Jos√©phine de Beauharnais. Robert Brown gave it its current name in 1813 in Hortus Kewensis. Common names include downy wattle and hairy-stemmed wattle. Derived from the Latin pubescens \\"hairy\\", the species name relates to the hairy stems. English botanist George Bentham classified A. pubescens in the series Botrycephalae in his 1864 Flora Australiensis. Queensland botanist Les Pedley reclassified the species as Racosperma pubescens in 2003, when he proposed placing almost all Australian members of the genus into the new genus Racosperma. However, this name is treated as a synonym of its original name. Along with other bipinnate wattles, it is classified in the section Botrycephalae within the subgenus Phyllodineae in the genus Acacia. An analysis of genomic and chloroplast DNA along with morphological characters found that the section is polyphyletic, though the close relationships of it and many other species were unable to be resolved. Hybrids with Cootamundra wattle (Acacia baileyana) and West Wyalong wattle (A. cardiophylla) have been reported. Description tree in Chullora Wetlands, Sydney Acacia pubescens grows as a shrub to small tree anywhere from high. The smooth bark is grey-brown in colour, and the branches can have a slightly drooping or weeping habit. Like all wattles, the downy wattle has leaf-like structures known as phyllodes which are compound (pinnate) and measure in length with 3 to 12 pairs of smaller \\"leaves\\" or pinnae, each long, and themselves composite - composed of 5 to 20 pairs of pinnules. Arranged in racemes, the globular yellow flowers appear in spring (August to October), peaking in September. Flowering is followed by the development of 3‚Äì7 cm long seed pods, which ripen over October to December. Distribution and habitat Endemic to New South Wales, Acacia pubescens is restricted to the Sydney Basin, where it is found in scattered populations from Bardwell Valley to Oakdale and Mountain Lagoon. Most plants are located around Bankstown, Fairfield and Rookwood in southwestern Sydney, and Pitt Town in the city's northwest. Most of its habitat has vanished with the spread of housing in Sydney's suburbs, and it is classified as \\"Vulnerable\\". It is found on clay soils and associated plant communities‚Äîalluvial- and shale-based soils. It grows in open sclerophyll forest, associated with such species as grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana), broad-leaved ironbark (E. fibrosa), white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora), and blackthorn (Bursaria spinosa).

He is noted for his time as British ambassador to Turin between 1852 and 1863, as an italophile and strong supporter of Italian unification, and a collector of Italian art. Early life Hudson was born at Bessingby in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, the eighth son of Harrington Hudson of Bessingby Hall, and his wife Lady Anne Townshend, daughter of George, 1st Marquess Townshend. He was educated at Rugby School (1823‚Äì1825) and at Westminster School (1825‚Äì1826).Death of Sir James Hudson, The Times (London, England), Wednesday, 23 September 1885; p. 9; Issue 31559.

The Burlington Magazine Publications Ltd. Court and diplomatic service Hudson first entered court as a page to George III. In 1830 he became clerk to the Lord Chamberlain and, between 1831 and 1837, usher to Queen Adelaide, consort of William IV. Between 1830 and 1837 he was secretary to Sir Herbert Taylor, the private secretary to William IV. At the accession of Victoria, he, with other officials from the court of William IV, left Windsor Castle. Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston appointed Hudson as secretary to successive British Legations: Washington (1838), The Hague (1845), and to Rio de Janeiro, where, in 1850, he became Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. He was posted to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and in 1852, to Turin. Italy Hudson returned to Italy when appointed by the 1852‚Äì55 UK coalition government to the British Legation at Piedmont, specifically to promote representative democracy. He developed a close relationship with Camillo Cavour, Prime Minister of Piedmont-Sardinia, later the first Prime Minister of a united Italy, and other leading Italian liberals, Giuseppe Massari,\\"Giuseppe Massari\\"; Eleaml.org. 28 July 2006.

Butterworth, London, pp. 212, 213 Hudson's intimate association with Italian patriots was seen as too partisan for a man in his position, however, Malmesbury understood Hudson's reluctance to act in a way that could prevent a war (between France and Austria) that could lead to unification According to Lord Cowley, British Ambassador in Paris, Cavour went further, believing Hudson to be a greater revolutionary than any Italian, had encouraged the Sardinian Government to action, and whose home was the rendezvous for disaffected liberals. The Times commented that although he had acted in accordance with the desires of English people, he had disregarded directions from two successive governments. Hudson was a collector of Italian art. His interest in painting fostered friendships with Massimo d'Azeglio, Prime Minister of Piedmont, and Giovanni Morelli, who were entertained at the British Legation. Hudson's mutual friends, art historian and diplomat Austen Layard and Florence-based English artist William Blundell Spence were visitors, and all could have been longstanding friends, Layard and Spence being at school together in Florence during Hudson's visit in 1829. First mention of Hudson's collection at the Legation was in 1856 by a National Gallery agent, who noted the Portrait of a Young Knight by Moretto da Brescia, seen again during a viewing of all Legation paintings by Sir Charles Eastlake, director of the National Gallery; The Moretto was acquired for the Gallery in 1857.Eastlake, Elizabeth Rigby (1895); Journals & Correspondence of Lady Eastlake, edited C.

The impression he made on the people in the town was such that they built him a school on Green Street. It was dedicated in 1837 with a speech by Ralph Waldo Emerson. For a time there, Fuller had Margaret Fuller for his assistant. He afterward became a bookseller in Providence. In this capacity, he nurtured the local literary scene by publishing The Rhode Island Book (1841), which was edited by Anne Charlotte Lynch. In 1843 associated himself with N. P. Willis and George P. Morris in the publication of the New York Mirror. The three afterward established the Daily Mirror, of which Fuller became sole proprietor, and edited it for 14 years. For the Mirror, Fuller wrote for a series of clever society letters from Newport, under the pen name of ‚ÄúBelle Brittan.‚Äù An attack on Edgar Allan Poe which he republished involved him in a libel action against him by that author; Poe won a $225 award. Under Zachary Taylor's administration, Fuller had a place in the navy department. Fuller went abroad at the beginning of the American Civil War, espoused the Confederate cause, and established the Cosmopolitan newspaper in London. After being twice a bankrupt, he became a journalist in Paris. After the war, he tried unsuccessfully to win back his following in the United States with his 1875 book.

Gilford was also an alternative cancer treatment advocate who wrote under the pseudonym John Cope. Biography Gilford was born at Melton Mowbray on July 2, 1861.\\"Gilford, Hastings (1861 - 1941)\\". Royal College of Surgeons. He qualified M.R.C.S. and L.R.C.P. from Guy's Hospital in 1887. He took the F.R.C.S in 1889. He was clinical assistant at Evelina Hospital for Sick Children and surgeon for the Reading Dispensary. During World War I he was surgeon in charge of the Sutherland War Hospital and Hospital for Pensioners. He was elected Vice-President of the Reading Pathological Society in 1908 and was a member of the British Medical Association. Cancer research Gilford took interest in the aetiology of cancer. He relied on clinical and post-mortem observations in his study of the origin of tumours. Under the pseudonym John Cope, he authored Cancer: Civilization: Degeneration in 1932. Gilford came to the conclusion that cancer is a disease of civilization and rarely found amongst primitive peoples. Gilford suggested that constipation from faulty foods causes cancer as well as irritants such as dentures, furnace heat, glass eyes, sexual perversion and tobacco.Horton, James C. (2000). Inner Hygiene: Constipation and the Pursuit of Health in Modern Society. Oxford University Press. p. 202. He took issue with milk, puddings and many liquids. He promoted a diet of fruit, meats and nuts.Patterson, James T. (1987). The Dread Disease: Cancer and Modern American Culture. Harvard University Press. p. 104. It was negatively reviewed in several medical journals. A review in the American Journal of Cancer concluded \\"This beautifully printed volume only repeats a lot of long since disproved ideas on the subject of cancer. It is not even accurate enough to place in the hands of the layman, for he will only wander among the quotations, anecdotes, and other ornaments which fill the book and look in vain for anything new about cancer.\\" A positive review appeared in the British Journal of Nursing which described it as well-written treatise on cancer with much valuable material. The book proposed some controversial ideas. Historian Robert N. Proctor has described Gilford as a misogynist.Proctor, Robert N. (1996). Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know And Don't Know About Cancer. Basic Books. p. 33. Gilford's last published book on cancer was The Cancer Problem and its Solution, in 1934. It received a mixed review in the Journal of the American Medical Association which disagreed with the thesis but applauded its interesting philosophical speculation. It was positively reviewed in the British Medical Journal. Gilford recommended people to exercise and avoid using cars. According to Gilford \\"the luxurious car brings with it the evils which arise out of inadequate exercise of the muscles... In the end, the man who walks and marries is the gainer.

The design re-imagined Bingham Canyon Mine, the world's largest open pit mine, as a monumental work of land art. The mine's beginnings Sixty million years ago, a gigantic explosion from within the earth blasted through the area's sedimentary layers to the surface. The incoming flow of magma filled the cracks and fissures in the stone and formed into a plug of molten rock. Beginning in 1848, the resultant metallic veins were mined for gold, silver, copper, and molybdenite. Investments in the mine by the Guggenheim family contributed to the early growth of the mine. The town of Bingham, Utah, was eventually swallowed by the expanding man-made chasm, which would come to be known as \\"The Richest Hole on Earth\\" and the largest man-made excavation in the world. The mine was active when Smithson submitted his reclamation design and it remains so today. Bingham Canyon Mine as it appeared in 2005. The Clean Air Act Extension of 1970 and push for remediation In 1970, cultural changes following the civil rights movement and federal policies such as the Clean Air Act Extension led to a growing environmental consciousness in the United States and placed pressure on mining companies to devise methods of controlling the toxic by- products of extraction. At the time of Smithson's unsolicited proposal in 1973, Kennecott Copper Corporation was contemplating different remediation projects in anticipation of federally imposed regulations. The town of Bingham, Utah in 1914. Proposal The proposal to Kennecott Copper Corporation was one of a portfolio that Smithson submitted to mining companies in the early 1970s. He hoped to capitalize on the mining companies' growing receptiveness to reclamation and remediation projects that dealt with waste land in new, innovative ways. Also, the companies possessed the sort of earth- moving equipment necessary for Smithson's increasingly ambitious land art projects since the late 1960s, such as 1970's Spiral Jetty. For the proposal, Smithson submitted a design in the form of a photostat with plastic overlay on which he marked with wax pencil. The mine's massive spiraling cavity was already sympathetic to Smithson's aesthetics and he did not plan to alter it. At the circular bottom of the open pit, the proposal called for four dividing crescent rises. During heavy rains, these would turn into jetties rising from the collected pool of water. Smithson designed the collected pool of water at the bottom as the most striking color element in the pit because it would be bright yellow due to the toxic runoff, or acid rock drainage (also known as yellow boy). Smithson further suggested that the circular base of the pit rotate, invoking a 19th-century cyclorama, so that the visiting pilgrim would be able to observe a 360 degree view of the man-made spiraling canyon while standing in one position. Response from Kennecott Kennecott did not immediately respond to the proposal, and the artist's untimely death on July 20, 1973 effectively brought an end to any potential negotiations between mining corporation and artist. The project, had it been realized, would have been by far the largest of Smithson's land works. The mine today The Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine is on the List of National Historic Landmarks. The mine claims success in ongoing reclamation efforts. It is open to visitors from April to October, weather permitting.

In his new assignment, Hustvedt, with the heavy cruiser as his flagship, also commanded a U.S. Navy task force centered around the battleships and which operated with the Royal Navys Home Fleet from the Home Fleets base at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, cruising along the coast of Norway in the hope of luring the German battleship Tirpitz out into a battle from her base in a Norwegian fjord. Tirpitz did not come out, and the American battleships departed in August 1943 for the Pacific Theater for operations against the Japanese.Morison, Volume X, pp. 229‚Äì230.

When three German aircraft later approached the Allied task force in the North Sea, Rangers combat air patrol immediately shot two of them down.Morison, Volume X, pp. 231‚Äì233.

Hustvedts first major Pacific action was Operation Flintlock, the American invasion of the Marshall Islands in January and February 1944, during which Battleship Division 7 was part of the escort of Task Group 58.3 (Carrier Task Group 3).Morison, Volume VII, pp. 349, 353. During Flintlock, Hustvedt participated in Operation Hailstone, a U.S. Navy combined surface and air attack on the major Japanese base at Truk Atoll on 17‚Äì18 February 1944. Detached from Task Group 50.3, his two battleships served as the center of Task Force 50.9 when it conducted a cruise around Truk under the command of Admiral Raymond A. Spruance on 17 February to intercept Japanese ships fleeing U.S. Navy airstrikes against the atoll. Late in the morning that day, a lone Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero (Allied reporting name \\"Zeke\\") dropped a bomb close aboard Iowa alongside the bridge wing where Hustvedt was eating lunch; his reaction was simply to say \\"That was my bomb\\" and continue eating. His two battleships went on to cripple the Japanese destroyer Maikaze ‚Äì which was finished off by accompanying heavy cruisers ‚Äì and to straddle the Japanese destroyer Nowaki at the extreme range of 34,000 to 39,000 yards (10,363 to 11,887 meters), although Nowaki escaped without damage and managed to fire a torpedo which passed close to New Jersey across her bow.Morison, Volume VII, pp. 326, 328‚Äì329, 353. Hustvedt also commanded Battleship Division 7 during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944.Morison, Volume VIII, p. 415. During the action, his two battleships were among those assigned to Vice Admiral Willis A. Lees Task Group 58.7 (Battle Line), which served as an antiaircraft screen against Japanese aircraft attempting to overfly the battleships on their way to strike at the American aircraft carrier force.Morison, Volume VII, pp. 258, 265‚Äì274. Admiral Spruance, in overall command, canceled his original plan to send the battleships forward in pursuit of the Japanese fleet after the virtual destruction of Japanese air power in the area, so no surface engagement took place.Morison, Volume VII, pp. 305‚Äì309. =Later career= Later in 1944, Hustvedt returned to Washington, D.C., where he became a member of the General Board of the United States Navy on 24 October 1944.The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia: Hustvedt, Olaf M.

Hustvedts career as a battleship officer had been a promising one and he had a good reputation prior to World War II. The rise of the aircraft carrier to dominance in naval warfare during that war left him with little opportunity to demonstrate his capabilities as a combat leader and prevented his possible emergence as a major World War II naval commander.Frank, Richard B., \\"Picking Winners?\\", Naval History, June 2011.

It is a modified version of the shortest fully functional fragment of GHRH, often referred to as growth hormone releasing factor (1-29) (abbreviated as GRF (1-29)), and also known by its standardized name, sermorelin. Origin The first 29 amino acids of GHRH were discovered to be as equally potent as its full 44 amino acid structure This fragment became known as GRF (1-29). However, due to a rapid metabolic clearance analogues of GRF (1-29) were synthesized to enhance the biological activity and reduce the rapidity of metabolic clearance. These analogues were primarily created by substituting amino acids within the peptide structure for amino acids more resistant to enzymatic cleavage. One early analogue substituted the amino acid L-alanine (abbreviated as Ala or A) at the 2nd position of the peptide structure for its optical isomer (mirror image), D-alanine (abbreviated as D-Ala). This substitution resulted in a peptide bond between D-Ala and the 3rd amino acid in the structure aspartic acid (Asp) more able to resist rapid cleavage by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4, a cleavage which had previously led to an inactive peptide fragment. This successful modification prompted the further creation of analogues with additional amino acid substitutions. In 2005, the first specific mention of tetrasubstitued GRF (1-29) appeared in a study that used it as one of the GRF (1-29) analogue peptide structures studied. The term was used to describe the replacement of the 2nd, 8th, 15th, and 27th amino acids in the structure of GRF (1-29). In 2008, a researcher known as DatBtrue created the term modified GRF (1-29) in place of tetrasubstitued GRF (1-29) in his public articles. Continued use of the term on public and private forums has popularized and standardized the nomenclature. Effect Modified GRF (1-29) acts to increase growth hormone production and release by binding to the growth-hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR) on cells in the anterior pituitary. Structure GRF (1-29), also known as sermorelin (Tyr-Ala-Asp-Ala-Ile-Phe-Thr-Asn-Ser-Tyr-Arg-Lys-Val- Leu-Gly-Gln-Leu-Ser-Ala-Arg-Lys-Leu-Leu-Gln-Asp-Ile-Met-Ser-Arg-NH2), the biologically-active portion of the 44 amino acid GHRH.

The two men had studied law together at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. It was not until decades later that John Barthell Faegre and John Benson, who would become namesakes of the firm, joined the practice. John Benson became a partner in 1914, after serving as a clerk. In 1923, George Hoke, Claude Krause and John Barthell Faegre joined the firm, which was renamed Cobb, Wheelwright Hoke & Benson. Following the accidental death of Wheelwright in 1927, the firm became Cobb, Hoke, Benson, Krause & Faegre. Faegre and Benson, who first met in 1909 as opposing players in a college football game, became up-and-coming leaders of the firm. When Hoke and two associates departed in 1938, the firm was reorganized as Faegre, Benson & Krause. On the death of Krause the following year, it became Faegre & Benson in 1940. The firm grew modestly until 1959, when a reorganization of the firm's management structure and new strategic initiatives put the firm on a growth path. That growth was accompanied by changes in the needs of its clients and the evolution of global business. As a result, new practices emerged in areas such as health care, intellectual property and mass tort. Faegre & Benson opened Colorado offices in Boulder and Denver in 1985. In 1990, Faegre & Benson became the first national law firm to establish an office in Des Moines, Iowa. Then, the firm opened an office in London in 1995 and an office in Shanghai in 2001. By the time it announced its merger with Baker & Daniels, it had already become the largest law firm in Minnesota and had been one of the 100 largest law firms in the United States, with well- known clients such as Target, Pfizer, Wells Fargo and 3M. =Baker & Daniels= Baker & Daniels LLP Baker & Daniels was founded as Hendricks & Hord in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1863. Then-U.S. Senator Thomas A. Hendricks, who later served as Governor of Indiana and Vice President of the United States under Grover Cleveland, partnered with Oscar Hord, a former Indiana Attorney General, to create the new firm. The first Baker at the firm was Conrad Baker, who also served as Governor of Indiana. Later, Albert Baker, the son of Conrad Baker, and Edward Daniels, the first Daniels at the firm, joined the practice. After going through several name changes, the firm became known as Baker & Daniels in 1888. After that, Joseph Daniels, the son of Edward Daniels, joined the firm.Gugin, p. 158‚Äì159 Through the years, Baker & Daniels has expanded. In 1976, the firm established an office in Washington, D.C. The Fort Wayne, Indiana, office opened in 1983. In the 1990s, Baker & Daniels continued to expand. The South Bend, Indiana, office opened in 1990, followed by the Elkhart, Indiana, office in 1993. In 1998, the firm‚Äôs first overseas office was opened in China. In 2000, Baker & Daniels opened its 96th Street office in Indianapolis. As part of a long-term growth strategy, Baker & Daniels consolidated its practices in North Central Indiana into a regional model in 2007 by transferring operations in Elkhart to the South Bend office. Then in 2008, the firm opened a new South Bend office. Baker & Daniels expanded its presence in Chicago with the opening of a new law office in 2008. While Baker & Daniels was expanding the reach of its legal practice, it was also extending the scope of its services with various consulting practices, which would eventually become Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting following the combination of the two law firms. Sagamore Associates (also known over time as Gogol & Associates or B&D; Sagamore) was formed in Washington, D.C. in 1985 to assist the firm's clients with federal relations issues. In the 1990s, a second subsidiary company called Capitol Direct (later B&D; Quorum) was formed in D.C. to assist clients through grassroots advocacy, direct marketing and public affairs efforts. At the turn of the millennium, a third consulting practice was added when Baker & Daniels formed Aventor, a global medical technology consulting firm. Each of these three practices were combined in 2006 to create one company, B&D; Consulting. B&D; Consulting expanded its national services to the property tax industry with the addition of the B&D; Equity Property Tax Group in Chicago.

Southworth family Although the generations of the Ewing family beyond Jock and Jason have not been referred to in the series beyond a fleeting reference to their father, Leander, Miss Ellie's family - the Southworths - is somewhat more explored. Enoch Southworth founded Southfork Ranch in 1858. Following Enoch's death in 1901, his sole child, a son Aaron, born in the 1870s, had Southfork Ranch signed over to him and carried on his father's legacy. Aaron and his wife Barbara had two children: son Garrison and daughter Eleanor, who eventually became known as Miss Ellie. Miss Ellie was the sweetheart of Willard \\"Digger\\" Barnes in the first half of the Great Depression. In 1936, Miss Ellie married Jock Ewing, who helped Aaron save Southfork Ranch from bankruptcy. Aaron died in 1959, and Garrison in 1979. Garrison dated and later married Cherie Simmons (in the television movie The Early Years), but it is unknown if the couple had any children. Family tree Ewing Oil Ewing Oil is a fictional oil company from the television series Dallas. Jock Ewing founded Ewing Oil in 1930 and ran it until 1977, when he retired as President. Several years prior to the debut of Dallas, J.R. Ewing had returned home to Southfork after serving in Vietnam and became Vice-President of Ewing Oil. When Jock retired, J.R. became president of Ewing Oil. Bobby Ewing returned to Dallas and joined the executive management team. J.R. resented his presence and wanted him out of the way. Things came to a head at the end of 1978, when Bobby resigned from Ewing Oil and started up Ewing Construction. When Cliff Barnes, the son of Jock's rival Digger Barnes, became Commissioner of the Office of Land Management, he used his position to declare war on the Ewings and Ewing Oil. He halted the new drilling sites of Ewing Oil and began shutting down the oil fields. J.R. quickly had to find a new source of income. J.R. invested $200,000,000 in offshore leases in Asia and remortgaged Southfork Ranch to do this. The wells came in as one of the biggest oil strikes in the world, making the Ewing family even wealthier. However, Jock was so upset over J.R.'s remortgaging of Southfork Ranch that Bobby stepped in to help run Ewing Oil. J.R. had gotten word that problems were escalating in Asia so he decided to sell 75% of the Asian leases to members of the Cartel (a small group of independent oil companies who work together for mutual benefit) - Seth Stone, Jordan Lee, Wade Luce and Andy Bradley - as well as banker Vaughn Leland, all bought shares. The next day there was a political revolt in Asia and the wells were nationalized. The investors lost everything, sending them all near bankruptcy, though J.R. had minimized his losses by selling most of his shares. Seth Stone could not bear to tell his wife Marilee that he had nearly bankrupted her father's company, and killed himself. Jock and Bobby believed that J.R. knew the wells were going to be nationalized, and that the Cartel had been double crossed, but J.R. denied that he knew anything prior to the nationalization. Bobby decided to leave Dallas after Jock supported J.R. shutting down a Ewing field to prevent Cliff Barnes from gaining any profit from the field (Cliff discovered a document that proved his father owned half of the field). One night in the spring of 1980, J.R. was shot at the Ewing offices. Among the suspects were the various Cartel members whom J.R. had swindled, Cliff Barnes, and J.R's wife, Sue Ellen, although it turned out to be Sue Ellen's sister, former Ewing Oil secretary Kristin Shepard, who had done it. While J.R. was in surgery, Bobby was made president of Ewing Oil. Bobby moved very fast and was eager to prove he was smarter and better than J.R. at running Ewing Oil, but encountered numerous obstacles in the business community. Bobby made several business decisions including changing banks and selling Ewing assets to buy a refinery, all while not consulting Jock or J.R. about any deals. Jock and J.R. became very close during this time and Jock regretted that he ever made Bobby president of Ewing Oil. Bobby committed Ewing Oil to a deal with the Cartel, the first business Ewing Oil had done with them since the Asian deal and it was important for the relationship to continue. But unbeknown to Bobby, Jock had taken $12,000,000 out of the Ewing Oil account to go into a business deal with Punk Anderson. Bobby eventually pulled the deal off via a loan but had a terrible fight with Jock and decided to quit Ewing Oil, and later became a state senator. Jock reinstated J.R. as president and his first move was to improve both his and Ewing Oil's public image, so he hired public relations specialist Leslie Stewart. J.R. secretly financed the overthrow of the new government that nationalized the Asian wells and the country's new rulers returned the oil wells to their Texas owners. The Cartel and Jock were thrilled but Cliff Barnes uncovered J.R.'s plot and tried to have him prosecuted but failed. After his wife Sue Ellen left Southfork and moved in with Dusty Farlow at Southern Cross Ranch in San Angelo, J.R. began stock-piling all of the oil that went to Farlow Refineries as a way to force Sue Ellen to come back to him with their son, John Ross. This put a great strain on the Ewing finances as the price of oil dropped and J.R. was stuck with a load of oil he couldn't get rid of. In 1982, Jock was killed in a helicopter crash in South America. Just prior to this, as an interim measure in his absence, Jock gave his family the power to control the company with voting shares which were divided as follows: :Miss Ellie Ewing (30%) :J.R. Ewing (20%) :Bobby Ewing (20%) :John Ross Ewing III (10%) (Ellie voted them if he was living off of Southfork, J.R. if he was living on Southfork) :Gary Ewing (10%) (which he gave to Lucy) :Ray Krebbs (10%) When J.R.'s plan to ruin the Farlows backfired, Miss Ellie stepped in to stop the destruction of Ewing Oil and made a deal with Clayton Farlow. Furious at J.R., she persuaded the family to vote with her to have him fired as president, but changed her mind at the last moment as nobody would be able to take his place at the time. However, when Ellie later learned that J.R. had used Ewing Oil to ruin Cliff Barnes (resulting in his attempted suicide), the family voted unanimously to remove J.R. as president and Bobby took over again. Some months later, Jock Ewing's will was finally read which stated that Ewing Oil would be split 50-50 between J.R. and Bobby and would run half each as a separate company for a period of one year. At the end of the year, the brother with the greatest profit would inherit 51% of the company and the loser would get 19%. The remainder would go to Miss Ellie, Ray and Gary who would inherit 10% each. Bobby's route was to drill in frozen ground in Canada using a new, experimental Tundra Torque drill bit. J.R.'s route was to over-pump oil with a special variance from the OLM (which he obtained through blackmail), refine it and open a chain of cut-price gas stations. The battle for Ewing Oil tore the family apart. Bobby and Pam divorced; and Cliff and Pamela's mother, Rebecca Wentworth, died in a plane crash in an attempt to stop J.R. from winning. In the fall of 1983, J.R. and Bobby decided to call the battle off and divide their shares equally regardless of who won the contest. When it initially appeared that J.R. was the winner, he was about to double-cross Bobby and take control of Ewing Oil, but at the last moment Bobby Ewing won the contest when his Canadian project struck oil. Bobby kept his word and allowed J.R. to have an equal share in the company and the brothers would run the company side by side. Ownership of Ewing Oil was now as follows: :J.R.: 35% :Bobby: 35% :Gary: 10% :Miss Ellie: 10% :Ray: 10% In 1984, Bobby was shot at the office by Katherine Wentworth, Pam's sister who was in love with him. During his recovery, Donna Krebbs stepped into his place, much to the annoyance of J.R. Jamie Ewing, Jock's niece, turned up at Southfork Ranch from Alaska, where she had been working in the oil business. Her father Jason, Jock's brother, had died and Jamie had a document which proved that Ewing Oil was in fact owned by Jock, Digger Barnes and Jason. Jamie married Cliff Barnes and they sided to take the Ewings to court for their rightful shares in Ewing Oil. The case went to court and the Ewings had a fight on their hands to keep control. Jamie's brother, Jack, came to Dallas and went to J.R. and Bobby to reveal that he had proof that Ewing Oil was owned outright by Jock Ewing. But there was a price for this information, Jack wanted 10% of Ewing Oil. The Ewing family agreed and Jack took Ray, Bobby and J.R. to meet a man called Wally Wyndham. He had witnessed the dissolving of the partnership and revealed that the document was with Jock's first wife, Amanda Ewing. The family met with Amanda, retrieved the document and won the battle for control. The company was now owned as follows: :J.R.: 30% :Bobby: 30% :Gary:10% :Miss Ellie:10% :Ray:10% :Jack: 10% By 1986, the price of oil dropped dramatically, the Middle East flooded the market with their oil, sending the price of crude oil down to an all-time low. It was beneficial for WestStar, but disastrous for independents like Ewing Oil. J.R. was forced to shut down many fields, causing a great deal of unemployment. A Ewing employee named Scotfield lost his job and, in his anger, he blew up a well, was later arrested and committed suicide. Mrs Scotfield, his widow, wanted revenge and told Bobby that \\"one day a big fish like Ewing Oil is gonna get eaten up and swallowed whole by a even bigger fish\\". By this time, Jack Ewing's ex-wife April Stevens had arrived in Dallas to claim half of Jack's 10% share of Ewing Oil as per the terms of their divorce settlement. Jack maliciously sold his 10% share to Jamie for $1 so April would only get 50 cents, but after Jamie died without leaving a signed will, her husband Cliff Barnes inherited it, finally giving him a piece of the Ewing's company, much to J.R.'s chagrin. Jack and the Ewings went to court to nullify the sale Jack made to Jamie but were only partly successful as the judge decided that only April's half of Jack's 10% was sold fraudulently but Jack's own half was not and therefore Cliff got to keep 5% of Ewing oil. As April agreed to sell her share back to J.R. and Bobby, the company was now divided as follows: :J.R.: 32.5% :Bobby: 32.5% :Gary:10% :Miss Ellie:10% :Ray:10% :Cliff: 5% The same year, J.R. wanted the price of American crude to rise and he met with mercenary B.D. Calhoun whom he paid to go to the Middle East and start trouble by blowing up oil wells. However, the CIA had Calhoun under surveillance and made this known to J.R. who tried to call the deal off, but Calhoun refused to stop. J.R. informed the CIA as to Calhoun's mission, and the mission failed, with Calhoun's mercenaries dying in the process. Calhoun blamed J.R. and set out to exact revenge. He kidnapped John Ross and threatened to kill him, but Ray shot Calhoun in time. The CIA decided on a cover up to keep their involvement secret. However, Mrs Scotfield's brother worked at the CIA's archives as a clerk. He stumbled upon information revealing J.R.'s involvement with Calhoun, which was a federal crime. Mrs. Scotfield then gave the story to a small town paper which printed it and opened the biggest can of worms J.R. was ever to see. Jeremy Wendell of WestStar wanted Ewing Oil's assets. He made Mrs. Scotfield a rich woman, for which she gave him the evidence he needed to destroy Ewing Oil. The Ewings finally lost Ewing Oil in 1987 when the Justice Department shut the company down after J.R.'s criminal activities were exposed and all of its assets were sold to WestStar Oil. In 1988, Bobby obtained the right to use the Ewing Oil name again. At the same time, J.R. blackmailed Jeremy Wendell and re-acquired the former Ewing Oil assets from WestStar Oil. He and Bobby agreed to merge their holdings, effectively resurrecting Ewing Oil. In 1989, Bobby invited Cliff Barnes to become a partner in Ewing Oil after Cliff sold his own company, Barnes-Wentworth, and Bobby, J.R. and Cliff ran Ewing Oil together. After his new wife April died in 1990, Bobby decided to leave Ewing Oil, as he blamed the oil business for her death. Later J.R. sold his Ewing Oil shares to Cliff Barnes, because he was planning to take over WestStar Oil. J.R.'s plot didn't succeed and he lost control of both Ewing Oil and WestStar on the same day. At the end of the original series in 1991, Cliff Barnes had become sole owner of Ewing Oil. In the 1996 TV movie Dallas: J.R. Returns, Cliff Barnes sold Ewing Oil to Bobby and Sue Ellen. In the 1998 TV movie Dallas: War Of The Ewings, J.R. managed to wrangle his way back into Ewing Oil to become partners with Bobby and Sue Ellen. In the revived Dallas series,(which ignores the two 1990s Dallas TV movies), Ewing Oil has ceased to exist after being absorbed into Barnes Global, a multinational conglomerate owned by Cliff Barnes. However, John Ross Ewing III briefly started an oil company under the name Ewing Oil, but this was not the same company that his grandfather Jock Ewing had founded and that his father J.R. had inherited and worked in. Later, the Ewings would start the company Ewing Energies as a successor to Ewing Oil. Ewing Energies Ewing Energies is a fictional company in the revived Dallas series. The company Ewing Energies was started by John Ross Ewing, Christopher Ewing, Elena Ramos, and Bobby Ewing. John Ross continues the Ewing tradition in the oil industry while Christopher works on new gas hydrates technology. Because of John Ross and Elena's works on new oil drilling technology, the oil pulled from wells would be used to bankroll a new gas hydrates technology developed by Christopher and Elena's collaboration. When John Ross was attacked while in police custody for the suspected murder of Veronica Martinez aka Marta Del Sol, Christopher signed over exclusive South American rights to his technology to John Ross's former business partner, Vicente Cano. Vicente's part of the deal was to provide video tape evidence that would clear John Ross. By doing this, Christopher also prevented Bobby from having to drill on Southfork to protect John Ross from Vicente. It is discovered in the season finale that before his arrest for his hand in the fraudulent Southfork sale, Vicente was about to sell off his South American rights to Cliff Barnes. In Season 2, Ewing Energies has been opened. Elena was given 5% from each board member to even out the board. Sue Ellen had recently given Elena a loan for drilling, but she buckled down on Elena before she could start pumping. This forced Elena out of Ewing Energies and Sue Ellen gladly took her place. Around this same time, Pamela demanded 10% of the company which had to do with the annulment of her and Christopher's marriage. Pamela took 10% of Christopher which dropped Christopher below John Ross, Bobby, and Sue Ellen. Elena teamed up with her brother Drew and drilled the land he bought from Bobby. The two called their company Ramos Oil. Early 2012 Ewing Energies Shares: Bobby Ewing 30% John Ross Ewing 30% Christopher Ewing 30% Elena Ramos 10% Late 2012 Ewing Energies Shares: Bobby Ewing 25% John Ross Ewing 25% Christopher Ewing 25% Elena Ramos 25% Early 2013 Ewing Energies Shares: Bobby Ewing 25% John Ross Ewing 25% Christopher Ewing 15% Sue Ellen Ewing 25% Pamela Rebecca Barnes 10% Ewing Global Ewing Global is a fictional company on the updated version of Dallas. Formerly Barnes Global, it is owned by Cliff Barnes, his daughter Pamela (with husband John Ross Ewing), and his nephew Christopher Ewing. Cliff is currently being represented by his hired proxy Nicolas Trevi√±o (a childhood friend of Elena Ramos). Cliff had built an international conglomerate, Barnes Global, which owned more than 100 subsidiaries in over 50 countries. After the death of J.R. Ewing Cliff conspired with trucking magnate Harris Ryland and Texas governor Sam McConaughey to take down the Ewing family once and for all. Cliff's plan was to sabotage Christopher's technology demonstration on the gas rig, causing the state to levy a billion dollar fine against Ewing Energies. Meanwhile, Governor McConaughy was to seize the Ewings' oil wells via eminent domain, making it impossible to pay the fine. Cliff bought the debt and knowing the Ewings didn't have the money to pay the fine, took control of Ewing Energies. This is how Barnes Global and Ewing Energies \\"merged\\". The Ewings prevailed thanks to J.R.'s final scheme. Sue Ellen got the first report of the gas rig explosion that proved the rig was sabotaged and the governor intentionally hid the report. She blackmailed the governor into ending the eminent domain on the Ewings' oil wells. Emma stole evidence from her father's safe that linked him to working with a Mexican drug cartel and cocaine trafficking. Christopher got proof that his adoptive mother Pamela Barnes Ewing was dead and he inherited 1/3 of Barnes Global. Cliff's daughter Pamela, who married John Ross, convinced him to give her 1/3 of Barnes Global giving the Ewings control of Barnes Global and Ewing Energies again. Cliff was framed for the murder of J.R. Ewing and was imprisoned in a Mexican jail but he did manage to contact Elena Ramos and revealed that years ago her father had bought some oil-rich land but that J.R. had switched land deeds and her father was left with useless land while J.R. made millions originally belonging to her father. Cliff gave Elena his power of attorney over his third of the company, and told her to exact revenge on the Ewings. Elena sought help from Joaquin, a close friend who she grew up with in Mexico. In 1997 he changed his name to Nicolas Trevi√±o. He became a billionaire not long after. Elena directed him to Cliff where Nicolas became his proxy for his 1/3 ownership in Barnes Global now Ewing Global. He showed up in Dallas in the season premiere and stopped the Ewings from selling their consumers division to help pay for the arctic leases. Later, Nicholas made a deal with John Ross to have Ewing Global go public. However doing so made the Ewings lose all control of Ewing Global to Nicholas's Mexican cartel. However, Pamela made a deal to buy it back without anyone else, only to learn that Bobby and Sue Ellen had secured the shares of the company from Carlos Del Sol, cutting both her and John Ross out of the company Ewing Global Shares Early 2012 Ewing Global Shares: Cliff Barnes: 99% Early 2013 Ewing Energies Shares: Cliff Barnes: 33% Pamela Rebecca Barnes: 33% Christopher Ewing: 33% Late 2013 Ewing Energies/Ewing Global Shares: Cliff Barnes: 33% Pamela Rebecca Barnes - John Ross Ewing: 33% Christopher Ewing: 33% Early 2014 Ewing Global Shares: Nicolas Trevino: 33% Christopher Ewing: 33% Pamela Rebecca Ewing/John Ross Ewing: 33% Bobby Ewing: Partner Sue Ellen Ewing: Partner Late 2014 Ewing Global Shares Bobby Ewing: 50% Sue Ellen Ewing: 50% References External links * The Official Dallas website Category:Soap opera families Ewing ","title":"Ewing family (Dallas)"},{"id":"35730666","text":"Walter Kusch (born 31 May 1954 in Hildesheim) is a German former swimmer who competed in the 1972 Summer Olympics and in the 1976 Summer Olympics.

Postacchini was born on 30 December 1786 in Fermo, a hilltop town near the east coast in Italy's marches region. He came from a wealthy, religious family of farm workers. The young Postacchini was sent to a monastery in Fermo where he met a priest who made violins using primitive tools. Postacchini became fascinated with this craft and upon his departure (age of 28), he decided to become a violinmaker. Although he was self-taught, Postacchini produced many fine instruments, all with elegant archings.The Violin Makers of the Marches - Riccardo Gabrielli, 1935 His output was diverse and included not only bowed-string instruments but also guitars and bows. The tonal quality of Postacchini's wood was excellent. During his lifetime, Postacchini received acclaim at exhibitions and fairs. At an exhibition in Fermo in 1869, his work was acknowledged as a unique continuation in direction and style of Antonio Stradivari, which gained him the title \\"Stradivari of the Marches\\".

Born on November 30, 1781, he worked at his creations in the workshop of number 3 of via delle Vergini, making refined instruments both for their esthetical beauty and the characteristics of their sound: soft, round but at the same time potent and selective. Qualities much valued by soloists at his times as well as nowadays.

Like those of Stradivarius, some of Postacchini's techniques and \\"secrets\\", making his works unimitable, are still ignored. We refer in particular to the original elastic varnishes, of beautiful brown-red and gold-yellow colours and still in perfect conditions after 150 year, whose formula has gone with him to the grave.\\" - Carmela Marani, journalist. \\"He learned his first violin making rudiments from an unknown friar and was then destined to priesthood. His ecclesiastic carrier was interrupted by the Napoleonic turmoil. In 1815 he was already \\"an outstanding maker of string instruments\\", in 1824 he signed a violin as his own work nr. 214. At Fermo, in his workshop of via delle Vergini, he made string instruments, guitars, bows and also restored them. His production was characterized by the accurate choice of the woods, the elegance of the curves and the fine varnishes he used, typically gold-yellow or brown- red. This built his reputation as an excellent violin maker when he was still living; his works, much appreciated for their beautiful sound, soon commanded high prices and were traded all over Europe. His late production bears the label \\"Andreas Postacchini Firmanus fecit sub titulo S. Raphaelis Arcang. 18..\\". After his death in Fermo, on February 3, 1862, Postacchini was named \\"the Marche's Stradivari\\". He is nowadays considered as a top class Italian violin maker of the 19th century.- Claudio Gioval√®, journalist. In his late work, Postacchini used \\"generous proportions, very slight gradient, deepish ribs, deep cherry red varnish with a touch of brown impregnating through, elastic and as smooth as foulard. Most skillful modeling with no imperfections to be criticised by the keenest eyes. Players fastidious in tonal matters should welcome these superb violins as an invaluable economy of time when assiduously practicing for rapid fingering clarity.\\" - William Henley External links * https://web.archive.org/web/20120306051929/http://www.concorsopostacchini.it/andreapostacchini_eng.php References *The Violin Makers of the Marches - Riccardo Gabrielli, 1935 *Karel Jalovek - Encyclopedia of Violin Makers, London 1968 *Makers of Central Italy - Florian Leonhard, 2011 * *Jost Thoene - Italian & French Violin Makers Vol. IV Walter Hamma, Meister Italienischer Geigenbaukunst, Wilhelmshaven 1993, Category:1788 births Category:1862 deaths Category:Luthiers Category:Italian musical instrument makers Category:Bowed string instrument makers Category:People from Fermo Category:19th-century Italian musicians ","title":"Andrea Postacchini"},{"id":"35730777","text":"I'll Have Another (foaled April 1, 2009) is a North American Thoroughbred race horse, bred in Kentucky, owned by Canadian businessman J. Paul Reddam and trained by Doug O'Neill. In May 2012, ridden by Mario Gutierrez, he won the first two legs of the Triple Crown by taking the Kentucky Derby with a time of 2:01.83. and the Preakness Stakes in 1:55.94. On the day before the Belmont Stakes, he was scratched due to tendonitis, ending his chances of winning the Triple Crown, and retired from racing. Background I'll Have Another is a chestnut horse sired by the Travers Stakes winner Flower Alley. Flower Alley's sire, Distorted Humor, was also the sire of 2003 Kentucky Derby winner Funny Cide. In September 2010, as a yearling, I'll Have Another was sent to the Keeneland sales where he was bought for $11,000 by Victor M. Davila. Davila, an exercise rider, broke and trained the colt before selling him as a two- year-old to J. Paul Reddam for $35,000 at the Ocala Breeder's sale. According to Reddam, the colt's name is inspired by his reply when his wife asks if he wants more of her fresh-baked cookies: \\"I'll Have Another.\\" Racing career =2011: two-year-old season= After winning on his racecourse debut in July 2011, I'll Have Another finished second to Creative Cause in the Grade II Best Pal Stakes at Del Mar in August. He ran sixth of the ten runners behind Currency Swap in the Grade I Hopeful Stakes on a sloppy track at Saratoga. I'll Have Another (#19) crosses the finish line at the 2012 Kentucky Derby ahead of Bodemeister (far left) =2012: three-year-old season= I'll Have Another began his three-year-old season by winning the Robert B. Lewis Stakes at Santa Anita on February 4, as a 43/1 outsider. In April, he won the Santa Anita Derby, staying on gamely to beat the favorite Creative Cause by a nose. I'll Have Another's lead pony in the Kentucky Derby post parade on May 5, 2012 was the retired gelding Lava Man, whom Doug O'Neill had trained previously. As of Derby Day 2012, Lava Man was the 27th-leading Thoroughbred money earner of all time, having won $5,268,706 in his racing career. Lava Man had also accompanied I'll Have Another to the post for his win in the Santa Anita Derby, the colt's final Kentucky Derby prep. Lava Man led I'll Have Another to the post again at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland on May 19, 2012 for the Preakness Stakes. Triple Crown races In the Kentucky Derby on May 5, I'll Have Another started at odds of 15‚Äì1 in what was considered an unusually strong field. In front of a record crowd of 165,307, I'll Have Another produced a strong finish to catch the front-running Bodemeister in the closing stages and win by one and a half lengths in a final time of 2:01.83 for 1 1/4 miles. He is the first horse in the history of the Kentucky Derby to have won from post position 19. It was the Derby debut for his 25-year-old jockey Mario Gutierrez, who had not previously ridden in any of the Triple Crown races. After the race, Gutierrez described I'll Have Another as \\"an amazing horse\\", and said that \\"from the first time I met him, I knew he was the one\\". In the Preakness Stakes on May 19, I'll Have Another was sent off at odds of 3‚Äì1 with Bodemeister starting favorite at 8‚Äì5. Gutierrez settled the colt in fourth place as Bodemeister set the pace from Creative Cause. On the turn into the straight, I'll Have Another passed Creative Cause to move into second place, and caught Bodemeister in the final strides to win by a neck, finishing the 1 3/16-mile race in a final time of 1:55.94. Injury and retirement I'll Have Another was drawn to run from the eleventh post position of the twelve runners, meaning that he would start on the outside of the field. On the Friday before the Belmont Stakes was to run, trainer Doug O'Neill indicated that the horse was officially out of the race due to a tendon injury, ending his hopes of a Triple Crown. At a news conference, the track veterinarian described the injury as slow-healing, requiring up to three to six months for recovery, and if the horse had raced, the risk of a bowed tendon would be very high. Thus, trainer O'Neill announced that he and Reddam decided to retire the horse from racing. He became the third horse, after Burgoo King in 1932 and Bold Venture in 1936, to be scratched from the Belmont Stakes after having won the first two legs of the Triple Crown. On July 11 the New York Times carried a report on the veterinary records of I'll Have Another, which O'Neill had been required to submit to the New York racing authorities. The records showed that the colt had been suffering from osteoarthritis. Three veterinarians interviewed by The Blood-Horse magazine, stated that the medications used were phenylbutazone, dexamethasone and polyglycan, a glucosamine-based medication, all of which were routine and appropriate. Stud career On June 23, 2012, it was announced that I'll Have Another had been sold with the intent that he would be exported to stand at stud at the Big Red Farm, located in Hokkaido, Japan, for the 2013 breeding season. J. Paul Reddam stated on June 9 that Big Red Farm paid $10 million for I'll Have Another after he received only two offers from American breeding farms:one for $3 million, the other $2.5 million. Reddam thought I'll Have Another stood a better chance of success at stud in Japan, where he would receive higher-quality books of mares than he would have attracted in the U.S. Reddam added that he would like to someday reacquire I'll Have Another, if possible. In 2013, his first season in Japan, I'll Have Another covered 152 mares, about 80 percent of whom became pregnant. He commanded stud fees of 3.2 million yen, or about $31,000. On November 6, 2018, it was announced that I'll Have Another would return to the U.S. for the 2019 breeding season to stand at stud at the Ballena Vista Farm in Ramona, California for a fee of $6,000. Pedigree * I'll Have Another is linebred 4 √ó 4 to Mr. Prospector and Danzig, meaning that both these stallions appear twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

He was Acting Commander of the Dutch Gold Coast in 1836 and 1837. Biography Hendrikus Jacobus Tonneboeijer was born in Kampen, in the province of Overijssel, to Jacob Tonneboeijer, a wine trader, and Aaltje de Zee. Tonneboeijer began his career as clerk at the harbour master's office in Willemsoord, a farmers colony established by the Society of Humanitarianism. For some reason, Tonneboeijer aspired a job at the Dutch Gold Coast already in his late teens; Tonneboeijer's father had sold a house in Kampen to Librecht Jan Temminck, who preceded Tonneboeijer in joining the colonial administration on the Gold Coast, and who could have had inspired him. His application in 1831 was turned down for a lack of vacancies, but when a vacancy did open a year later, the minister of colonies himself approached Tonneboeijer for the job, as a voluntary application of a young man of impeccable behaviour was particularly rare for a place which was notorious for its bad health conditions and below-average pay. Adventurism may well have been a reason for Tonneboeijer to apply for this position, but one must also note that his service excluded him from being drafted in the national army, which in theory was still at war with Belgium. Tonneboeijer was finally appointed to service on the Gold Coast by a royal decree dated 17 January 1833. He was appointed provisional resident on 12 May 1834 and became Acting Commander of the Dutch Gold Coast on 2 December 1836, when his predecessor Christiaan Lans left for the Netherlands. It was during his tenure as Commander that Tonneboeijer made the biggest mistake of his life. Against the advice of many, he assembled an expeditionary force to arrest Ahanta king Badu Bonsu II, whose forces had killed two of Tonneboeijer's envoys. Tonneboeijer's army was ambushed on 28 October 1837 by Badu Bonsu's forces, killing 45 men, including Tonneboeijer. Tonneboeijer died in front of Fort Witsen at Takoradi when he was only 23 years old.

The band members referred their style as \\"Cinematic metal\\" to underline Luca Turilli's passion for the world of cinema and the soundtracks, yet the main influence of his new artistic proposal. In 2011, Rhapsody of Fire announced its friendly split into two Rhapsody bands: Alex Staropoli and Fabio Lione decided to go on as Rhapsody of Fire while Turilli, along with bassist Patrice Guers and session guitarist Dominique Leurquin decided to move on as Luca Turilli's Rhapsody. The band's first line-up also included singer Alessandro Conti and Rhapsody of Fire drummer Alex Holzwarth, who was then a member of both bands. However, in 2012 Holzwarth left due to the impossibility to be fully in both bands, and was replaced by Alex Landenburg. Their first album, Ascending to Infinity, was released in 2012 and is referred to as their own \\"Rhapsody's 11th album\\". Their second and final album, Prometheus, Symphonia Ignis Divinus, was released in 2015. From April 2017 to March 2018, Turilli, Leurquin, Guers, Holzwarth, and former Rhapsody of Fire vocalist Lione toured together for the 20th Anniversary Farewell Tour, playing the music of the original band; in June 2018, Turilli confirmed that the band was inactive, and the following December announced that the 20th Anniversary Farewell Tour lineup now formed a new band, named Turilli / Lione Rhapsody. History On August 16, 2011, Rhapsody of Fire announced the friendly departure of long-time guitarist, songwriter, and founding member Luca Turilli and bassist Patrice Guers. Following his departure, Turilli founded his new Rhapsody band, Luca Turilli's Rhapsody, with Guers, his friend and former Rhapsody of Fire session and live guitarist Dominique Leurquin, an unspecified new lead singer and Rhapsody of Fire drummer Alex Holzwarth who became a member of both bands. On January 30, 2012, the band announced their first album, Ascending to Infinity. On March 30, 2012, the band finally revealed their new singer, Alessandro Conti. In 2012, Holzwarth left the band due to the impossibility to be fully in both bands. Following his departure, the band announced his new drummer, former Annihilator, Axxis and Stratovarius member Alex Landenburg. On May 22, 2012, the first single from the upcoming album Ascending to Infinity, titled \\"Dark Fate of Atlantis\\" was released with a music video. On June 22, 2012, the new album was released. The band then started its \\"Cinematic World Tour\\". On October 8, 2012, the band revealed that Leurquin seriously injured his left hand with a circular saw, almost losing it: \\"After the complicated surgery and everyone around thinking it will be difficult for Dominique to play his beloved instrument once again, the doctors spent some more optimistic words to describe the situation, speaking about a long period of rehabilitation and some major problems eventually related to the thumb only. Therefore it seems there will be again the possibility for Dominique to play a guitar, and maybe sooner than what can be expected.\\" The injury made it impossible for Leurquin to be a part of the band for almost two years; instead of replacing him with another guitarist for the upcoming Ascending to Infinity Tour, Turilli arranged all the songs to add Leurquin's parts on the backing tracks at lower volume. His return was eventually announced on August 9, 2014, with the band's concert at the Made of Metal Festival on August 15 being his first show with the band. On 23 March 2015, Nuclear Blast announced Prometheus: Symphonia Ignis Divinus for release on June 19 in the EU, June 22 in the UK and June 30 in the US. The following year after release, they went on their first world tour in starting in Europe in early 2016. They co-headlined with Primal Fear in North America and South America in support of the album. On September 30, the band announced on the website and Facebook that they would release their new album remixed in Dolby Atmos and on Blu-Ray with two live CDs from performances they had played on their Ascending to Infinity Tour and Prometheus Cinematic World Tour. It was released on December 9, 2016. On June 20, 2018, Turilli had announced on the band's official Facebook page that the band would be going on an indefinite hiatus, due to the other members' commitments to other musical projects, such as vocalist Alessandro Conti who was announced as the new vocalist for Swedish symphonic power metal band Twilight Force earlier that monthTWILIGHT FORCE - reveal new vocalist Alessandro Conti!, nuclearblast.de and drummer Alex Landenburg who was later confirmed as the new drummer for the American power metal band Kamelot on April 10, 2019.

See also: informed consent. The HCCA states that a person has the right to consent to or refuse treatment if they have mental capacity. In order to have capacity, a person must have the \\"ability\\" to understand and appreciate the consequences of the treatment decision. The law says that ‚Äúa person is capable with respect to a treatment, admission to a care facility or a personal assistance service if the person is able to understand the information that is relevant to making a decision about the treatment, admission or personal assistance service, as the case may be, and able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.‚Äù(section 4) Relationship to other Acts The Ontario HCCA is relevant to the Ontario Mental Health Act (MHA) because while the MHA governs detention in a psychiatric facility, the HCCA governs whether or not a person can be treated while in hospital (for example, with anti-psychotic medication that can reduce symptoms of serious mental illness such as schizophrenia). The Ontario HCCA is relevant to the Substitute Decisions Act because a person may be found to lack capacity for personal care, in which case he or she would need a substitute decision maker (SDM) to decide whether to consent to or refuse treatment with psychiatric medication. The law says that ‚Äúa person is incapable of personal care if the person is not able to understand information that is relevant to making a decision concerning his or her own health care, nutrition, shelter, clothing, hygiene or safety, or is not able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.‚Äù (section 45) HCCA and the Right to Refuse Treatment There is a widely reported Supreme Court of Canada case called Starson v. Swayze that dealt with the right of a mentally ill person to refuse treatment, even if it is in their best interests to be treated (for example, with anti- psychotic medication that would reduce delusional thinking). The majority in Starson v. Swayze ultimately decided that Starson did not lack capacity so he could make his own treatment decisions, even if his decision (to refuse anti- psychotic medication that would reduce delusional thinking) was not in his best interests. As a result, he could not be treated with psychiatric medication, even if that meant that his health deteriorated as a result. Critics of the decision in Starson argue that because of mental deterioration, Starson did not have the capacity to make the decision to refuse treatment, and that his right to autonomy needs to be balanced with the right to be well. See also: autonomy as opposed to paternalism or beneficence. Autonomy is a complex concept in bioethics that has many variations. For example, there is the concept of supported autonomy, that is, in order to support the autonomy of the person in the long term it may be necessary to compromise autonomy in the short term.

This little work is a minuscule contribution to the exaltation of the Fatherland.\\" Mara√±√≥n's 1921 Maternidad y feminismo, republished as a second edition in 1951, said, \\"The difference between the sexes is insurmountable. Such difference emerges from the anatomical surface of each man and woman, and it goes to the deepest, darkest roots of life, to the home of the cells.\\" Eugenics in Spain in the late 1930s and through to the 1940s was not based on race, but instead on people's political alignment with the regime. Ricardo Campos said, \\"the racial question during the Franco era is complex.\\" He went on to say, \\"despite the similarities of the Franco regime with the Italian and German fascism and the interest that the eugenics provoked, the strong Catholicism of the regime prevented its defense of the eugenic policies that were practiced in the Nazi Germany.\\" Campos went on to say, \\"it was very difficult to racialize the Spanish population biologically because of the mixture that had been produced historically.\\" Vallejo-N√°gera in his 1937 work, \\"Eugenics of the Hispanicity and Regeneration of the Race\\" defined Hispanicness around spirituality and religion. The goal was the\\"strengthening psychologically\\" of the phenotype. Because Catholicism was opposed to negative eugenics, the only way to fight the degradation was through repression of abortion, euthanasia and contraception. Women in Francoist Spain in the immediate post-war period were viewed as essential towards the rebuilding of the country, with their most important aspect being viewed as their bodies. Francoist Spain believed women should become mothers, reproducing to support the needs of the state. They were to give themselves over to this task in both body and soul. Dr. Luque was quoted in the SF magazine Y in 1938 as saying, \\"In the state, the woman/mother has to be the most important citizen. Those are the words that Hitler said in his fundamental program. Because we know he is totally right, and because we are aware of the importance of getting as many healthy children from healthy mothers as we can for our country at this moment, we have to make this statement come true, not only in words but in action.\\"  State-sanctioned kidnappings  Much of the time, the kidnappings were done to benefit couples who had adopted the Francoist regime and wished to have children. The kidnapping of children eventually became a state policy. The Ministry of Justice adopted the responsibility of \\"collecting\\" the children whose parents who had been assassinated, jailed, or had disappeared, with the goal of indoctrinating them with the new state model. By 1943, 12,043 Republican children were in state custody. = Prisons = Republican mothers and their children faced repression both inside and outside jail. There are numerous oral testimonies from women recounting many types of humiliation. The living conditions in jails were grievous: the massive number of arrests made prisoners live in extreme overcrowding. Food was scarce, as was hygiene. Many children who entered jail with their mothers died there. Those who survived were separated from their mothers and, in many cases, given up for illegal adoptions, as the law stated that children could not remain in jail with their mothers after the age of three years. Other children ended up in convents, forced to convert to Catholicism. A law passed on 30 March 1940 meant Republican women could keep their children with them in prison until the child turned three years old. Then, children were then put into state care to prevent the contagion of Republican thinking from spreading. The number of children removed from Republican mothers between 1944 and 1954 was 30,960. The children were not allowed to remain in contact with their families, and many found themselves in centers run by Auxilio Social. When mothers were released from prisons, they were often watched to make sure that they were good mothers as defined by the state. Actively watched, many women lost custody of new children they had. Caser√≥n de la Goleta, the women's prison in M√°laga, had horrible conditions for women prisoners. Women were packed into tiny, unhygienic cubicles where conditions were so bad that they facilitated the spread of disease. Food often consisted of fruit peels or edible waste. A third of the prisoners by the end of 1939 were there on charges of committing faults against the regime. Many of the remaining were there as retaliation for relatives having disappeared or fled into exile. Guards and visiting church and regime officials would often sexually assault female prisoners. Pregnant women would be forced to give birth in unsanitary prison conditions, and infant mortality was a problem, with many infants dying. Mar√≠a Topete Fern√°ndez was part of prison leadership at the Prison for Nursing Mothers in Madrid. Held up as a model for being the first of its kind in Europe, the prison had problems with infant mortality. While the Law of Maternal and Infant Health in June 1941 reduced infant deaths by a small amount, imprisoned Republican women would not see improved rates until 1943, and significant improvement until 1952, when the prison's rationing system was abandoned. The punishment of being a female relative of a \\"red\\" male was resurrected between 1945 and 1947, when there was a surge in guerrilla activity. That resulted in a large number of rural women swelling the ranks of Spanish prisons, including in women's prisons in Madrid, C√≥rdoba, M√°laga and Segovia. They had received sentences of 20 to 30 years merely for feeding \\"red\\" male relatives. Age did not matter, as girls as young as nine were sent to prison, where they would be physically assaulted by guards. Children of prisoners were taught in Catholic schools, as part of efforts to indoctrinate them in regime ideology, that their parents were in prison because they were traitors to the state. = Nuestra Se√±ora de La Almudena = Single pregnant teenaged girls were particularly vulnerable in the Francoist period, with the state assuming guardianship of them and their children at the Pe√±a Grande maternity prison, officially known as Nuestra Se√±ora de La Almudena, until the girls turned 25 years old. Girls found themselves there as a result of being taken in by the police or relatives dropping them off at the facility A special wing existed for some women who voluntarily checked in and had the money to afford to hide their pregnancies. In some cases, the state would line the pregnant women in a row, bring in men who had paid a fee and allow them to chose among the woman for one to marry or work in his home; the women would never know before the purpose. The men would sometimes also return the women they had selected, indicating they were not happy with their choice and then pick out a new woman. It was primarily from the Pe√±a Grande maternity prison that children part of the stolen babies scandal were taken, with women continuing to be imprisoned there until 1984. The conditions at the state supported facility were so bad that girls would commit suicide by jumping off the top floor stairwell. Mar√≠a √Ångeles Mart√≠nez was one woman kept at the Pe√±a Grande facility while she was pregnant. She said about her experience, \\"I entered as a 19-year-old, in August of 1975. I was an orphan and I had just gotten pregnant, so my sister-in-law, who wanted to get rid of me, told me 'get dressed we're going', and without knowing where she was going, she brought me here.\\" She described the nuns: \\"They told me what I was going to do with a daughter, how I was going to feed her, if they had thrown me out of the house, if I was a wretch, and she was going to be one too.\\" She described the process of giving birth, \\"I was in the dilatation room, and with half a head already out and they told me that I had to walk alone to the operating room and get on the gurney. I went with all the care, but she was born with a deformed skull. When they saw it, they stopped insisting I give her to them. I think that's why I did not lose my daughter.\\" = Repatriation of children = During the war, many parents sent their children to foreign countries, including Britain, France, Russia, out of concern. Franco, after winning the war, declared that those children needed to return to Spain, with or without parental permission. The regime turned the repatriation of the minors into a large propaganda operation. A 1940 law stated that the legal authority of children in facilities belonging to the human rights' group Auxilio Social (\\"Social Aid\\") would automatically be transferred to the state. That created a risk that parents would forever lose their children if they sent them to foreign countries.  Later years  Victims' groups have stated that the baby kidnappings developed into a business that continued into the 1980s. In January 2011, the families of 261 babies who disappeared in hospitals over a duration of fifty years put forward their case to the attorney general in Madrid. This started when two brothers were told by their foster father that he had bought them from a priest; the pair then went to the media and the story spread, making others come forward. Evidence consisted of nurses and people who admitted illegally adopting babies, with hospital staff, nuns and priests being suspected of being part of an organised network. People underwent DNA tests in the hope of reuniting their families but there were few matches. Many graves of dead infants were dug up for DNA-testing but some contained no remains while others contained those of an adult. According to lawyers involved in some cases, the number of abducted children is estimated to be up to 300,000. The Spanish Catholic Church had an important role in hospitals and social services because of Franco. The purpose of these abductions changed from ideological reasons to targeting parents, who the network considered \\"morally- or economically- deficient\\" and in some cases, they charged money. Parents were mostly told that their children had died and since the hospitals took care of the burials, they never saw the bodies. In many cases, the records were missing, either accidentally or because they were destroyed. In one case, an 89-year-old woman confirmed that a priest and a doctor encouraged her to fake a pregnancy so she could receive a child due to be born at another clinic in 1969. Another involved undertakers in M√°laga, who said that in some occasions, they buried empty coffins of children which had arrived from a local hospital. The Spanish law, where the identity of an infant's mother was not be revealed to protect the anonymity of those who were unmarried, is alleged to have facilitated these kidnappings. The 1977 Amnesty Law passed two years after Franco's death has never been repealed, rejected by the judiciary and opposed by politicians. This hindered the investigation of these traffickings as a national crime against humanity.  Legal and moral reparations  Jurist Baltasar Garz√≥n, who believed that the crimes committed constituted crimes against humanity, urged the attorney general and judges investigating the case to sanction those at fault and to pay reparations to victims in such a way that they could regain their lost identities. Garz√≥n included in his cited statistics, based on historical sources, that more than 30,000 Republican children had been under the \\"tutelage\\" of the Francoist regime between 1944 and 1954. He also specified that these children were kidnapped or forcefully repatriated by the Falange, and that children's names were changed so that they could be given to families in favor of the Francoist regime. They never returned to their original families, and Garz√≥n considers these children part of the Francoist victims. In 2006, the Council of Europe was the first international organization to recognize Republican children whose last names had been changed.

Biography =Early life= Aladar Imre was born in 1898 in Bucharest to Janos Imre, an ethnic Hungarian lumberjack, and Maria Boer, of Romanian origins. The family had earlier left the Austro-Hungarian ruled Transylvania and moved to Romania in order to escape political persecution, the father dying when Aladar was six years old. After completing six grades, he began working as an apprentice in a carpentry workshop. It was here that Imre became interested in the study circle of the apprentices and the carpenters' trade union. Around 1911-1912, he participated in the political courses offered by the Bucharest socialist club, where militants such as I. C. Frimu, Christian Rakovsky, Dumitru Marinescu and Mihail Gh. Bujor provided guidance for the young workers. According to the commission that invalidated his Parliament seat in 1931, in 1916 Imre was drafted in the 24th Regiment of the Royal Hungarian Army. =Union leadership= In 1919 Imre joined the Circle of the Socialist Youth, the youth wing of the Socialist Party of Romania, participating in the major Bucharest strikes organised by the party in 1920. Around this period, he was also elected a member in the leadership of the carpenters' trade union. Joining the newly established Communist Party of Romania (PCdR) in 1922, Imre became responsible for the party's relations with the labour movement. In 1923 he was designated regional secretary of the Union of the Wood Workers of Romania, as well as secretary of the Bucharest Local Commission of the Trade Unions. As a representative of the trade unions in the timber industry, he participated along Constantin IvƒÉnu≈ü and Coloman M√ºller in the collective bargaining with the General Union of the Industrialists of Romania (UGIR). Several important gains were obtained, such as the signing of collective agreements in a large part of the Romanian industrial enterprises and the recognition of the trade unions, including the communist-influenced Unitary Trade Unions. In late 1923, after the September Cluj Congress resulted in a major split in the labour movement, Imre managed to retain the unity of the Union of the trade unions in the timber industry and its affiliation to the General Council of the Unitary Trade Unions (CGSU), also militating for unity √Æn the workers' movement. In the same year, as secretary of the union, he organised a 30-day-long strike of the timber industry workers in 28 enterprises and 80 carpentry workshops in Cluj, managing to achieve the acceptance of most of the workers' demands. In 1924 Imre was arrested for political agitation, and, although the Siguran≈£a could not confirm his lack of Romanian citizenship, the Romanian authorities decided to expel him to Hungary. The Hungarian authorities denied him entry, stating he did not have Hungarian citizenship; nevertheless the Romanian authorities forced him past the border post. After spending several hours in no man's land, he clandestinely returned to Romania. Three more attempts to expel him were made in 1924 and 1925, all having similar outcomes. In spite of persecution, he was still able to keep in contact with the labour movement. Thus, in late 1924 and 1925 he succeeded in bringing into the CGSU several trade unions from Gala≈£i and Piatra Neam≈£. In August 1926 he was again arrested after organising a strike among the workers of the Army's Pyrotechnics Factory in Bucharest, and in 1927 he was brought before the War Council of the Second Army Corps for leading a strike of the typographers. Accused of activities against public order, his trial was postponed several times before he was acquitted due to lack of evidence. Arrested again in March 1928, Aladar Imre was a defendant in the Cluj trial, being again acquitted. =Communist Party politics= By 1928, persecution from the Romanian authorities, coupled with differences among the leadership, threw the PCdR into disarray, with most of its militants under arrest in Romania or in self- imposed exile. The Third International (Comintern) sought to reorganise the party, and convened a congress, the 4th in the party's history, near Harkov. Hastily organised by the Communist Party of Ukraine, with almost the total exclusion of the Romanian leadership, the congress fully adopted the points of view of the Comintern. Aladar Imre was included the praesidium, and requested representatives of both the party's Central Committee (based in Romania) and the exiled political bureau be given deliberative vote. Nevertheless, he rejected the inclusion of any of the members of the former leadership in the newly established Central Committee. Imre headed the congress' commission on the labour movement, also preparing its resolution, and was elected in the party's Central Committee. During his stay in the Soviet Union, along with Vitali Holostenco, Elek K√∂bl√∂s and Ion Heigel, he represented the party at the 6th World Congress of the Comintern in Moscow. Back in Romania, he was designated secretary of the CGSU in late 1928, and in this position he was part of a committee, which also included Dumitru Grofu, Iancu Olteanu and Coloman M√ºller, that organised a unionisation campaign among Romania's workers. The campaign was regarded as a success, as the number of workers affiliated with the CGSU grew from fifteen thousand to thirty thousand between November 1928 and February 1929. Beginning with April 1928, Imre was also the editor in chief of the short-lived bilingual Romanian-Hungarian newspaper Ferarul (Vasmunk√°s), the organ of the Unitary trade union of the workers in the chemical, metalworking and petroleum industry. In recognition of his organisational merits, the April 1929 General Congress of the CGSU held in Timi»ôoara elected him secretary. Imre was arrested days after the Congress along several other union leaders, including Grofu, M√ºller and Vasile Luca, being eventually amnestied in 1930. As a result of increased factional struggle, Aladar Imre was excluded from the Central Committee of the PCdR during the October 1929 conference. =Election to the Parliament= Aladar Imre (first from right) and the other deputies of the Workers and Peasants' Bloc elected in the 1931 Romanian parliamentary elections As the Communist Party, outlawed by the Romanian government in 1924, sought to continue participating in the country's political life, a legal front organisation was set up, the Workers' and Peasants' Bloc (BM≈¢), in order to contest the elections. Aladar Imre joined the leadership of the Bloc in 1926, and participated on the party's list in the local elections. In the 1931 legislative elections, Aladar Imre contested for a seat in the lower chamber of the Romanian Parliament, and succeeded in being elected in the Bihor and Satu Mare constituencies. As Lucre≈£iu PƒÉtrƒÉ≈ücanu, Eugen Rozvan and another two members of BM≈¢ also won the popular vote, the party entered the Parliament. The election of communist deputies provoked outrage in the right-wing press, with nationalist newspaper Curentul leading a press campaign for their ousting, no matter the means. At the request of the government, a Parliament commission invalidated two of the mandates, including Imre's. As a result, the results of the Bloc were lowered below the electoral threshold, thus invalidating all the seats won. The arguments for Imre's invalidation were his supposed lack of Romanian citizenship, and a previous political conviction, amnestied in 1930. Some members of the commission, including Dr. N. Lupu, disagreed with the conclusions, and left the commission in protests. Imre also disputed the arguments of the commission, ascertaining that, by drafting him for one month in the Romanian Army in 1927, the authorities had virtually recognised his citizenship. The left-aligned press, including AdevƒÉrul, condemned the invalidation as a government abuse. Nicolae Iorga, who at the time was serving as prime-minister, later acknowledged that the invalidation of the communist seats was based on a technicality. =Later life= The Romanian Council of Ministers decided on August 29, 1931, to expel Imre, and he chose to leave for the Soviet Union. Participating in the Fifth Congress of the PCdR that took place near Moscow that year, he joined David Avramescu in criticising the gathering's lack of representativeness, only to be rebuffed by Bela Kun. At the same Congress, as CGSU delegate, he presented a report on the Romanian trade unions. Around 1935 he was living in Tiraspol, where he published pamphlets attacking the Romanian electoral system of the time. Imre was executed during the Great Purges. He was part of the group of Romanian victims of the purges posthumously rehabilitated in 1968 by a commission of the Romanian Communist Party.

The charges stemmed from incidents that occurred on September 19 and 21, 2010. On September 9, 2016, a New Jersey court of appeals overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial on narrower charges. The following month, Ravi accepted a plea deal and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy. In the first incident, Ravi and his friend Molly Wei used a webcam to view a private romantic encounter between Ravi's roommate, Tyler Clementi, and another man identified only as \\"M.B.\\" In the second incident, Ravi urged friends and Twitter followers to watch via his webcam a second private encounter between Clementi and M.B., though the viewing never occurred. Clementi committed suicide on September 22, 2010, and his death brought national and international attention to Ravi's trial. On May 21, 2012, Ravi was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 3 years' probation, 300 hours of community service, a $10,000 fine, and counseling on cyberbullying and alternate lifestyles. Ravi served 20 days of his 30-day jail term from May 31 to June 19, 2012 at the Middlesex County Adult Corrections Center in North Brunswick, New Jersey. Events leading up to the indictments and trial =First webcam incident= Before September 17, 2010, Clementi had chatted online with a man whose identity has not been made public. While Ravi was out for the evening on September 17, the man came to Clementi's dorm room for the first time. On the nights of September 19 and 21, Clementi texted with Ravi about using their room for the evening. On the first occasion, Ravi met Clementi's male friend, and Clementi said that the two wanted to be alone for the evening. In conversations with Wei and later text messages with friends, Ravi expressed distrust of the stranger that Clementi brought into the room, describing him as \\"an older, shabbier-looking guy\\". Ravi said he was worried about theft and that he left the computer in a state where he could view the webcam due to those concerns. However, other witnesses testified that Ravi said he also wanted to confirm that Clementi was gay. Ravi and Wei viewed the video stream via iChat for a few seconds, seeing Clementi and his guest kissing. Ravi posted to his 150 Twitter followers, \\"Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.\\" Soon after, Wei began an online chat in which she said that the two men had been \\"kissing [each other] right now / like THEY WERE GROPING EACH OTHER.\\" Later, Wei turned on the camera for another view with four others in the room, though Ravi was not there. During this second viewing, Wei and others saw Clementi and his guest kissing with their shirts off and their pants on. Clementi followed Ravi on Twitter. Although Clementi could not see Ravi's phone text messages, he saw his Twitter postings the next day. Clementi viewed Ravi's Twitter posts 38 times following the first webcam viewing. Late on September 20, Clementi wrote to a friend online that, initially, he was not really bothered by what Ravi had seen in the first, brief viewing, primarily due to its extreme brevity. According to a Rutgers employee, at about 4 a.m. on September 21, after further conversations online, Clementi sent an online request for a single room because his \\"roommate used webcam to spy on me.\\" =Second planned webcam viewing= On September 21, Ravi sent a friend a series of text messages, including messages saying, \\"Yeah, keep the gays away\\" and \\"People are having a viewing party with a bottle of Bacardi and beer in this kid's room for my roommate\\" along with directions on how to view it remotely. At 6:39 p.m., Ravi tweeted, \\"Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again.\\" Ravi had set up the webcam and initially pointed it towards Clementi's bed. Ravi has stated that he realized that his \\"joke\\" was \\"stupid\\", and pointed the webcam towards his own bed before the planned viewing on September 21. The police say, however, that it was subsequently found still pointed directly at Clementi's bed. When Ravi's friend suggested that Clementi and his guest might use his bed, Ravi said \\"My webcam checks my bed, hahaha.\\" At trial, two Rutgers students testified that Ravi had spent part of that early evening in their dorm rooms, and used their computers to verify that the webcam was still focused on the bed. The captain of Ravi's Ultimate Frisbee team testified that, after practice that evening, Ravi \\"told me he had set up a webcam of some sort to capture images of his roommate. He told me he had done it before that date\\" and \\"that he was planning on doing it again. That night.\\" When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode. On September 21, Clementi complained to a resident assistant and two other officials that Ravi had used a webcam to videostream part of Clementi's private sexual encounter with another man. The resident assistant testified at trial that Clementi appeared shaky and uncomfortable when they met around 11 p.m., and in his official report of the meeting, the resident assistant said that Clementi requested both a room change and punishment for Ravi. In a formal e-mail request to the resident assistant made after the meeting, Clementi described the two viewing incidents, quoted from Ravi's Twitter postings, and wrote \\"I feel that my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner.\\" Clementi wrote in detail on the Just Us Boys and Yahoo! message boards about complaints he filed through university channels about his roommate. His posts indicated that he did not want to share a room with Ravi after he learned about the first incident and then discovered that Ravi invited his Twitter followers to watch a second sexual encounter. \\"He [the resident assistant] seemed to take it seriously,\\" Clementi wrote in a post about 15 hours before his jump from the George Washington Bridge. On September 22, a friend of Ravi asked what had happened to the live stream the night before. Ravi responded, \\"It got messed up and didn't work.\\" In the afternoon, the resident assistant confronted Ravi about Clementi's written complaint, in which he requested a room change. Within a few hours, Clementi returned to his dorm room and he and Ravi were there for less than an hour. Clementi suicide and Ravi's apologies On the evening of September 22, the day after Ravi's second webcam transmission attempt, Clementi left the dorm room, got food, and, around 6:30 p.m., headed toward the George Washington Bridge. By 8:42 p.m., Clementi had made his way to the George Washington Bridge and posted from his cell phone on Facebook, \\"Jumping off the gw bridge sorry.\\" Five minutes after Clementi posted on Facebook, Ravi sent the first of two final messages to Clementi. The messages were sent after Ravi had been visited that afternoon by the resident assistant and told of Clementi's complaint: > \\"I want to explain what happened. Sunday night when you requested to have > someone over I didn't realize you wanted the room in private. I went to > Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access > it from anywhere. I turned on my camera and saw you in the corner of the > screen and I immediately closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what > happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me > advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again I wanted to make sure > what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 > to 12. Just in case, I turned my camera away and put my computer to sleep so > even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday > night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I > assure you all my actions were good natured.\\" The prosecution noted that the apology came after Ravi learned he faced discipline by Rutgers. Prosecutor Julia McClure said that the apology was one of \\"many attempts\\" by Ravi to \\"dilute, cover up and explain, in other words to tamper with the facts and to fabricate evidence that could be looked on as favorable to him.\\" Ten minutes later, Ravi texted again: Indictments On September 28, 2010, Dharun Ravi and Molly Wei were charged with four and two counts of invasion of privacy, respectively, for their roles in the webcam spying incidents on September 19, 2010 and September 21, 2010. Under New Jersey law, one commits a fourth-degree crime of invasion of privacy if one observes another person without that person's consent under circumstances in which a \\"reasonable person would know that another may expose intimate parts or may engage in sexual penetration or sexual contact.\\" A third-degree crime is committed if one discloses a \\"reproduction of the image\\" of the observed person. Ravi was charged with both third- and fourth-degree invasion of privacy. Soon after these charges were filed, there were calls from gay rights advocates and bloggers to include hate crimes charges against Ravi and Wei. Bruce Kaplan, the prosecutor in the case, said \\"now that two individuals have been charged with invasion of privacy, we will be making every effort to assess whether bias played a role in the incident, and, if so, we will bring appropriate charges.\\" On October 4, 2010, Kaplan stated that he did not think there would be enough evidence to charge Ravi and Wei with a hate crime. After further investigation, the prosecution concluded that there was evidence supporting a hate crime charge against Ravi, dating to when Ravi first learned Clementi's name. On April 20, 2011, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts, including bias intimidation, invasion of privacy, witness tampering, and evidence tampering. The witness tampering charges were based on text messages Ravi sent to Wei, in which he tried to persuade her not to contradict what he had told police. In these messages, Ravi said \\"Did you tell them we did it on purpose?\\", and \\"Because I said we were just messing around with the camera.\\" Wei responded \\"Omg dharun why didnt u talk to me first i told them everything\\". According to a prosecution expert witness, Ravi deleted almost 100 text messages between him and Wei and another high school friend, whom he had invited to view Clementi's second encounter with his guest. A key aspect of the prosecution's evidence tampering charge was Ravi's deletion of two potentially incriminating postings: one on Twitter on September 19 in which he wrote that his roommate was \\"making out with a dude. Yay\\", and one on September 21 in which he told his iChat followers \\"dare you to video chat me\\" during the time of Clementi's tryst. He replaced the latter post with one that said \\"don't you dare video chat me\\" at the time of the tryst, stating that the first message was a draft. Ravi was charged with third and fourth degree invasion of privacy. =Public statements by defense= Soon after the charges against Wei were made public, Wei's attorneys released a statement proclaiming her innocence, and a former New Jersey federal prosecutor commented that, \\"there's no evidence of Ms. Wei doing anything. I'm very curious as to why the prosecutor is holding her responsible in any way, shape, or form simply because Mr. Ravi was using her computer.\\" Steve Altman, Ravi's attorney, said, \\"Nothing was transmitted beyond one computer and what was seen was only viewed for a matter of seconds.\\" Rubin Sinins, Wei's attorney, said, \\"I'm unaware of any evidence of sexual contact. The statute defining sexual contact refers to nudity and private parts, and, to my knowledge, nothing like that was seen. I'm also unaware of any evidence that any video was recorded, reproduced or disseminated in any way.\\" =Pleas= Wei and the prosecutor reached a plea agreement on May 6, 2011. Under the agreement, all charges against Wei would be dropped if Wei testified against Ravi and completed a three-year intervention program, including counseling and community service. Clementi's parents \\"supported leniency for Wei\\", believing that her \\"actions, although unlawful, were substantially different in their nature and their extent than the actions of Tyler's former roommate\\" and that she \\"was forthcoming and cooperative during the investigation.\\" In December 2011, Ravi rejected a plea agreement in which he would not spend any time in jail and through which the prosecutor's office would assist him in fighting any potential deportation orders. Ravi is a citizen of India living legally in the United States. In rejecting the plea arrangement, Ravi's lawyer stated: \\"Simple answer, simple principle ... He's innocent. He's not guilty. That's why he rejected the plea.\\" Trial arguments and testimony Ravi was represented during the trial by attorneys Steven Altman and Philip Nettl of the New Jersey criminal defense law firm Benedict & Altman. The trial lasted 13 days with closing arguments ending on March 13, 2012. = Pretrial motion = In August 2011, Ravi's defense attorney requested a mistrial because the prosecution had not presented evidence to the grand jury which, he argued, would have cleared Ravi, and had presented other evidence in what he said was a misleading manner. This evidence included documents that showed that Clementi had titled files on his computer \\"Why does it have to be so painful\\" and took photographs of the George Washington Bridge a month before entering Rutgers. The judge did not grant Ravi's motion. Ravi was not charged with a role in the suicide. = Opening arguments = On February 24, 2012, Assistant Prosecutor Julia McClure told jurors that Dharun Ravi acted to \\"deprive\\" Tyler Clementi of his \\"privacy\\" and \\"dignity\\" when he observed an intimate encounter of Clementi and later invited others to watch a second liaison of Clementi and his friend. Ravi's actions were not, she emphasized, a \\"prank\\", \\"accident\\", or \\"mistake\\", but rather were \\"intentional\\", \\"planned\\", \\"criminal\\", and \\"mean-spirited\\". She said Ravi was motivated by the fact that Clementi was homosexual: \\"he sought to brand Tyler as different from everybody else\\" and \\"to set him up for contempt.\\" Later, she explained, Ravi tried to \\"cover up the tracks\\" of his actions by altering evidence. Defense attorney Steven Altman said that Ravi's actions were those of an \\"18-year-old boy\\". He argued that although these actions may have been \\"immature\\" and \\"stupid\\", they were not hateful, bigoted, or criminal. \\"There was no bullying,\\" Altman emphasized. Ravi never \\"harassed\\", \\"ridiculed\\", or even said \\"anything bad\\" about his roommate. Moreover, Altman said that Ravi saw only a few seconds of hugging and that nobody \\"transmitted\\" or \\"reproduced any image of anything\\". = September 19 viewing: Testimony of Rutgers students = Wei testified that, shortly after 9 p.m. on September 19, 2010, Dharun Ravi came to Wei's room and within a few minutes he showed her how he could get live images from his room via an auto- accept feature of his computer's video chat. Wei said that both she and Ravi were \\"shocked\\" when they saw Clementi and another man leaning against the bed kissing. Wei said that she and Ravi viewed for only a few seconds, turned off the video stream, and initially agreed not to tell anyone, because it \\"just felt weird\\" and she felt it was wrong. Several minutes later she chatted about the incident online. Ravi later left the room to shower and Wei, within an hour of the initial viewing, accessed Ravi's webcam again, at the request of a friend, and briefly showed four other students. Wei said the scene was the same as that before, except that the men's shirts were off. According to one student, the two men were turned so one could not see their faces. Wei and other students testified that Ravi had told them that he was concerned about his possessions. Two of these students testified that Ravi also said he wanted to confirm that his roommate was gay. Several students described Clementi's guest as \\"shabby\\" or \\"shady\\". The prosecution argued that only Ravi and one other student had seen Clementi's guest in person and that the other student said the guest was not \\"anything out of the ordinary\\" and, while older, was \\"not obscenely old\\". None of the students said that Ravi had expressed any animosity towards gays. One student said that Ravi had called Clementi \\"nice\\", and another said that Ravi had told him he had a gay friend. Wei said that Ravi mentioned that Clementi was gay, but \\"didn't make a big deal out of it\\". = Testimony of M.B. = On March 2, 2012, Tyler Clementi's guest, M.B., testified for more than five hours. To protect his privacy as a possible crime victim, the judge ordered that media could show only his hands and could not record him‚Äîcourtroom restrictions that were a \\"rare exception\\" according to The New York Times account. M.B.'s testimony was important, not only because he himself was an alleged victim, but because the defense had portrayed him as a suspicious character that prompted Ravi's actions. According to former prosecutor John Fahy, it was also important for the prosecution to establish that sexual activity had occurred, and M.B. had to answer specific questions about the nature of that activity. Kate Zernike of The New York Times described M.B. as having \\"close-cropped hair\\", not dressed as casually as on September 19, 2010, but his \\"hair and bearing much the same\\" as in the Rutgers dormitory surveillance camera photo. She wrote that \\"he did not look, as Mr. Ravi's friends have described him, 'scruffy' or 'shady'.\\" However, M.B. testified that he had not shaved the evening of the encounter. According to M.B.'s testimony, he and Clementi met on a social network site and the September 19 meeting was the second of three dates. M.B. said his relationship with Clementi was a \\"good relationship\\", which included continual texting and online chats, and that Clementi was \\"happy\\" when he last saw him. M.B. said that during the September 19 visit he noticed a webcam pointed at Clementi's bed and thought the position \\"was kind of strange\\", although he did not think that anyone was actually watching. In cross-examination, he noted he remembered this only when it later became relevant. M.B. also said that when he lay in Clementi's bed, he heard people joking and laughing in the courtyard, and it \\"seemed like the jokes were at somebody else's expense\\". When he left the room, there were about five students who \\"seemed to be looking at me and it seemed kind of unsettling\\". = September 21: Timeline of Ravi's communications and events = Ravi's communications, both in person and in texts and tweets, were key evidence in regard to the September 21 incident. The prosecution contended that on September 21 Ravi set up his webcam to view a second tryst of Clementi's and advertised it to friends and Twitter followers. The viewing was thwarted, they argued, only because Clementi unplugged the computer. Ravi said that his messages were made in a joking manner and that he later turned off the webcam so that no viewing would occur. Tyler Clementi followed Ravi's Twitter messages, visiting Ravi's Twitter page 38 times on the two days before his suicide. Clementi saved two of the messages. On September 20 Clementi saw the first message, which Ravi had made a few minutes after the September 19 viewing, and Clementi discussed it with friends. Ravi wrote: \\"Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into Molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.\\" The second saved message was sent by Ravi on September 21 (6:39 p.m.), after Clementi late that afternoon requested private use of the room for another tryst: \\"Anyone with i-chat, I dare you to video chat me between 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again.\\" On the afternoon of September 21, Ravi texted his friend Michelle Huang. Ravi said that Clementi's guest \\"was older and creepy and def from the internet\\". He said he had not seen the guest since September 19, but \\"My webcam checks my bed hahaha. I got so creeped out after Sunday.\\" He then added, \\"Yeah keep the gays away.\\" Shortly after Ravi sent his \\"dare you\\" tweet at 6:39 p.m., Ravi urged Huang to later watch the videostream: \\"Do it for real! I have it pointed at his bed. And the monitor is off so he can't see you. Be careful it could get nasty.\\" At 8:41, in another text conversation, Ravi told Huang that \\"people are having a viewing party\\" with rum and beer. Ravi told Huang the next day, \\"It got messed up and didn't work.\\" On September 23, Ravi and Huang discussed Clementi's death and Huang asked, \\"Didn't you say there was a viewing party once. ...\\" Ravi answered, \\"No that was a joke.\\" Two Rutgers students testified that Ravi, in an apparent test of his webcam, used computers in their rooms to connect to his own. A Rutgers information technology analyst reported that iChat connections were made with Ravi's computer from these students' computers at 6:58 and 7:44 p.m. on September 21. The first student said that Ravi encouraged him to text friends to watch Clementi's date and that Ravi used his computer to test the angle of the webcam so that it was pointed at Clementi's bed. The second student said that after dinner Ravi \\"hyped up\\" his earlier \\"dare you\\" tweet, that Ravi used her computer to access his iChat, and that \\"Tyler's side of the room came into view\\" when the webcam was accessed. The first student said that the next day he told Ravi that the webstream had not worked: \\"Then I saw [Ravi] in the lounge and I said, 'Yo, it didn't work.' And he said, 'Yeah, I have been getting that from a lot of people.'\\" At 9:15 p.m. Clementi saved a screenshot of Ravi's \\"dare you to video chat me\\" tweet. At 9:25 Ravi's computer was disconnected, according to analysis by the Rutgers IT expert, and it stayed disconnected till 11:19 p.m. At 9:33 Clementi told a friend online that he had turned off the power strip to Ravi's computer. At 10:19 Clementi's guest arrived. Ravi left for ultimate frisbee practice around 8:30‚Äì9:00 p.m. The captain of the frisbee team testified that after practice, at 11 p.m., he, Ravi and others went to get takeout food at the dining hall and that Ravi said that \\"he had set up a webcam of some sorts to capture images of his roommate\\", had \\"done it before,\\" and that night \\"was planning on doing it again\\". The student also testified that Ravi seemed uncomfortable with his roommate's being gay, but had said nothing explicitly \\"disparaging\\". Shortly after 11 p.m. Ravi texted Clementi to see if he was still using the room. At 11:48, Clementi texted Ravi that \\"we're done.\\" In an interview with investigators, Ravi said that on September 21 he had turned the webcam away from Clementi's bed. A former university detective testified that, when he inspected the dorm room on Sept. 23, the webcam was \\"angled directly at Tyler's bed\\". = Clementi's complaints to Rutgers officials = Only a portion of Clementi's requests for a room change were permitted to be seen by the jury. After discussing with friends Ravi's first Twitter message (\\"saw my roommate making out with a dude\\"), Clementi, at 3:55 a.m. on September 21, filed a request on the Rutgers housing website; he wrote, \\"roommate used webcam to spy on me/want a single room.\\" The part about spying was ruled hearsay and not admissible. Late on the evening of September 21, after seeing Ravi's \\"dare you\\" tweet and just before his meeting with M.B., Clementi visited a resident assistant, Rahi Grover. Grover was not permitted to testify about what Clementi said, but did testify about Clementi's demeanor. He said that Clementi's voice was \\"a little shaky\\" and that he appeared uncomfortable. The judge allowed some parts of Grover's official report of the incident: \\"Tyler is quite upset and feels uncomfortable. Tyler prefers some sort of roommate switch ASAP and prefers some sort of punishment for Dharun Ravi.\\" Grover also included his own recommendation that a roommate change be made as soon as possible, and he offered Clementi a bed in his own room for that night, which Clementi declined. Grover requested that Clementi later send him an e-mail to formalize the roommate change request, part of which was allowed as evidence. In his e-mail (12:03 a.m.) Clementi wrote: \\"I feel like my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in such a wildly inappropriate manner.\\" The judge ruled that \\"wildly inappropriate\\" be excluded from jury evidence since it was not a present sense impression but a description of past actions that Clementi had deliberated on. According to former prosecutor John Fahy, Clementi's e-mail and Grover's testimony were important in regard to whether or not Clementi \\"reasonably believed he was being intimidated\\". = Reactions to prosecution = Observers who commented after the prosecution rested its case, and before the defense brought its arguments, differed on the strength of the prosecution's case. Susan Abraham, a law professor and former public defender, said that she believed that the prosecution had established both the invasion of privacy and the bias intimidation charges. There is \\"no question\\", she said, that Clementi believed he was selected because of his sexual orientation, and some of Ravi's messages referring to gays might also be evidence of intent; she noted that, under the New Jersey bias intimidation law, the prosecution does not have to prove a biased intent, but only a reasonable belief by the victim that he was targeted because of sexual orientation. Abraham also guessed that one defense argument would be that, when Ravi admitted to violating privacy in his statements to the police, he did not understand the legal meaning of \\"invasion of privacy\\" and made the statement under duress. After the indictments, attorney Edward Weinstein had said that the prosecution case might be weak, but after hearing the prosecution case, he concluded that \\"The defense has an extremely large burden; the prosecution put on a good case.\\" He noted that Ravi's Twitter messages, revealed during the trial, showed that \\"he was not just a mischievous kid pulling a prank\\", though he also felt that the outcome of the case \\"totally remains to be seen\\". Jack Levin, an authority on hate crimes, was skeptical of the case for bias intimidation, saying of Ravi that \\"it becomes difficult to determine whether the motivation was due to sexual orientation or some other conflicts between the roommates that have nothing to do with sexual orientation\\", although he also noted that the position of the camera had raised doubts about Ravi's contention that he was primarily concerned about protecting his possessions. In a news analysis published shortly before the verdict was announced, Chris Cuomo of ABC News wrote that \\"for the most part, the consensus of reporters and legal analysts following the trial is that the state's hate crime charges are thin, at best.\\" =Reactions to defense= After the first morning of the defense presentation on March 9, 2012, trial attorney Brian Claypool viewed the overall defense strategy as effective, but he questioned defense techniques in trying to show that Ravi was not anti-gay. The character witnesses called, he said, were ineffective because the prosecution showed there was \\"no foundation\\" for them to say that Ravi was not anti-gay. Claypool said that the defense theme (of Ravi's not having bias) should have been pursued with numerous additional witnesses. He also said that Ravi himself needed to testify to show he had no bias against gays and to explain the inconsistencies in his recorded interview with the police. John Fahy, former Bergen County District Attorney, said after closing arguments that both the defense and prosecution did a \\"very good job\\". In regard to the invasion of privacy charge, Fahy said the defense was effective in raising reasonable doubt by characterizing the incidents as a \\"frolic\\" of \\"first-year college students\\". Regarding bias intimidation, Fahy said that there was \\"not a lot of proof\\" that the viewing was done because Clementi was gay. In regard to obstruction of justice, Fahy noted that a few texts by Ravi were \\"very difficult to explain\\". Fahy said that the police interview revealed a \\"kid not used to being interrogated\\" and that the interview contained \\"one big lie\\" by Ravi‚Äîthat in the second (September 21) incident he had \\"turned the computer off and later turned it on.\\"  Verdict  = Jury decision = After 12 hours of deliberations over two and a half days, a jury of 12 members and three alternates reached a verdict on March 16, 2012. Ravi was found guilty of invasion of privacy, hindering apprehension, witness tampering, and all four of the bias intimidation counts. In regard to the viewing on September 19, the jury concluded that Ravi did not act with the purpose to intimidate either Clementi or his guest because of their sexual orientation, but that Clementi was intimidated and reasonably believed that he had been targeted because of his sexual orientation. In regard to the planned viewing on September 21 and Ravi's encouragement of his Twitter followers to watch, the jury concluded that Ravi acted with the purpose to intimidate, with the knowledge that intimidation would occur, and with the result that Clementi was intimidated and reasonably believed that he was targeted because of sexual orientation. Ravi was acquitted of all bias charges against M.B. = Reactions = Five days after the verdict, Ravi said in an interview: In another interview, he said: On March 23, Joseph Clementi, Tyler's father, said that the family believed that the jury had reached the \\"correct verdict,\\" which \\"was based on the facts and the evidence\\"; the defense explanation, he added, \\"was simply not believable\\". \\"I have said all along we were looking for justice and accountability. I trusted the Courts and the State of New Jersey to get this right ... and they did.\\" Clementi's guest, identified only as MB at the trial, reacted to the verdict on March 16, 2012. He said, \\"I had hoped for all concerned that a trial could have been avoided, but that was not my choice. It was Mr. Ravi's decision, and now he will have to live with it.\\" MB's attorney said that the jury had been thorough and that the jury was correct in not finding MB to be the victim of a bias crime since the Rutgers students \\"didn't know anything about our client\\". The trial and the verdict sparked nationwide debate on the validity and efficacy of the New Jersey hate crime statute and similar laws. Marcellus A. McRae, a former federal prosecutor uninvolved in the case, hailed the guilty verdicts as \\"a watershed moment, because it says youth is not immunity\\". Steven Goldstein, the chairman of a New Jersey equal rights advocacy group, said that \\"This verdict sends the important message that a 'kids will be kids' defense is no excuse to bully another student.\\" Louis Raveson, a professor of criminal and civil trial litigation at Rutgers School of Law-Newark, said that bias intimidation criteria had been met: \\"I think the statute correctly predicted this kind of crime and ... is being used appropriately.\\" Glenn Berman, the judge who presided over Ravi's trial, said that the New Jersey statute was \\"muddled\\" and that he would have written it differently. The editorial board of the Newark newspaper, The Star-Ledger, criticized both the law and its application, arguing that Ravi's crime was not malicious, the law was unconstitutional, and the application of the law against Ravi was a \\"huge overreach\\". Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen criticized Ravi for \\"bullying (via webcam)\\", but argued that hate crime laws unfairly punish an individual for thought or speech, and therefore erode civil liberties. In a New York Times op-ed piece, journalist Emily Bazelon argued that, while Ravi's invasion of Clementi's privacy \\"should be out of bounds on a college campus,\\" the punishment he faced was disproportionate to that crime, and that hate crime laws were not intended for these types of actions.  Sentencing hearing  = Sentence = On May 21, 2012, Judge Glenn Berman sentenced Ravi to 30 days in jail, 3 years' probation, 300 hours of community service, a $10,000 fine, and counseling on cyberbullying and alternate lifestyles. \\"It wasn't my deal,\\" the judge said. \\"It was the state's.\\" Lead prosecutor Julia McClure had sought a five-year prison term and on May 23, 2012 filed a motion appealing the sentence. On May 30, 2012, Ravi waived his right to remain free during the appeals process and began his jail term at the Middlesex County Adult Corrections Center in North Brunswick, New Jersey on May 31, 2012. Ravi was released from jail on June 19, 2012 after serving 20 days of his 30-day term, with 5 days of credit for good behavior and 5 days of work credits. Ravi is a permanent resident of the United States who immigrated at age 6. Clementi's family, M.B., and the judge all recommended Ravi not be deported. In June 2012, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials announced that the convictions were not serious enough to seek deportation. = Apology issue = Judge Berman said that Ravi's \\"'letter of apology' to the pre-sentence people\\" was \\"unimpressive\\" and \\"didn't even mention the seven cover-up charges\\". He said it was \\"ironic\\" that Ravi's letter \\"doesn't mention M.B. as if he doesn't exist\\", yet M.B. had in his letter offered to write a letter to help Ravi avoid deportation. Ravi declined the opportunity to speak at the sentencing hearing and was reprimanded by Judge Berman for not having publicly apologized: \\"I heard this jury say guilty 288 times‚Äî24 questions, 12 jurors, that's the multiplication. And I haven't heard you apologize once.\\" On May 29, 2012, Ravi released the following statement: Clementi's parents responded: Appeals  Both the prosecutors and Ravi filed separate appeals. In February 2016, Ravi asked the courts to overturn his convictions. On September 9, 2016, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division overturned the conviction after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the bias intimidation laws under which Ravi had been convicted were unconstitutional. The appeals court ordered that Ravi could be re-tried on ten other charges. Ravi accepted a plea deal on October 27, 2016, and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy, a third-degree felony. He was sentenced to time already served and fines paid, and the remaining charges against him were dropped.

Roughwood is situated near to the town of Beith in North Ayrshire, Scotland; the lands lay within the old Lordship of Giffen.  The history of Roughwood  Roughwood Farm The name 'Ruch' in Scot's relates to ground that is \\"difficult to traverse; broken, uneven; covered with tussocky vegetation or the like\\".Dictionary of the Scots Language. Retrieved : 2012-05-04. The lands consisted of 160 acres in Beith parish and 85 in Dalry parish. No improvements had been made on these lands, mainly composed of moss and clay, since 1770 and they were in a very poor state, with no roads, farm-houses ruinous, and few enclosures when acquired by the Patricks.Paterson, Page 115 =The Barony Court= The Baron Courts were held at Roughwood by the Hammills or their baillies as it is recorded that a court was held at Roughwood on 25 June 1724 with William Ralston of that Ilk acting as bailie for Hugh Hammill. In August 1725 Henry Adam of Morshill was bailie, however in May 1740 Robert Shedden was bailie to John Shedden, Hugh Hammill having passed on the lands, rights and privileges permanently to the Sheddens and their heirs.Dobie, Page 195 In 1836 it is recorded that the Earl of Eglinton had discontinued the appointment of a Baron Bailie and a Baron Officer and the Barony Court had therefore ceased to function.Reid (2000), Page 54 =The old tower= The castle was a simple fortified keep. These defensive towers usually had an entrance on the ground floor, giving access to a wheel-stair to the first floor hall and to cellars or stores on the ground floor. The hall on the first floor usually had a large fireplace and window seats. The illustration is nearly or actually identical to that used for other tower castles, such as Busbie Castle. The old manor house or fortified tower of Ruchwood (sic) had a coat of arms of the Hammill family on the front bearing quarterly \\"a star (or mullet) of five points; a crescent; a shakefork, the same as the Cuninghame; and a fleur-de-lis.\\" The colours were not apparent at that time. This shield had a crest above, again a fleur-de-lis. Half of the old tower was removed to make room for modern improvements; however, in the half that remained an old doorway was retained, surrounded by a cut moulding. This coat of arms may be the same one that was present in the interior in the upper storey over a small fireplace in the left of the gable. These armorial bearings are reported as being very worn with the date '14' in the left-hand lower corner and 1st and 3rd quarters obliterated.Dobie, Page 85 =The farm= Mr Patrick built a road through his lands, rebuilt the farm-houses, created enclosures, and added plantations that survive to this day. The Spiersland Way is an old road, now only suitable now for farm vehicles, that runs down from the old 'Craig View' house near Bellscauseway to Burnside Cottage next to Roughwood Bridge and the Powgree Burn. The term 'lands of Roughwood and Millburn' are used in regards of the Shedden family, however no Millburn is located nearby, this property being already associated with the Sheddens before they obtained the lands of Roughwood.Paterson, Page 113 The farm may have been involved in flax dressing at one time, a retting pond is known to have existed at Windyhouse Farm and a lint mill was located on the Powgree Burn at the far end of Kersland Glen near Longbar. A room in Roughwood Farm has an unusual floor with four separately supported sides creating slopes down to a central area. This may have been the heckling shed where flax was processed and the spent material, called 'tow', was collected for further use in stuffing pillows, etc or simply for removal as it was highly combustible and fires in heckling shops were common. =Cartographic evidence= Blaeu's 1654 map based on Timothy Ponts map of the early 1600s marks a 'Ruchwood' as a dwelling rather than a fortified dwelling.

The fox or cat carving has no associated initials or dates. The bird is a falcon, the Ralston family crest. The painting of the animals is of recent origin. The falcon can be seen on the family memorial in Beith Cemetery (See photograph). The reason for the cockerel carving is unknown however in heraldry a cockerel represented courage and perseverance.

One is the standard design, but the other is triangular. These holes were constructed to permit access to barn owls which would also be provided with a nesting area within the building, the benefit to the farmer being that these birds would predate the rats and mice on the farm. Typically owl holes have an entry and a landing platform or perch in front. A stone used as a ventilation hole conforms to the design of a basic blind gun loop as found in fortified buildings. Blind gun loops allowed a defender to fire a gun from within; however, the view through this design of gun loop was limited. Dressing on some of the ashlar stone blocks suggest that they were prepared for a harling surface, the equivalent of modern roughcast, typically found on tower castles. Associated families =The Hammils= Coat of arms of the Hammil family A Walter de Hamule is recorded as holding lands in the Lothians during the reign of William the Lion. The estate of Roughwood appears to have been separated from the Barony of Giffin before the time of Sir Hugh de Eglinton acquisition of Giffin in 1371. The grant of Roughwood (Rughwodd) lands and those of Broadstone (Bradestaneward) to Robert de Hommyl were confirmed by John de Lyddale, Dominus de Bradestane on 14 July 1452. These lands were granted in 'payment' for attendance at the three annual Head Courts. The lands remained in the family by direct male descent for eight generations. In 1600 Hugh Hammil held these lands.Robertson, Page 373 In 1643 Hugh married Catherine, daughter of William Ralston of that Ilk and had offspring, Matthew and Anna. This Matthew sold the estate to Robert Shedden, circa 1736, and died unmarried. His sister Anna married Robert Montgomery of nearby Craighouse. The coat of arms, as engraved on the front of the house, were \\"Quarterly; first, Gules, a mullet, Or; second, Azure, a crescent, Argent; third, fleur de lis, Or. The crest was a fleur de lis. The supporters were two serpents, pendant et vigilans.\\" Dobie has it that Hugh Hammill sold the lands of Ruchwood and Bradestaneward to Robert Shedden, rather than his son, on 23 May 1713. The Sheddens were merchants in Beith.Dobie, Page 84 in 1720 Catherine Peebles, the widow of Matthew Hammill of Roughwood, protested against the rights passed to the Sheddens as it would prejudice her right to living at Mains of Roughwood for the remainder of her days. The Ulster connection Some of the family of Hugh Hammil of Roughwood accompanied Hugh Montgomerie to Ireland and became established there as merchants in the Dublin area.Robertson, Page 373. Hugh Montgomery brought a colony of Irish Protestants over from his Irish estates in 1600 and later a colony of Protestants from the area were taken over to the Ardes and Clandebora areas of Ireland following the putting down of an Irish revolt.Robertson, Page 281. Hugh was knighted by King James in 1605, giving him precedence over his rival James Hamilton, Hugh Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery (1560‚Äì1636), is known as one of the \\"founding fathers\\" of the Ulster-Scots along with James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye. Paterson,Paterson, Page 48. the historian, records that the 'Laird of Braidstane's Scotch Colony', established in around 1606, was responsible for the introduction of linen weaving and manufacture to the area around Lurgan in Ireland.Jamieson, Page 10 In 1636 Hugh Hamill of Roughwood, attended the funeral of the 1st Viscount Ards in Newtownards, Ireland, as one of the principle mourners.Irish Surnames Retrieved : 2012-05-06 The Hamills mainly settled in Antrim, and the North Antrim Hamills are almost entirely descended from Hugh Hamill of Roughwood.

Robert the heir, married Jean Harvey of Greenend, daughter of Robert Harvey. Robert acquired the lands of Roughwood from the Hamills in 1713 and had a son, John.Paterson, Page 112 In 1734 John Shedden also held house and tenements in Beith, portions of the old Glebe and the lands of Easterbraehead, Townhead, Knockbuckle, Cumingsbraehead and Braehouses. Site of the old limestone quarry and lime kilns John Shedden (b 1690) succeeded his father in the lands of Roughwood and Millburn and married Jean Ralstoun, eldest daughter of Gavin Ralstoun of that Ilk. William Ralstoun Shedden was born on 23 April 1747 and succeeded to Roughwood and Millburn on 1 May 1770. He lost property in Virginia as a result of American independence, moved to Bermuda and finally settled in New York, never to return to Roughwood. Upon his death a judicial sale of the estate was only avoided by Robert Patrick, eldest son of John Patrick and Marion Shedden (B 1733), paying the value of his late uncle's estate. Later he sold Roughwood and Millburn to his younger brother, William Patrick, upon purchasing Hessilhead. William therefore acquired his mother's family estate and also purchased the Woodside- Ralston estate of his grandmother.Paterson, Page 114 The Shedden arms were \\"Azure, on a chevron, betwixt three Griffins' Heads, erazed, Argent; as many Cross Cross-lets fitchee, Gules; on a chiefl of the second, an Escalop Shell of the first, inter two Cinquefoils of the third.\\" When translated the Arms description is: Blue: on a silver chevron between three griffins' heads jagged, three red crosses crosslet pointed at the foot; on a silver upper third a blue shell between two red cinquefoils.Shedden Coat of Arms Retrieved : 2012-05-05 The Shedden crest was a Lion Rampant and the motto \\"Virtute et Fidelitate.\\" (By Valour and Fidelty). ;Litigation Because Robert Patrick had been served heir to his uncle's estate of Roughwood in 1799, the junior branch, which descended from William Shedden (b 1708), youngest son of John Shedden (b 1643), never actually held Roughwood. William Ralston Shedden (b 1828), was the only son of William Patrick Shedden (b 1794), and unfortunately became obsessed with the idea that he was the rightful heir to the Roughwood estates. He entered on a course of litigation in the prosecuting of which he used up the whole of his fortune that he inherited from his father. The claim continued to be pressed by the family for many years and when all their funds had been exhausted his sister, Annabella Jane Shedden, took up the pleadings and in a futile final effort conducted the case before a committee of the House of Lords.Sheddens of Roughwood Retrieved : 2012-05-05 =The Patricks and Ralston-Patricks= Memorial plaque to Major Robert Ralston-Patrick at Beith cemetery Memorial to the Ralston-Patricks of Trearne, Hessilhead and Roughwood In 1823 William Patrick held the lands of Roughwood.Robertson, Page 374 Dobie records that Neubottle (the ancient name of the lands called 'Windyhouse), Over Windyhouse and Nether Windyhouse were purchased by William Patrick of Roughwood in 1810 and 1841.

Lime kilns to produce lime for improving the soil, were a common feature of the countryside before the process became fully industrialised. Roughwood had at least two limekilns nearby and a large limestone quarry is shown on OS maps in the area of the old 'Myre' dwelling of which nothing survives other than the surrounding shape of its hedgerows. The quarry has been infilled and the limekilns demolished. These kilns would have created considerable pollution in the area, surprisingly close to Roughwood Farm.

She was the second ; her only sister ship was . Prinzess Wilhelm was laid down in 1886 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel, launched in September 1887, and commissioned into the fleet in November 1889. The cruiser was named after Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, first wife of Kaiser Wilhem II. As built, the ship was armed with a main battery of fourteen guns and had a top speed of . In 1895, Prinzess Wilhelm was deployed to East Asian waters, where she frequently served as the flagship of the East Asia Cruiser Division. She was one of the three ships that participated in the seizure of Kiaochou Bay under the command of Rear Admiral Otto von Diederichs. She subsequently was present in the Philippines in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Manila Bay between American and Spanish squadrons during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. Prinzess Wilhelm returned to Germany in 1899 and was modernized in 1899‚Äì1903. She was reduced to a mine hulk in February 1914 and ultimately broken up for scrap in 1922. Design Prinzess Wilhelm was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal AG Germania 2-cylinder double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of screw propellers. Steam was provided by four coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which were ducted into a pair of funnels. These provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . She had a crew of 28 officers and 337 enlisted men.Gr√∂ner, pp. 94‚Äì95 The ship was armed with a main battery of four 15 cm RK L/30 guns in single pedestal mounts, supplied with 400 rounds of ammunition in total. They had a range of . Prinzess Wilhelm also carried ten shorter-barreled 15 cm RK L/22 guns in single mounts. These guns had a much shorter range, at . The gun armament was rounded out by six 3.7 cm revolver cannon, which provided close- range defense against torpedo boats.Gardiner, p. 253 She was also equipped with three torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes, two launchers were mounted on the deck and the third was in the bow, below the waterline. The ship's main armor protection consisted of a curved deck that was on the flat portion, increasing in thickness toward the sides to , where it sloped downward to the side of the hull. The conning tower had sides that were 50 mm thick. =Modifications= The ship was modernized in Wilhelmshaven in 1899; work lasted until 1902. The ship's armament was significantly improved; the four L/30 guns were replaced with 15 cm SK L/35 guns with an increased range of . A secondary battery of eight SK L/35 quick-firing (QF) guns was installed in place of the L/22 guns, and six SK L/40 QF guns were added.Gr√∂ner, p. 95 Service history SMS Prinzess Wilhelm Prinzess Wilhelm was the second protected cruiser built by the German navy. She was ordered under the contract name \\"Ersatz \\" and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in 1886.Gr√∂ner, p. 94 She was launched on 22 September 1887, after which fitting- out work commenced. She was commissioned into the German navy on 13 November 1889. In the first maneuvers of 1890, the newly commissioned Prinzess Wilhelm operated as the opposing force with several old corvettes.Sondhaus, p. 194 In September 1892, the ship was sent to Genoa to represent Germany in the 400th anniversary of the voyage of Christopher Columbus. She was the only German ship sent to the ceremonies, a result of cooling relations between Germany and Italy at the time.Sondhaus, p. 195 In the 1894 autumn maneuvers, Prinzess Wilhelm served as the flagship of a reconnaissance flotilla.Sondhaus, p. 196 In January 1895, Prinzess Wilhelm was dispatched to Asia to reinforce the Cruiser Division stationed there.Gottschall, p. 136 After she joined her sister in East Asian waters, the Division was reinforced with the rebuilt old ironclad , the light cruiser , the corvette , and the gunboat .Sondhaus, p. 206 In June 1896, Alfred von Tirpitz took command of the Cruiser Division.Kelly, p. 119 By November, Prinzess Wilhelm was in bad need of maintenance, as engine problems limited her to half-speed.Kelly, p. 122 In June 1897, Rear Admiral Otto von Diederichs arrived in Asia to take command of the Cruiser Division; Prinzess Wilhelm, Irene, and Arcona were in Chefoo conducting gunnery training.Gottschall, p. 147 Diederichs, aboard Kaiser, joined the rest of the Division in Chefoo at the end of the month. There, he held a series of ceremonial visits with the captains of each of his ships. On 1 July, Diederichs boarded Prinzess Wilhelm to make a visit to the Chinese capital at Peking. There, he attempted to negotiate with the Chinese government to acquire a permanent naval base for the Cruiser Division. Diederichs, who sought the port of Kiaochou, was unsuccessful in his attempt, and so he returned to Prinzess Wilhelm on 11 July. While leaving Peking, he examined the Taku Forts that guarded the entrance to Peking. Diederichs returned to the Division on 16 July, after which he conducted a tour of Asian ports with the entire Division.Gottschall, pp. 148‚Äì150 =Seizure of Kiaochou= In October, Diederichs planned to rotate his ships through repair facilities in the region for periodic maintenance; Prinzess Wilhelm was scheduled to dock in Shanghai. He requested permission to take Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser to Kiaochou for autumn gunnery training and to leave Prinzess Wilhelm stationed there during the winter, which was denied.Gottschall, pp. 153‚Äì154 Diederichs was able to make use of the murder of a pair of German priests on 6 November in Shangtung, however, to justify his move against Kiaochou. At the time, the only ships available for the attack were Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser.Gottschall, pp. 156‚Äì157 Cormoran joined the two ships after a few days, and by 10 November, the ships were ready. Prinzess Wilhelm left port on the 11th, to rendezvous with Kaiser and Cormoran at sea.Gottschall, p. 158 On the night 12 November, the three ships met and formed into line; the attack was scheduled to begin on the morning of 14 November with a bombardment from the warships. The crews of Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser were to form a landing party to seize the harbor. The flotilla arrived on the morning of the 13th.Gottschall, p. 159 The following morning, the landing party of some 700 officers and men was landed on the main pier in the harbor. The Chinese were caught completely by surprise, and the Germans secured their objectives within two hours; Diederichs convinced the Chinese commander, General Chang, to withdraw from Kiaochou. The Imperial flag was raised in the town and Prinzess Wilhelm fired a 21-gun salute.Gottschall, pp. 161‚Äì162 The landing party remained in Kiaochou to garrison the port, and several 3.7 cm guns were removed from the ships to provide artillery to the force.Gottschall, pp. 165‚Äì166 Diederichs requested reinforcements from Germany, and the Kaiser authorized a second Division to deploy to the East Asia station. The unit was therefore reorganized as the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm was assigned to the I Division of the Squadron.Gottschall, p. 165 On 27 November, Diederichs was promoted to vice admiral for his success in seizing Kiaochou, and given command of the new Squadron.Gottschall, p. 169 Chinese forces converged on the port by the end of the month. Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser moved into the harbor to provide artillery support. General Chang, who had been placed under house arrest, was discovered to have been attempting to subvert the German occupation; Dierderichs therefore placed him under arrest aboard Prinzess Wilhelm. A brief skirmish ensued, which quickly resulted in a Chinese rout.Gottschall, pp. 169‚Äì171 On 8 January, a force of 50 men from Prinzess Wilhelms crew was sent to Chi-mo to defend against Chinese raids in the area.Gottschall, p. 173 =The Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= In the Spring of 1898, Prince Heinrich arrived in Asia. While awaiting his arrival, Diederichs planned to rotate his ships through dockyards for periodic maintenance. On 4 May, Diederichs made Prinzess Wilhelm his flagship and sent Kaiser to Nagasaki and followed the next day, after Prince Heinrich reached Kiaochou.Gottschall, p. 179 The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War had broken out on 25 April and Commodore George Dewey had defeated the Spanish squadron at the Battle of Manila Bay on 1 May.Gottschall, p. 180 Diederichs planned to use the crisis as an opportunity to seize another base for the Squadron in Asia.Gottschall, p. 181 Upon arriving in Nagasaki, Diederichs learned the shipyard had not yet completed repairs to Kaiser, and so was unable to refit Prinzess Wilhelm for some time. He therefore ordered to meet him in Nagasaki, which he would use as his temporary flagship.Gottschall, p. 185 Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser were to rejoin Diederichs once their repairs were completed.Gottschall, p. 190 On 20 June, Prinzess Wilhelm arrived in the Philippines; Diederichs now had a force of five warships: Prinzess Wilhelm, Kaiser, Irene, Kaiserin Augusta, and Cormoran.Gottschall, p. 195 After her arrival, Prinzess Wilhelm proceeded to Mariveles to replenish her coal supplies and receive new crewmen from the transport Darmstadt.Gottschall, p. 196 On 9 August, the American squadron in the Bay ordered the neutral warships in the harbor to leave the bombardment zone, and so Prinzess Wilhelm and the other German ships went to Mariveles.Gottschall, p. 212 Following the fall of the city, most of the German ships departed the Philippines; only Prinzess Wilhelm remained on station to protect German nationals in the islands. She was replaced by Arcona in October.Gottschall, p. 218 In mid- November, Kaiser ran aground and had to go into drydock for repairs; Diederichs therefore made Prinzess Wilhelm his flagship.Gottschall, p. 220 The ship remained in Asia for only a few more months, returning to European waters in 1899. =Fate= After returning to Germany in 1899, she went into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven for modernization; work lasted until 1902. She was stricken from the naval register on 17 February 1914 and used as a mine hulk. She was initially based in Danzig, but later moved to Kiel and Wilhelmshaven. On 26 November 1921, Prinzess Wilhelm was sold for 909,000 Marks. She was broken up the following year in Wilhelmshaven.

Located in The Hague, Netherlands, ESH offers tuition in 13 European languages, leading to the European Baccalaureate. Mission ESH's stated vision is to inspire students to be responsible, future focused, and proactive citizens of Europe and the world. Its mission is to provide a positive, open-minded community that fosters ambition through rich cultural and academic opportunities, inspiring lifelong learning. The ESH lists its values as \\"ambition\\", \\"positivity\\" and \\"respect\\". Curriculum Students at the European School The Hague must enrol in a language section, with general instruction provided in the language of the respective section. The primary school currently operates Dutch, English, French, German and Spanish language sections, and the Secondary school offers Dutch, English and French language sections, with German beginning in school year 2020-2021. Students must choose from either English, French or Dutch for their second language, which becomes the language of instruction for the History, Geography and Ethics curriculum from the third-year secondary. As per the policy of the European Schools, students whose mother tongue is not covered by a language section, must enrol in the section of one of the EU's official vehicular languages (English, German, or French), or in the section of the host country language (Dutch). They may then opt for their mother tongue for \\"Language 1\\" classes in place of those usually provided by their respective chosen language section. For the purposes of second language classes, their respective chosen section then becomes their designated second language. In 2006 the Council of the European Union and European Parliament adopted a European Framework for Key Competences for Lifelong Learning. These competences are incorporated and embedded in the European Schools curriculum. The eight key competences, which all individuals need for personal fulfillment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment form the basis of the school‚Äôs curriculum. Legal status The school received its initial status as an Accredited European School from the Board of Governors of the European Schools in November 2013, and received accreditation to offer the European Baccalaureate programme in June 2018. The European School The Hague is managed by the Rijnlands Lyceum Foundation, which is responsible for the provision and maintenance of its facilities, finances, staff, and the overall quality of education. ESH is recognised by the Dutch government as a Dutch school, which must meet Dutch education objectives, in return for partial- subsidisation by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. The school was largely established to cater for the needs of families of staff of European institutions based in The Hague. For this reason the school is obliged to prioritise, for enrolment purposes, the children of staff of European Union institutions or agencies (notably Europol and Eurojust), as well as non-EU institutions such as the European Patent Office and the European Space Agency (ESA/ESTEC). The European Commission covers the fees of children of European Union staff enrolled in the school. History The European School The Hague opened in August 2012, and was officially inaugurated that October, with an event programme that included a key note speech on \\"The Future of Europe\\", delivered by Rob de Wijk (nl), Professor of International Relations and Security at the Institute of Security and Global Affairs at Leiden University. Initially only the nursery and primary cycles of the school operated, with the secondary cycle operating from September 2014. In 2018, the secondary school moved into the old Aloysius school premises, a municipal monument, and has undertaken a significant renovation project to modernise the facilities, while maintaining the historical integrity of the building. The renovation project will deliver a new theatre, library, art, science and IT facilities, 27 new classrooms, and new kitchen and canteen facilities during school year 2020-2021. New sports facilities, additional classrooms and office space will be available when the renovations end in the school year 2021-2022. ESH held its first European Baccalaureate examinations in 2019.

The village lies south of the river and north of the A30 Shaftesbury-Wilton road, about west of Wilton and east of the large village of Tisbury.  Hamlets  The hamlet of Sutton Row is about one mile west of Sutton Mandeville village. Lower Chicksgrove, in the northwest of the parish and on the left (north) bank of the Nadder, was transferred from Tisbury parish in 1986. The Apshill area, south of the river on the road from Sutton Row to Lower Chicksgrove, was also part of the transfer from Tisbury parish. The hamlet here, which includes the Compasses Inn, is unmarked on a 1958 Ordnance Survey map but on some modern maps is labelled as Chicksgrove.  History  No prehistoric sites are recorded in the area, although an Iron Age hillfort known as Castle Ditches lies to the west in Tisbury parish. Domesday Book in 1086 recorded a settlement of 25 households at Sudtone, with woodland and a mill. Later landowners included the Wyndham family of Dinton House (later Philipps House). In 1859 the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway opened their line from Salisbury to Gillingham, following the Nadder valley and crossing the parish north of Sutton Mandeville. The station at was closed in 1966; station remains in use, and the line forms part of the route from London Waterloo to Exeter via Salisbury.  Parish church  The parish church dedicated to All Saints, built in uncoursed dressed limestone, dates from the 13th century; the chancel arch is from that period. The chancel was restored in 1850 and there was further restoration in 1862. The church was recorded as Grade II* listed in 1966. The three-stage west tower was built in the 15th century and carries three bells: one possibly dated 1399, the others cast by John Wallis in 1615 and 1616. In the churchyard is a late 17th-century sundial, restored in the 19th century. At some point the benefice was united with those of Fovant and Compton Chamberlayne. In 1979 the benefice of Teffont Evias with Teffont Magna was added to the union and a team ministry was established, today known as the Nadder Valley benefice and covering fourteen parishes with sixteen churches.  Notable buildings  Church Farmhouse, now a dwelling, began as a cottage in the 17th century. An 18th-century watermill on the Nadder, northwest of the village, was in use to grind flour until the 1940s. Chicksgrove manor at Lower Chicksgrove is Grade II* listed. The house, in rubble stone under a thatched roof, has 14th-century origins and is described by Historic England as \\"a very fine Wiltshire manor house retaining many features from different periods of its development\\". Behind the house is an 18th-century timber-framed granary, on staddle stones. Apshill House, part of the hamlet between Sutton Row and Lower Chicksgrove, dates from the 14th century and was altered and extended in the 16th and 17th. Historic England state it is \\"an unusual survival of a hall house\\". The Compasses Inn, in the same hamlet, is a late 17th-century building. Governance The parish has a locally-elected parish council, which was created in 1974 to replace the earlier parish meeting. This is consulted on all parish matters, while most significant local government functions are carried out by the Wiltshire Council unitary authority.

The first REC service was established at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in 1997. Today, most REC services are found at academic institutions, and the majority of current services were originally launched in response to the 2006 NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award program, as applicants to that program were required to have procedures in place to address ethical concerns raised by their research. While still a young discipline with no explicit standards, individuals serving as research ethics consultants are expected to be familiar with research ethics and ethical analysis; knowledgeable about the applicable regulations, laws, and policies; and ideally also have some biomedical research experience and scientific expertise. REC is distinct from related services, such as those of Institutional Review Boards, in that it is typically available at any point during a study (planning, conducting, interpreting, or disseminating results), and can relate to any ethical question. While little is known about the range and distribution of topics put forth for REC, such services may be particularly important and useful for studies of known regulatory and ethical uncertainty (e.g. assessment of minimal risk in pediatric studies) and frontier research for which there is little if any regulation or expert consensus. The recommendations that result from the consultation are non-binding, meaning that the researcher may choose to follow the recommendation, or to pursue a different approach.

In 1882 Munson returned to the Vermont House, and in 1883 he was appointed as Bennington County's Judge of Probate. In 1889 Munson was appointed to a vacancy on the Vermont Supreme Court. He was elected to the post in 1890 and served until 1914, when he was not reappointed due to his age, and was replaced by Robert E. Healy. His retirement lasted only a month; public outcry led the Vermont General Assembly to return Munson to the bench in January 1915 with appointment as Chief Justice.James Terry White, editor, The National Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography, Volume 17, 1921, page 322 While serving as a justice of the Court, Munson authored the opinion in the well- known torts case Ploof v.

Putnam's servant untied Ploof's boat, and Ploof's family was injured and his boat damaged in the storm. The Vermont Supreme Court held that Putnam, the dock owner, was liable for damage and injuries caused by his employee while the employee was acting on the employer's behalf.

Oakes, Encyclopedia of World Scientists, \\"Wendy Freedman\\" Freedman's early work was principally on the Cepheid distance scale. Hubble constant Freedman was co-leader of an international team of 30 astronomers to carry out the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project, a program aiming to establish the distance scale of the Universe and measure the current expansion rate, a quantity known as the Hubble constant. This quantity determines the size of the visible universe and is key to determining its age. Over the course of the Key Project, the team measured the distances to 24 galaxies using Cepheid variable stars, and measured the Hubble constant using five independent methods. The project's researchers, led by Freedman, published their final result in 2001. The work provided a value of the Hubble constant accurate to 10%, resolving a long-standing, factor-of-two debate. Giant Magellan Telescope Freedman initiated the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) Project and served as chair of the board of directors from its inception in 2003 until 2015. GMT is an international consortium of leading universities and science institutions to build a 25-meter optical telescope at the Carnegie Institution for Science's Las Campanas Observatory in the Chilean Andes. With a primary mirror in diameter, the GMT is poised to be the world's largest ground-based telescope when it is completed. The telescope, which has entered its construction phase and is expected to become fully operational by 2024, will be able to produce images 10 times sharper than those of the Hubble Space Telescope.

The film stars Greta Gerwig, Joel Kinnaman, Lister-Jones, Bill Pullman and Debra Winger. Plot On her 29th birthday, Ph.D. student Lola accepts a marriage proposal from her longtime artist boyfriend, Luke, and wedding preparations soon unfold. However, weeks before the wedding, Luke gets cold feet and ends the engagement, leaving her devastated. In an attempt to encourage Lola to date other men, her best friend Alice takes her to a nightclub. There, the thought of having one-night stands with strangers sends Lola into a panic attack. Shortly thereafter, Lola visits Henry, a mutual friend of hers and Luke's, spending the night at his place. One day, a man named Nick flirts with Lola outside a fish market. Though she is not ready to start dating again, she agrees to give him her phone number. On her way to a meeting at university, Lola is surprised by Luke, who has been second-guessing his decision to cancel the wedding, but she dismisses him. Lola presents her doctoral dissertation on silence in 19th-century French literature and the lack thereof in modern popular culture, as her professors look on in confusion. One night, Lola asks Henry to stay over at her place. The two share her bed and eventually kiss, until Henry stops out of respect for Luke. Despite confessing he has always had feelings for Lola, Henry reckons they should take things slow. The next day, Lola meets Luke for lunch. After they have sex at Luke's apartment, Lola breaks down in tears and insists she can no longer see him, as she is still heartbroken. While Luke is in the shower, Lola sees text messages from a woman named Peggy on his phone. Lola and Henry continue to spend time together. While watching Henry perform with his band one night, Lola runs into Luke and Peggy. Outside the venue, Luke tells Lola he has recently started a casual relationship with Peggy. Angry, Lola reminds him that he was the one that wanted time alone, before abruptly revealing she is dating Henry. Back inside, Luke, feeling betrayed, lashes out at both Lola and Henry. Later that night, a drunken Lola goes over to Henry's, where they have awkward sex. Afterwards, Henry asserts they do not need to label their relationship. Lola meets Nick for a dinner date at his place. They later have sex, during which Nick behaves oddly. The next morning, Nick accompanies Lola home. Henry, who had been waiting for Lola on her doorstep, becomes upset upon seeing her with Nick. Lola attempts to apologize to Henry, saying she was unsure if their relationship was exclusive, but he angrily walks out on her. Lola stops by Luke's apartment; the two hang out and smoke weed. At a house party thrown by Lola, Henry assures her that he is no longer upset with her, while Luke tells her that Henry will move in with him and invites her to their upcoming housewarming party. Later on, Lola breaks up with Nick. At the housewarming party, Alice and Henry awkwardly reveal to Lola that they have recently started dating. A hysterical Lola berates Alice for not telling her earlier. When Luke chimes in, Lola insists that all three of them have abandoned her, before storming off. Wandering the streets at night, Lola goes on a drunken bender, stealing liquor bottles and going to a strip club. The next morning, she awakens outside her apartment. As she realizes she is the only one responsible for her existential crisis, Lola takes time to focus on her own self-improvement, and successfully completes her dissertation. Having made peace with both Alice and Henry, Lola celebrates her 30th birthday with a picnic in the park, surrounded by her parents and close friends. When Luke shows up, he tells Lola that their time apart has helped him realize how much he missed her, and proposes a reconciliation. Lola kindly rejects his offer, explaining that since she spent all that time obsessing about him, she still needs to be alone for a while.

He is best remembered for his actions as commander of the fleet flagship, the Dingyuan, during the First Sino-Japanese War. After his death and the ship being destroyed at the end of the war, he was raised to national hero status in modern China. At his death, Liu was commander of the fleet flagship, with the rank Admiral of the Right, and reserve Admiral of the Fleet. Life Liu was born in the town of Houguan, in Fujian province in China. Liu‚Äôs father died before he was born, and he was brought up by his mother. In 1867, he passed the entry examinations and entered the Foochow Arsenal Naval School established by Shen Baozhen to study navigation. In 1871, was on the training ship Jianwei, and he visited Amoy, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Bohai Bay. In 1872, with the best results, Liu graduated in the first class of the Foochow Arsenal Naval School. In 1875, he was appointed commander of the training ship Jianwei. In 1876, he was sent to Britain for further training. He served on the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet flagship HMS Hercules as a trainee first mate. He returned to China in 1878 and was given command of the Zhenbei in the Beiyang Fleet. In 1881, Viceroy Li Hongzhang, the Beiyang minister, sent a command with a German shipyard for the construction of two battleships (the Dingyuan and the Zhenyuan). Liu was sent to monitor construction and inspect the ships, and to assist in delivering the two warships back to China. In 1885 got back to China aboard the Dingyuan, upon which he was given command of the Dingyuan, with Commodore rank. In 1888, the Beiyang Fleet was officially established. Liu participated in drawing up the Fleet's charter, and was subsequently promoted to the Right Wing command of Admiral. Viceroy Li was highly impressed with Liu, and in his secret missive to the court said Liu had \\"talents that could be placed to great use\\". In 1890, the Beiyang Fleet visited Hong Kong. When Fleet Admiral Ding Ruchang left his ship, Liu took down the fleet admiral flag and put up his admiral flag. The fleet's chief training officer, Royal Navy captain and Englishman William Lang raised issue with this, and complained to Li Hongzhang. In the subsequent dispute, Li supported Liu, and in response William Lang resigned from the Beiyang Fleet. In the years leading up to the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Liu repeatedly pressed Li Hongzhang to develop the Beiyang Fleet. He pointed out that Japan was enthusiastically expanding its navy, and to keep up the Beiyang Fleet must adopt an annual program to add new ships. However, Li Hongzhang was unable to expand the Beiyang Fleet due to the realities of court politics. The First Sino-Japanese War began in 1894, and on 17 September of that year, the Beiyang Fleet encountered the Japanese Combined Fleet on the Yellow Sea, sparking the Battle of the Yalu River. During the Battle of the Yalu River, Liu Buchan commanded the flagship Dingyuan - the most powerful ship of the Beiyang Fleet - in battle against the Japanese fleet. The battle lasted into the afternoon and the Dingyuan was struck multiple times. As Admiral Ding Ruchang, the fleet commander, had been seriously wounded early in the battle, Liu had to assume command of the entire fleet. For his bravery during the battle, Liu was promoted to reserve Admiral of the Fleet after the battle, and acted as commander of the fleets while Ding Ruchang recovered from his injuries. Shortly afterwards, on 4 February 1895, Japanese torpedo boats launched a surprise attack on the Beiyang Fleet's home base at Weihaiwei, during which the Dingyuan was hit and began taking on water. Liu ordered the ship run aground and to continue firing as an artillery battery. On 9 February 1895 the Japanese army took over the shore batteries, and fired upon and hit the Dingyuan. Fearing that the naval base at Liugong Island would soon fall, and that the Dingyuan would fall into enemy hands, he ordered that the Dingyuan be scuttled. That night, Liu killed himself by swallowing opium. The Qing government, appreciating his service, ordered that benefits be given with the status of an admiral of the fleet. Assessment In the 20th century, there was praise as well as criticism in all kinds of books about him. The criticism was mainly from William Tyler‚Äôs - an English sailor on Dingyuan - memoir. But there were also widely accepted ideas that there was a personal enmity between William Tyler and Liu Buchan and that William Tyler‚Äôs words were unreliable. But there were two opinions that were really accepted. First, Liu Buchan lacked adequate experience before he was appointed as the captain of Dingyuan and training and command were very bad under him. Second, he was addicted to taking opium all the time, which was universal among his troops.

Two of her books, Fog Magic and The Light at Tern Rock were among the annual Newbery Medal runners-up. Both are set in Canada, where Sauer frequently vacationed. Life Julia Lina Sauer was born April 8, 1891, in Rochester, New York. She attended the University of Rochester and the New York State Library School in Albany, NY. Sauer then returned to Rochester, where she was the head of the children's department at the Public Library from 1921-1958.Chevalier, Tracy (editor), Twentieth-Century Children's Writers, St. James Press, 1989; Though she lived most of her life in Rochester, Sauer spent many summers in Little River, Nova Scotia, Canada. That area became the setting for both of her award-winning books. As a librarian, Sauer became involved in the new medium of radio through the School of the Air, broadcasting programs for fifth through eleventh graders directly into schools.Keith, Michael, Radio Cultures: The Sound Medium in American Life, Peter Lang, 2008, pp. 296; She eventually edited a book on giving radio book talks for children.Freeman, Robert, Libraries to the People: Histories of Outreach, McFarland, 2003, pp.171; Her early work as a children's librarian brought her recognition with the American Library Association, and in 1939 she was appointed chairman of the Committee on Planning and Equipping Children's Libraries for the ALA. By the early 1940s a debate, at times acrimonious, had developed in the children's literature field about whether children's books should be imaginative escapes from reality or reflections of the trials and difficulties of modern life, including the Great Depression and developments leading to World War II. The side supporting fantasy was symbolized by the nightingale, a figure of ethereal beauty from fairy tales. Realists often pointed to the character of Janey Larkins from Doris Gates' book Blue Willow, the first realistic American problem novel for children. The ALA asked Julia Sauer to address the controversy, and in 1941 the Library Journal published her article \\"Making the World Safe for the Janey Larkins\\". In it, Sauer wrote that children should not be protected from the realities of their world. But, she argued, they need both realism and imagination. She finished with an appeal to her fellow librarians: \\"We need many more books about the Janey Larkins in our literature for children. And when we get them we will need the courage to give them to our children... before a world can be made safe even for nightingales, it must be made safe for the Janey Larkins.\\" Sauer presented the paper, \\"Library Services to Children in a World at War,\\" to the 8th Pan- American Child Congress in Washington, DC, in 1942. Her final children's book appeared in 1954. It tells the adventures of a small boy who checks out Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel so many times he calls the library Mike's House. At the behest of the Atlantic Monthly, in 1955 Sauer and two others, Virginia Haviland and Elizabeth Gross, compiled a list of \\"50 Outstanding Books Published Since 1940\\". As well as writing, Sauer spoke throughout her life at colleges, library institutes and national meetings. Julia Sauer died June 26, 1983 in Rochester, New York. Her papers are held at the Rochester public library and the University of Minnesota. Reception and legacy Sauer wrote only three books for children and two of them were among the annual Newbery Medal runners-up, now called Newbery Honor Books. All three books received starred reviews from Kirkus, for \\"books of remarkable merit\\". Her first book, Fog Magic, is a fantasy novel set in Nova Scotia. It was one of four Newbery runners-up in 1944. In it, Sauer addresses the debate of imagination versus realism that was raging at the time. As Mary Lystad writes in Twentieth- Century Children's Writers, \\"The story goes back and forth from the real present to the conjured-up past, pointing out the thin line between a person's reality and his fantasy, and the need for the acceptance of the two.\\" Sauer's second novel, The Light at Tern Rock, received the Newbery Honor in 1952. Kirkus Reviews praised its keen sense of place, calling it \\"unusual and atmospheric\\". Rebecca Stead, author of the 2010 Newbery Award book When You Reach Me said in an interview \\"There‚Äôs a book called Fog Magic by Julia L. Sauer that I loved very much, about a girl in Nova Scotia who discovers a village that appears only on foggy days. For a long time, I thought this was a secret book that only I knew about\\". As a librarian, Sauer held high standards, saying ‚ÄúThe children‚Äôs librarian‚Äôs first obligation is always, I believe, to lead a child to the best there is for him, to help him, by what wisdom she may have, to appreciate the better and finally the best, and to keep him reading at the highest possible level.‚ÄùMiller, Marilyn, Pioneers and Leaders in Library Services to Youth: A Biographical Dictionary, Libraries Unlimited, 2003, pp. 212-214; As a writer, according to Marilyn Miller, Sauer \\"wrote with passion and compassion.

Opened in 1906, it is Madison's oldest theater, changing ownership many times and adapting to the many changes in the entertainment business throughout its history. Beginning as a vaudeville theater, it became a movie house by 1912 with occasional live acts, and converted to talking motion pictures by 1930. Today the theater is owned and operated by Matt Gerding and Scott Leslie who acquired the theater in 2007 and made it into a successful music club hosting DJs and live shows several nights a week.  History  = Vaudeville theater (1906‚Äì1912) = A newspaper ad promoting the Majestic's vaudeville acts during its opening week in 1906. The Majestic Theatre was founded by Edward F. Biederstaedt (1865‚Äì1912) and his brother Otto, sons of Williamson Street grocer Charles Biederstaedt, whose German ancestors helped establish the Catholic church in Madison. Edward had been a railroad brakeman, secondhand goods dealer, and later ran the White House saloon on King Street. By 1900, he was running a gambling house in the basement of the Capital Hotel. Otto was a printer at the Democrat Printing Company. On May 6, 1906 the Biederstaedts purchased the King Street property from developers of the Cantwell block at Pinckney and Doty Streets, previously the site of annual outdoor tent shows featuring horses and touring vaudeville acts. Designed by Madison architects Claude & Starck, the Majestic has an irregular footprint due to it being in the center of a triangle-shaped block. It became the second vaudeville house in Madison when it opened on Saturday, December 15, 1906. Attendees were met with gray uniformed ushers and free music provided by Charles Nitschke Jr.'s Arion Orchestra. Appearing in the theater's first week were the 4 Luciers (\\"Monarchs of the Musical World\\"), popular singer Flo Adler, an \\"up-to-date sketch\\" by Edith Dembey & Company, comedians Dixon & Fields as German sailors, and the \\"Majestiscope\\"‚Äîlyrics to popular songs projected on a screen for the audience to sing along with. Admission was fifteen cents, with reserved seats being twenty cents and matinees a dime. Promoting itself as Madison's family vaudeville house, the Majestic was immediately popular. Only months after opening contractor John H. Findorff was hired to add a balcony and theater boxes, raising capacity to nearly 500, plus a second ticket window to accommodate the many patrons. Performers were hired through the United Booking Agency and Klaw and Erlanger, and later the Western Vaudeville Managers' Association. Before celebrating their first year the Biederstadt brothers were already seeking to acquire theaters in La Crosse, Winona and Minneapolis, as well as making an offer on Madison's Fuller Opera House. The Biederstaedts took on a partner and incorporated with $50,000 capital as the Majestic Amusement Company. They rented out the Majestic as meeting space, hosting a convention of Wisconsin fire chiefs in 1909. They also began showing their first \\"moving pictures\\" in 1908. Three years later, the Biederstaedts' fortunes had changed. Edward's \\"nervous\\" wife shot herself in the head on the eve of the opening of a competing vaudeville theater, the New Orpheum. He himself would die four months later. The types of performances staged were typical of the vaudeville era, including all manner of singers, dancers and musicians, ethnic comedians, magicians, minstrel shows, hypnotists, Asian acrobats and live animal acts ranging from dogs to seals to lions. Claims have been made over the years that vaudevillians such as Harry Houdini, Al Jolson, W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers performed on the Majestic stage, but there is no evidence of these shows in newspapers during the six years the theater featured live vaudeville, although their appearances have been confirmed at other Madison theaters. = Sherwood and McWilliams' Majestic (1912‚Äì1916) = In July 1912, Jay Sherwood and F. J. McWilliams, operators of Madison's Grand and Fair Play theaters, gained control of the Majestic, renovating and re-opening it as a movie house on September 14. Showing first-run releases from the Universal Film Company, the theater was operated by a succession of managers including William M. Fursman, Hugh Flannery, Archie M. Cox, and George B. Thompson. In 1915, Wisconsin doctors were criticized for hiring a scantily clad dancer from the Majestic as entertainment for their convention. = Fischer's Majestic (1916‚Äì1920s) = A 1924 newspaper ad promoting the Majestic Players featuring Melvyn Hesselberg (Melvyn Douglas) and Ralph Bellamy. In 1916, owner R. M. Power sold the Majestic to Frank W. Fischer of Chicago. Facing competition from Madison's newer movie houses, Fischer renovated the theater by switching from coal to oil heating, installing a new ventilation system and moving the projectionist booth to the top of the balcony. He also added new lighting effects and an electric Bartolo organ for $7000, later replacing it a year later with a much larger model for a reported $46,000. He also employed \\"mulatto girls in neat costumes\\" as ushers. He remodeled the theater yet again in 1923. On April 29, 1916 Fischer pioneered Madison's first kiddie matinees. Incorporating as Fischer Paramount Theaters, he left operation of the Majestic to various managers (such as T. H. Luneman, Louis St. Pierre, Richard Siebert, Walter Nealand, and Tom Norman) while building a circuit of show palaces, including Madison's Parkway and Madison theaters in addition to ten other houses in Wisconsin and Illinois. In April 1921, Fischer was applauded for presenting the Cosmopolitan picture The Inside of the Cup after it was lambasted in a Chicago Tribune editorial and had been refused as \\"undesirable\\" by A. P. Desormeaux, manager of Madison's Strand Theater. The film was criticized for portraying business men and the clergy preying upon the poor. Fischer was praised after screening the film for a select group of state lawmakers and society women. In 1924, a Madison policewoman sought to halt the Majestic from presenting Bell's Hawaiian Revue, declaring the act \\"detrimental to public morals\\" due to the brevity of the hula costumes. The police chief declined to issue an injunction, while the theater was filled with capacity crowds. In 1924, the Majestic staged several months of successful comic plays performed by the Majestic Players, a stock company of local actors that included future Hollywood film stars Ralph Bellamy, Edmond O'Brien and Melvyn Hesselberg, who later changed his name to Melvyn Douglas. In 1927, the Majestic dropped its weekday shows, restoring them with added amateur nights the next year. In the late 1920s the theater building was bought by S. M. Kernan, a commercial fisherman who held the city contract to clear the lakes of carp. The Majestic was managed by Edmund H. Michalson, who with his father Torger S. Michalson owned the Orton and Palace Theaters on Madison's east side. After the advent of talkies, Edmund defended the continued showing of silent films by pointing out that many people are hard of hearing. Following the stock market crash of 1929, F. J. McWilliams was appointed trustee for the creditors of the Fischer theaters in Madison and oversaw the dissolution of the chain. In April 1930, Michalson was threatened with revocation of the theater's license by Mayor Albert G. Schmedeman for showing a movie without first getting approval from Madison's film censorship committee. The feature in question was No More Children, a film that advocated birth control. Michalson's attorney (and future Wisconsin congressman) Harry Sauthoff criticized the body for lax supervision and for allowing \\"hotter\\" films be shown in other theaters. After screening No More Children for the committee, Michalson was given a letter of reprimand. = Desormeaux's Majestic (1930‚Äì1943) = In November 1930, S. M. Kernan leased the theater for $100,000 with an option to buy to Arthur P. Desormeaux, who had become the manager of the Eastwood Theater on Madison's east side. Originally a film distributor, Desormeaux had been the manager of the Strand Theater since 1918. He closed the Majestic for many weeks while he had the interior remodeled and outfitted for talking pictures. He planned on renaming the house the State Theater, but later dismissed the idea. That same year Desormeaux was placed on the \\"unfair\\" list by Local 251 of I.A.T.S.E. due to his refusal to employ union labor at the Majestic and for refusing to bargain with union members at the Eastwood. Desormeaux also acquired other theaters in Mineral Point and Mount Horeb, but they did not prove lucrative. Following the downtown openings of the New Orpheum and Capitol theaters, the Majestic succeeded as a second-run theater, known for its kiddie matinees of Wild West \\"shoot 'em ups\\" and adventure serials. In the early 1930s the theater lost its contract as a second-run house to the Strand, forcing Desormeaux to boost his advertising to compete with the newer houses. During a hearing concerning the oversale of bonds invested in the Orpheum, Strand and Parkway theaters, Desormeaux proposed to manage those houses plus the Majestic to pay off the bondholders, but nothing came of his plan. As World War II began, Desormeaux strengthened the Majestic's ties to the community through charitable actions such as offering free passes to old age pensioners and donating a day's box office receipts to the USO. In 1942, he helped manage the local collection of scrap metal for the war effort, contributing several steam radiators from the theater. He also opened the theater early mornings to accommodate third-shift defense workers. Citing declining health, Desormeaux and his wife sold the Majestic in 1943 to Warner Brothers Theaters of Wisconsin, Inc. Conditions of the sale stipulated that the theater could not be closed for more than thirty days at a time, and included a ban on burlesque or obscene shows. Nevertheless, the theater held Madison's first pin-up girl photo contest a year later. = Warner theater (1943‚Äì1976) = As a Warner house the Majestic was run by a variety of managers including Wayne Berkely, Roland Krause, R. O. Jensen, Robert Tauscher, James McCarthy, Ollie G. Thompson, Dennis Finkler and Marian Aasen. The Majestic was about one third the capacity of the other Warner theater in Madison, the Capitol, and typically screened the Warner studio's lesser films or finished out the runs that opened at the larger theater. After the 1948 Supreme Court anti-trust ruling United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. that declared that studios must separate their film production from their exhibition, Warner Brothers spun off its theater holdings as Stanley-Warner Theaters (later RKO-Stanley- Warner Theaters). In 1956, the theater was once again extensively renovated, and re-opened with the movie musical High Society. The Majestic boasted \\"ultra modern decorative effects\\" with new seats, screen, refreshment stand and improved projection. As the 1960s loomed, the Majestic began to establish itself as the place to see art house and foreign films, with mainstream fare rounding out their bookings. After police heard complaints about a movie trailer that showed \\"objectionable\\" material, the Majestic previewed Ingmar Bergman's The Silence for a group headed by the Madison chief of police, but they declined to censor the film. In 1965, the Majestic finished a 14-week run of My Fair Lady, the longest run for any film in a Madison theater at that time. But as social mores and attitudes began to change during the late 1960s, RKO-Stanley-Warner began booking soft-core \\"skin flicks\\" that were light on art and heavy on nudity. When criticized for doing so, manager Finkler replied that the local audience for family movies had dried up. = Landmark theater (1976‚Äì1992) = In November 1976, real estate broker Dan Nevasier bought the Majestic from RKO-Stanley Warner Theaters of New York for $125,000, adding it to his chain of 20th Century Theaters in Madison. He then leased the house to Parallax (later Landmark) Theatres of Los Angeles, a national chain of repertory cinemas that was founded by several former University of Wisconsin students. Parallax specialized in presenting classic, independent, foreign and cult films by screening a different double feature nearly every night. Drawing from the popularity of the campus film societies, the Majestic promoted its diverse schedule on free poster calendars. On June 3, 1978 it began its first midnight showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which ran there for 21 years. The Majestic's new format was an instant hit with sophisticated film- goers and Madison's counterculture at large. As the city's only art house cinema, it cultivated a fiercely loyal patronage that appreciated the herbal tea, cider and fresh popcorn with real butter for sale at its concessions stand. Midnight shows were often preceded by announcements of coming attractions delivered from the floor by the manager, along with the policy that \\"we don't care what you smoke\\" as long as it was smoked near the ashtray at the top of the balcony stairs. The outdated equipment was dismissed as a concern, with manager Bob Strong saying their loyal patrons \\"come for what's on the screen and not to hear a new sound system.\\" Projectionist Bob Monshein fondly dubbed the non-automated 1939 projectors \\"Neandermation.\\" During a 1983 appearance to benefit Madison Repertory Theatre, film critic Roger Ebert called the Majestic \\"a temple of art and sacred to me.\\" As many of the older classic films became available on video cassette in the early 1980s, the theater switched to contemporary independent films and foreign fare. In 1986, the Majestic faced competition for bookings from the new east-side Barrymore Theatre (formerly the Eastwood), but within a year the Barrymore became a mainstream $2 budget cinema with frequent live concerts. In 1987, Landmark Theaters signed a new six-year lease with 20th Century Theaters. In 1991, the Sam Goldwyn Company acquired Heritage Entertainment Inc., parent company of Landmark Theaters, but the Majestic's art house schedule was not affected. = 20th Century theater (1992‚Äì1999) = Due to the difficulty of turning a profit on a single-screen theater in the age of multiplex cinemas, Landmark Theatres Corp. let its lease expire in September 1992. As owner of the building 20th Century Theaters sought to continue independent films at the Majestic and installed their district manager Jerry Fladen to oversee operations. The city of Madison designated the building a historic landmark in 1995, but its infamously uncomfortable seats and substandard sound did little to encourage attendance. The theater also suffered from its antiquated design, with a tiny lobby and concessions area, plus the only restrooms were in the balcony. Because the auditorium was never designed for movies, the pictures were difficult to keep in focus projected from such a steep angle. Ironically the widening popularity of independent films may have doomed the theater, with the Majestic no longer holding a monopoly on the art house films that were also shown regularly at the multi-screened Hilldale and Westgate Cinemas. As attendance declined, the union projectionists stopped working there so Fladen could save on expenses. In March 1999, Dean Fitzgerald of 20th Century Theaters announced the closing of the Majestic on the imminent sale of the building to a buyer he would not name. When the Majestic closed with its final feature Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels on March 28, 1999, it had been Wisconsin's oldest continually operating theater. = Doane's Majestic (2000‚Äì2002) = The new owner of the building was indoor soccer field developer Richard Fritz, who purchased the Majestic for $248,800. In April 2000 it was announced that local restaurateur Henry Doane would lease the theater and reopen after extensive renovations. Doane had bought the 71-year- old Orpheum Theatre (with the attached Stage Door Theater) a year earlier and installed a restaurant and bar in the lobby, making him the operator of the last three commercial movie screens in downtown Madison. Admitting publicly that he may lose money on the Majestic venture, he confessed to sentimental feelings about the theater and believed it could return to its former art house glory. Fritz and Doane spent $250,000 on a new roof, a new sound system, a larger concession stand and a first-floor restroom. Seating capacity went from 537 to 400 to provide more leg room, and padded bench seats were installed in the balcony. The theater reopened on June 30, 2000 with Hamlet starring Ethan Hawke. The Majestic became one of the venues for the growing Wisconsin Film Festival. But Doane struggled to make a profit in the face of the same competition with the Westgate and Hilldale Theaters for independent film bookings and audiences. The theater stopped showing films on September 1, 2002 as a new buyer was found who planned to turn the movie house into a nightclub. = Club Majestic (2003‚Äì2007) = After his plan to develop an entertainment complex on East Washington Avenue fell through, restaurateur Nick Schiavo purchased the Majestic from Fritz for $718,000, contingent on his ability to secure the site's first liquor license. Schiavo, whose family owned Cafe Continental across the street and had owned local restaurants and bars for generations, planned to convert the theater into a combination music club and banquet facility that retained the ability to screen films. Over $300,000 was spent installing an elevated dance floor, industrial-styled mezzanine and two bars, one of them above the stage. Flashing lights were installed in the ornate gold proscenium arch and the DJ booth was the theater's original art deco concessions stand. With a capacity of 472 making it the second largest dance club in Madison, the new Club Majestic opened in February 2003 with longtime Madison DJ Nick Nice providing the music. During the four years of its operation, Club Majestic garnered negative headlines and criticism, beginning with complaints about its $9 all-you-can-drink specials. By 2004, the club became primarily a hip hop venue, and the weekend crowds of hundreds that spilled out into the street at closing time often resulted in fistfights and smashed windows. In 2005, there were three separate incidents of gunfire, and the next year a stabbing. Madison police responded by blocking off the street to cruising vehicles, and Schiavo (and his brother Jim) implemented ID scanners and metal detectors in addition to hiring their own armed security guards, which police later said contributed to the problem. After Schiavo declared he was not responsible for what happened in the street, neighboring businesses withdrew their support, claiming the club was making their customers feel unsafe. By 2006, Schiavo himself admitted the atmosphere was \\"scary,\\" but blamed insufficient numbers of police officers in an area saturated with bars. Others in the community blamed hip hop music itself, as it was seen as leading to similar violent incidents at other Madison venues. Schiavo defended hip hop as \\"the most popular music around these days\\" and \\"If you say 'I don't like hip hop' you're saying 'I don't like black people.'\\" Despite the Schiavos announcing they planned to sell the Majestic, in September 2006 Madison police attached onerous conditions to the club's liquor license, including lowering the capacity to 200 and requiring one uniformed security guard for every thirty patrons. In a compromise with the city, the club surrendered its performing arts license which had allowed DJs and underage patrons. Live shows were discontinued by the end of the year. Asking for $1.6 million, the Schiavos accepted an offer of $1.35 million for the building in March 2007 and closed the deal three months later. = Gerding and Leslie's Majestic (2007‚Äìpresent) = In 2007, the Majestic was acquired by Matt Gerding of Kansas City and Scott Leslie of Chicago. Gerding had booked shows at the University of Missouri, while Leslie had done the same at the University of Iowa. Leslie had also been keyboardist and tour manager for The Push Stars. Gerding and Leslie met in Los Angeles, where Gerding worked for Creative Artists Agency. Gerding had booked shows at Midwest venues and was familiar with Madison clubs such as Luther's Blues and the High Noon Saloon. Sharing an interest in running a music venue of their own, they re-opened as the Majestic Theatre on September 29, 2007 with a concert by Mandy Moore and Ben Lee. Since then, the Majestic has featured artists of every musical genre, local and international DJs and stand-up comedians. The theater has also hosted vaudeville and burlesque shows, political rallies, \\"Brew & View\\" film nights, live concerts on King Street as well as weddings, church services and other events. Gerding and Leslie's promoting arm, Majestic Live, has booked acts into many other Madison venues as well as outside the city.

Early life and career in serious theatre Jones was born in England in 1810. When he was six, his family emigrated to Boston; the voyage was so harsh that his sister died, a brother went mad, and Jones was blind for six weeks. As a young man he studied elocution with Daniel Webster, spoke at Faneuil Hall and won medals in rhetoric. By 1829 he was performing regularly at the Tremont Theatre in Boston. Thomas S. Hamblin hired him for the 1831-2 season in New York at the Bowery Theatre. He continued to play leading roles in the New York theaters until 1836, when he sailed for England. In England he played in various Shakespeare plays and other roles, to considerable success. By late 1836 he had returned to New York, where he played Hamlet at the National Theater. About 1837 he married actress Melinda Topping, and on July 12, 1839 their daughter Avonia, later a prominent actress herself, was born. Avonia's sister Caroline Emma was older.Connecticut Courant, Supplement, November 2, 1867, p. 171-172 The Joneses moved to Virginia shortly after Avonia's birth; Jones managed the Marshall Theater in Richmond, and had the Avon Theater in Norfolk built. Europe and his returns Jones' behavior became more eccentric. He had always been egotistical, but this became even more marked. He wrote long letters to the newspapers detailing the successes and honors of his European tour. On his return he painted a drop curtain for the Norfolk theater he was managing, and on tour he distributed bills advertising \\"Mr. and Mrs. George Jones/The Greatest Living Actors/With Their Original Drop Curtain/Painted by George Jones Himself\\".The Changing American Theatre: Mainstream and Marginal, Past and Present, Yvonne Shafer, 2002, University of Valencia, p. 20 In 1841 he moved to England, where he lived until 1857. It might have been around this time that he separated from his wife Melinda; they were divorced in 1850, at her request.The Library of Virginia, Research Notes #10, page 2 In England, Jones wrote books and gave orations. He claimed to have been \\"Principal Orator\\" at the Royal Panopticon in London.New York Times, May 26, 1856, \\"Affairs in France\\" And he later claimed that in March 1847 he was made a \\"Knight of the Golden Spur\\" and \\"Count Palatine\\".\\"The Count Joannes: A Vindication of a Much-Maligned Man\\", Walter Armstrong, ABA Journal, May 1950, p. 831 He married Rosetta Maria (or \\"Mary\\") Van der Gucht (b. 1835)Genealogy page listing her birth date in London on May 1, 1854.The Times (London), 4 May 1854 They had a daughter named Eugenie, born Feb. 3, 1855;The Illustrated London News, 10 February 1855, \\"Births\\", p. 134 she died about a year later. His wife was with him in Paris in 1856,The Courier (Hobart, Tasmania), 6 May 1856, p. 3 but there is no mention of her after that. In December 1858 he journeyed on the steamship Fulton from Havre to New York, arriving in early January 1859.New York Times, January 6, 1859, \\"The Passage of the Fulton: A Note from the Count Joannes\\" By June plans were made for a benefit appearance for Count Joannes (for so he now called himself) on the New York stage, possibly as Hamlet, and this was being reported as a joke - his vanity and assumption of a title had turned many against him.Daily Alta California, July 24, 1859, Our New York Correspondence, New York, June 27, 1859 Massachusetts Now living in Massachusetts, in June 1860 the Count Joannes filed a lawsuit for libel over a letter from a clergyman attempting to dissuade a woman from marrying him. He argued his case himself, and, after two trials, received a substantial sum from him.Reports of cases argued and determined in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Volume 5, Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1863, p. 169Armstrong, p. 831 His new wife's given name was \\"Mary Eliza\\". Count Joannes then commenced a series of libel suits in Massachusetts against various persons whom he claimed impugned his sanity or his good name. After thirteen suits had been filed over several years, in February 1864 the Count was charged with barratry, tried, and convicted. The court discovered it was unable to sentence him because he was not a member of the bar, and suspended his sentence. Nevertheless, the Count and his wife moved back to New York City in March 1864.Armstrong, p. 832 New York The Count announced there that he was seeking students in drama, and also a benefit performance of Hamlet on April 30, 1864. Melinda Jones was to play the Queen. This performance and the reviews in the newspapers occasioned another round of lawsuits. One of the more interesting cases involved a handbill which the Count had circulated, which apparently implied that the Count's daughter Avonia Jones and the actor Edwin Booth would appear at the benefit at the Academy of Music - when actually they were appearing there at other times. The New York Tribune called the claim a fraud, and the Count sued editor Horace Greeley for libel. The trial included testimony by P. T. Barnum, who was called upon to give his opinion of the handbill. The Count lost his case.Armstrong, p. 887 In 1865 he briefly published a weekly newspaper named The New-York Joannes Journal.Google Books entry for New-York Joannes Journal The Count's daughter Avonia died in New York City in 1867. Mary Eliza divorced him in May 1869 in Boston for \\"desertion and lack of support\\".Daily Alta California, May 10, 1869, p. 1 The Count continued to file cases, and actually became a member of the New York Bar. He had few clients, but spent much time attending courts, sometimes rising to interject comments or protest errors in the proceedings. He announced that he had found the murderer of Benjamin Nathan, a certain James Hughes, but a grand jury failed to agree with him.Armstrong, p. 888 On April 29, 1871 the Count played Richard III at the Academy of Music to considerable applause; this was perhaps his last performance that did not draw jeers and catcalls.History of the New York Stage, T. Allston Brown, New York: Dodd, Mead, 1902, Vol. 1, p. 211 From then until close to his death, the Count continued to appear on the stage, in New York and around the nation, to increasing ridicule. By 1878 at a New York performance of Richard III \\"scarcely a word said on the stage was audible, so loud and continuous were the cat-calls, laughter, and sarcastic comments and advice gven by the spectators to the players.\\"Brown, Volume 2, p. 474 In the same year Edward Askew Sothern in The Crushed Tragedian was interpreted in New York as a parody of the Count, and it became a hit; the Count sued to suppress the production, unsuccessfully. In March 1879 the Count appeared on the stage as Dundreary in Our American Cousin, a role Sothern created.Brown, vol. 3, p. 273 Count Joannes' most faithful companion onstage and off in his last years was Lydia Fairbanks, a young student of his who he encouraged to use the stage name \\"Avonia Fairbanks\\". After his death on December 30, 1879, she made sure that he was buried properly, in Maple Grove Cemetery in Queens, New York City. Interactions with the famous The Count's many letters and other interactions with the famous became fodder for the newspapers, particularly after his return to America in 1859. He filed lawsuits against Horace Greeley, Edward Sothern, Massachusetts governor John Albion Andrew,\\"Johannes v. Andrew: New Light on Old Litigation\\", Walter Armstrong, ABA Journal, May 1952, p. 385 writer Francis Henry Underwood, The New York Times, and others. His correspondence with General Robert E. Lee offering him to defend him against charges of treason was reported in the newspapers.Sacramento Daily Union, November 7, 1865, p. 4 He also had correspondence with the Duke of Wellington,Sydney Morning Herald, 11 June 1915, p. 10, \\"Duke of Wellington's Letter\\" Lord Byron's mistress Teresa, Contessa Guiccioli,online listing for letter to Teresa Guiccioli architect Alexander Jackson Davis,Garvan Collection finding aid, University of Pennsylvania actor Edwin ForrestA Monograph on Privately Published Books; a Plea for Bibliomania, Daniel Tredwell, Flatbush, Long Island, 1892, p. 377 and many others.

He died in an apparent suicide in September 2017. For most of his life, he taught at Yonsei University. He was imprisoned for eight months, and discharged from his university for six years, for publishing 'sexually explicit' novels in 1995. His novel, Happy Sara () was deemed obscene by the Supreme Court and is banned for teenagers. He made his literary debut in 1977, releasing six poems on a monthly basis on the recommendation of poet Park Doo-jin. Later in 1989, she created a sensation for her free sex discussion, including poems, roses, novels, and essays. In particular, the 1991 novel, \\" Happy Sarah, \\" has changed his life forever, creating a heated controversy over obscenity in our society. Sarah, a female college student, was arrested in 1992 on charges of producing and distributing obscene materials. His arrest was a classic cultural event that revealed aspects of the times, including freedom of expression and limits, the emergence of liberalism and the conflict of conservatism in the 1990s. He was dismissed from school in 1995 when the Supreme Court confirmed that he was sentenced to two years in prison and suspended execution. He returned to Yonsei University after receiving a special pardon in 1998, but after being disqualified in 2000, he changed his job. He returned to work in 2003 and retired in August 2016.

The station is now used exclusively by line S 2 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn. The entrance building is protected as a monument. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station. History Dietzenbach station was established on 1 December 1898 together with the opening of the Offenbach-Bieber‚ÄìDietzenbach railway, a branch line of the Rodgau Railway (). From the beginning all passenger services on the line started here. Labourers and craftsmen used the line to commute to their jobs in Offenbach am Main and Frankfurt and local farmers benefited from having faster transportation to the markets of the major cities. Traffic to Dietzenbach flourished in the period after the Second World War. In 1959 there were still 25 daily trains to Offenbach, but in 1978 there were only five. On 18 June 1982, passenger services were closed to Dietzenbach; this was followed a few years later by the abandonment of express freight and baggage traffic. The tracks were retained and preserved. From the 2003/2004 timetable, introduced on 14 December 2003, the station, which until then had been called Dietzenbach (Hess), became part of S-Bahn line S 2 (Niedernhausen‚ÄìDietzenbach) of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn. The station had been modified to give barrier-free access for the disabled. The station is now the starting point for trains to Niedernhausen via the Offenbach and Frankfurt city tunnels, H√∂chst and Hofheim. Infrastructure  The station building is a listed building built in 1898 of brick with the roof sloping towards the platform, at the southern end on both sides there is an avant-corps. These are connected by a continuous ridge line and have triangular gables. Connected to it is a flat-roofed freight shed with a covered ramp. The building is now privately owned. The station has a barrier-free \\"home\\" platform next to station building and the single-track line ends to the south at a buffer stop near Max-Planck-Strasse. The other tracks were dismantled during the reconstruction for the S-Bahn. Operations =Rail= The S-Bahn trains run every 30 minutes. During peak hours trains run at 15-minute intervals. =Bus= The municipal bus line OF-57 runs from Dietzenbach station to Dietzenbach Mitte station, occasionally as far as Dietzenbach-Steinberg station. Expansion plans Since the beginning of operations there have been plans to extend the line past Dietzenbach. In 1906 and again after 1913 there was talk of an extension to Messel, but due to the First World War, these plans came to nothing. After the beginning of S-Bahn operations in 2003 there was consideration of extending the railway line and S-Bahn operations to R√∂dermark-Urberach station where it would have connected with the Dreieich Railway (Dreieichbahn), running between Dreieich-Buchschlag and R√∂dermark-Ober Roden station. This project failed because it was found to be not economically justifiable and so Dietzenbach remains the terminus of the line.

Biography Nyi Ageng Serang was born under the name Raden Ajeng Kustiyah Wulaningish Retno Edhi in Serang ( north of Solo), in 1752. Her father was Pangeran Natapraja (also known as Panembahan Serang), a ruler of Serang and Pangeran Mangkubumi's war commander. She was also a descendant of Sunan Kalijaga. The name Nyi Ageng Serang was given to her after her father lived of disease and she took over his position. She helped her father to fight against the Dutch colonial government, which attacked them because her father still maintained troops, in violation of the Treaty of Giyanti. After the battle, she was arrested and taken to Yogyakarta. Then, she was sent back to Serang. At the beginning of Diponegoro War in 1825, 73-year-old Nyi Ageng Serang commanded the force on a stretcher to help Pangeran Diponegoro fighting the Dutch. During the war, she was accompanied by her son-in-law, Raden Mas Pak-pak. She also became a war advisor. She fought in several areas, including Purwodadi, Demak, Semarang, Juwana, Kudus, and Rembang. She was also assigned to defend the area of Prambanan from the Dutch. One of her best-known strategies was the use of lumbu (green taro leaves) for disguise. Her forces attached the lumbu to poles to look like a taro orchard. She stopped fighting after 3 years, although her son-in-law continued fighting. Despite fighting the Dutch, beginning in 1833 they gave her an annuity of 100 gulden per month. She died in Yogyakarta in 1838. Her remains were buried in Beku, Kulon Progo, Yogyakarta. Legacy Nyi Ageng Serang was awarded the title National Heroine of Indonesia through Presidential Decree number 084/TK/1974 on 13 December 1974. One of her grandsons, Raden Mas Soewardi Soerjaningrat, is also a national hero. Her name is used for the building of the Culture and Museum Office () in South Jakarta.

The single was later featured on Tex's \\"live\\" album, Live and Lively a year later in 1968. Recording and release By 1967, Joe Tex had been recording for over a decade but started reaching his commercial peak in the mid-1960s with the releases of R&B; hits such as \\"I Want To (Do Everything For You)\\", \\"A Sweet Woman Like You\\" and \\"Hold What You've Got\\", which became the first song in the Southern soul style to become a top five pop record. The three aforementioned records had also peaked at number-one on the R&B; singles charts. Tex was also known as an energetic live performer whose intense dancing was often compared to the likes of Jackie Wilson and James Brown. Two of his major trademarks, which Tex accused James Brown of stealing from him, was doing microphone stand kicks and adapting a cape, the latter of which Tex poked fun of during a rare joint headlining gig with both musicians, in which he covered Brown's hit \\"Please, Please, Please\\" but in the middle as his emcee dropped the cape on him, Tex yelled \\"please, please, please...get this cape off me!\\" which didn't go over well with Brown, who allegedly later shot at Tex and his entourage at a nightclub after the show. Luckily for Tex and his entourage, no one was injured. In 1967, Tex's producer Buddy Killen decided to record a \\"live show\\" of Tex's, which was actually cut at American Studios. Killen would later include a live audience to give it a feeling of an actual live show. One of the last songs Tex did was a novelty type of song he had composed on the spot titled \\"Skinny Legs and All\\" in which he poked fun at a man who was ignoring a woman he was with who apparently had skinny legs. Tex advised the woman to dump her lover because \\"someone out there will take you, Miss skinny legs and all\\". He later mocked a woman for similarly treating a man with \\"raggedy clothes\\" and advised the guy to do the same thing. Tex would later tell an interviewer in 1972 that he got the inspiration to write the song while in Alabama and noticing a man arguing with his wife who was reportedly skinny and holding two bags of groceries, which frustrated her husband, causing an argument. Joe said he said to himself about what he'd say to the woman, \\"‚ÄòWalk on baby‚Äô. If that man don‚Äôt want you in public someone else will.\\" The song was released in the spring of that year and became a top ten hit on the pop charts, reaching #10 and later going gold. It became Tex's biggest hit until the release of \\"I Gotcha\\" in 1972. During his early years with The Jackson 5, Michael Jackson, who later listed Tex as one of his idols, performed the song and often did it going into audiences and peeking under women's skirts on the behest of his father Joseph.

It is a deep- water fish found in the Atlantic Ocean. Description The roughhead grenadier can reach a length of one metre (yard). The head occupies about one quarter of the total length of the fish, it has a slender body and long tapering tail. There are some bony spiny scutes or scales on the upper side of the head but the lower side is scaleless. The snout is pointed and the small mouth is set far back on the lower side of the head with a short barbel underneath. There are 3 to 5 rows of sharp teeth in the upper jaw and 1 or 2 rows in the lower jaw. The eye is large and bulbous, giving the fish its alternative name of onion-eye grenadier. There are two dorsal fins, the front one having 11 to 13 finrays and the hind one running along the back to the tip of the tail. The anal fin is similarly long and narrow and there is no tailfin. The body is covered in large ridged, spiny scales. The general body colour is grey, darker underneath, with dark fins and dark edges to some of the scales. Distribution The roughhead grenadier is found in the North Atlantic Ocean at depths between and water temperatures below . Its range includes the waters around Greenland and Iceland, and extends in the west from the Bear Seamount, Norfolk Canyon and Georges Bank north to Labrador and the Davis Strait and in the east from Ireland north to the Faeroe Islands, Norway, Spitzbergen and the Barents Sea. Biology The roughhead grenadier feeds on crustaceans and other small invertebrates it finds on the seabed. The diet includes small fish, shrimps, amphipods, polychaete worms, bivalve molluscs, isopods, brittle stars, other echinoderms and comb jellies. The roughhead grenadier is a slow growing fish. The females mature at an age of about 14 years and a length of while males reach maturity at a length of . The potential fecundity of the female is 17,000 to 56,000 eggs. The eggs are laid in batches and spawning takes place at any time of year, with a peak in late winter and early spring. Fishery The roughhead grenadier is landed as a by-catch when fishing for Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus). In a study off the east coast of Greenland, more males were taken by trawling and more females by long line. This seemed to be due to the females being in the depth range while the males predominated at shallower depths.

The match was a rematch of their first controversial fight from a year earlier in Los Angeles, California, United States which ended when Hopkins was unable to continue due to a dislocated shoulder suffered when Dawson lifted Hopkins off the ground with his own shoulder, causing Hopkins to the canvas after a clinch. The fight was originally ruled as a technical knockout victory for Dawson in the second round, but was later changed to a no contest by the California State Athletic Commission and a technical draw by the World Boxing Council. The rematch took place at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA, and was televised on HBO as part of its World Championship Boxing series. The rematch was contested for Hopkins' WBC and The Ring light heavyweight championships, both of which were returned to him after the reversed decision. Undercard The co-featured contest on the HBO card featured a heavyweight bout between Seth Mitchell and Chazz Witherspoon for the vacant NABO heavyweight championship, which was won by Mitchell via a third round technical knockout. Fight information Since neither fighter was able to garner a decision in the previous fight, they entered the contest with the same records they had when they fought the first time. Hopkins' record stood at 52-5-2-1, and counting the first fight he had not lost in his last six fights dating back to his 2008 defeat at the hands of Joe Calzaghe, which cost him The Ring light heavyweight championship he had won from Antonio Tarver. Dawson entered the fight having only been defeated one time, when Jean Pascal beat him for his WBC and International Boxing Organization titles in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2010. Eddie Cotton was the referee for the fight, with Dick Flaherty, Luis Rivera, and Steve Weisfeld as judges. =The bout= In the fourth round of the fight, Hopkins hit the challenger with an accidental headbutt which caused Dawson to begin to bleed from his eye. Later on in that round Dawson again tried to lift Hopkins off the canvas as he had in the previous fight but was unsuccessful. Although Hopkins continued to inflict damage to Dawson's face, Dawson kept hitting Hopkins and won a majority of the rounds. Hopkins went for a knockout victory which he needed later in the fight, but Dawson held him off and lasted the full twelve rounds. =Result= Dawson won a majority decision victory. Flaherty and Weisfeld both saw him as a 117-111 winner while Rivera scored the fight even at 114-114. Hopkins was not pleased with the loss and stormed out of the ring afterward, saying \\"let the public judge for themselves\\" if he won. Dawson called Hopkins a dirty fighter and said that if you could go twelve rounds with him you could go twelve rounds with anyone.

Because the gravitational wave frequency is determined by orbital frequency, the chirp mass also determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational wave signal emitted during a binary's inspiral phase. In gravitational wave data analysis it is easier to measure the chirp mass than the two component masses alone. Definition from component masses A two-body system with component masses m_1 and m_2 has a chirp mass of :\\\\mathcal{M}=\\\\frac{(m_1 m_2)^{3/5}}{(m_1+m_2)^{1/5}} The chirp mass may also be expressed in terms of the total mass of the system M = m_1 + m_2 and other common mass parameters: * the reduced mass \\\\mu = \\\\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}: *: \\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\mu^{3/5} M^{2/5}, * the mass ratio q = m_1/m_2: *: \\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\left[ \\\\frac{q}{(1+q)^2} \\\\right]^{3/5} M, or * the symmetric mass ratio \\\\eta = \\\\frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} = \\\\frac\\\\mu M = \\\\frac{q}{(1+q)^2} = \\\\left( \\\\frac {m_{\\\\mathrm geo}}{M} \\\\right)^2: *: \\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\eta^{3/5} M. *: The symmetric mass ratio reaches its maximum value \\\\eta = \\\\frac 14 when m_1 = m_2, and thus \\\\mathcal{M} = (1/4)^{3/5} M \\\\approx 0.435\\\\,M. * the geometric mean of the component masses m_{geo} = \\\\sqrt{m_1 m_2}: *: \\\\mathcal{M} = m_{\\\\mathrm geo} \\\\left(\\\\frac{m_{\\\\mathrm geo}}{M}\\\\right)^{1/5}, *: If the two component masses are roughly similar, then the latter factor is close to (1/2)^{1/5} = 0.871, so \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\approx 0.871 \\\\, m_{\\\\mathrm geo} . This multiplier decreases for unequal component masses but quite slowly. E.g. for a 3:1 mass ratio it becomes \\\\mathcal{M} = 0.846\\\\,m_{\\\\mathrm geo}, while for a 10:1 mass ratio it is \\\\mathcal{M} = 0.779\\\\,m_{\\\\mathrm geo}. Orbital evolution In general relativity, the phase evolution of a binary orbit can be computed using a post-Newtonian expansion, a perturbative expansion in powers of the orbital velocity v/c. The first order gravitational wave frequency, f, evolution is described by the differential equation :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}f}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}=\\\\frac{96}{5}\\\\pi^{8/3}\\\\left(\\\\frac{G\\\\mathcal{M}}{c^{3}}\\\\right)^{5/3}f^{11/3}, where c and G are the speed of light and Newton's gravitational constant, respectively.

Called \\"Spring Styles\\" by the Preliminary Design staff after the term for ladies' fashion catalogs, they fulfilled an important role in the design of various ship classes from aircraft carriers and battleships to much smaller vessels. the Bureau of Construction and Repair became the Bureau of Ships in 1940 and is known presently as Naval Sea Systems Command. The plans in these books were used in many cases to illustrate potential ship designs for Navy leadership, usually the General Board, of the implications of certain design characteristics and were used to help make decisions regarding them. Sometimes the plans were prepared after approved characteristics had been published to accommodate requests for modifications, which were often sought to make that project smaller and more affordable. Three of these books are currently held in the U.S. National Archives Book 1 includes plans drawn between 1911 and 1925. Book 3 covers 1938-1944; Book 4 covers 1946-1954. No surviving examples of Book 2 are known. Book 1 The first \\"Spring Styles\\" book comprises 216 sheets of U.S. Navy \\"preliminary design\\" plans prepared by C&R; between March 1911 and September 1925. The earliest of these plans were prepared by C&R;'s Scientific and Computing Branch, established in 1911, and by its successor organization, the Preliminary Design Division of the New Design Section, beginning in 1918. They were drawn in almost all cases by career civilian employees of C&R; under the supervision of Navy Construction Corps naval architects and at the direction of the Navy's command leadership. Many drawings from World War I and immediately afterwards were prepared by naval architect James L. Bates, who began work at the New York Navy Yard in 1903 and joined C&R; three years later. Bates served as director of the Technical Division of the Maritime Commission from 1938 to 1946. Alt URL Book 1 is in loose-leaf format. While many of the individual plans employ a standard format sheet , a variety of sizes is included. A number of them, in original ink drawings and blueprint copies, are notated in pencil, apparently from the time they were drawn. Not all the preliminary designs created during this time are included; there are gaps and missing plans. Unfortunately, many preliminary design workbooks for this period were considered no longer essential and consequently destroyed in the mid-1970s. Book 3 Book 3 includes 75 individual sheets of \\"preliminary design\\" plans created between October 1939 and November 1944.

Spain emerged as a European power after it was unified by the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 and then claimed for Christianity at the Siege of Granada in 1492. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw a monumental increase in the production of live theatre as well as in the importance of the arts within Spanish society. Overview Theatre was an accessible art form for all participants in Renaissance Spain, being both highly sponsored by the aristocratic class and highly attended by the lower classes. The volume and variety of Spanish plays during the Golden Age was unprecedented in the history of world theatre, surpassing even the dramatic production of the English Renaissance by a factor of at least four. This volume has been as much a source of criticism as praise for Spanish Golden Age theatre, for emphasizing quantity before quality. A large number of the plays of this period (10,000 to 30,000) are still considered masterpieces today. This prolific production greatly contributed to the accessibility of theatre in Spain. For modern theatre historians, however, it has contributed to the difficulty of researching theatre from this period. The vast majority of plays have remained virtually untouched, in terms of both production and scholarly analysis, since the seventeenth century. Combined with the error prone printing techniques that plagued the publication of Spanish plays, this has vastly undercut the study of Spanish Golden Age theatre. Although a thorough inclusive analysis remains difficult or even impossible, Spanish Golden Age theatre represents an area of active and productive research for theatre historians. Genres Noted for its variety, the theatre of Renaissance Spain was the only in Europe to simultaneously include secular and religious dramas. Additionally, state sponsored drama existed harmoniously alongside popular for-profit theatre, with many theatre artists contributing significantly to both. Stylistically, plays ranged from straight plays to operas and from bawdy comedies to epic tragedies. Spain also introduced its own forms and genres of theatre with the development of the Comedia nueva and the zarzuela. =Religious drama= * Autos sacramentales celebrated the mystery of the Eucharist by mixing the human, supernatural, and allegorical. *They were performed in two or four carros (two-story wagons) in parades around Madrid and other cities as part of the Corpus Christi processions. *They were produced by trade guilds until the mid-sixteenth century when municipal authorities produced them at great expense. *Starting in the 1550s they were performed by professional acting troupes and mixed civic and religious authority. *A special introductory prologue called a Loa sometimes preceded Autos Sacramentales. Each Loa was specific to the play it was performed with and to the audience it was performed for, and were designed to get the audience interested in the play they were about to see. The word Loa means to compliment and garner good will. =Public theatre= Corral de comedias in Almagro *Professional public theatre was established in Spain's major cities during the 1570s. The Corral de la Cruz, built in 1579, was Madrid's first permanent theatre. *Corrales de comedias originated from courtyard performances, and were constructed within rectangular courtyards enclosed by buildings on three sides. The stage was raised with a permanent backdrop, and a patio for standing spectators was placed in the upper levels. *Alojerias were refreshment booths and above them were galleries for more spectators: cazuelas (reserved for women), and aposentos (box seats). Audiences were often lively and unruly. *Corrales were originally licensed to charitable organizations, which used performance to support hospitals and aid the poor. =Theatre at court= *Court performances emerged during the seventeenth century during Philip III's reign (1598‚Äì1621) at Alcazar, the royal palace. *In 1633 Buen Retiro‚Äîa new palace on the outskirts of Madrid‚Äîbecame the center for court entertainment; in 1640 by Italian set designers supervised the establishment of the Coliseo, a permanent outdoor theatre. *Cosimo Lotti (1571‚Äì1643) engineered a special stage above lake waters with a silver chariot drawn across the surface by two large fish, and a mountain was transformed into a palace in Calderon's Love, the Greatest Enchantment (1635). Themes Honor is a major theme in Spanish Golden Age drama. Theatre was used as a metaphor for life, and honor was therefore represented in a number of ways on stage, for example, reputation, and juxtaposed against disillusionment and hypocrisy. Right versus wrong is a common theme in plays from this period and Lope de Vega himself believed that everyone reacts to honor. Honorable (Christian) conduct is enforced by the public and to lose your honor is to live in shame and despair. A large number of plots focus on the fear of lost reputation and on masculine honor based on women's chastity. While women seem to control their men's honor, gender roles are only very conservatively challenged. While poverty is everywhere, the plays are filled with picturesque scenes, glorious churches, and courts. Still, the playwrights of the time throw a bit of cynicism in their work. The stock character of the gracioso (disillusioned clown) survives the stories without even wondering about right and wrong. Playwrights Portrait of Lope de Vega *Lope de Vega (November 25, 1562 ‚Äì August 27, 1635) One of the key figures in the Spanish Golden Century of Baroque literature. His reputation in the world of Spanish literature is second only to that of Miguel de Cervantes, while the sheer volume of his literary output (between 800 and 1800 plays) is unequalled, making him one of the most prolific authors in the history of literature. His most notable play is Fuenteovejuna (1613). *Calder√≥n de la Barca (January 17, 1600 ‚Äì May 25, 1681) During certain periods of his life he was also a soldier and a Roman Catholic priest. Born when the theatre was being defined by Lope de Vega, he developed it further, his work being regarded as the culmination of the Spanish Baroque theatre. As such, he is regarded as one of Spain's foremost dramatists and one of the finest playwrights of world literature. One of his most notable plays is Life is a Dream (1629‚Äì1635). He also wrote about 80 Autos Sacramentales. *Lope de Rueda (1510‚Äì1565) A very versatile writer, he wrote dramas, comedies, farces, and pasos. He was the precursor to what is considered the golden age of Spanish literature. His predecessors wrote mostly for court, but he was able to use his abundance of riotous humour, great knowledge of low life, and a most happy gift of dialogue to create a taste for drama. His works were issued posthumously in 1567 by Timoneda and include Eufemia, Med Ora, Arinelina, and Los Enga√±ados.Nineteen pasos translated into English *Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz (November 12, 1651 ‚Äì April 17, 1695) An important female Mexican self- taught playwright, poet, and nun. While she lived in colonial era Mexico during the time when it was ruled by Spain, she is considered both a Mexican and Spanish Golden Age dramatist. One of her notable works include Loa to the Divine Narcissus. She is also pictured on the 200 pesos bill issued by the Banco de Mexico. *Juan del Encina (July 12, 1468 ‚Äì late 1529 or early 1530) Often called the Founder of Spanish Drama.Slonimsky, Nicolas, ed., Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, seventh edition. London, England: Collier Macmillan Publishers, 1984: 662 One of his notable works is Cancionero (1496), a collection of lyrical and dramatic poems. *Gil Vicente (1465‚Äì1536) Called the Trobadour, he was a Portuguese playwright and poet who acted in and directed his own plays. He worked in Portuguese as much as he worked in Spanish and is thus, with Juan del Encina, considered joint-father of Spanish drama. *Tirso de Molina (March 24, 1579 ‚Äì March 12, 1648) A Baroque dramatist, poet, and Roman Catholic monk. During his lifetime he wrote around four hundred plays, of which only eighty still exist. One of his most famous plays is El Burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra (The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest), the piece in which Don Juan is first presented on the stage.edited by E Cotarelo in the Nueva biblioteca de autores espa√±oles (supplementary to Hartzenbusch's edition) *Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla (October 4, 1607 ‚Äì January 23, 1648) Many of his works were adapted outside of Spain. His main pieces are Del rey abajo ninguno and No hay padre siendo rey, both published in the 1640s. *Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n (c. 1581 - 4 August 1639) Fitzmaurice-Kelly said of Alarc√≥n: \\"There are Spanish dramatists greater than Ruiz de Alarc√≥n: there is none whose work is of such even excellence.\\" Actors and companies After 1603 only licensed companies could work in Spain, and licenses were limited in availability. Unemployed actors joined the compa√±√≠as de la legua (‚Äúcompanies of language‚Äù) and performed in the countryside. Companies could not perform in one place for more than two months annually, and only one company was permitted to perform at that location. In 1615, Madrid assumed control and hired companies made up of actor-managers (autores), actors, and apprentices, subject to government rules. These companies were licensed by the Royal Council and highly paid to perform Autos Sacramentales both in court and at public theatres. Actors generally worked for managers under a 1 to 2-year contract and a typical schedule had actors study their role from 2am to 9am, rehearse until noon, take a break to eat, then perform until 7pm. While women were licensed to perform starting in 1587, this practice remained controversial until 1599, when a royal decree stipulated that only women married to company members could perform. Important performers included Lope de Rueda and later Juan Rana. Costumes Costumes during this time were very similar to Elizabethan or English Renaissance theatre costumes. Actors dressed as lavishly as finances permitted and contracts even had special allowances for costumes. Records show that actors paid anywhere from 1/5 to 1/2 of their salary for one costume and some even petitioned civic officials for extra funds for costumes. Towns gave awards for acting and costumes, showing that the quality of the costumes was quite important to the audience. The government made many rules dictating the specifications of costumes. For example, actors performing in Auto Sacramentales had to wear silk or velvet and women were forbidden to wear strange headdresses, d√©collet√© necklines, or wide-hooped or non-floor length skirts. As well, actors were only allowed to wear one costume per play, unless it was specifically stated in the text. Design elements Three kinds of scenic background were utilized: the facade; the curtains concealing the facade, which were used when the location was not particularly important; and medieval-type mansions, which were sometimes erected on the main stage. As spectacle increased after 1650, painted flats with doors and windows were set into the facade in place of curtains. After a period of time, awnings were rigged over the seating, and, eventually, the addition of a permanent roof made it an indoor theatre. In the 1640s and 1650s set designs of new public and court theatres were supervised by Italian designers. Machines that simulated wind and the sounds of thunder (created with metal sheets or dropping planks of wood), rain (similar to a large rainstick, and a swelling ocean were quite common and delighted theatregoers of this time. Musicians were also commonly used to create moods and important sound effects. Significance Unlike the rest of Europe, Spain had unique theatre traditions. Religious plays continued to be produced and popular into the 1700s, religious and secular theatre thrived side by side, and actors were accepted in church and as worthwhile members of society. As well, Spain pioneered a three-act model for plays instead of the classic five acts, allowed women on stage, and had an organized and efficient system of actor contracts, travel stipends, licenses, and booking. Most importantly, Spanish Golden Age theatre produced wonderful politically and philosophically allegorical plays such as Calderon's Life is a Dream, and Lope de Vega's Fuente Ovejuna, that spoke specifically to the audience of the time. The sources of influence for the emerging national theatre of Spain were as diverse as the theatre that nation produced during the Golden Age. Storytelling traditions originating in Italian Commedia dell'arte and the uniquely Spanish expression of Western Europe's traveling minstrel entertainments contributed a populist influence on the narratives and the music, respectively, of early Spanish theatre. Neo-Aristotelian criticism and liturgical dramas, on the other hand, contributed literary and moralistic perspectives. In turn, Spanish Golden Age theatre has dramatically influenced the theatre of later generations in Europe and throughout the world. Spanish drama had an immediate and significant impact on the contemporary developments in English Renaissance theatre. It has also had a lasting impact on theatre throughout the Spanish speaking world. Currently, a growing number of works are being translated, increasing the reach of Spanish Golden Age theatre and strengthening its reputation among critics and theatre patrons.

Approximately long, it drains Lake Whatcom through Whatcom Falls Park and through the city of Bellingham to Bellingham Bay. It starts at the dam near the fish hatchery in Whatcom Falls Park where the creek goes over many falls, (hence the name) from about to about 80 feet above sea level. It flows across a short plain to downtown Bellingham and over the falls where the first lumber mill that was powered by the falls was built in 1854. When two men, Henry Roeder and Mr. Peabody went looking for a falls to power a sawmill back in the early 1850s, he learned of a creek up north that the Indians called Whatcom. In the local lingo this meant \\"noisy waters\\" by some accounts. The men canoed to Bellingham Bay and found a fairly large creek tumbling over a 35-foot fall and founded their mill. This was the start of the city of Bellingham. The creek has a small fishery, with trout and salmon, but only minors are allowed to fish above the falls. During the fall a large group of people fish below the falls, and large salmon can be spotted jumping the falls. On June 10, 1999, a gasoline pipeline operated by Olympic Pipeline that passes over Whatcom Creek split a seam and dumped about 277,000 gallons into the creek, which then exploded. Before the explosion, an 18-year-old who was fly fishing on the creek was overcome with the noxious fumes and drowned. Minutes after the young man drowned, two 10-year-olds died when the fumes ignited from fireworks they played with. Both boys died from severe burns the following day. After the fire the Olympic pipeline company provided millions of dollars to restore the creek and its surroundings.

Action Saybusch (, ) was the mass expulsion of some 18,000‚Äì20,000 ethnic Poles from the territory of ≈ªywiec County in the area annexed to the German Province of Upper Silesia, conducted by the Wehrmacht and German police during the German occupation of Poland in World War II. The main purpose of the forcible displacement of Polish nationals was to create space for ethnically German colonists from across Eastern Europe, after the annexation of western Poland into the Third Reich in 1939. The Action was part of the Adolf Hitler's plan known as Lebensraum which involved Germanization of all Polish areas west of the territory allocated to the General Government. The name of the Action came from the German name of the city of ≈ªywiec - Saybusch. Displacements of the Poles from ≈ªywiec and surrounding villages and towns was led by the occupation authorities under ' Fritz Arlt, who replaced Bruno M√ºller from RKF. Aktion Saybusch lasted from September to December 1940, with some 3,200 Volksdeutsche brought in Heim ins Reich (Home into the Empire) from Romanian Bukovina. The process of expulsions continued thereafter. In total, between 1940 and 1944, around 50,000 Poles were forcibly removed from the region and replaced with about 4,000 settlers from Eastern Galicia and Volhynia who were given new latifundia. Before the German attack on the Soviet Union, their transfer was agreed upon by both invaders at the Gestapo‚ÄìNKVD Conferences. The expulsions from eastern Silesia were the direct responsibility of the ' Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, who was also responsible for instigating them. Course of the expulsions Women awaiting transport during Action Saybusch, 24 September 1940 In December 1939, the German police conducted a population census in the region. Over 99 percent of the locals declared Polish nationality, much more than in the proper Silesia to the immediate west. Analysis of the census figures set the stage for the mass deportations across Upper Silesia, which was decided in July 1940. Some believe that Polish Jews were not a part of this Aktion. On the other hand, the Holocaust historian Christopher R. Browning wrote that Jews had to have been an integral part of it. The local Germans \\"had not diligently carried out the identification and seizure of Polish activists and intelligentsia and thus were not eager to report the actual number of Jews deported.\\" For example, the Jewish families from the Zab≈Çocie district of ≈ªywiec were transported to a transit ghetto and labour camp in Sucha Beskidzka in the spring of 1941, and in 1942 sent aboard Holocaust trains to Auschwitz. Everything was carefully prepared by the German occupation authorities, with schedules for the Polish train transports, food rations, and a group of Gestapo functionaries who spoke Polish. The cost of the operation estimated at about 300,000 Marks was to be paid by the captives themselves. The Action began simultaneously at different locations on September 22, 1940 at 5 in the morning. The police and army units surrounded Polish settlements and entered individual homes ordering farmers to get out within 20 minutes. Eye-witness Helena Szatanikowa remarked that all instructions came from a warrant printed in Polish. Residents were requested to turn in all money and valuables. They were allowed to take with them only clothing and food, leaving behind everything else including livestock. They were marched and trucked to the so-called transit points in nearby towns of ≈ªywiec, Rajcza, Sucha Beskidzka, and farther away like Ko≈Ñskie and others. Meanwhile, the new Germanic settlers were already waiting at the distribution centers set up in Bogumin and Cieszyn. The Poles were subjected to selection, and separated into those \\"racially valuable\\" (for preferential treatment) and the rest, including women and children. Groups of young men were gathered for slave labor in Germany. According to German law all captives were to be supplied with necessities for 14 days; however, in practice they were stripped of the remnants of their own belongings in the process of luggage and body searches. Polish families carrying allowable possessions board deportation train The assembly points at railway stations held each time about 1,000 Polish people; who were split into groups of 40 in line with already numbered rail cars. Each transport was usually sent separately, first to a railway junction in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (for further selection), and from there, to previously chosen locations across the General Government (Generalgouvernement). Poles were delivered to towns and villages in the vicinity of Bi≈Çgoraj, Wadowice, Radzymin, ≈Åuk√≥w, and to the Lublin and Kielce governorates (see, the Lublin Reservation organized since October 1939), where they were dropped off alone without any help. Moreover, the Germans had warned the local population that the arriving deportees were criminals, thus further worsening their plight. They were met with fear and only reluctant acceptance at their destinations. Many died during transport. Others were forced to beg. The whole displacement action was conducted by the Polizei-Battalion No. 82 (under Kegel) and Battalion No. 83 (under Eugen Seim, stationed in Jele≈õnia) with approximately 500 soldiers as well as numerous SS, RKF and NSDAP functionaries including Katowice Gestapo officers. The settlers Abandoned Polish houses were cleaned and washed by forced laborers, mostly Jewish captives and some remaining Poles, who were later employed by the new farm-owners. Sheds deemed unsanitary were torn down. The department prepared swastika flags and portraits of Hitler to be placed at farms declared ready for occupation by the new Germans. Despite the Nazi propaganda campaign painting a rosy picture of their opulent future, the new hosts were not given the best of lands, which were reserved for the Reichsdeutsche who had served in the Wehrmacht. Many settlers were disappointed with the simple wooden cottages they were told to move into, and poor quality farmland. The Wartheland Gaue officials on their part, lamented the newcomers' cultural backwardness in comparison with most Poles, and their inability to speak proper German. The new settlers were put under permanent police surveillance. Expulsion of the Polish women with children from the ≈ªywiec County Aktion Saybusch officially ended on December 12, 1940, although the last transport (out of the total number of 19) was dispatched as late as January 31, 1941. On top of the 18,000-20,000 deportees sent across the border, some 8,000 Poles employed in local industries were moved away from their homes. It was a pilot project meant to be followed by similar actions, but in March 1941 SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Hans Frank, Governor of General Government, objected to further overcrowding of his district. As a result, from 1942 on, Polish deportees were placed with other farmers in the poorest villages within the same territory of Silesia (Interne Umsiedlung), or sent to one of the new 23 camps called Polenlager, created especially for that purpose. By the end of war, about 50,000 Polish nationals were displaced from ≈ªywiec and the surrounding area, nearly one-third of its population. In Polenlagers, further selections were carried out, including racial abductions of children from their parents, who after verification were sent to Lebensborn centers for Germanization. The displaced Polish farmers who returned to their homes in 1945 often found buildings razed or destroyed and everything else stolen by the settlers escaping the Soviet advance. IPN investigation In the early 1990s, Action Saybusch was investigated by the Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes Against the Polish Nation at the Institute of National Remembrance in Katowice followed by a formal inquiry initiated in 1998 by Senator W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bu≈Çka. After a series of announcements in the press, some 1,000 persons contacted IPN with personally collected data and supplementary materials, revealing the identities of many displaced families. According to Ewa Koj from IPN most living victims had already been interviewed. The investigation was limited by their advancing age and had to be discontinued on legal grounds. However, it was followed by a broad exhibit of documents and photographs collected in the process, and presented in many regional cities and towns including Katowice, ≈ªywiec, Bielsko-Bia≈Ça and others. The Nazi perpetrators of ethnic cleansing had already been sentenced during the Nuremberg trials. The IPN announced that discussing matters of war compensation was not within their mandate, which some living victims found disappointing.

Red was introduced in 2011 by Nenad Rakoƒçeviƒá, and is both an imperative and functional programming language. Its syntax and general usage overlaps that of the interpreted Rebol language. The implementation choices of Red intend to create a full stack programming language: Red can be used for extremely high-level programming (DSLs and GUIs) as well as low-level programming (operating systems and device drivers). Key to the approach is that the language has two parts: Red/System and Red. * Red/System is similar to C, but packaged into a Rebol lexical structure for example, one would write instead of . * Red is a homoiconic language capable of meta-programming, with semantics similar to Rebol's. Red's runtime library is written in Red/System, and uses a hybrid approach: it compiles what it can deduce statically and uses an embedded interpreter otherwise. The project roadmap includes a just-in-time compiler for cases in between, but this has not yet been implemented. Red seeks to remain independent of any other toolchain; it does its own code generation. It is therefore possible to cross- compile Red programs from any platform it supports to any other, via a command-line switch. Both Red and Red/System are distributed as open-source software under the modified BSD license. The runtime library is distributed under the more permissive Boost Software License. As of version 0.6.4 Red includes a garbage collector \\"the Simple GC\\". Red Language architecture schema Introduction Red was introduced in the Netherlands on February 2011 at the Rebol & Boron conference¬´ New Red Programming Language Gets Syllable Backend ¬ª, osnews.com, May 2011. by its author Nenad Rakoƒçeviƒá. In September 2011, the Red programming language was presented to a larger audience during the Software Freedom Day 2011.¬´ Red Programming Language: Red at Software Freedom Day 2011 ¬ª, red-lang.org, September 14, 2011. Rakocevic is a long-time Rebol developer known as the creator of the Cheyenne HTTP server.¬´ What is Cheyenne? ¬ª Last referenced Nov 2017. Features Red's syntax and semantics are very close to those of Rebol. Like Rebol, it strongly supports metaprogramming and domain-specific languages (DSLs) and is therefore a highly efficient tool for dialecting (creating embedded DSLs). Red includes a dialect called Red/System, a C-level language which provides system programming facilities. Red is easy to integrate with other tools and languages as a DLL (libRed) and very lightweight (around 1 MB). It is also able to cross-compile to various platforms (see Cross Compilation section below) and create packages for platforms that require them (e.g., .APK on Android). Red also includes a fully reactive cross-platform GUI system based on an underlying reactive dataflow engine, a 2D drawing dialect comparable to SVG, compile-time and runtime macro support, and more than 40 standard datatypes. Goals The following is the list of Red's Goals as presented on the Software Freedom Day 2011: * Simplicity (\\"An IDE should not be necessary to write code.\\") * Compactness (\\"Being highly expressive maximizes productivity.\\") * Speed (\\"If too slow, it cannot be general-purpose enough.\\") * Be \\"Green\\", Have a Small Footprint (\\"Because resources are not limitless.\\") * Ubiquity (\\"Spread everywhere.\\") * Portability, Write once run everywhere (\\"That‚Äôs the least expected from a programming language.\\") * Flexibility (\\"Not best but good fit for any task!\\") Development Red's development is planned to be done in two phases: # Initial phase: Red and Red/System compilers written in Rebol 2 # Bootstrap phase: Red and Red/System compilers complemented by a Red JIT-compiler, all written in Red Cross compilation Red currently supports the following cross-compilation targets: * MS-DOS: Windows, x86, console (and GUI) applications * Windows: Windows, x86, GUI applications * Linux: Linux, x86 * Linux-ARM: Linux, ARMv5, armel (soft-float) * Raspberry Pi: Linux, ARMv5, armhf (hard-float) * FreeBSD: x86 * Darwin: OS X Intel, console (and GUI) applications * Syllable: Syllable OS, x86 * Android: Android, ARMv5 * Android-x86: Android, x86 (Note: This list will increase with time and should therefore be considered as incomplete.)

Roaring Rapids at Six Flags Magic Mountain. Many guests claim it is the best water ride at the park.  History  Six Flags Astroworld and Intamin AG partnered in 1979 to build the world's first river rapids ride in 1980 called Thunder River. The water ride became so popular at Astroworld that Six Flags debuted two new river rapids in 1981 at Six Flags Magic Mountain and at Six Flags Great Adventure, 1983 at Six Flags Over Texas, and 1984 at Six Flags Great America. The version at Six Flags Over Texas features a dual loading station where boats can be loaded at twice the rate of one loading station. The Magic Mountain version doesn't feature a dual loading station but is built to feature one. The Great America version also doesn't feature a dual loading station but features a turning station where the station moves in a circle with the boat where riders can depart and get on. The Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags Magic Mountain rides operate from spring to the end of Fright Fest in October. The Six Flags Great America ride operates from spring to around Labor Day. At some parks, the ride is transformed into a Fright Fest maze during October. At Six Flags Over Texas the ride is closed during both Fright Fest and Holiday in the park. The ride made an appearance in a Kidsongs episode, Ride the Roller Coaster. Roaring Rapids at Six Flags Over Texas  Ride  Once the twelve riders strap themselves into one of the boats, the boat then leaves the station to the artificial river that is shaped like an oval at Over Texas and Magic Mountain. The twelve riders at Great America's version goes through a unique course rather than in an oval. During all three rides, there are different objects that are in the water that disrupt the flow of the river that creates the rapids. Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags Great America's versions feature waterfalls towards the end as another way to get passengers completely soaked. Once riders go through the full course of the ride, the boat will then reach the lift and be taken back into the station.  Incidents  On March 21, 1999, a 28-year-old woman died at Six Flags Over Texas, and 10 other guests were injured, when the raft they were on overturned in 2‚Äì3 feet of water due to sudden deflation of the air chambers that support the raft. The raft then got caught on an underwater pipe, which provided leverage for the rushing water in the ride to flip the raft over. In a subsequent settlement, Six Flags agreed to pay US$4 million to the victim's family, and the company would join the family in a lawsuit against Canyon Manufacturing Co., the company responsible for parts that were related to the accident.

He was one of the artists who associated with Gauguin at Pont-Aven in Brittany. Biography The son of a wallpaper manufacturer in Mulhouse, Filiger first studied decorative arts before specializing in painting at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris. He exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants in 1889 and 1890. He arrived in Pont-Aven in 1888 and went on to Le Pouldu staying at the Buvette de la Plage where Gauguin was also a guest. Other artists who joined the colony in the late 1880s and early 1890s included Paul S√©rusier, Charles Laval, Meijer de Haan, Armand S√©guin, Henry Moret and √âmile Jourdan. From 1890, he received a monthly payment of 100 francs from the artists' patron Count Antoine de La Rochefoucauld who was thus able to select Filiger's best works for himself while the remainder were exhibited at Le Barc de Boutteville, Le Salon de la Rose + Croix and other Paris galleries. After Gauguin's departure in 1895, the other artists soon dispersed. Filiger made frequent moves in the area. After La Rochefoucauld terminated his monthly allowance, he lived in poverty in Kersul√©, a hamlet near le Pouldu. He became an alcoholic and drugged himself on ether. After a period in hospital in 1905, he spent four years in a little inn in Gouarec. Breaking his ties with friends and family, from 1911 he lived in Arzano. In 1914, his sister paid for his board at a hotel in Tregunc. When the owners moved to Plougastel the following year, he moved with them for the remainder of his life. He died an alcoholic in January 1928 after being hospitalized in Brest. Art Andr√© Breton who bought several of Filiger's works considered him to be a surrealist, not strictly within the Pont-Aven school. Nor did √âmile Bernard see him as a disciple of Gauguin, characterizing him as a mixture of Byzantine and Breton popular art forms. In Pont-Aven he remained a mystic and a recluse. The area provided fertile ground for his mystical imigary. Indeed, his geometric approach and expressionless faces in subjects such as Virgin and Child (1892) show his interest in early Italian painting and the Italian tradition. His landscapes, for example Breton Shore, reflect Gauguin's abstract quality and simplification.\\"Charles Filiger\\", Kilidavid.com. Retrieved 5 May 2012.

Electoral history Candidates Sir Stuart Samuel had been Liberal MP for the seat since 1900 and the seat had been Liberal since it was created in 1885. He was opposed by Edgar Browne, who had been his Unionist opponent in December 1910. Campaign =Votes for women= The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, following the adoption of their new policy to not support Liberal candidates, chose not to support either candidate and instead opened a local office from which to carry out propaganda work. The smaller Women's Freedom League, a breakaway group from the Women's Social and Political Union who favoured direct action but opposed violence, also set up a local campaign office. However, the WFL's position on by-elections was specifically anti-government, so they campaigned against the return of the Liberal candidate Samuel and thus by definition in support of his Unionist opponent, Browne.Standard, 22 April 1913 Result Stuart Samuel Aftermath Samuel retired from politics in 1916 and the Liberals held the resulting by-election unopposed.

It is the catchment area for the Waiapu River and its tributaries, and covers . The Raukumara Range forms the western side of the valley, with Mount Hikurangi in the central west. The towns of Ruatoria and Tikitiki are in the north-east of the valley. The vast majority of the catchment area lies within the Waiapu and Matakaoa wards of the Gisborne District Council, with the southernmost area in the Waikohu and Uawa wards. Some of the most Western points fall within the Coast Ward of the Opotiki District Council in the Bay of Plenty Region. The area is of immense cultural, spiritual, economic, and traditional significance to the local iwi, NgƒÅti Porou, and in 2002 approximately 90% of its 2,000 inhabitants were MƒÅori. Geography Waiapu Valley is sparsely inhabited, with a population density in 2002 of approximately ‚Äî less than 8% of the national average at the time (approximately 14.71/km2 or 38.09/sq mi). The population of the valley is centred in Ruatoria, though the area contains a large number of small settlements. In the 2006 census, Ruatoria had a population of 756 ‚Äî down 9.7% since 2001, and 94.8% of its population were MƒÅori, with 46% of the population able to speak te reo MƒÅori. The second largest town, Tikitiki, is the easternmost point on the New Zealand state highway network. The western border of the valley is the Raukumara Range, and has a relief ranging from . Moving east, the middle and lower parts of the valley are hilly, with a relief of , and the eastern side is made of lower sets of terraces and floodplains just above sea level. Mount HikurangiThere are many large mountains in the Raukumara Range on the west of the valley, the most prominent of which is Mount Hikurangi, on a spur of the Raukumura Range inland from Ruatoria. At above sea level, it is the highest non-volcanic peak in the North Island. Other summits in the area include Whanokao (), Aorangi (), Wharekia () and Taitai (). Together, these mountains provide what Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand calls an \\"awe-inspiring vista\\". The valley receives a high level of rainfall ‚Äî from per year at the coast, to more than per year in the Raukumura Range. This water drains into a large number of streams and rivers, which flow to Waiapu River, the main stem in the north-east of the valley. The Waiapu River flows north-east from the joining of the Mata River and the Tapuaeroa River near Ruatoria, and reaches the Pacific Ocean near Rangitukia. Other tributaries in the valley include the Mangaoporo, Poroporo, Wairoa, Maraehara rivers, and the Paoaruku stream. A tributary of the Mata River, the Waitahaia River, is renowned for its brown trout ‚Äî a European species of fish introduced into New Zealand for fishing in the late 1860s. Environmental concerns In 1840, approximately 80% of the Waiapu Valley was native forest, with a rich array of native flora and fauna. There was a small area to the east of the river covered in coastal forest and scrub due to partial clearance and burning. Between 1890 and 1930 there was large-scale clearing, felling and burning of native forests for pastoralism. Floods and heavy rainfall are common to the area, and this, combined with the development, resulted in widespread erosion and large amounts of sediment being deposited in the Waiapu River and its tributaries. This has changed the landscape significantly. Since the late 1960s, much work has been done to repair the area by planting exotic forests in eroding areas, and encouraging the return of native scrub. However, by 2002 the catchment area had few natural habitats remaining. It was 37% pasture, 26% exotic Pinus radiata forest, 21% native forest, and about 12% kƒÅnuka and mƒÅnuka scrub. It was highly degraded and modified, and had extensive and serious erosion problems. About half of the pasture area could be considered erosion-prone and unsustainable. Many of the catchment's rivers were full of sediment, and classed as highly degraded. The Waiapu River had one of the highest sediment yields in the world (20,520 t/km2/year in 2000), more than two and a half times that of the adjacent catchment area of the Waipaoa River. The high level of sediment in Waiapu River means it is undesirable as a source of drinking water, and very little of the river's water is used. Approximately one sixth of the annual sediment flow in all New Zealand river systems is in the Waiapu River, which continues to be one of the most sediment laden rivers in the world. The annual suspended sediment load is 36 million tonnes, and of sediment flows into the sea every second. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this sediment may have adversely affected nearby coastal and marine environments. Gravel deposited by the river onto shingle beaches near its mouth is extracted at approximately 12 different sites, predominantly for use on nearby rural and forestry roads. The water quality of the river's tributaries is often much higher, as they are closer to the native vegetation cover of the Raukumura Range. In lower areas, much of the eroded gravel from the catchment area settles on the riverbed of the Waiapu River, making it rise rapidly. The riverbed rose between 1986 and 2007, and a number of bridges in the valley have had to be raised to accommodate their rising riverbeds. As the riverbed rises, so does the river, which is causing extensive riverbank erosion. The banks eroded at a rate of per year between 1988 and 1997. By the 2003 to 2008 period this rate had doubled, with per year eroding in 2005 and 2006. This erosion threatens the town of Ruatoria, and groynes have been installed in an attempt to divert the river away from the town. MƒÅori history and significance Paepae pƒÅtaka (threshold of a storehouse) in the Waiapu ValleyThe Waiapu Valley, called Te Riu o Waiapu in te reo MƒÅori, lies within the rohe of NgƒÅti Porou, the largest iwi on the East Coast, and second largest in New Zealand. Mount Hikurangi, Waiapu River, and the Waiapu Valley itself are of immense cultural, spiritual, economic, and traditional value to NgƒÅti Porou. Mount Hikurangi is the iwi's most important icon, and in MƒÅori mythology, was the first part of the North Island to emerge when MƒÅui, an ancestor of NgƒÅti Porou, pulled it as a giant fish from the ocean. According to these beliefs, his waka, Nukutaimemeha, became stranded on the mountain, and lies petrified near the mountain's summit. Nine whakairo (carvings) depicting MƒÅui and his whƒÅnau were erected on the mountain to commemorate the millennium in 2000 (photo). Another of NgƒÅti Porou's mythological ancestors, Paikea, is also associated with the mountain. According to myth, Paikea's younger half-brother, Ruatapu, attempted to kill about 70 of his older kin (\\"brothers\\") at sea in Hawaiki to exact revenge on his father for belittling him as a low-born son of a slave. The massacre, called Te Hurip≈´reiata, was survived only by Paikea, who called on the sea gods and ancestors to save him. Paikea travelled to New Zealand on the back of a whale, but Ruatapu sent a great flood to kill the survivors in New Zealand, called Te Tai a Ruatapu. Mt. Hikurangi became a refuge for the people from this deluge. The Waiapu River is also of great significance to NgƒÅti Porou. According to traditional beliefs, they have had an undisturbed relationship with the river since the time of MƒÅui, which serves to unite those who live on either side of it. NgƒÅti Porou believe that taniwha dwell in and protect the river, in turn protecting the valley and its hap≈´. Taniwha believed to be in Waiapu River include Kotuwainuku, Kotuwairangi, Ohinewaiapu, and Ngungurutehorowhatu. MƒÅori settlement of Waiapu Valley was widespread until the 1880s, while in March 1874 there were only 20 PƒÅkehƒÅ living in the area. In 1840, NgƒÅti Porou extensively cultivated the area around the river. The valley was a place where they could live, offering safe refuge during periods of war, and supplies of fresh water and various species of fish. The first MƒÅori church in New Zealand was built on the banks of Waiapu River sometime between 1834 and 1839. The previous decade, Taumata-a-Kura of NgƒÅti Porou had been captured by a NgƒÅpuhi war party, and been made their slave in the Bay of Islands. He escaped several years later, and was protected by the missionaries, who introduced him to Christianity, and taught him to read and write. When he returned to the Waiapu Valley in 1834, he introduced his people to the religion. Richard Taylor's drawing of the church, done after visiting in April 1839, can be viewed here. WhakawhitirƒÅ PƒÅ, in which the church was located, was described to Taylor as the largest in the region. Just prior to 1840, the pƒÅ had approximately 3,000 inhabitants. Many NgƒÅti Porou hap≈´ still live in the valley, which has a large number of marae. In 2002, the valley's population was approximately 90% MƒÅori, and traditional culture is still practised in the area ‚Äî though it has changed significantly in the last 150 years. Since they arrived, the many hap≈´ that live alongside the Waiapu River have been responsible for preserving the mauri (life principle or special nature) of the river, and the hap≈´ of the valley act as kaitiakitanga (guardians) of the river and its tributaries. The techniques the iwi use to catch Kahawai at the mouth of the river are unique to that river, and are considered sacred. According to an affidavit of Hapukuniha Te Huakore Karaka, two taniwha were placed in strategic locations in the river to protect the hap≈´ from invading tribes ‚Äî one near Paoaruku (a locality at ) and one at the Wairoa River (a small creek at ). Karaka said that a bridge was built from Tikitiki to Waiomatatini, to the protest of local MƒÅori who were concerned that it would disturb the taniwha. The night before the bridge was completed, a storm came washing the bridge away ‚Äî the weather till then had been calm. From then, one person would drown in the river nearly every year. If it did not happen one year, two would drown the next. A local tohunga, George Gage (Hori Te Kou-o-rehua Keeti) was approached to help the situation, and after that there were no similar drownings. The deforestation and land development of the area, largely planned and managed by non-Maori groups, have had a huge negative impact on MƒÅori. In December 2010, NgƒÅti Porou signed a settlement deal with the New Zealand Government for various grievances, some of which relate to the Waiapu Valley. The settlement included a million financial redress, and the return of sites culturally significant to the iwi totally approximately . NgƒÅti Porou have a number of whakataukƒ´ or pƒìpeha (sayings or proverbs) relating to Waiapu Valley. These include: * Ko Hikurangi te maunga, Ko Waiapu te awa, Ko NgƒÅti Porou te iwi (Hikurangi the mountain, Waiapu the river, Ngati Porou the people). NgƒÅti Porou's proverb of identity. * Hoake tƒÅua ki Waiapu ki tƒÅtara e maru ana (Let us shelter under the thick matted cloak of Waiapu). * He atua! He tangata! He atua! He tangata! Ho! (Behold, it is divine! It is human! It is divine! It is human! Ah!). Referring to Mt. Hikurangi, this is from the NgƒÅti Porou haka, R≈´aumoko, named after the earthquake god. * Waiapu k≈çkƒÅ huahua (Waiapu of many mothers). Referring to the valley's large population, its many whƒÅnau, and its large number of female leaders. * Waiapu ngau ringa (Waiapu that blisters the hands). Referring to the hard work required to live in the valley. Men with blistered hands were considered good potential husbands. * Kei uta Hikurangi, kei tai Hikurangi, kia titiro iho ki te wai o te pƒÅkirikiri, an≈ç ko ngƒÅ hina o t≈çku ≈´poko (In Hikurangi inland is the place, but at the sea coast of Hikurangi look down at the blue cod soup, indeed white as the hair of my head). Singing the praises of home ‚Äî the white layer of fat on top of the soup showed its high caloric value. 19th-century gold prospecting NB: This section is based on text from available here at The New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. There were several ‚Äúgold rushes‚Äù in the Waiapu Valley in the early days of European settlement. In 1874 about 100 MƒÅori went prospecting on and around Mount Hikurangi. Sir James Hector, who examined the locality, found no signs of gold. In 1875 ‚ÄúScotty‚Äù Siddons, mate of the Beautiful Star, claimed to have met, on the East Coast, a MƒÅori who had a few ounces of gold. He and a mate named Hill found a lot of mundic on the north-west side of the mountain, but only outcrops of limestone on the higher slopes. In 1886 Reupane te Ana, of Makarika, discovered what he fondly imagined was an enormous deposit of gold. With what Joseph Angus Mackay called ‚Äúnoble unselfishness‚Äù, he let all his friends into the secret. Drays, wheelbarrows and receptacles of all kinds were rushed to the scene, and large quantities of the ‚Äúprecious metal‚Äù were removed to a safe place. When it turned out that the metal was only mundic, Reupane became an object of ridicule, and, afterwards, was known as ‚ÄúTommy Poorfellow.‚Äù  Notable residents  The area was home to politician Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata, and Te Moananui-a-Kiwa NgƒÅrimu ‚Äî the second of three MƒÅori to receive a Victoria Cross.

Despite the availability of highly effective contraceptives, about half of the pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Highly effective contraceptives, such as IUD are underused in the United States. Increasing use of highly effective contraceptives could help meet the goal set forward in Healthy People 2020 to decrease unintended pregnancy by 10%. Cost to the user is one factor preventing many US women from using more effective contraceptives. Making contraceptives available without a copay increases use of highly effective methods, reduces unintended pregnancies, and may be instrumental in achieving the Healthy People 2020 goal. Teenage pregnancies are very involved in today's society and because of this the resources that are around for family planning is vital to the survival of these infants. Federally funded programs such as Planned Parenthood are very important in the family planning process of adolescents because of the involvement of doctors, gynecologists, or medicine. These family planning practices also help impact the teenager and the infant because of the availability of healthcare and other resources that may otherwise not be offered. In the United States, contraceptive use saves about $19 billion in direct medical costs each year. Title X of the Public Health Service Act, is a US government program dedicated to providing family planning services for those in need. But funding for Title X as a percentage of total public funding to family planning client services has steadily declined from 44% of total expenditures in 1980 to 12% in 2006. Medicaid has increased from 20% to 71% in the same time.

Development under difficulties NB: This section is derived from text in available here at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. The Waiapu County, which then included the area which became Matakaoa County, was formed in 1890. Its first council comprised: E. H. Henderson, W. Milner, A. H. Wallis, Travers, Connolly and White. At a meeting at Port Awanui on 27 December 1890 Mr. Henderson was elected chairman. In March 1874, there were only 32 European residents on the East Coast above Uawa‚Äî9 males and 3 females in the Te Araroa district, and 13 males and 7 females in Waiapu. By 1878 the number of pƒÅkehƒÅ had risen to 109. The 1906 census showed 858 Europeans and 2,611 Maoris. Previously the native census had been taken on a tribal basis. In 1926 (exclusive of Matakaoa) the figures were: Europeans, 1,809; Maoris, 3,292; and, in 1945: Europeans, 1,641; Maoris, 4,341, plus 3 per cent. representing residents absent on war service. The Guide to Travellers section of the Poverty Bay Almanac for 1884 contained a warning to visitors to Waiapu not to attempt to pass round headlands where there was no track. Mention is made of a track from Waipiro Bay to the hot springs at Te Puia, and of another leading to Makarika. From Tuparoa a track led to the oil springs at Rotokautuku, branching off to Wai-o-matatini. There was also a track from Port Awanui to Wai-o-matatini. In October 1884, the Poverty Bay Independent praised the development work which was being undertaken by Mr. J. N. Williams and Sir George Whitmore. \\"There is already a movement among the dry bones of Tawhiti,\\" it remarked, \\"and, to-day, the district is alive with the voices of labourers.\\" It added: ‚ÄúSmallholders could not possibly make any strides in the work of converting those wilds into pleasant and verdant pastures.‚Äù It was not until 1894 that steps were taken to effect appreciable improvements to the old native track leading north from Tolaga Bay along the Hikuwai River. A contract was then let to D. Malone to form a road wide for a distance of . C. H. McCracken and a mate squared the timber for several 2.4-metre-wide (8 ft) bridges. Manuka was used for the stringers, studs, caps and sills; manuka fascines, bound with wire, for the decking and sheathing; and logs for wheelguards. Some attention was next given to the track leading over the hill into Tokomaru Bay. When the council raised a loan of NZ¬£10,000 for road works in 1901 very considerable improvements were made to the inland route. By February 1902, drays could make the journey from Tolaga Bay to Tokomaru Bay. Floods have, on several occasions, done considerable damage to roads and bridges. The greatest setback was suffered in May 1916, when the overall damage was estimated at ¬£30,000. Both the Tikitiki bridge (opened in February 1914) and the Rotokautuku bridge (then only recently erected) were damaged. The Tikitiki bridge was again extensively damaged in February 1917. A further flood in March 1918, swept away four of the spans, and the site was abandoned. Phenomenal rains at Tokomaru Bay on 21‚Äì22 January 1917, caused the Mangahauini Stream to rise to a record level in a few hours. Part of W. G. Keane's home was undermined, A. N. Wilkins's wool-scouring works was demolished, and two bridges were swept away. At Waima, Edgar A. R. Louis (20 years old), who lived in a tent, was drowned. When Mr. and Mrs. Hanlon had to leave their home the husband took charge of their 18-months-old infant, but it slipped from his grasp when he became entangled in a fence, and was swept out to sea. In the heyday of development on the East Coast shipping was a very important industry. All inward goods and outward produce had to be \\"surfed\\" at Tokomaru Bay, Waipiro Bay, Tuparoa, Port Awanui, Te Araroa and Hicks Bay. In the case of Tolaga Bay small craft could enter the river. Tolaga Bay, Tokomaru Bay, Te Araroa and Hicks Bay were, later, equipped with wharf facilities. \\"Ghost\\" townships NB: This section is derived from text in available here at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. The pattern of a large section of the East Coast was completely altered by the diversion of traffic from the coastline to the inland route. For many years Port Awanui had three hotels, a courthouse, police station, post office, three stores and a wool store. Nothing now remains to indicate that it was once a very busy locality. Tuparoa had two hotels, post office, two large stores, boarding-house, stables, smithy, wool store and dumping shed. It, too, has been shorn of most of its former glory. Waipiro Bay (for many years the county headquarters) has lost two of the three large stores which it formerly boasted, besides a wool store, saddler's shop and a smithy. On the other hand, Ruatoria has blossomed from a sparsely- settled junction known as \\"The Cross Roads\\" into a substantial township, and Te Puia (now the county headquarters) has become a popular spa. Tokomaru Harbour Board is the only harbour board in New Zealand that has never levied a harbour rate. In 1911 it built a wharf at a cost of ¬£10,000, and, in 1914, made substantial improvements. [A jetty had been built at Te Ariuri in 1906. Mr. McCracken (who carried out the work) used large manuka trunks obtained from \\"Mangaroa\\" for piles. A wool store was then erected and a dumping plant installed.] In 1925 some rocks were removed, enabling vessels drawing up to to berth. Two years later the board bought the New Zealand Shipping Co.'s brick wool sheds, etc., for ¬£13,000. A new wharf and approach were built in 1940 at a cost of ¬£28,300. The port's busiest years were from 1913 to 1916, when 400 vessels (aggregate tonnage, about 400,000) were handled annually. As in the case of other small ports, it suffered a heavy decline in business when‚Äîduring the Second World War‚Äîit was excluded from the itineraries of Home vessels. Harbour Board Chairmen: K. S. Williams, 1910‚Äì19; G. Kirk, 1920; A. B. Williams, 1921‚Äì23; A. W. Kirk, 1924‚Äì26; F. J. Williams, 1927‚Äì30; H. H. Fairlie, 1931; J. Busby, 1932‚Äì33; D. W. W. Williams, 1934; J.

McCallum, harbourmaster, 1948‚Äì. A severe outbreak of typhoid fever, which necessitated the establishment of a temporary camp at Ruatoria, led to the erection of a small hospital in 1907 at Te Puia. In 1949 a 24-bed \\"T.B.\\" block, an X-ray block, a new nurses' home and a new kitchen were added at a cost of ¬£57,210. At Tokomaru Bay a small maternity home was opened, but, subsequently, Mr. and Mrs. A. B. Williams made a gift of a fine dwelling at Waipiro Bay for that purpose. In 1948 they presented a modern ambulance to the hospital. The gravest menace that has to be fought by the Health Department and the hospital authorities is tuberculosis among the Maoris. X-ray examinations have been carried out extensively. In 1948 there were two district nurses at Ruatoria and one each at Tolaga Bay, Tokomaru Bay, Tikitiki and Te Araroa. County Chairmen: E. H.

From 1890 to 1893 the county offices were at Tuparoa, from 1893 to 1930 at Waipiro Bay, and from 1930 at Te Puia. Rates collected for 1890‚Äì91 totalled ¬£513; in 1946‚Äì47 the aggregate was ¬£34,070. As at 31 March 1947, the county debt (apart from Harbour Board loans) stood at ¬£57,130, with maturity dates ranging up to 1966. The gross capital value of the county in 1946 was ¬£2,667,971. Gold rushes NB: This section is derived from text in available here at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. There were several ‚Äúgold rushes\\" in the Waiapu in the early days. In 1874 about 100 natives went prospecting on and around Mount Hikurangi. Sir James Hector, who examined the locality, found no signs of gold. In 1875 \\"Scotty\\" Siddons, mate of the Beautiful Star, claimed to have met, on the East Coast, a native who had a few ounces of gold. He and a mate named Hill found a lot of mundic on the north- west side of the mountain, but only outcrops of limestone on the higher slopes. In 1886 Reupane te Ana, of Makarika, discovered what he fondly imagined was an enormous deposit of gold. With noble unselfishness he let all his friends into the secret. Drays, wheelbarrows and receptacles of all kinds were rushed to the scene, and large quantities of the \\"precious metal\\" were removed to a safe place. When it turned out that the metal was only mundic, Reupane became an object of ridicule, and, afterwards, was known as \\"Tommy Poorfellow.‚Äù Biographical information NB: This section is derived from text in available here at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. Edward Hannam Henderson (born at Worth, Kent, in 1852) came out to New Zealand in 1875. He learned sheepfarming in Hawke's Bay under Colonel Herrick and Sir G. Whitmore. In 1880, in conjunction with Swindley and Co., he bought a run in the Bay of Plenty. He moved to the East Coast in 1882, and, with W. G. Stainton, took up Matakaoa run. He had three brothers‚Äîall admirals‚ÄîSir John Henderson, Sir Reginald Henderson (who planned the first Australian Navy) and Sir William Henderson. Arthur William Kirk (born at Makaraka in 1874) was the eldest son of Enoch Kirk, one of the pioneers of Tolaga Bay. With his brother George he engaged in storekeeping at Tuparoa for a number of years. Then he took up land in the Ruatoria district. He served as chairman of Waiapu County Council, Waiapu Hospital Board and Tokomaru Bay Harbour Board. He died on 27 February 1947. Arthur Henry Wallis (born at Bexhill, England, in 1851) came out to Hawke's Bay in 1868. He was a cadet on William Nelson's station and, then, under J. N. Williams. In 1883 Mr. Williams appointed him manager of Waipiro station, which was then in heavy bush and fern. Under his guidance much of the property was completely transformed. He was the only justice of the peace for miles around, carried out the duties of lay reader, and, when an accident occurred, was called upon to administer first aid. He represented Waiapu Riding on Cook County, and assisted to promote Waiapu County. In March 1901, he took over Onetohunga and Horehore on his own account. He served, for several terms, on Gisborne Harbour Board, and became prominent in social, business and sporting circles in Poverty Bay. He died on 12 September 1938. William Busby (born at Bay of Islands in 1841) was the third son of James Busby, the first British Resident for New Zealand. He engaged on survey work in Poverty Bay for some years, and then returned to the Bay of Islands, where he took up sheepfarming. In 1885 he moved to Edenham (Hawke's Bay), and, in 1901, he bought Pauariki, Tokomaru Bay. He died on 25 December 1918. Thomas Sydney Williams (born at the Bay of Islands) was a son of Judge Edward Marsh Williams, of the Native Land Court, and a grandson of Archdeacon Henry Williams. In 1894 he took up the management of Tuparoa run for his uncle (Archdeacon Samuel Williams) and developed methods of stocking and fencing which overcame tauhini scrub, which had become a grave menace to the establishment of pasture on papa hillslopes. Mrs. Williams was a granddaughter of Archdeacon Henry Williams and of James Busby. Cadets and shepherds always received a warm welcome at their home, \\"Kaharau.\\" Mr. Williams died on 25 May 1928, and Mrs. Williams on 29 December 1940. William Oates (born in Durham in 1861) resided at Opotiki for five years before he settled on the East Coast in 1890. For some years he was a working manager on the Tawhiti portion of J. N. Williams's run. He then established a boarding-house, butchery and bakery, and, later, a storekeeping business at Tokomaru Bay. He served on Waiapu County Council, Waiapu Hospital Board and the Tokomaru Bay Harbour Board, was chairman of the Tokomaru Bay School Committee for 30 years, and, for several terms, held a seat on the Hawke's Bay Education Board. In all forms of sport, especially cricket, he took a keen interest, and was regarded as \\"The Father of Sport\\" at Tokomaru Bay. He died on 10 January 1930. William O'Ryan (born in 1852) was trained as a surveyor and engineer. In addition to practising his profession in Poverty Bay, he also took up bridge building contracts. In 1886, he built the wooden approach to the Gisborne breakwater. For 16 years he was engineer to Waiapu County, and, during much of that time, he was also county clerk. A good deal of the road and bridge work carried out under his supervision was badly damaged by floods between 1916 and 1918. He died at Auckland on 2 October 1939. Upon his retirement in 1946, after fifty years' service as a contractor and/or employee of Waiapu County, Charles H, McCracken was presented with a special letter of appreciation and a substantial gratuity.

The project uses QRpedia QR codes to provide multilingual smart phone access to wikipedia articles covering notable subjects in Monmouth, such as places, people, artefacts, flora and fauna. It was formally launched on 19 May 2012, and led to Monmouth being described as the \\"world's first wikipedia town\\". The project was awarded the \\"Excellence in Marketing\\" award at the Monmouthshire Business Awards.  Inception  The idea of Monmouthpedia was conceived in late 2011 by John Cummings, a resident of Monmouth. Cummings attended a TEDx event in Bristol which discussed the QRpedia project in use at Derby Museum and Art Gallery. Cummings founded the project with chair of Wikimedia UK, Roger Bamkin, who co-founded QRpedia. The project was subsequently supported by Monmouthshire County Council, and the council-owned Shire Hall later announced plans to instate a wikipedian-in-Residence and introduce sessions to help visitors with contributions to the project. Monmouthpedia's initial goal was to have 1,000 QR codes by April 2012, with each article having a corresponding ceramic plaque emblazoned with a code. By May, the project's home page reported 712 new and improved articles in 25 different languages. For non- English speakers, where available, articles in other languages are automatically displayed in the language of the user on the basis of the phone's language configuration. At project launch, some 500 articles in other languages were available thanks to the collaboration of editors abroad.\\"Monmouthpedia : la ville Wikip√©dia\\", GNT, 18 May 2012. Retrieved 22 May 2012. In addition to this, the project covers over 250 pre-existing entries on Monmouth-related topics. In the same period, over 1,000 photographs were uploaded. One of the issues that Monmouth faced in making the project a success was that there was poor 3G mobile coverage. To help with this, wireless (Wi-Fi) broadband was provided in the high street and at most QR code plaque locations. Monmouth Library has become the first library in the world to add QR codes to books. Users with smart phones can now instantly find wikipedia articles on the book and its author. Priority has been given to local literature and Welsh titles but more recent acquisitions on the Queen's Jubilee and the Olympics have also been QR coded.\\"Monmouth Library First in the World\\", Monmouthshire Libraries, 21 May 2012.

He described the project as creating \\"a kind of fractal wikipedia\\" likening it to the 2010 film Inception, potentially enabling \\"[a] wikipedia within a wikipedia within a wikipedia.\\" Within days of the launch, the initiative had led to widespread interest. A spokesman for Wikimedia UK reported that the project page had been viewed 10,000 times. Benton also reported there had been inquiries from towns in Norway, England, France, Scotland and Texas, USA. One test of success will however be the project's ability to attract more tourists to the town.Erika Morphy, \\"Tiny Welsh Burg Paints the Town Wiki\\", TechNewsWorld, 21 May 2012.

The line is integrated into the Frankfurt S-Bahn network. It is served by line S 2. History The Offenbach- Bieber‚ÄìDietzenbach line was opened on 1 December 1898, following the opening of the Rodgau Railway in 1896. It was the result of continuing efforts at the local level since about 1870 to open up the area south of Offenbach am Main with a railway, but which was only adopted by the Grand Duchy of Hesse very slowly. So it took until 1888 for the government to finally give its approval and it took another ten years until the first train ran. The first trains were steam hauled; after the Second World War trains were increasingly hauled by diesel locomotives. The importance of the connection lay in the growing commuter traffic from the district of Offenbach, especially for those working in the leather goods industry in Offenbach. On 18 June 1982, passenger services were closed to Dietzenbach. =Reconstruction for S-Bahn operations= The establishment of an S-Bahn operation on the track was considered in the late 1950s. It was not, however, until 23 March 2001 that the line to Dietzenbach began to be reconstructed as a double-track electrified line of the Frankfurt S-Bahn network. A proposed extension of the line to R√∂dermark-Ober Roden via R√∂dermark-Urberach failed as it was found not to be economically justified. The last kilometre between Dietzenbach Mitte and Dietzenbach stations was built as a single track. The last station is near Spessartviertel (Spessart quarter, formerly called Starkenburgring), an area of high-rise residences. As a result of some incidents, the ceramic insulators on the catenary masts on the line near the housing were protected with bullet- proof metal plates. S-Bahn operations began on line S 2 (Niedernhausen‚ÄìDietzenbach) at the beginning of the 2003/2004 timetable on 14 December 2003. The line is operated by DB Regio as part of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn network. After the conversion of the line for S-Bahn operations there remained only one siding on the line; it is in Dietzenbach-Steinberg and is used by a fruit wholesaler.

The cultural properties number more than 8,000 and include ancient Hindu and Buddhist temples, mosques, historic colonial buildings, forts, art galleries, national parks and beaches. A number of the sites are World Heritage Sites. The current regime for the protection and promotion of the cultural properties of Indonesia () is governed by the Act of the Republic of Indonesia No. 5, 1992, concerning Items of Cultural Property. Such measures are to be understood against the background of Section 32 of the 1945 Constitution, according to which \\"The Government develops the National Culture of Indonesia\\". Regulation no. 10 of 1993 prescribes the registration of items of cultural property, which is to be undertaken by the relevant second level administrative area. As of 2008, some 8,232 immovable cultural properties and heritage sites have been identified, the last being those places in which items of cultural property are contained. Legal basis Cultural properties in Indonesia have been protected since at least 1931, when the colonial government of the Dutch East Indies passed Ordinance Number 19 of 1931 regarding Monuments, which was later amended with another ordinance in 1934. Since 1992, cultural properties have been protected under Act of the Republic of Indonesia Number 5 of 1992 regarding Cultural Properties (), which was passed by President Suharto on 21 March. This new law was passed as the old, colonial laws were considered no longer applicable. Article I of the act defines a cultural property as of \\"important value for history, science, and culture\\", being either a man-made object or group of objects, movable (bergerak) or immovable (tidak bergerak), aged at least fifty years which has or have high historical value,; or natural objects with high historical value. Said objects, under Articles IV and V, generally belong to and are under the domain of the national government. However, Article VI allows private ownership under certain conditions. The act then goes on to regulate the search for and discovery of historical objects, as well as their keeping and maintenance. Under Chapter VII of the act, there are several criminal offences related to cultural properties. The intentional damage, theft, relocation, and/or disfigurement of cultural properties, under Article XXVI, is a felony offence punishable by up to ten years in prison and/or a maximum fine of Rp. 100 million (US$ 10,500). Illegal searches for cultural properties, under Article XVII, is a felony offence which can be punished by up to five years in prison and/or a Rp. 50 million (US$ 5,250) fine. Persons who neglect to maintain cultural objects, as required in Article 10 subsection 1, face a criminal misdemanour charge carrying a maximum of one year in prison and a Rp. 10 million (US$ 1,050) fine. Indonesia's cultural properties are managed and studied by their respective provincial authorities known as Balai Pelestarian Cagar Budaya (BPCB). The BPCB does not have an official English translation, and usually remains untranslated when referred to in documents in other languages. Nevertheless, BPCB means \\"Centre for the Conservation of Cultural Properties.\\" Objects As of 2008, some 8,232 immovable cultural properties and heritage sites have been identified, the last being those places in which items considered cultural properties are contained.

Dufour, Dictionnaire topographique du d√©partement de la Loire . Retrieved 16 December 2018. The castle stands on an island in the lake formed by the Villerest dam.  History  The earliest written records of the castle date from 1260. It was built on a rocky platform overlooking the Loire river from a height of 30 metres. The fortress allowed a watch to be kept and tolls to be collected for the County of Forez border. The building suffered floods from the Loire more often than attacks from enemies. In 1290, Girard de La Roche paid homage to the Count of Forez for his house in La Roche. In the 17th century, because of repetitive floods, the castle lost its attraction, resembling more and more a fortified house that became a ruin in later centuries. At the end of the 1900s, an industrialist from Roanne bought the castle and restored it in the Gothic style, intending it as a second home. During the 1930s, the construction project for the Villerest dam by EDF condemned the ch√¢teau to disappear below the water. The structure degraded very quickly and was subject to numerous acts of vandalism. It was finally bought for a symbolic one franc by the commune. During the construction of the dam in 1984, the ch√¢teau was the only building spared by the waters. It is now situated on an island. In 1996, it was entirely restored and the side facing the water was remodelled to permit access throughout the year. The regulation of the waters of the Loire have not fully protected the ch√¢teau; it was affected by floodwater in 2003 and 2008.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Robert Cameron had been Liberal MP for Houghton-le-Spring since 1895. He died on 13 February 1913. Previous results Cameron was elected unopposed in December 1910, however, he was opposed at the election before. Candidates The Liberals chose a Grimsby man, Tom Wing to defend the seat. He was elected at the January 1910 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Grimsby, but lost that seat at the general election in December 1910. The Unionists selected local barrister, Thomas Richardson as their candidate. His father had been Liberal MP for Hartlepool. Labour intervened with an Independent Labour Party member, William House, who was sponsored by the Durham Miners' Association, for whom he had been President since 1900. House stood for the Labour Party in Bishop Auckland at the January and December 1910 general elections. Campaign In the recent past, there had been a good working relationship between the local miners and the local Liberal Association to the point that by 1913, miners still dominated the local Liberal association. Every miners lodge in the constituency was represented at Wing's selection meeting. During the campaign, many miners lodge officials spoke on platforms in support of Wing.Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918 by Duncan Tanner This came as something of a slap in the face to both the Independent Labour Party and the Durham Miners Association who had hoped that the local miners would support their candidate, House. This split in the local miners lodges was good news for the Unionist campaign. They knew that their only hoping of winning was if the Labour candidate took half or the Liberal vote, allowing the Unionists the chance to come through the middle. Result Tom Wing Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the autumn of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. House's parliamentary interests moved on to the Mid Durham constituency, while Richardson never stood again. At the eleventh hour, the Labour party replaced W.P.Richardson as candidate with another local miner Robert Richardson *Lindsley was the endorsed candidate of the Coalition Government.

The cape lies on the territory of the municipality Garz/R√ºgen.  Location  Palmer Ort marks the boundary between the Bay of Greifswald and the sound of Strelasund. On the land side, there is a small coastal defence wood in front of the Palmer Ort. Through it runs a woodland path to the Palmer Ort, part of which is laid out as a nature trail, \\"Know Your World\\" (Erkenne Deine Welt). The nearest settlement is the small hamlet of Grabow, about 1 kilometre to the northeast. At Palmer Ort itself there is a narrow, natural sandy beach which is not often frequented by visitors because of its isolation. Anglers use the beach to fish for pike. In winter ice floes at the Palmer Ort often pile up to form heaps of ice several metres in height.  Palmer Ort in history  In 1372, a ship with 90 pilgrims on board sank off the Palmer Ort in a storm. They were travelling on a pilgrimage to St. Lawrence's Church on Zudar. There is a story that there had been a painting of the Blessed Virgin Mary there, which was said to work miracles, but which disappeared after the disaster.Martin Holz: R√ºgens unbekanntes Land (\\"R√ºgen's unknown land\\"), Berliner Zeitung, 18 February 2005. During the Pomeranian campaign of the Great Northern War, Palmer Ort was the scene of hostilities. An invasion fleet of 500 ships from Prussia, Denmark and Saxony sailed towards Palmer Ort on 11 November 1715. Sweden, to which R√ºgen belonged, gathered its forces in the area of Palmer Ort. The invasion fleet was fired upon from the Zudar peninsula, but no significant losses occurred. The fleet did not actually intend to land at Palmer Ort, which was strongly held by the Swedes, but could not implement its real plan for the landing, due to unfavourable wind conditions. A few days later, however, much of the fleet put off to the northeast in the fog, unnoticed by the Swedes, and landed unscathed at Gro√ü Stresow. One of the Prussian columns there commemorates this landing. Some ships were left in front of Palmer Ort to continue to feign a landing attempt there.  Palmer Ort as a namesake  In 1968 a buoy tender belonging to the East German navy, the Volksmarine, was given the name of Palmer Ort. The town of Stralsund named one of its roads Zum Palmer Ort.

B. Yeats. The poem was written midway through his life as a highly reflective poem which is rooted within the turbulent past. Most notably, the poem provides insight into Yeats' detestation of the middle classes whilst also glorifying figures such as John O'Leary. Poem What need you, being come to sense, But fumble in a greasy till And add the halfpence to the pence And prayer to shivering prayer, until You have dried the marrow from the bone; For men were born to pray and save; Romantic Ireland's dead and gone, It's with O'Leary in the grave. Yet they were of a different kind, The names that stilled your childish play, They have gone about the world like wind, But little time had they to pray For whom the hangman's rope was spun, And what, God help us, could they save? Romantic Ireland's dead and gone, It's with O'Leary in the grave. Was it for this the wild geese spread The grey wing upon every tide; For this that all that blood was shed, For this Edward Fitzgerald died, And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone, All that delirium of the brave? Romantic Ireland's dead and gone, It's with O'Leary in the grave. Yet could we turn the years again, And call those exiles as they were In all their loneliness and pain, You'd cry \`Some woman's yellow hair Has maddened every mother's son': They weighed so lightly what they gave. But let them be, they're dead and gone, They're with O'Leary in the grave.  Style  The use of the strong ABAB rhyme scheme maintains a spiteful and accusatory tone, and unpleasant adjectives such as 'greasy' are very much indicative of this.  Key themes and John O'Leary  The poem focuses on manifesting Yeats' new stance of exploring his political mind and celebrating those whom he believes worth of praise. Notably, in all four of the refrains, Yeats mentions John O'Leary, who was an Irish separatist 'of a different kind'. O'Leary's political stance was much less self-interested than many of his contemporaries, as he instead focused on getting the greatest good for Ireland. It is clear through the poem that Yeats admires this and wishes for a return to the less egotistical and self-driven politics of a bygone era. Yeats does, however, appear to question whether these great historical figures, whom he admired and previously emulated in the style of his earlier work, are comprehensive in their understanding of the world in which they lived. \\"September 1913\\" functions also as an iconic example of Yeats's own fidelity to the literary traditions of the 19th century British Romantic poets. A devoted reader of both William Blake and Percy Shelley, Yeats' repetition of the phrase \\"Romantic Ireland\\" connects the politically motivated ideals of the Romantics \\"to an Irish national landscape.\\"George Bornstein, \\"Yeats and Romanticism,\\" The Cambridge Companion to W.B. Yeats, 27. Edited by Marjorie Howes and John Kelly. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006. The fact that Yeats attaches a second repetition of \\"It's with O'Leary in the grave\\" indicates further the speaker's belief that John O'Leary embodied a nationalism in his political actions that now rests solely within the poem. Indeed, John O'Leary \\"directed Yeats not just to large-mindedness, but to a way of combining Romanticism with Irishness into an original synthesis.\\"George Bornstein, \\"Yeats and Romanticism,\\" 27. In other words, O'Leary's influence on Yeats enables the poet to both inherit the literary legacy of the Romantics while carrying on the nationalistic vision of O'Leary. As a result, the romantic idealism found in Blake and Shelley is now transformed into a fundamentally Irish concept whereas Yeats's deep Irish heritage becomes Romantic in every sense of the word. \\"September 1913\\" thus illustrates that \\"Romantic Ireland is not dead after all; rather, it lives on in the remarkable voice uttering the poem, the voice of O'Leary's greatest disciple, fully of hybridity and passion at once.\\"George Bornstein, \\"Yeats and Romanticism,\\" 28. In a matter of four stanzas, the poem's speaker manages to exist at the confluence of British Romanticism and Irish nationalism. Yeats's endorsement of the Romantic imagination in \\"September 1913\\" is also used to identify several of its flaws that are in need of his revision. Writing at the nexus of the Romantic and Irish traditions \\"enabled him to correct flaws not only of Shelley but also of Blake, who he thought should have been more rooted and less obscure.\\" Now that \\"Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,\\" it can no longer express its will and thus requires Yeats poetic prowess to clarify Ireland's message. Speaking specifically about Irish leaders such as Edward Fitzgerald, Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone, Yeats describes them as brave yet a bit delirious, a classification that treats the poet as far more grounded in his politics than the Irish nationalists who died. Yeats channels the fervor of their idealism and struggle through his words by insisting that his own poem continues the nationalist project initiated by those who came before him. The speaker's voice thus becomes \\"the characteristic note of Yeats's great mature poetry.\\" Hugh Lane bequest Hugh Lane offered his collection of paintings to the Dublin Municipal Corporation. Public reaction was mostly negative on economic and moral grounds. In the end, as Yeats said \\"the mob\\" prevailed. In a note to this poem Yeats wrote that the pictures \\"works by Corot, Degas and Renoir - were compared to the Trojan Horse 'which destroyed a city'. They were dubbed 'indecent' and those who admired the painting were called 'self- seekers, self-advertisers, picture dealers, log-rolling cranks, and faddists'...\\"Adele M dalsimer, \\"By the Irish Political Ballad, Colby Library Quarterly, 12,1 March 1976, p38) http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/1479 Dublin lock-out Yeats wrote this poem following the Dublin lock-out and the Hugh Lane bequest. Robert Emmet, mentioned in the poem, planned for a revolution several times, unsuccessfully. When he was finally successful, he was said to try and stop everything mid-rebellion, because he witnessed a man being pulled from his horse and killed. Considering that Emmet had spent months previously manufacturing explosives and weapons, this sudden drawback at the sight of violence, suggests that he did not fully understand the implications of a revolution. Perhaps Yeats is acknowledging the naivety of some Irish Republican figures like Robert Emmet, and himself, following public violence as a result of attempts at revolution.

Shardlow was a left-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox. He was born at Stone, Staffordshire. Shardlow made his debut in county cricket for Staffordshire in the 1936 Minor Counties Championship against the Lancashire Second XI. Before the start of World War II in 1939, Shardlow made 24 appearances for the county in the Minor Counties Championship. Following World War II, he made a further 115 appearances for Staffordshire in Minor Counties Championship, with his final match coming against Durham in 1957. In his career with Staffordshire, he took 558 wickets. It was the opinion of Sydney Barnes that if Shardlow had accepted several offers he received to qualify for a first-class county, he may well have possessed enough quality to play at Test level for England. It was also after the war that he made his debut in first-class cricket for a combined Minor Counties team against Yorkshire at Lord's. Yorkshire batted first and made 231 all out, during which Shardlow bowled three wicketless overs. Responding in their first-innings, the Minor Counties made 210 all out, with Shardlow ending the innings not out on 24. In Yorkshire's second-innings of 250 all out, he took a single wicket, that of Norman Yardley, to finish with figures of 1/20 from twelve overs. Chasing 272 to win, the Minor Counties could only manage 135 all out in their second- innings, with Shardlow being dismissed for 5 runs by Allan Mason. Yorkshire's margin of victory was 136 runs. The following season he made a second first- class appearance for the Minor Counties against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. Batting first, the Marylebone Cricket Club were dismissed for 127, with Shardlow leading the way with five wickets, taking figures of 5/25 from twenty overs. The Minor Counties responded in their first-innings by making 172 all out, with Shardlow making 16 runs before he was dismissed by Fred Titmus. He went wicketless in the Marylebone Cricket Club second-innings of 229 all out, which left the Minor Counties with a target of 185 for victory. They fell short in their chase, making just 129, with Shardlow being dismissed for a duck during the innings by Francis Appleyard. The Marylebone Cricket Club won the match by 55 runs. Away from cricket he worked as a boat carpenter. He died in hospital at Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, following a long illness on 30 April 1976. His son, Paul, also played Minor counties cricket for Staffordshire. He was also a professional footballer, playing for Northwich Victoria and Stoke City.

Biography Watt travelled widely and sketched many buildings. In 1864 he travelled to Australia, where his sketches were published in nine volumes. Returning to England, he planned to train as an art teacher, but instead became a glove merchant in Manchester. Practice Watt designed some buildings himself, but usually used four architects to execute his plans, namely Walter Aston, John Brooke, Harry S. Fairhurst, and William Longworth. In 1898 Watt bought a tannery on Drury Lane, to the north of the town centre, and with Fairhurst, adapted the buildings into a laundry and cottages. One of Watt's other buildings. the King's Coffee House and Gaskell Memorial Tower, is located in the centre of the town, and his series of more eccentric houses were built 1900‚Äì1907, stretching along Legh Road, to the southeast of the town. Watt lived in one of these, The Round House, until 1913. Appraisal The author of a citation in the National Heritage List for England describes the Knutsford houses as \\"a series of eccentric buildings which are of considerable interest and importance\\" which \\"transformed the townscape of Knutsford\\". The architectural historians Nikolaus Pevsner and Edward Hubbard state that \\"any Royal Fine Art Commission now would veto such monstrous desecration of a small and pleasant country town\\". Yet they accept that younger critics might dub him \\"the Gaud√≠ of England\\". They describe his motifs as a mixture of Classical, Italianate, Byzantine, and \\"Unprecedented\\", and comment on his liking for towers with a jagged outline, domes, and random fenestration. The authors of the later edition of the Buildings of England series refer to \\"his penchant for scrounging bits of demolished buildings and putting them together in novel and exotic-looking ways\\". However they express the opinion that some of his works equate to those of Edgar Wood and Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

It is predicted to stimulate economic growth in the region. The project has several elements but the prime objective is to eradicate the bottleneck in Manchester and allow trains to travel through the city at speed without stopping. The project was announced as the Manchester Hub in 2009. The project's steering partnership involves Network Rail, Deutsche Bahn, First TransPennine Express, Northern Rail, East Midlands Trains, CrossCountry, Freightliner, the Department for Transport, Transport for Greater Manchester and Merseytravel. Services from Liverpool to Leeds and beyond will be diverted from the Liverpool to Manchester line southern route, via Warrington Central and Manchester Piccadilly, to the more direct electrified Liverpool to Manchester northern route, via Newton-le-Willows and Manchester Victoria; this will provide a fast route to and through Manchester. The construction of two through platforms at Manchester Piccadilly will allow 4 more trains per hour through the station. The refurbishment of Manchester Victoria station was completed in October 2015, so it can become an east-west rail interchange and through station between Liverpool and Leeds. Trains from North-East England to Manchester Airport will use the ¬£85 million Ordsall Chord, between Manchester Victoria and Manchester Oxford Road, to access Piccadilly and will continue to the airport without reversing at Piccadilly. The Manchester Hub Study, outlining the project, was released by Network Rail in February 2010. Costs were estimated at ¬£530 million, subsequently reassessed to ¬£560 million. Chancellor George Osborne approved expenditure of ¬£85 million for the Ordsall Chord in his budget on 23 March 2011 and other aspects of the scheme were reviewed to ensure best value. A further ¬£130 million was committed in Osborne's budget of March 2012 and approval for the full scheme was confirmed by the government on 16 July 2012. The first train ran on the chord on 10 December 2017 and the project was completed by 2018.¬£560m Northern Hub rail scheme approved, Insider News North West, 16 July 2012 Support for the scheme has been vociferous from civic and business leaders, due to the high benefit- to-cost ratio, and from politicians, such as George Osborne; but has also been criticised for being incremental and only improving the rail network in Northern England to \\"where it should have been a decade ago\\". The scheme has a benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) of ¬£4 for every ¬£1 invested - double that of Crossrail in London and the proposed High Speed 2 project which have BCRs of ¬£2.10 and ¬£2.30 respectively. The project may be followed by or merged with High Speed 3. In November 2015, Transport for the North (TfN) proposed a four- track trans-Pennine railway line to link with the HS2 line to London, and a new Liverpool-Manchester airport-Manchester railway line also linked to HS2. A feasibility study of the west to east rail line and its branches into HS2 will be published in March 2016. Background Approximately 90% of Arriva Rail North's rolling stock was built in the 1980s, including the unpopular \\"Pacers\\" (pictured). As of 2017, the last investment in new-built rolling stock for Northern was in 1998. The Northern Hub was proposed in February 2010 to resolve problems around Manchester city centre that restricted route capacity and caused delays. *Terminating trains in through platforms at Victoria station removed capacity for through trains. The problem could have been mitigated by an additional terminating platform west of the station but operational efficiencies were achieved by altering route paths to relieve congestion. *Congestion at Piccadilly was caused by trains having to reverse to travel to Manchester Airport and trains between Liverpool and Yorkshire or the East Midlands had to switch lines across the throat of the station blocking all other services. *Freight trains pass through Manchester city centre, unusual for a city centre rail network. Two freight trains per hour pass through Manchester to Trafford Park and no alternative route exists. Freight trains using passenger routes through Manchester was raised in Parliament in 2002. Network Rail concluded that no single intervention would unlock the bottlenecks but that greater efficiency and enhancement to services was possible. A proposal to use Piccadilly primarily for north-south services and Victoria for east-west services was agreed as the most effective course of action. The re-alignment of services commenced in May 2014 when First TransPennine Express services between Liverpool and Newcastle were routed through Manchester Victoria rather than Piccadilly. It is expected most TransPennine Express services will pass through Victoria after the May 2018 timetable change after the opening of the Ordsall Chord in December 2017. Station improvements The partially complete new roof at Manchester Victoria in July 2014 Major stations will be improved to include new platforms, station layout re-configuration and redevelopment. Most improvements will be in Manchester aimed at alleviating bottlenecks that delay passing services and restricts routes. =Manchester= Victoria station will be re-configured as the Northern England hub for east-west rail services. Once voted the worst station in the United Kingdom, it has received a ¬£44 million transformation including a ¬£20 million roof covering the concourse and four platforms. Piccadilly's through platforms, 13 and 14, will be modernised and two through platforms, 15 and 16, will be built over Fairfield Street to alleviate congestion. Oxford Road's platforms will be lengthened and a footbridge will be built. The Grade II listed timber grid-shell roof will be incorporated into the new station design. The surrounding site could be redeveloped with office, residential and leisure space. Salford Crescent station will be redeveloped at a cost of ¬£12 million and further development could occur should extra capacity be required. At Manchester Airport station a new platform will be built creating extra capacity and access for direct services from other cities in Northern England. Construction of the platform began in February 2014. Huyton and Roby stations will have two new tracks through the stations to allow faster trains to pass and provide two additional platforms. Burnley Manchester Road station will receive a ¬£2.3 million upgrade before the reinstatement of a direct rail service to Victoria via the re-opened Todmorden Curve in 2015. Dore and Totley railway station will get a second platform and a footbridge for access. The single track will be doubled. =Leeds= At Leeds Station two platforms will be built at a cost of ¬£13.6 million to alleviate congestion. Infrastructure A diagram showing the Ordsall Chord.

Northern Hub is expected to deliver the following improvements: * 14 trains an hour through Manchester compared with 10 currently * Up to 700 more trains per day with space for 44 million more people to travel by train each year * Two new fast trains per hour between Manchester Victoria and Liverpool Lime Street * Six fast trains an hour at peak times between Leeds and Manchester as opposed to five * New services to Manchester Airport from Bradford via Halifax, and the Calder Valley and from Chester * A 15-minute service to Manchester Airport from Victoria, Oxford Road and Piccadilly * An express service between Liverpool Lime Street and Newcastle via Manchester Victoria and Leeds commenced in May 2014 319363 at Manchester Oxford Road. The Class 319 will provide faster journey times and greater capacity compared with pacer trains. The refurbished Class 319 entered service in May 2015 between Liverpool and Manchester. As part of the Northern Hub scheme; electrification of key lines will enable faster electric trains increasing capacity and lowering journey times. Typically, diesel trains that operated between Manchester and Liverpool such as the Class 142 and Class 156 had a maximum speed limit of . Following electrification, Class 319 trains reach a top speed of with greater acceleration from stations. Network Rail has published target times from Manchester to be achieved after the completion of the Northern Hub projects. * Leeds and Manchester target time: 40 minutes - a reduction of 14 minutes * Bradford and Manchester target time: 50 minutes - a reduction of 10 minutes * Manchester and Sheffield target time: 40 minutes - a reduction of 8 minutes * Chester and Manchester target time: 40 minutes - a reduction of 23 minutes * Liverpool and Manchester target time: 30 minutes - a reduction of 17 minutes. A reduced journey time of 37 minutes was achieved in May 2014 with the introduction of the new 'express' route and the introduction of Class 319 trains in May 2015 reduced journey times between both cities to 30 minutes. * Manchester and Preston target time: 30 minutes - a reduction of 9 minutes * There will be faster journey times to the East Midlands via Sheffield, Chester, Halifax, Hull, Newcastle and the North East Timeline Class 350 were introduced to coincide with Newton-le-Willows to Manchester electrification in 2013. The trains operate on the Edinburgh to Manchester route. Network Rail's original aim was for all schemes - including electrification, station upgrades and track work - to be completed by the end of 2018, though this timescale will not be met for the Transpennine electrification. ;2013 *April - work begins on restoring Manchester Victoria station *30 December - Manchester to West Coast Main Line and Newton-le-Willows electrification complete. New four-carriage Class 350s are introduced, reducing journey times and increasing capacity on the Edinburgh-Manchester Airport route. ;2014 *20 May - a new fast service between Liverpool and Newcastle via Manchester Victoria begins delivering journey time reductions *December - Newton-le-Willows to Liverpool Lime Street and Huyton to Wigan electrification complete - delayed, first services Liverpool to Manchester Airport did not run until March 2015. Four-carriage Class 319s will be introduced increasing capacity between Liverpool and Manchester Airport via Manchester Piccadilly. ;2015 *August - Completion of Manchester Victoria station redevelopment ;2016 *Early 2016 - work begins on building two new platforms at Manchester Piccadilly and re-configuring Manchester Oxford Road (subject to application approval, expected in late 2015) ;2017 *December **Ordsall Chord operational ** Manchester Victoria to Preston electrification complete ** Manchester to Miles Platting area electrification complete (TP phase 1) ;2018 *Preston-Blackpool electrification complete *Platforms 15 and 16 were supposed to be operational at Manchester Piccadilly ;2020 ;2022 *Manchester to Leeds and York electrification scheduled for completion Heritage threat The historic first passenger railway station, Manchester Liverpool Road, a Grade I listed building, is threatened by the plan. After this project is completed, it will no longer be possible to run trains into or out of the station. The Manchester Museum of Science and Industry management objected to the scheme and an inquiry was set up in 2014 to investigate potential damage to the historic structure. Future The Northern Hub may be merged into or superseded by a larger project being called High Speed 3. David Higgins, chairman of the HS2, stated in March 2014 that the Northern Hub scheme is incremental and the benefits of the High Speed 2 will not be fully felt if rail links between Northern cities are not improved. In June 2014, George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer stated his vision to see improved transport links between Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds to increase economic productivity. Osborne's proposals were referred to as 'Crossrail of the North' and 'High Speed 3'. In November 2015 Transport for the North (TfN) proposed a four-track trans-Pennine railway line that would link with the HS2 line to London, and a new Liverpool-Manchester airport-Manchester railway line also linked to HS2. A feasibility study of the west to east rail line and its branches into HS2 will be published in March 2016.

Spectrometer, that had a high resolution (maximum measurable pulse in the field of 20 kGauss was 150 GeV/c) was used to determine the momentum and mass of cosmic particles. Abraham Alikhanov and Artem Alikhanian believed that the spectrum of elementary particles are richer and more varied than it had been thought at that time. (By 1951 the only known hadrons were the proton, neutron and pion, and the only known leptons were electron, muon and neutrino). Experiments with spectrometer lead to the discovery of protons in cosmic rays (Alikhanian et al., 1945) and narrow air showers (Alikhanian, Asatiani, 1945).

Unlike the members of the elected institutions and other appointed institutions in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, who serve in those offices, Hands are considered to have achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion. Baker was among those in the first contingent, appointed 24 December 1951 by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion. Baker was distantly related to Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Before being named a Hand of the Cause At the age of 13 years, her grandmother, a Bah√° º√≠, took her to New York to see  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° who was then on an extended trip to the West. About on her 15th birthday she took official steps to be recognized as a Bah√° º√≠. She went to college at New Jersey State Normal School at Montclair where she graduated in 1918 as a teacher and was employed by the Newark school system. In June 1921 she married Frank Baker who had two children and in 1922 she had an additional daughter and a son in 1923. In 1926 she was first elected to the Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Buffalo NY where they then lived. The family moved to Lima, Ohio in 1927 and in 1928 she was a delegate to the national convention following which she dedicated herself more to the service of the religion. She was first elected to the National Spiritual Assembly in 1937. Baker participated in leadership roles in several initiatives of the Bah√° º√≠s before World War II. Among the two highest priority were undertaking  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s call through the Tablets of the Divine Plan to spread the religion throughout Latin and South America and addressing racism in America. Baker was named chair of the Inter-America Committee of the Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of the US, responsible for many aspects of an initiative of the religion to spread the religion into Latin and South America and in 1939 she was also appointed by the national assembly to the Race Unity Committee along with Louis George Gregory which she chaired from 1941‚Äì44 when she also served on the Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada on which she ultimately served sixteen years. The committee stressed the role of education and culture, gave parents recommendations for educating their children in the spirit of racial equality, and encouraged the study of African American culture. Baker was instrumental, for example, in establishing the College Speakers Bureau for the committee on Race Unity. In 1941-2 she visited 30 colleges - in 1942-3 she visited 50 more. Across four years, through this bureau's work, she spoke to more than 60,000 students in 20 states. From 1937 to 1946 Baker made six trips through Central and South America. Because of her background in speaking to many audiences Baker was regarded as one of the best Bah√° º√≠ speakers in the United States. Baker's daughter, Louise Baker, pioneered to Colombia in earlier 1943. In later in 1943 Dorothy spent a month in Colombia visiting the Bah√° º√≠s and her daughter. Later in 1945 and again early 1947 Baker was one of a number of notable Bah√° º√≠s who traveled through Mexico. Starting in 1946, following World War II, Shoghi Effendi drew up plans for the American (US and Canada) Bah√° º√≠ community to send pioneers to Europe. Delaying her personal Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage, Baker undertook a trip from 1948 across Europe including visiting Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and Portugal (where she again visited her daughter.) See Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Europe. Baker was a representative of the US National Assembly to 1951 convention to elect the regional assembly to oversee the religion across Mexico through Latin America to Panama and the West Indees. During a second trip through Europe and the second in 1951 Baker was appointed as a Hand of the Cause. After being named a Hand of the Cause of God Baker attended the second convention of the regional assembly of Latin America which was held in San Jose, Costa Rica in April 1952 \\\\- her last journey to the region. Death In February 1953 the first inter-continental conference of four designated by Shoghi Effendi took place in Uganda. Baker was on the program along with  ªAl√≠-Akbar Fur√∫tan, Ugo Giachery, Hermann Grossman,  ªAl√≠-Muhammad Varq√°, George Townshend, and Dhikru'llah Khadem giving a wide variety of talks and classes across 7 days. Baker made her Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage just before the conference after delaying it twice in earlier years in order to provide service in her travels. At a follow-up conference for the initiatives in Europe, in Stockholm in August 1953, Baker asked for a Bah√° º√≠ to settle in Andorra and French-born William Danjon Dieudonne volunteered. He left his home in Denmark and arrived in on 7 October 1953 and so was listed as a Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h thereafter. Baker spoke at a variety of events in India extending her stay twice to speak at schools - her last public talk was in Karachi in early 1954. In January 1954 it was announced Baker had died in a plane crash near the island of Elba en route to Rome from Pakistan where she had toured after helping an international conference in India. The plane, BOAC Flight 781, had taken off at 4:30 a.m., Lima time, Sunday, on its way to London, and crashed in the sea about 40 minutes later. She had had plans to continue her trip from Rome to Paris, New York, and from there to a pioneering post with her husband Frank Baker in St. Charles, Grenada, West Indies. Paul Edmond Haney was appointed Hand of the Cause to replace her in service to the religion.

In his compositions he has developed a rhythmic language devoid of regular beat or metre, and he has created a new musical notation to represent his music. Biography Gu√∞mundur Steinn was born in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland in 1982. He studied at the Iceland Academy of the Arts, graduating in 2005, and then at Mills College in Oakland, California, where he gained an M.A. degree with a thesis entitled \\"An Approach to Rhythm\\". His teachers have included Atli Ing√≥lfsson, √ölfar Haraldsson, Hilmar √≥r Arson and Hilmar Jensson in Iceland, and Alvin Curran, Fred Frith and John Bischoff at Mills College. He also attended Karlheinz Stockhausen‚Äôs courses in K√ºrten in 2004, went to the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse in 2008 and has had masterclasses with Helmut Lachenmann, Tristan Murail, Pauline Oliveros and Clarence Barlow. Music Gu√∞mundur Steinn's musical style combines sound patterns without using a rigid rhythmic grid structure or pulse. This approach has led to the development of his animated notation, or , instead of using traditional musical scores. During the performance, the musicians follow specific instructions that move across a computer screen. This rhythmic language and animated notation and the structural methods he uses in composition were the subject of his M.A. thesis in Mills College. As Gu√∞mundur Steinn explains, \\"By intently focusing on small differences, both in rhythm and pitch, the ear gets tuned to a microscopic mode of listening. When things then open up, a new sense of variety is gained.\\" Works have been performed at events in both Scandinavia and the USA, including the Reno Interdisciplinary Arts Festival, Music for People and Thingamajigs, U.N.M.

She was undefeated in five races in 2011 including the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes and was awarded the title of European Champion Two-Year-Old Filly of 2011 at the Cartier Racing Awards. She was the winter favourite for the 2012 1000 Guineas. Background Maybe is a bay filly with a white star bred in Ireland by Epona Bloodstock Ltd at the Croome House Stud in County Limerick. She was sired by The Derby winner Galileo out of the Listed race winner Sumora. As a yearling, Maybe was sent to the Deauville Sales where she was bought for ‚Ç¨340,000 by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne, acting on behalf of the Coolmore organisation. Like most Coolmore horses she was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. For racing purposes Maybe was registered as being owned by Derrick Smith, Mrs John Magnier and Michael Tabor. Racing career =2011: two- year-old season= Maybe made her racecourse debut in a maiden race at Naas on 11 May 2011. Starting at odds of 8/1 she led from the start and won by four and a half lengths from Princess Sinead. In June, Maybe was sent to England to contest the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot in which she was pitted against colts. Ridden by Ryan Moore, she took the lead two furlongs from the finish and recorded an \\"impressive\\" two and a quarter length victory over Fort Bastion. In the Group Three Silver Flash Stakes at Leopardstown in July, Maybe started the 2/7 favourite and won by a neck from La Collina. In this race she was ridden by her trainer's son Joseph O'Brien. On 7 August, Maybe was moved up to Group Two class for the Debutante Stakes at The Curragh. Ridden again by Joseph O'Brien, Maybe took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" from Yellow Rosebud and Lightening Pearl. Three weeks later, Maybe returned to the Curragh for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes. Starting the 8/13 favourite she took the lead two furlongs out and won from Fire Lily and La Collina. In late September, Maybe's form was boosted when Lightening Pearl won the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket. In November, Maybe was named European Champion Two-Year-Old Filly at the Cartier Racing Awards. =2012: three-year-old season= Maybe made her three-year-old debut in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket on 6 May for which she was made 13/8 favourite. The start of the race was delayed after the filly Gray Pearl collapsed in the starting stalls. Maybe finished third to her stable companion Homecoming Queen. In The Oaks a month later, Maybe started as 100/30 second favourite, but was again beaten by a stable companion, finishing fifth to Was. The filly was expected to run in the Pretty Polly Stakes on 1 July, but was withdrawn (along with Was) because of the extremely soft ground. Maybe's next appearance was the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket on 13 July. Racing against older fillies and mares for the first time she finished fifth of the ten runners behind the French-trained four-year-old Giofra. On her only subsequent appearance Maybe finished last of the eight runners in the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown in September. Breeding record After the end of her second season Maybe was retired from racing to become a broodmare for the Coolmore Stud. Her second foal Saxon Warrior (by Deep Impact) won the Racing Post Trophy in 2017 and 2000 Guineas in 2018. Pedigree * Maybe is inbred 3 x 4 to the stallion Northern Dancer, meaning that Northern Dancer appears once in the third generation and once in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

In addition to India, it is also spoken in some parts of the Terai region of Nepal. It belongs to the Eastern Indo-Aryan language family. It is closely related to languages such as Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Maithili and Magahi. Angika is not listed in the 8th schedule of the constitution of India. Nevertheless, Angika language movements have advocated its inclusion, and a submitted request is currently pending with the Government. Angika is written in the Devanagari script; although the Anga Lipi and Kaithi scripts were used historically. Angika shows a regular contrast for animates.  Territory  Angika is mainly spoken in Anga area which includes Munger, Bhagalpur and Banka districts of Bihar and the Santhal Pargana division of Jharkhand. Its speakers number around 15 million people. In addition to the Anga area, it is also spoken in some parts of Purnia district of Bihar. However, in Purnia, it is a minority language as Purnia has a Maithil majority.https://m.aajtak.in/elections/lok-sabha- election-2019/story/purnia-lok-sabha-election-result-2019-live-updates-will- santosh-kumar-win-again-from-this-seat-1085204-2019-05-23 Apart from Bihar and Jharkhand states of India, it is also spoken in the Morang district of Nepalese Terai as a minority language. 1.9% people of Morang returned Angika as their mother tongue during the 2011 Nepal census.2011 Nepal Census, Social Characteristics Tables  Relationship to Maithili  Angika was classified as a dialect of Maithili by George A. Grierson in the Linguistic Survey of India (1903). However, the Angika speakers now assert its status as an independent language. When the proponents of the Maithili language in Bihar demanded use of Maithili-medium primary education in the early 20th century, the Angika speaking people did not support them, and instead favoured Hindi-medium education. In the 1960s and the 1970s, when the Maithili speakers demanded a separate Mithila state, the Angika and Bajjika speakers made counter-demands for recognition of their languages. Maithili proponents believe that the Government of Bihar and the pro-Hindi Bihar Rashtrabhasha Parishad promoted Angika and Bajjika as distinct languages to weaken the Maithili language movement; many of them still consider Angika to be a dialect of Maithili. People from mainly Maithil Brahmins and Karan Kayasthas castes have supported the Maithili movement, while people from various other castes in the Mithila region have projected Angika and Bajjika as their mother tongues, attempting to break away from the Maithili-based regional identity.  Official status  Angika has the status of \\"second state language\\" in the Indian state of Jharkhand since 2018. It shares this status with 15 other languages, including Maithili.

Hetmana Polnego Koronnego Stefana Czarnieckiego w Poznaniu, abbreviated Muzeum Broni Pancernej CSWL (Armoured Warfare Museum) is a large collection of military vehicles, formerly located within Land Forces Training Center in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland. The museum has the largest collection of armoured fighting vehicles in Poland, displaying around 60 vehicles from the First World War, interwar, Second World War and Cold War periods. In 2018, the old museum was closed to visitors; it was re-opened in early 2019 in a new location.  History  The museum was established in 1963, as a small collection of vehicles formerly used by the local military training center. It was located in former barracks in So≈Çacz district. For most of the Communist period, the only vehicles in the museum were those of Soviet (or USSR's satellites) production. After the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, the museum started to acquire non-Soviet exhibits (Western or German) as well. The museum was located inside a single hangar, housing much of its exhibits, although some vehicles were stored outside. The museum's curator is Lt Col Tomasz Ogrodniczuk, who also participates in the restoration efforts and would occasionally drive certain vehicles during the \\"Armoured Parade\\" - from the museum's hangar to the Training Center's parade square. In November 2013 it was announced that by 2015, the museum will be turned into a branch of Land Forces Museum in Bydgoszcz. This offered several advantages, the most important being financial aid from the state, and also that the museum will be open to visitors for all year long.http://www.radiomerkury.pl/informacje/pozostale/czolgi-z-golecina- codziennie.html Ultimately, however, the museum was turned into a branch of Polish Army Museum in Warsaw. In January 2015 it was announced that the museum will be moved to an unused hangar near the ≈Åawica airport by June 2017.http://www.radiomerkury.pl/informacje/pozostale/czolgi-z-golecina-w- nowym-miejscu.html As of 2017, the Museum was no longer accessible, and expected to be reopened in spring 2019, after the restoration of the hangars and relocation of the exhibits is finished. The museum was eventually reopened on 8 October 2019.https://gloswielkopolski.pl/muzeum-broni-pancernej-w- poznaniu-wiemy-kiedy-otwarcie/ar/c1-14442531  Excavations and restorations  In 2008, a German Sturmgesch√ºtz IV assault gun was recovered from the Rgilewka river near Grzegorzew. It was moved to Pozna≈Ñ and by the summer of 2009, it was restored to running condition. As of 2012, it's the only running StuG IV in the world and one of three preserved examples at all (one is also in Poland and second in Latvia) On August 5, 2011 a German Sd.Kfz. 6 artillery tractor was excavated from Warta river near Bia≈Çobrzeg. Exactly one year later, on August 5, 2012, its restoration was officially finished. Thanks to the restoration team's efforts, much of the vehicle is original (only the wooden elements and thinnest metal parts were replaced), though as of 2012, its engine is still being restored and it uses a replacement powerplant. In April 2012 the museum acquired the wreckage of TKS tankette (lower hull only) and first presented it on June 2 of that year. The restoration took two years and was finished in May 2014. In October 2012, renovation of BTR-152 APC was finished. Almost simultaneously, the restoration of IS-2 heavy tank was launched. One month later, T-70 tank was also taken to repair shop. They were finished in June and February 2013, respectively. In late 2012 a Renault FT tank was brought from Afghanistan and initially brought to Pozna≈Ñ and exhibited shortly near the Pozna≈Ñ National Museum and the Bazar Hotel. The tank was to be restored in Pozna≈Ñ with the help of Armoured Warfare Museum, however it was eventually sent to Polish Army Museum in Warsaw and restored by the end of 2013. In June 2013, a Cruiser Tank Mk VIII Centaur Mk I was brought from Portugal. Such tanks were used by Polish Armed Forces in the West during World War II for training. Its restoration began in May 2014. In September 2013, three new vehicles were acquired from Norway - a wreck of Panzer III medium tank, an M47 Patton main battle tank and an M88 Recovery Vehicle. It was the second time when the museum worked together with Norwegian authorities, the first being the acquisition of the TKS tankette. Thanks to the assistance from Polish Army Museum in Warsaw, another wreck was donated to the museum, and the two wrecks were used to complete a single vehicle. In 2014, the T-54 and T-55 tanks were taken to Wroc≈Çaw to take part in the shooting of Bridge of Spies, standing for NVA vehicles in East Berlin. Steven Spielberg and Janusz Kami≈Ñski left their signatures on the latter tank. In June 2015, an M10 Achilles tank destroyer was donated to the museum and is currently under restoration. In September 2016, a Daimler Dingo scout car was donated to the museum from the United States. Such cars were used by the Polish Armed Forces in the West, and after a renovation, it was given the markings of 15th Pozna≈Ñ Uhlan Regiment. In October 2017, the museum acquired a 7.7 cm FK 96 n.A. gun, once exhibited outside of the Czocha Castle, which was severely damaged by elements and tourists. In December of that year, the renovation of the gun was finished, and it was decided it will stay in the museum to prevent further destruction. Around the same time, the museum acquired another artillery piece, a 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer. Since its restoration, it has been exhibited side by side with its dedicated tractor, the Sd.Kfz. 6. In January 2018, the museum acquired three new vehicles: a Jagdpanzer 38(t) Hetzer tank destroyer, an M4A1 Half-Track and a replica of an Austin Putilov armoured car (all three from private owners). All three vehicles are in running condition. In May 2020, a Fox Armoured Car, found in Italian scrapyard by Polish soldiers taking part in Operation Irini, was delivered for restoration. Much like the aforementioned Dingos, such cars were used by the 15th Poznan Uhlans Regiment and one of the aims of the restoration process is to determine whether this particular vehicle was a part of this unit during the war.

After the transfer, it was put on permanent static display inside the museum and the engine was removed.  Visiting the museum  Formerly, because the museum was located inside the military area, it was necessary to pre-arrange the visit by acquiring an entry permit from the CSWL command.http://www.muzeumbronipancernej.pl/pl/kontakt However, during certain events (Child Day in May/June and the CSWL Patron's Day in September/October), visitors could enter it without permits. Since the museum was moved to a new location, no permits are needed, but tickets must be acquired before entry. The museum is open from Tuesday to Saturday, however opening hours might be subject to change without prior warning due to organisational matters (e.g. arrival of new exhibits). =Location and access= The old museum was located on the 86/90 Wojska Polskiego Street, north-west from the city center. The new site is located closer to the ≈Åawica airport, on 4 \\"3 Pu≈Çku Lotniczego\\" Street, close to the intersection with DƒÖbrowskiego Street, with the nearest bus stop being Tatrza≈Ñska.

It generally indicates the recommendation or encouragement through chanted sutras. Solicited donations are usually intended for the establishment of new temples or statues or their renovations. Since the medieval age, Kanjin has come to mean \\"fund raising\\". Kanjin-Hijiri (Saint) Statue of K≈´ya who was traveling as Kanjin Kanjin usually means the solicitation of donations for temple construction or repair. It originally meant the action of monks who encourage the recitation of chanted sutras and who collect donations, thereby spreading Buddhism, but later meant chiefly raising money through fundraisers. In the medieval age, construction of bridges or repairs of roads, and construction of official temples were also beneficiaries of Kanjin. These public works should have been funded by the governing bodies or local officials. However, those who did the job were Kanjins and they carried a scroll of Kanjin or Kanjincho and traveled in many areas of Japan and collected donations at temples or shrines or checkpoints called Sekisho. The money people paid respectively was very small, as in the idiomatic 4-letter phrase Isshi-Hansen which meant a piece of paper and a half sen (one hundredth of yen).Issen-hanshi has been used meaning small money. The work of kanjin was conducted by the monks who were called Kanjin-hijiri (literally \\"Kanjin saint\\") or Kanjin-monk, Kanjin-sh≈çnin; they traveled and preached and received donations in money or rice. They took necessary costs and others were used for the original purposes. The most famous Kanjin monks included Gy≈çki (668 - 749) of the Nara period, K≈´ya (903 - 972) and Engy≈ç (? - 1004- ?) of the Heian period. There were female kanjin called Kanjin-bikuni (priestess), including Seijun (? - 1566) of Rinzai school who devoted herself to the restoration of the Ise Grand Shrine. Formal recognition of priestesses was delayed because the Imperial Household had not recognized them.Risshu (Buddhism) recognized priestesses in the Kamakura era. Popularity The custom of Kanjin became popular in the 12th century and afterwards. The bell of Kimpusen-ji, Nara Prefecture, was founded by the kanjin of Dojaku (?- 1147). The Uji bridge of Kyoto and the Seta-no-Karahashi(Chinese Bridge of Seta), located at the southern end of Lake Biwa, now Shiga Prefecture were maintained by the kanjins in the 12th century. The restoration of Omi-no-Sekiji, a temple, was completed in 1179 by the kanjin of Namua-sh≈çnin.By Honen ?

It is about long Kanjinshoku of T≈çdai-ji Ch≈çgen in replica at Osaka Prefectural Sayamaike Museum. Daibutsu-den in T≈çdai-ji T≈çdai-ji, in Nara, which housed the Japan's largest Daibutsu burned down in 1180. Emperor Go-Shirakawa wanted to reconstruct it. He nominated Ch≈çgen as Daikanjinshoku, the head of kanjin shoku in 1181. Chogen recruited various technicians and collected money. He sent Saigyo Hoshi to the T≈çhoku region to obtain gold. T≈çdai-ji was reconstructed in 1185.The Nandaimon was completed in 1199 and the whole was completed as late as 1289. The post of Daikanjinshoku of T≈çdai-ji continued to Eisai (2nd, 1141‚Äì1215), Gyoyu (3rd, 1163‚Äì1241), Enni (10th), Enkan (24th, 1281‚Äì1358). After years of interruption in the Edo period, Kokei(1648‚Äì1705) maintained the T≈çdai-ji and its Daibutsu. =Summary of the formal Kanjincho document= Ch≈çgen had a letter, which he read aloud, for the donations for the reconstruction of T≈çdai-ji and the Daibutsu). Kanjin at other temples and its decline The post of Kanjin was adopted by other temples. The monks of the Risshu Buddhist sect were favored for this appointment since the Risshu sect was unbiased and favored the fair distribution of money and strengthened relationships with the people. However, over time, the post of Kanjinshoku became a post of rights and interests. For instance, Todai-ji was given a district responsible for its maintenance. The position of Kanjinshoku became degraded since some Kanjin-hijiri negotiated with bakufu for their works. Some pursued this post for self-aggrandizement. Kanjin-bikuni (women) were not allowed in this avocation in the medieval era. Nonetheless, Oguni kabuki women joined to obtain money in exchange for sexual favors. =Kanjin scroll= The original Kanjincho was a scroll on which the purposes or goals of the Kanjin were described. Kanjincho(ÂãßÈÄ≤Â∏≥) is a Japanese kabuki play by Namiki Gohei III based on the Noh play Ataka. It is one of the most popular plays in the modern kabuki repertory. The hero, Benkei, cleverly \\"reads\\" a blank scroll as if it were a scroll of Kanjin for the restoration of Todai-ji. He does this in order to pass the checkpoint of Ataka, with his companion, who is being hunted by his enemies. An act of hero Benkei in Kanjincho after reading a would-be scroll of Kanjincho Special meanings Alternate meanings of \\"Kanjin\\" have evolved over the years: =Kanjin Ship= A Kanjin ship was a ship or boat on which a kanjin preached for donations, in some boats, people of various amusements were on the ship for the same purpose. =Kanjin Heike= Biwa hoshi chanted The Tale of the Heike for the construction or repair of temples. It was said that the whole story needed 90 to 120 hours. =Kanjin Sumo= Sumo had been enjoyed in the Japanese Imperial Household but discontinued in 1174. In the early Edo period, Kanjin Sumo started in order to build temples and shrines, especially in Kyoto, Osaka and Edo. At that time, groups of sumo wrestlers were in various parts of Japan, including Akita, Nanbu, Tsugaru, Sendai, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Wakayama, Takamatsu, Inba, Nagasaki, Kumamoto and Kagoshima. Between 1648 and 1742, it was banned by the Tokugawa shogunate under the name of violations of regulations. Then, Kanjin Sumo Tournaments were reopened, in Edo in spring, in Kyoto in summer, in Osaka in autumn, and in Edo in winter. The term Kanjin-Sumo remained because sumo tournaments were under the control of the Jisha-bugy≈ç, which was a \\"commissioner\\" or an \\"overseer\\" of the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1925, the Japan Sumo Association was established, though the practice of Kanjin-moto remains, and expresses private local organizations which hold tournaments.These were called combination grand tournaments. =Noh= Kanjin-Noh was originally held for the construction or repair of temples and shrines. The noh of Monk Yoshimori was well known for the reconstruction of Kurama Temple; he produced a Kanjin-Noh with On-ami and Kanze-morimasa in 1464 in Kyoto. Later, Kanjin-Noh was held for the benefit of Noh players, especially in the Edo era, while the term Kanjin remained.

He was born the eldest son of John and Eleanor (n√©e Lucas) Longfield of Longueville. He was appointed High Sheriff of County Cork for 1833‚Äì34, an office that had also been held (1829‚Äì30) by his father. He sat as a Conservative in the British House of Commons for County Cork from 1835 to 1837. Having successfully petitioned against the re-election in January 1835 of the radical Repeal MP Feargus O'Connor, on the grounds that O'Connor failed the property qualification then required of MPs, Longfield took the seat on 5 June. He married twice;firstly Harriett Elizabeth, the daughter of John M'Clintock, with whom he had one son (killed in the Crimea) and secondly Jemima Lucy, the daughter of Wyrley Birch of Norfolk, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. A relation, also named Richard Longfield (1734‚Äì1811), had sat in the Irish House of Commons for Charleville in County Cork (1761‚Äì68), for Cork City (1776‚Äì83 and 1790‚Äì96), and for Baltimore, County Cork (1783-1790), before becoming the first and last holder of the titles of Baron Longueville and Viscount Longueville in the Irish peerage; he had also been High Sheriff of the County (1758‚Äì61).

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Sir Rufus Isaacs was appointed Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales created Baron Reading and given a seat in the House of Lords. He had been Liberal MP for Reading since 1903. Electoral history Isaacs had won the last four parliamentary elections in Reading, but at the last General Election he only just managed to hold off the Conservative challenge; Sir Rufus Isaacs This made Reading one of the most marginal seats in the country. Candidates The local Liberal Association were unable to find a local candidate, and after some difficulties, settled on the wealthy and radical outsider George Peabody Gooch to defend the seat. He was elected at the 1906 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bath, but lost the seat at the January 1910 general election. He stood again in Bath at the December 1910 general election, but did not regain the seat, Gooch's candidacy provoked the threat of an anti- vaccinationist candidate from within the local party.Daily Chronicle, 23 October 1913 The local Unionists re-selected Leslie Orme Wilson. In January 1910, at the General Election, he unsuccessfully stood as the Conservative candidate for Poplar. In December 1910, he was Unionist candidate for Reading, but was defeated by the sitting Liberal candidate, Sir Isaac Rufus, the Attorney-General. A third candidate entered the contest in the figure of J. G. Butler, who was a member of the British Socialist Party. Butler was from London and in March 1913 he had contested the 1913 London County Council election at Stepney, where he had polled poorly. He secured the backing of the Reading Trades Council and the Reading branch of the Independent Labour Party.Justice, 25 October 1913 Background If the Unionists were to hope to win a majority at the next General Election expected to take place in 1914/15, they would need to win Reading as it was statistically No17 on their target list. The intervention of a Socialist candidate at the by-election, thus gave them a good opportunity to gain the seat and establish their candidate as the incumbent. Campaign In the last week of the campaign, following on from an announcement made by Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, of a new rural land policy, the Liberal campaign circulated a leaflet proclaiming Vote for Gooch and the new Liberal land policy ‚Äì the wage raising policy for Reading. It argued that higher agricultural wages would lead to higher wages in towns. It also argued that a revival in the rural economy would stop labourers migrating to towns and causing unemployment and that a more prosperous countryside would buy more of Reading's products.The Times, 4‚Äì7 November 1913 Result Although the Unionists gained the seat, the fact that the Unionist share of the vote only increased by 0.8% indicated that they would struggle to hold the seat at a General Election when no Socialist would be standing. Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the summer of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. *Wilson was the endorsed candidate of the Coalition Government. References * Craig, F. W. S. (1974).

Written by Harold Vaughn Taylor, and produced and directed by Austin Green, the film stars David Bailey as a boy who finds himself lost in an enchanted forest, encountering an assortment of fanciful characters and navigating a series of fantastical (mis)adventures as he attempts to find his way home. Originally released as a weekend \\"kiddie matinee\\" feature, the film was rediscovered and re-released on DVD in 2004 by Something Weird Video, and has subsequently gained something of a cult following for its low budget production values, as well as for the unintentionally camp performances by the adult character actors. Plot The film opens by a lake on Saint Patrick's Day as the story's young hero, an Irish boy named Matthew O'Brien (David Alan Bailey), is playing hooky from school and fishing with his best friend, Timothy Ryan (Ernest Vaio). As the time approaches to return home, the two boys go their separate ways and Matt soon finds a magic frog which he places in his pocket. Deciding to take a short-cut home through the woods, Matt quickly finds himself lost and soon encounters a leprechaun (Frank Delfino) whose beard is caught in a log. Matt, remembering the old Irish legends he's heard from his grandfather, agrees to help the little man on the condition that he give Matt his bag of gold, to which, according to legend, Matt knows the leprechaun cannot refuse. After freeing the little man, Matt soon learns that the seven gold coins in the bag are not ordinary coins, but magic \\"wishing coins\\", which only have power when used to do good for others. After warning Matt of the magic of the coins, the leprechaun promptly scampers off and vanishes into the woods, leaving the boy to find his own way out of the forest. As Matt becomes desperate to find his way home, he unintentionally spends his first coin wishing for some guidance, which, to his surprise, brings a long suffering wooden sign post to life. Now able to talk, the sign post advises Matt to seek the help of a Wizard and points Matt in the direction of the Wizard's cave. As he approaches his destination, Matt finds himself in the Wizard's enchanted forest, where the trees come alive and inform him that the frog in his pocket is really a knight who was put under a spell by the Wicked Wizard. Matt decides to spend his second coin to help the frog, which instantly transforms it into a medieval knight named Sir Humphrey (Clive Halliday). Grateful to Matt for freeing him, Sir Humphrey warns the boy to avoid the Wicked Wizard who had placed him under a spell while he was attempting to rescue a princess named Cecilia. Sir Humphrey decides to accompany the boy as he searches for a way out of the enchanted forest, but their plans are interrupted when the Wicked Wizard (G. Edward Brett) suddenly appears in a cloud of smoke and banishes them to a barren desert. In the desert, Matt and Sir Humphrey encounter the Genie of Aladdin's Lamp (Dick Reeves) and learn that he has been stripped of his magical powers and has been banished to the desert by the ruler of all Genies. Feeling compassion for the lonely Genie, Matt spends his third coin to restore the Genie's powers, which prompts the Genie to respond in kind, using his regained powers to transport Matt and Sir Humphrey back to the enchanted forest. Once back in the forest, Matt and Sir Humphrey encounter a Gypsy girl named Esmerelda (Nancy DeCarl) who attempts to help Matt find a way home by inviting him to look into her crystal ball, however, the crystal only shows Matt a vision of his worried mother before fading to darkness. Matt and Sir Humphrey continue on their journey and encounter a lonely old puppeteer named Professor Antonio (Lindsay Workman). Learning the Professor has been abandoned in the woods by a traveling carnival after growing too old to operate his puppets properly, Matt spends his fourth coin to bring the puppets to life so that they can perform on their own. As Matt and Sir Humphrey continue their search, they once again encounter the Wicked Wizard who uses his evil powers to turn Sir Humphrey back into a frog. At the same moment, Matt spends his fifth coin to wish for the Wicked Wizard to lose his magic powers and to become harmless, which instantly transforms the Wizard into a gentle and confused old man. Suddenly realizing the Wizard's final spell has turned Sir Humphrey back into a frog, Matt immediately spends his sixth coin to restore Sir Humphrey to his human form. Now harmless, the Wizard wanders off and Matt and Sir Humphrey once again encounter Esmerelda, who invites the two to once again gaze into her crystal ball which reveals that Esmerelda is in fact the Princess Cecilia who was also under the spell of the Wicked Wizard. Matt uses his last coin to wish for the girl to be freed from the Wizards spell and she is instantly transformed back into the Princess (also played by DeCarl). Having used all seven of his magic coins unselfishly, a beautiful rainbow appears, which guides Matthew to find his way him home.

Veteran actor Austin Green served as both producer and director of the film, which would be the only directing or producing credit of his career. Selected to portray the film's young lead, Matthew O'Brien, was 12-year-old David Alan Bailey who, at the time, was best known for his various guest-starring roles on well-known television series of the time, including Dennis the Menace, The Andy Griffith Show and Bewitched among others. British character actor Clive Halliday was reportedly cast when producer-director Green saw his performance as \\"Mr. Mousely\\" in the 1964 Walt Disney Pictures film Mary Poppins, and immediately decided Halliday would be perfect for the role of Sir Humphrey. Suitable filming locations were scouted by Green, who eventually selected Northern California's Carmel-by-the-Sea to serve as the location for the \\"enchanted forest\\" sequences. Production then moved south to the desert area near Indio, California, which served as the location for the \\"impossible desert\\" sequences. Release Originally released as a children's weekend matinee feature, the earliest report of a screening of the film dates to October 23, 1965, when the film was released as At the End of the Rainbow. By March 1966 (and possibly earlier), the film's title had been changed to The Princess and the Magic Frog. As with other \\"kiddie matinee\\" offerings of the time, the film did not receive a simultaneous nationwide release and, consequently, continued to play in local movie theaters across the United States until as late as 1971. The film was largely forgotten and thought to be lost, until Something Weird Video released it on DVD in 2004. Upon releasing the film, Something Weird Video advertised their newfound discovery writing, \\"Yes, boys and girls, here's another mind- boggling children's film, straight from the mid-Sixties, when Americans would dump their youth at the local theater's \\"Kiddie Matinee\\" and subject the poor tots to all manner of cinematic torture. Such as The Princess and the Magic Frog, a long-unseen rarity that's so hilariously impoverished, it makes Jimmy, the Boy Wonder look like a multimillion-dollar work of art. [...] There's more that a whiff of Wizard of Oz wafting through The Princess and the Magic Frog, from the child who can't find his way home, to the Wicked Witch, er...Wizard, to the search for the end of the rainbow.\\" Reception With the 2004 DVD release, the film began to gain something of a cult \\"so bad it's good\\" reputation, for everything from its no-budget sets - to its amateurish costumes and effects - to its unintentionally humorous dialogue and camp performances by the adult character actors. Allmovie and TV Guide both gave the film two out of five stars, while describing the film as \\"charming\\" and \\"enchanting\\" respectively. In a 2009 review of the film, a local film critic for The Seattle Times wrote, \\"The Princess and the Magic Frog (1965) was probably made with children as the target audience, but it plays more like something you'd watch at 3 a.m. after a long night of overindulgence.\\" The \\"kiddie camp\\" connoisseurs at KiddieMatinee.com described the film writing, \\"The Princess and the Magic Frog (1965), produced and released originally as At the End of the Rainbow, is a fascinating (albeit threadbare) U.S. fantasy film, very much in the spirit of similar mid-1960s Kiddie Matinee indie product such as Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, The Magic Christmas Tree and Jimmy, the Boy Wonder. [...] (O)ne wonders if 60's tots would have found this odd fairy tale engaging or excruciating. It looks more than anything like a children's theatre production restaged out in the dull woods. Yet even with a fantasy film told with the bare minimum of production value, the question remains; does it work? The answer, in this case, is yes and no.\\" See also *List of American films of 1965 References External links  At the End of the Rainbow (aka: The Princess and the Magic Frog) at Something Weird Video * At the End of the Rainbow (aka: The Princess and the Magic Frog) at KiddieMatinee.com * At the End of the Rainbow (aka: The Princess and the Magic Frog) 1965 press kit Category:1965 films Category:1960s fantasy adventure films Category:American fantasy adventure films Category:1965 independent films Category:American children's adventure films Category:American children's fantasy films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films ","title":"At the End of the Rainbow"},{"id":"35735319","text":"Overall view, September 2014. The Navigation Pass S-1 of Saint Petersburg Dam is a storm surge barrier in the eastern part of the Finnish Gulf to the south of the island of Kotlin, Russia. It is part of a waterway from the Baltic Sea to Saint Petersburg located at eastern end of Neva Bay. The scheme of S-1 is similar to the Maeslantkering barrier in the Netherlands and consists of two submersible caissons with dimensions 125√ó22 metres, which are used to close the navigable channel and thus stop storm tides from proliferating into Neva Bay. The channel is 200 metres wide and 16 metres deep. The Saint Petersburg Ring Road crosses it via an underwater tunnel. The construction of the S-1 began in 1984. The S-1 gates were commissioned for exploitation in the middle of 2011. Their first use for the city protection against storm surges happened on 27 November of the same year. –ú–æ—â–Ω–µ–π—à–∏–π —É—Ä–∞–≥–∞–Ω –∏ –Ω–∞–≤–æ–¥–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞–∫—Ä—ã–ª–∏ –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥: –≤–æ–¥–∞ —É–≥—Ä–æ–∂–∞–µ—Ç –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—É (–í–ò–î–ï–û), –ì–ª–∞–≤—Ä–µ–¥, 11/28/2011 –î–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ü–∏—è –ö–ó–°: –î–∞–º–±–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Ç–≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–ª–∞ —É—â–µ—Ä–± –≤ 1,3 –º–ª—Ä–¥ —Ä—É–±–ª–µ–π Gallery File:–î–∞–º–±–∞.–í—ã—Ö–æ–¥ —Å –ö—Ä–æ–Ω—à—Ç–∞–¥—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä–µ–π–¥–∞.jpgThe view of the barrier from the east in June, 2011.

The woods cover an area of 982 hectares and are designated as a nature reserve. Since 1991 they have been part of the Southeast R√ºgen Biosphere Reserve. Characteristic of the Granitz are its rich stands of beech and sessile oak and its rolling landscape of push end moraines, which in some ways resemble a mountain landscape. To the north and east the Granitz is bounded by a cliffed coast on the Baltic Sea. In the south it adjoins the M√∂nchgut region and in the north, the narrow bar of the Schmale Heide. The Black Lake (Schwarzer See) lies in the Granitz as do several kettle bogs. A number of non-native stands of conifers are being turned into a near-natural forest. No roads of any description run through the Granitz, but there are many cycle and footpaths. Local transport and access to the area is provided by the R√ºgen Light Railway and Binz Seaside Railway (Binzer B√§derbahn). On the highest point, the Tempelberg (), Prince Wilhelm Malte I of Putbus had the Granitz hunting lodge constructed in the 19th century. Other landmarks include Granitz House, the grave site of Finnish warriors and the Cross Oak (Kreuzeiche). The name is probably of Slavic origin and comes from the personal name, Granza, used by the Rani tribe, which first appears as a prince's name in the Saxo Grammaticus in 1168. In 1888, the Waldhalle, a tourist restaurant, was built on the hill of Falkenberg on the clifftop path from Binz to Sellin near the coast. The building had to be abandoned and demolished in the 1980s as a result of coast collapse.

In a career which lasted from April 2006 until November 2008, he ran seventeen times and won eight races. He recorded his most important victory when winning the Classic St. Leger Stakes as a three- year-old. He won five other Group Races before being retired to stud. Background Sixties Icon is a bay horse bred by the Newmarket-based Lordship Stud. He is exceptionally well-bred, being sired by the 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo out of the 2000 Epsom Oaks winner Love Divine. In October 2004, Sixties Icon was sent as a yearling to the Tattersalls sales at Newmarket, where he was bought for 230,000 guineas by John Warren Bloodstock. The colt was sent into training with Jeremy Noseda at Newmarket. Racing career =2006: three-year-old season= Sixties Icon began his racing career by finishing sixth of the twelve runners in maiden race at Newmarket in April 2006. Three weeks late he started 6/4 favourite for a similar event at Windsor and won by three-quarters of a length from Fleeting Memory. Sixties Icon was then sent to Epsom to contest the Epsom Derby. Starting a 66/1 outsider he stayed on in the closing stages to finish seventh, five and a half lengths behind Sir Percy. Later in June he finished third to Papal Bull in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot. In August, Sixties Icon recorded his first Group Race win in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood. Ridden by Frankie Dettori he was settled in fourth place before taking the lead in the straight and winning by one and three quarter lengths from Jadalee. Sixties Icon started 11/8 favourite for the 2006 St Leger Stakes which was run at York as Doncaster Racecourse was being redeveloped. Dettori restrained the colt at the back of the eleven runner field before moving up to take the lead in the final furlong. He produced a \\"powerful late burst\\" and went clear to win by two and a half lengths from the 50/1 outsider The Last Drop with Red Rocks a length further back in third. Noseda was unable to attend the race as he was viewing yearlings in Kentucky, but described himself as being \\"absolutely delighted, over the moon\\" at the result. On his final start of the year, Sixties Icon finished seventh of the eight runners in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. =2007: four-year-old season= Sixties Icon made his four-year-old debut in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket on 6 May. Dettori took the colt into the lead two furlongs from the finish and he \\"stayed on strongly\\" to win by three lengths from Admiral's Cruise, with Papal Bull in fourth. Sixties Icon started 11/8 favourite for the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June but weakened badly in the closing stages and finished last of the seven runners behind Scorpion. He started favourite again in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket in July but finished tenth of the twelve runners behind Papal Bull. =2008: five- year-old season= Sixties Icon returned after a break of almost ten months to finish second to Getaway in the Jockey Club Stakes. Later in may, the horse was dropped in class for the Listed Festival Stakes at Goodwood and won by five lengths at odds of 8/13. Sixties Icon was moved back up to Group One class for the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, but finished last of the twelve runners behind Duke of Marmalade. Sixties Icon won his next three races. On 1 August he \\"stayed on well\\" in the closing stages to win the Group Three Glorious Stakes at Goodwood in what was described as a \\"triumphant return to form\\". Two weeks later he justified his position as favourite for the Geoffrey Freer Stakes at Newbury, getting up in the \\"last stride\\" to beat Tempelstern. His jockey, Johnny Murtagh called Sixties Icon \\"a class horse\\" after his win while Noseda described him as \\"a tough, honest horse\\". In September he went clear in the closing stages of the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot and won by two and a quarter lengths from Sugar Ray. In October, Sixties Icon was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Marathon at Santa Anita Park. He was made 11/8 favourite, but finished fifth, beaten two and three quarter lengths by Muhannak. On his final appearance, Sixties Icon finished thirteenth of the seventeen runners in the Japan Cup where he appeared to be unsuited by the hard ground. He was then retired to stud. Stud career Sixties Icon retired to stand as a breeding stallion at the Norman Court Stud at West Tytherley, near Salisbury in Wiltshire. His first foals began racing in 2012. He currently stands at a stud fee of ¬£4,500. His first winner was the filly Vanessa, who won a race at Musselburgh Racecourse in April 2012, and Chilworth Icon gave his sire a first Group race win when taking the Premio Primi Passi three months later.

The case decided that an intention to return home, from fraud-induced absence, of the rightful owner can count as \\"actual occupation\\" for the purposes of overriding interests which binds new owners and lenders in domestic properties. The defrauded owner was not absent at the time of the transfer of the home but was at most times for many months during a new replacement secured loan obtained by the fraudster.Link Lending Ltd v Bustard HTML Version of the Judgment HM Courts and Tribunals: the Court of Appeal; reprinted at bailii.org The case turned on facts including that the defrauded owner's furniture and personal effects were still there; she made relatively brief, supervised visits about once a week to check out the Property and collect post; but she was incapable of living safely in the Property and at the relevant date the powers exercised under the terms of \\"sectioning\\" otherwise prevented her from leaving her mental health hospital. The appeal court confirmed the order of the High Court: that the transfer be reversed; Link Lending discharge their charge (lose their security as against this property); Mrs Hussain (the fraudster) and Link (her unwitting lender) [be obliged] to pay Ms Bustard‚Äôs costs. Facts Through fraud, Mrs Noreen Hussain took advantage of Ms Susan Bustard‚Äôs mental handicap by having her transfer (by transfer deed) her the house, 12 Cradley Drive, Brookfield, Middlesbrough in 2004. Bustard was sectioned in 2007 and put in hospital. Hussain obtained on the 2004 date an interest-only mortgage loan (secured against the house) approved by HSBC. In 2008 the fraudster replaced her mortgage loan with one from Link Lending and then defaulted, and the lender claimed possession, arguing Bustard had not been there for over a year. Bustard argued that she was in actual occupation (under LRA 2002 Sch 3, para 2, a virtual re-enactment of the standing law, since 1925). The Judge refused appeal which Carnworth LJ then granted on grounds that the case raised issues of general importance. Judgment The panel concurred with Mummery LJ's judgment. He upheld the judge's decision in law and in fact. Bustard was \\"in actual occupation\\" because of her persistent intention to return home, evidenced by regular visits to the property. > 14\\\\.

His decision is supportable in law and in fact. The court could, as in other cases, have taken into consideration further errors in the lender's decision to lend to the borrower, the fraudster against the previous owner. These errors included constructive notice of the fraud firmly fixed to the mortgage lender, particularly that under land registration, the headline details of the transaction by the proposed borrower showed their ownership was recent and the price of ¬£100,000 was a slight undervalue. Commentary The court did criticise the lender's valuation. \\"The only inspection of the Property by Link prior to taking the charge on it was a \\"drive-by\\" inspection by a surveyor, who noted signs of occupation.\\" The court suggests physical inspections (in lender's valuations) should take note of who may be deemed to be legally in occupation. In contrast to other fraud cases as regards secured lending, the case did not consider other means for constructive notice of the fraud \\"to attach\\" to the mortgage lender, for example under land registration, the summary of the purchase of the proposed borrower showed her ownership was recent and supposedly at ¬£100,000 (an undervalue). Furthermore, nothing was truly paid, a fact ascertainable on further investigation. Neither did the court consider other textbook errors in the two successive lenders' decisions to lend to the borrower who, without short of actual notice, was the fraudster against the previous, very vulnerable, registered owner.\\"Defining the scope of actual occupation under the LRA 2002\\", Barbara Bogusz, [2011] 75 Conv. 268 The Law Commission has called the statutory term 'actual occupation' \\"notorious and much- litigated\\".Law Commission Report No 254, \\"Land Registration for the Twenty First Century: A Conveyancing Revolution: Land Registration Bill and Commentary\\" (2001) at para. 8.15.

After the journal had been reestablished, he became its deputy editor.  Accentuations of character  His monograph entitled \\"Psychopathy and Accentuations of Character of Teenagers\\" (1977) has become an indispensable textbook for many generations of Russian psychiatrists and psychologists. For writing this book, Andrey Lichko was awarded the Honorary Certificate n.a. V.M. Bekhterev by USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. In this monograph, Andrey Lichko has enriched the theory of psychopathy (what is known today as personality disorders) by demonstrating that along with psychopathy it is necessary to distinguish the so-called accentuations of character. Lichko's typology has parallels with those of Karl Leonhard and Pyotr Gannushkin. Persons with accentuations of character are placed somewhere between mentally sane persons and psychopaths (those who suffer from different personality disorders). Referring to the famous monograph by the German psychiatrist Karl Leonhard, \\"Accentuated Persons\\", Andrey Lichko emphasized that it is more correct to use the term \\"accentuations of character\\" instead of the term \\"accentuated personality\\" because personality appears to be a wider notion, which includes IQ, skills, worldview, and so on.Lichko, Andrey. ‚ÄúPsychopathy and Accentuations of Character at Teenagers‚Äù. Saint Petersburg: Rech, 2010. P. 8. With his theory of accentuations of character, Andrey Lichko has contributed to the understanding of etiology of neuroses by proposing the concept of the so- called \\"locus of the least resistance\\" (locus resistantiae minoris) within the character structure. This conception emerged as the result of elaboration of the idea of the \\"individual sensibility\\" to psychic traumas proposed by the eminent Russian developmental psychologist, Vladimir Nikolayevich Myasishchev.Alexandrov, A. A. ‚ÄúThe Contemporary Psychotherapy‚Äù. Saint Petersburg: Academic Project, 1997, p. 173. By improving and elaborating the conception of \\"situativity\\" and \\"individual hypersensibility\\" to outside influence, Andrey Lichko has developed the theory stating that each type of accentuation of character has its own different \\"Achilles' Heel\\". On the assumption of these observations, Andrey Lichko supposed that neurosis is mostly linked with the juxtaposition of a pathogenic situation and the individual peculiarities of character.

It was broadcast by Nederlandse Programma Stichting on the TV program Het Uur van de Wolf (The Hour of the Wolf) on 3 June 2007. Plot For forty years the Havo voor Muziek en Dans has given talented young people the opportunity to study music and dance in depth as well as following the normal high school curriculum, with the possibility of going on to the conservatory or dance academy. Each pupil dreams of becoming a professional dancer or musician. The children come from all over the country, and from all types of background. The film focuses on eight students: John, Lorenzo, Genelva, Paul, Misha, Alysh, Mickel and Rory. The camera gives a view of the pupils' daily life in the school as the camera \\"dances\\" between classrooms and practice rooms. It shows the tension of the tough entrance exams and the demanding teachers. It shows the sacrifices the pupils have to make to realize their dreams, such as 12-year-old Alysh from distant Joure who has to live in lodgings while she studies at the school. The film also shows the adolescents coping with their parents and struggling with their ambitions, anxiety and love. The school is a factory where the dreams of ambitious and talented young people are nurtured. Production To make the film, Netty van Hoorn and her cameraman Onno van der Wal repeatedly visited the school, which is located in the modern Codarts building in downtown Rotterdam, filming students in their daily lives over a ten-month period. The director said she invested a lot of time in getting the students used to her presence. If the cameraman was not present, she walked around with her own camera. She felt this helped ensure the camera was not disruptive, but gave a genuine view of life at the school. The film was edited by Annemiek van der Zanden. Reception The film was screened at the 2007 Netherlands Film Festival in Utrecht. A reviewer said that the characters do not come to life, mainly because the camera does not follow any of them for long enough. He described the film as a missed opportunity.

The Saudi Princess, occupying the property through an arrangement with the defendant company, claimed she had been in actual occupation of a house, retained clothing, furniture and caretaking arrangements in place,Land Law: Text, Cases, and Materials 3rd Ed. 2012 imprint, Ben McFarlane, Nicholas Hopkins, Sarah Nield, OUP (Publisher). She sought that the orders should be reversed. The claimant plead the Princess's admittance of not being in the home for more than a year and having only been intermittently resident before.

Facts Kling was first just a licensee of the garage (in Chelsea). He had and then exercised a right of pre-emption to take a long lease of it from the licensor (land owner). He parked his car in the garage routinely. It was almost always kept there overnight and for most of the day. The new owner of Keston's interest did not know of Kling's parking and noted that he had not registered his lease promptly at the Land Registry, nor registered a priority \\"search\\" against their title warning that a new lease was to be pending. The legal question was whether parking amounted to occupation. Judgment The Judge held that the parking of the car in the lock-up garage could amount to actual occupation for the purpose of an overriding interest. His overriding interest derived from his proprietary right in the leasing the garage and remaining a lawful licensee. The plaintiff had and exercised a right of pre-emption entitling him to take a long lease of a garage. He was at the time also licensee of the garage. The use of the garage amounted to actual occupation, thereby protecting the right as an overriding interest as regards the garage. His right was protected under section 70(1). The court rejected a submission based on section 59 of the Act. Cases applied, followed Bridges v Mees [1957] Ch 475 EWHC: an overriding interest, namely an estate contract, was protected under s. 70(1) of the Act even though it could have been protected by a caution. Webb v Pollmount Ltd [1966] Ch 584 EWHC: an option to purchase the reversion contained in a seven-year lease was protected under s. 70(1) by virtue of the tenant‚Äôs occupation under the lease. Significance The case has been superseded, strengthening its proposition, by statute. Such lawful, actual occupation is officially an overriding proprietary interest under the Land Registration Act 2002, Schedule 3. The Act took effect from 13 October 2003. The case confirms the law has evolved to take into account such uses as cars/motorbikes kept in domestic garages as \\"occupation\\".

One of the most important brigands after the Italian unification, he was a lieutenant of Carmine Crocco, band chief of the Vulture area, in Basilicata. He was known for his brilliant guerrilla warfareEric Hobsbawm, Bandits, Penguin, 1985, p. 25 and for his brutality against his enemies. Biography =Early years= Son of Domenico Summa and Anna Coviello, he was born into a poor family involved with problems with the law. His maternal uncle, Giuseppe Nicola Coviello, was a bandit who died burned in a hut where he was hiding from the police; his paternal uncle, Francescantonio, was sentenced to ten years for beating a bourbon gendarme and, after the imprisonment, fled to Apulia after killing a man for a matter of gambling, working as a servant for a landowner of Cerignola but he left soon for banditry. His father, though an honest farmer, had alcohol problems and one of his sisters was a prostitute. Still a little boy, Ninco Nanco began to work as a servant for a nobleman and later as a keeper of vineyards. At 18, he married a girl called Caterina Ferrara, orphaned of both parents. The couple had no children and the marriage lasted two years. In his young age, he was often protagonist of violent episodes. One day, he was beaten and stabbed in a leg by some people, forcing him into three months of recovery. Instead of denouncing the deed, he preferred personal revenge, killing one of his aggressors with an axe. Ninco Nanco was arrested and sentenced to ten years in Ponza but he escaped in August 1860.Quirino Bianchi, Il brigante Ninco - Nanco, p. 24 He went to Naples, trying to join the Garibaldine army but he was rejected. He tried also to enter the Italian National Guard but the result was negative. Forced to brigandage, he began to live by robbery. =Brigandage= Wanted poster of Carmine Crocco, Ninco Nanco and Angelantonio Masini On January 7, 1861, he met Carmine Crocco, becoming one of his best subordinates. Ninco Nanco participated in the conquest of the entire Vulture zone, pushing forward to the province of Matera, Irpinia and Capitanata. He had his own band of 50 men, remaining disposable to Crocco's orders in case of a big conflict against the royal troops. His principal targets were rich landowners, resorting to kidnapping, homicide and properties devastation for ransom to finance his band activities. Ninco Nanco became soon known for his cold- blooded and ferine acts. The most known episode of his brigand life happened In January 1863, when he killed in the wood of Castel Lagopesole Costantino Pulusella, director of Public Safety of Avigliano, the captain Luigi Capoduro and some of his troops who tried to lead him to surrender. The corpses were discovered days later: Pulusella was found with his hands cut off; Capoduro was beheaded, his head was found on a rock with a stone between his teeth and on his body a cross of Savoy was engraved.Basilide Del Zio, Il brigante Crocco e la sua autobiografia, Tipografia G. Grieco, 1903, p.172 According to the accounts of the time, Ninco Nanco often tore the heart from the chest of captured soldiers. The memory of these actions was still alive among the inhabitants of Basilicata in 1935, when Carlo Levi exiled to Aliano during the fascist regime. The writer met people who claimed to be witnesses of those deeds and reported the anecdotes in his memoir Christ Stopped at Eboli.Carlo Levi, Christ Stopped at Eboli, Farrar, Straus And Company, 1947, p.71 However, Crocco denied tortures by Ninco Nanco at the expense of military prisoners, stating that he was fierce only for his self-defense.Ettore Cinnella, Carmine Crocco. Un brigante nella grande storia, p.168 Beside his cruelty, the brigand made also generous acts. He helped his sisters economically, who lived in miserable conditions and, being deeply religious, he donated money to the priests to celebrate masses in honour of the Lady of Mount Carmel, whose effigy he carried always on his neck. During the siege of Salandra, he spared the life of a priest who had helped his family in the past, ensuring him his protection. Ninco Nanco deposited valuable items in the chapel of Monte Carmine, which were seized and sold in 1863, by order of the antibrigandage committee. The proceeds were used for the renovation of the building. Once, he ordered to one of his men to stop using death threats to extract money from poor people, as they could not support the bands.Quirino Bianchi, Il brigante Ninco - Nanco, p. 113 =Death= Ninco Nanco's activity began to weaken on the early 1864, because of the betrayal of Giuseppe Caruso, Crocco's lieutenant who decided to collaborate with the Italian government. On March 13, 1864, Ninco Nanco and two of his brigands (one of whom was his brother Francescantonio), while repairing in a farmhouse in the district of Castel Lagopesole, were suddenly surprised by the national guards, headed by captain Benedetto Corbo. The farmhouse was assaulted and, after a short conflict, Ninco Nanco and his men were captured and soon killed. He was killed with two shots to the throat by Nicola Coviello, corporal of the guards, to avenge the death of his brother-in-law, killed by Ninco Nanco on June 27, 1863, but most probably the brigand was killed by the order of Corbo himself, to prevent his revealing his protectors, including Corbo. In fact Corbo was involved, two months later, in another affair of complicity with the brigands and was accused for having issued, without any authority, two brigands belonging to Ninco Nanco's band. Crocco wanted to avenge the death of his lieutenant but the arrival of reinforcements in the district of Avigliano forced him to abandon the plan. His corpse was taken to Avigliano and hanged as a warning to the people and, the next day, it was brought to Potenza, where it was buried. His subordinates joined the band of Gerardo De Felice known as \\"Ingiongiolo\\", a brigand from Oppido Lucano. Ninco Nanco in popular culture *William Henry Giles Kingston wrote a novel about him called Ninco Nanco, The Neapolitan Brigand, from Foxholme Hall (1867).William Henry G. Kingston, Foxholme hall; and other tales, 1867, p.244 *He was portrayed by Branko Tesanovic in the movie Li chiamarono... briganti!

The facts of the case showed an intention to do a woman out of her (and her children's) occupational interest in a matrimonial home, as the new co-owner buying his share from the husband knew of her situation from the outset and wished to resell the property. The court confirmed in these exact circumstances her interest was overriding at the time when she was in hospital and it was a constructive trust. Facts Mr and Mrs Chhokar married on 18 April 1975. May 1977: Mr Chhokar bought 60 Clarence Street, Southall, for the purchase price of ¬£9250 with a deposit of ¬£700. Mrs Chhokar substantially contributed to the family fortunes to the tune of approximately ¬£3000. 1978: There were matrimonial difficulties and they both travelled to India to visit their parents. Mr Chhokar tries to abandon her in India but Mrs Chhokar returns in November 1978, a few weeks later. December 1978: An acquaintance of Mr Chhokar, Mr Parmar, visits the house under the guise of a potential lodger. They sign a contract of sale for the marital home for ¬£12700 (an undervalue) and the date of completion was fixed at 12 February. This was the date on which Mrs Chhokar was scheduled to deliver their second child in hospital. However, Mrs Chhokar did not deliver on 12 February. She delivered on the 16th and so the men deferred the completion of the sale until then. Mr Parmar then put the house on the market for ¬£18,000. When Mrs Chhokar returned, she discovered the locks had been changed. She broke in but was forced out by Mr Parmar who threatened and assaulted her. Mrs Chhokar managed to gain entry to the house again and stayed put. The question for the court was whether Mrs Chhokar could be said to be in 'actual occupation' even though she was not physically present in the house at the time of the transfer (sale). Judgment =High Court= Ewbank J ordered that Mr Parmar held the property on trust for himself and Mrs Chhokar in equal shares; that it be sold in 9 months; and until then, she must pay him a rent of ¬£8 a week. She appealed, arguing she should stay rent-free until a sale. =Court of Appeal= The Court of Appeal, sitting as a panel of two judges, held the purpose of the trust was to give Mrs Chhokar and her children a home. There was no reason for an order for sale, having regard to the interest of third parties. Because Mr Parmar stepped into Mr Chhokar‚Äôs shoes, it would be inequitable for her to have to pay an occupational rent, but he should be entitled to credit for paying off the mortgage. Accordingly, she and Mr Parmar held the house as tenants in common in equity in equal shares. Cumming-Bruce LJ remarked that for the question about whether an order for sale should be made, bankruptcy case law was analogous and relevant. He first referred to Goff LJ in Re Holliday [1981] 1 Ch 405, before continuing his judgment.[1984] FLR at pp. 329-330 He held the judge at first instance was wrong to make an order for sale. Reeve J concurred.

He rose to the position of Chief of Staff of the Guatemalan Army before being forced into retirement in 1985, after which he served as Assistant Chief of State and Guatemala's ambassador to Panama. Military career Lobos Zamora began his military career in the 1950s, and was sent to study at the United States Army Infantry School, from which he graduated in 1959, and then the Escuela Militar in Colombia, from which he graduated in 1965. He later rose to the command of the Mariscal Zavala base in Guatemala City. After the coup d'√©tat which followed the 1982 elections, he and fellow colonels C√©sar Augusto C√°ceres Rojas and H√©ctor Gramajo Morales ‚Äî two other Guatemalan officers who had studied counter-insurgency tactics at foreign military schools ‚Äî created the National Plan of Security and Development. In October 1983, Lobos Zamora was named Chief of Staff of the Guatemalan Army, succeeding Hector Mario Lopez Fuentes. Lobos Zamora had been expected to be promoted to Minister of Defence, but after Vinicio Cerezo emerged victorious in the 1985 elections, he forced Lobos Zamora to retire from the military, and named Jaime Hern√°ndez M√©ndez as Minister of Defence instead. Diplomatic career In February 1984, Lobos Zamora was named to the newly created position of Assistant Chief of State under √ìscar Humberto Mej√≠a Victores. He flew to Taipei, Taiwan, that year as his country's official representative at the inauguration of Chiang Ching-kuo to his second term as president of the Republic of China (ROC), demonstrating the close ties between the two anti-communist governments. His opposition led to a delay of nearly five years in the ROC's plans to establish relations with Belize: in 1984, when then-ROC ambassador to Guatemala Gene Loh travelled to Belize to meet with William Quinto and Prime Minister George Price, Lobos Zamora made his displeasure known, and a CIA agent informed Loh that if the ROC went ahead with its plans, Guatemala might break off relations entirely. In March 1986, Lobos Zamora was named Guatemala's ambassador to Panama by the new civilian government of Vinicio Cerezo. The Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo accused him of human rights abuses and attempted to bring him to trial, but his diplomatic appointment made him immune from prosecution. During the 1988 confrontation between Manuel Noriega and the United States, Cerezo frequently recalled Lobos Zamora to Guatemala to provide updates and discuss the situation; the Guatemalan government paid close attention to the situation and sought to act as a mediator between Panama and the United States.

Technology High level illustration of Powermat Technologies inductive wireless charging system. The company's technology is based upon Inductively Coupled Power Transfer. As the block diagram shows, within a Transmitter (Tx) - by varying the current in the primary induction coil - an alternating magnetic field is generated from within a charging spot. The receiver (Rx) is a second induction coil in the handheld device that takes power from the magnetic field and converts it back into electric current to charge the device battery. An additional part of the technology is the System Control Communication: Data over Coil (DoC) ‚Äì the Rx sends feedback to Tx by changing the load seen by the Tx coil. The protocol is frequency based signaling, thus enables fast response of the transmitter. Each receiver is equipped with a unique ID (RxID), enabling the system, when installed in public venues, to recognize users and communicate with them. The RxID is communicated as part of the data over coil to the Tx. History The company was founded in 2006 by Ran Poliakine. Its first products were launched in 2009. In 2011 General Motors announced that it would integrate Powermat's wireless charging technology into certain vehicles in its 2013 Chevrolet Volt line, and would also invest in the private company.

First, it clarified the law as to wedding gifts.HTML Version of Judgment at bailii.org at Question A Second, it held that so long as some financial contribution, however, small can be identified as going to the purchase of a home, the court may quantify that contribution in a greater amount than initially given. It opted for a 50:50 division looking at both spouses' conduct in the round.HTML Version of Judgment at bailii.org at Question B Third, it clarified that if proven the spouses had never discussed any details of joint ownership, where one spouse legally owns the whole family home then the court often should from equitable principles infer agreement as to proportions of their beneficial interests.HTML Version of Judgment at bailii.org at Question C Facts The street of the family home. Mr Cooke paid ¬£8500 at age 19 for the house the month before he was married. He achieved this through a mortgage loan from a bank, his own savings, and a pre-wedding gift from his parents of ¬£1100. Mrs Cooke's parents paid for the wedding. The Cookes replaced that mortgage with one from Midland Bank plc to secure Mr Cooke's business overdraft. Mrs Cooke signed a consent form for her interest to be postponed to the bank's security. The property was put into Mr Cooke's name as sole legal owner. Midland Bank plc now demanded repayment of ¬£52,000 and sought possession. Mrs Cooke argued her signature was obtained by undue influence. (Mrs Cooke admitted at trial that the married couple had never discussed any beneficial entitlement.)HTML Version of Judgment at bailii.org per quote extracted The Judge held the bank knew of Mr Cooke's undue influence and that she had an equitable interest given that the wedding gift was partly hers. The bank did not (cross-)appeal on this finding. The bank cross-appealed by alleging that Mrs Cooke had a 0% interest. The Judge assessed her interest as 6% of the property, and Mrs Cooke appealed arguing for a 50% interest. Judgment The Court of Appeal held that the gift was made to the couple jointly (50:50). This was proof of a common intention to have a beneficial interest. But in quantifying her interest the financial contribution was not the only thing which mattered: the whole course of dealing did. On the facts it was clear that the presumed intention was that she should have an equal share of the beneficial interest. Waite LJ observed that people usually will not talk about legal entitlements to property when young and embarking on a relationship, and says that should not leave them ‚Äòbeyond the pale of equity‚Äôs assistance‚Äô. The parties shared everything equally, including ‚Äòthe upbringing of their children.‚Äô He continued as follows. Stuart-Smith LJ and Schiemann LJ concurred.

Facts Mrs Elayne Oxley had been living, renting in public housing in Page Close, Bean, near Dartford and under the Housing Act 1985 before leaving had lived there long enough to have the statutory right to buy. She quit the tenancy losing this valuable right, which on her own the court found she likely in a few years would have exercised. Instead she formed a new home with Mr Allan Hiscock, a First Iraq War soldier who had been captured in September 1987 at 35 Dickens Close. She paid 28%, he paid 48% of ¬£25,200, a mortgage the balance. They both contributed to household expenditure, improvements, maintenance and paying off the mortgage. The parties fell out. Oxley claimed 50% of the proceeds. Hiscock claimed 22% to her would be appropriate taking into account also improvements he had made. At trial in the Bromley County Court, HHJ Hallon held: > \\"The description given by the claimant, whose evidence I accept, shows that > this was a classic pooling of resources, even though there was no joint bank > account. . . . All of the evidence which I have heard clearly shows that > both were evincing an intention to share the benefit and the burden of [35 > Dickens Close] jointly and equally.

He said there were two questions (1) was there a constructive trust, and (2) how was it to be quantified. In particular, when there is no expression of what share each was (as in joint tenancy here) then it is up to the courts to decide.

In it Lord Millett expressed the view that a resulting trust arises because of the absence of intention to benefit a recipient of money. Facts Air Jamaica Ltd had set up a pension trust for the benefit of its employees, funded by contributions from its employees' salaries. When the company was privatised, J$400 million was left over in the pension fund. Clause 4 of the pension deed provided that ‚ÄòNo moneys which at any time have been contributed by the Company under the terms hereof shall in any circumstances be repayable to the Company‚Äô. Air Jamaica Ltd wished to remove clause 4, and change clause 13.3 to say that surpluses would be held on trust for the company. The Judge held that clause 13.3 was void, going against the rule against perpetuity, and so the surplus passed on trust as bona vacantia to the Crown. The Court of Appeal held that the surplus should be dealt under the rules of the scheme, by the trustees. Advice The Privy Council advised that a resulting trust of the surplus funds could still arise in favour of the company, and so it would not be bona vacantia. Clause 13.3 would usually be void for perpetuity because there was no statutory exemption in Jamaica to the common law rule. But with each new member, there was a new settlement, and each member was a life in being, so the termination of a new settlement could in fact be calculated, and so the scheme was in fact not void for perpetuity. The powers for the trustees to change the settlement‚Äôs terms were void for perpetuity, and so was the power for the widows to designate a beneficiary to receive benefits, because these were only contingent on termination of the plan itself which could occur more than 21 years after the death of any particular beneficiary. (The individual settlements were contingent on the death of each individual beneficiary under the scheme.) In any event, the scheme‚Äôs terms prohibited granting beneficial rights in the scheme to the company in clause 4. But a resulting trust for the company could still exist. Lord Millett remarked1412 that although Mr Vandervell, in Re Vandervell No 2 did not wish the share option to result to him, he did not wish to make an outright gift to the trustee company either. A presumption in the transferor‚Äôs favour can only be made where there is no evidence that there was an intention to create a trust, or make a gift, or make a loan of the property to the transferee.

He was one of the artists who associated with Paul Gauguin at Pont-Aven in Brittany. He is best known for his involvement in the Pont-Aven artist colony and his richly colored landscapes of coastal Brittany. http://www.artnet.com/artists/henry- moret/Benezit Dictionary of Artists Early life Moret was born in Cherbourg, but little is known of his life until he began his military service in 1875. Jules La Villette, his commander in Lorient, who first noticed his artistic talents, introduced him to Ernest Corroller, a drawing teacher and marine painter. Corroller taught him the art of landscape painting as practiced by masters such as Corot and Courbet, enabling him to register at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris where in 1876 he studied under Rudolf Lehmann, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me and later, from about 1880, under the history painter Jean-Paul Laurens at the Acad√©mie Julian.(fr)School records indicate attendance in 1876 Career Moret first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1880, presenting La plage de Locqueltas √† mar√©e basse; c√¥te de Bretagne. He maintained contacts with Corroller, often returning to Brittany. In 1888, he arrived in Pont-Aven which had begun to attract a number of artists including Ernest de Chamaillard, √âmile Jourdan, and Charles Laval, with Paul Gauguin playing the leading role. Moret was one of the first painters to move to nearby le Pouldu which soon became the new centre of attraction for the Pont- Aven artists. His work began to show signs of Symbolism, probably as a result of Gauguin's influence.\\"Henry Moret: (1856 - 1913)\\", Rehs Galleries. Retrieved 6 May 2012. After Gauguin left the area in 1891, Moret began to develop his own style. In 1895, he established a fruitful relationship with Paul Durand- Ruel who maintained a number of galleries in Paris, London and New York, with an emphasis on Impressionism. During their relationship, Moret completed over 600 paintings, many of which were exhibited in Paris and New York leading to a growing clientele for his work. Moret also exhibited seven of his Breton paintings at the Salon des Ind√©pendants. After 1900, Moret became more immersed in Impressionism, applying small flecks of paint to his work rather than the broad strokes favoured by the Pont-Aven artists. Increasingly he focused on landscapes where his light effects can be seen in the sunsets and storm scenes he painted around 1909. In addition to his oils for Durand-Ruel, he also completed some 800 watercolours and drawings. He died in Paris, aged 56. Assessment Port Manech (1896) After initially painting in a rather classical manner, Moret's style developed under the influence of Gauguin and the Pont-Aven artists. As time went by, his works became increasingly Impressionistic, while revealing his love of nature.

(born 26 April 1936) is an eminent litterateur from Odisha who has dominated the Odia literary scene for over forty years. His literary oeuvre comprise poetry, plays, short stories, novel, essays, children‚Äôs poems and nonsense verse. He has done translations of literary works from different languages into Odia and English. He has done extensive research into Odishan art and has published three works on the pictorial arts of the state. He has also done paintings, acted on stage and in films, and taken an active part in social and cultural movements. His writings have been widely translated into Hindi, English and other Indian languages, bringing him national recognition. He has been honoured with awards for his writings, the important ones being the Central Sahitya Akademi award for his poetry (which he refused), the Nandikar Award for plays, the Sarala Award for short stories and the Saraswati Samman for his poetry. He has been connected with literary, cultural, and charitable organisations and has been member/office holder of these bodies. Starting his career with a brief teaching assignment as assistant professor in the University of Allahabad, he joined the Indian Administrative Service and had held many important positions in the Government of Odisha and the Central Government. He has chosen to settle down in Delhi after taking premature retirement from Government service and is a well-known figure in the cultural and social life of the city where he lives. It would come as no surprise that Sumanyu Satpathy has titled a short biographical piece he has written on him The Artist as Polumetis, the Greek term meaning many-mindedness.  Early life  Das was born on 26 April 1936 to Shridhar Das and Indu Devi at Banpur in the Puri District of Odisha. His father Shridhar Das, an eminent literatteur, was then teaching at the Banpur High School. Banpur is a village and Das studied in the local ‚Äòvernacular‚Äô school. Shridhar moved to Cuttack as professor in the Christ College there and the family moved there in 1948. J P enrolled in the Mission School (later called the Christ Collegiate School) and passed the matriculation examination from there (1951). He did his Intermediate in Arts from the Christ College (1953) and Bachelor of Arts (honours) from Ravenshaw College, Cuttack (1955). He was a good student and secured high ranks in all the examinations. He moved to Allahabad to do his Master of Arts in political science, which he passed in 1957, topping the list of successful candidates.  Early writing  Das started writing poetry from his school days, and one of his earliest poems was published in the reputed Odia literary journal Kumkum in 1949 when he was thirteen years old. He regularly contributed to Odia literary journals and shared space with many literary luminaries of the time. In 1951, he brought out a collection of 39 of his poems titled Stabaka (meaning 'Bouquet', published by Odisha Publishing House, Cuttack, priced four annas. He continued writing poetry and was considered a major young voice in Odia poetry. However, he stopped writing when he moved to Allahabad. His next collection of poems was to appear only in 1971. Das has not included these early poems in his later anthologies, considering them juvenilia. However, many readers of his early poems still remember the words of those poems and feel that they should not be excluded from the corpus of his poems.  Service career  Das joined the IAS in 1958 and was allotted the Odisha cadre. His earliest posting was to Rourkella as Subdivisional Officer. He thereafter worked in several Departments of Government of Odisha, and was secretary of the Departments of Works and Transport, Industries, and Finance at different times. In 1973, he was deputed to the Central Government in Delhi and worked in the Commerce and the Finance Ministries. In 1976, he did his M.Phil. in the Indian Institute of Public Administration, and took a Homi Bhabha fellowship to research. After completing the fellowship, he joined as the resident commissioner of the Government of Odisha at Delhi from which post he took premature retirement in 1984. Das is on record saying that of the years he spent in government service, he considers the three years he spent in Kalahandi district of Odisha as Collector and District Magistrate as the most rewarding and fulfilling of his career.  Kalahandi  Das was posted to Kalahandi in 1963, when the district was one of the most backward ones having a substantial tribal population and lacking in basic facilities. The district faced severe drought in 1965, which necessitated tremendous efforts by the administration to provide relief to ameliorate the condition of the famine-stricken population. He has written about the problems he had faced when he stopped the export of food grains outside the district, though his order was rescinded by the Government. The authorities had to permit import rice at a later date. J P Das has written a poem on Kalahandi, which has gained an almost classic status.  Poetry Das considers poetry his first love. He is also on record saying: \\"All that I want to say, let me say in poetry\\". Writing poems from an early age, he published his first collection of poems in 1951, which he later called immatured. His next collection Prathama Purusha came out after a twenty-year hiatus in 1971 and made a great impact on the Odia poetry scene. The poems were hailed as free from the existing trends in poetry and received rave reviews. Translation of the collection soon followed and was equally well- received. Mulk Raj Anand called the translated poems in First Person \\"authentic poetic expression in new metaphor\\". Of the Urdu translation, a review said: \\"Das‚Äôs sensibility is easily comparable with that of Faiz in Urdu\\". Given below are some comments on his poetry at different times. \\\\- \\"If contemporary Odia poetry has acquired a new dimension and sophistication in terms of vision, technical integrity and innovative use of the creative medium, it was because of J.P.Das's contribution.\\" ‚Äì Kavya Bharati,1997 \\\\- \\"An unusual blending of the sense of beauty and the sense of joy in living and loving makes his poetry extremely readable and accessible. His passion for the diverse facets of life and existence makes his poetry vibrant and rejuvenating. The sense of rhythm that he tries to capture in his poetry is very close to the colloquial speech.\\"-Kavya Bharati, Madurai, Issue 13, 2001 \\\\- \\"J.P.Das's collection of poems] is authentic poetic expressions in new metaphors.\\" ‚Äì Mulk Raj Anand \\\\- \\"There is no self-indulgent practicing here; form and language suggest a strong, mature personality.\\" ‚Äì Nissim Ezekiel \\\\- \\"His poetry is universal as true poetry should be and ranks with some of the best in any language.\\" ‚Äì Vassilis Vitsaxis \\\\- \\"The world that J.P.Das creates is both magical and historical, lost and redeemed.\\" ‚Äì Mary O'Connor \\\\- \\"J.P.Das's is a poetry of concern, of dread and angst in a world growing darker day by day...its virtues are to be sought in its moral earnestness and its faithfulness to the gruesome reality of our times of torment.\\" ‚Äì K. Satchidanandan  Painting J.P.Das held the first (and only) exhibition of sixteen of his paintings in 1971 at Bhubaneswar. His formal training in Art was joining the diploma course of fine arts at the Allahabad University, which he could not finish. Though painted by an amateur Sunday artist, the paintings got some good reviews. Dr. Dinanath Pathy wrote: \\"It is not necessary that one should go through a training course in fine arts to make a good artist‚Ä¶.All the sixteen canvases on display were marked with a freshness and individuality, which clearly indicated a good artist in the making‚Ä¶..With his vision and sincerity, he will one day establish himself one day as a true artist.\\" Prof. Inam Ansari, another reviewer wrote: \\"Given time and maturity, Das is sure to succeed and prove a worthy member of the artist fraternity\\". But this was not to be, for Das stopped this creative activity and thus ended the short period of his career as visual artist. Short stories J.P.Das wrote his first short-story in 1980, many years after publishing poetry. His very first short-story attracted attention for the novelty of its theme as well as for the use of a new style and language for Odia fiction. Since then, he has alternated between poetry and prose and given both equal attention. He is now as much known as a fiction writer as a poet, and his collection of short stories has been awarded the prestigious Sarala Award. Many of his short stories have been produced as television films. Given below are some appreciations of his short stories: \\\\- \\"His stories draw a map of India whereby seemingly incontestable categories, widely accepted beliefs and traditions associated with the national identity collapse‚Ä¶. The stories gain a deeper, unstated meaning as they provide an acid critique of a country largely transformed under the pressures of globalization‚Ä¶. J.P.Das‚Äôs characters re- validate the assertion that the authentic re-appropriation of one‚Äôs cultural space remains by and large one of the most critical unfinished agendas of our time.\\" ‚Äì Mauricio D.

Mohapatra  Drama J.P.Das wrote two short plays in 1960 and then wrote his first full-length play Suryasta Purbaru (translated into English as Before the Sunset) in 1971. This play was staged in a Bengali version in Kolkata the next year, even before it was staged in Odia in Odisha. In 1976, the Hindi version was performed in Delhi directed by the eminent theatre personality Ram Gopal Bajaj. Om Puri played the role of the protagonist Deepankar in the play. The play has since been translated into many other languages and staged in different parts of the country giving it the status of a classic. It is included in the volume Modern Indian Plays published by the National School of Drama. His second play Saba Shesha Loka (translated into English as [The Underdogs]) was also produced in the Hindi version first, directed by eminent theatre and film personality Ravi Baswani. Thespian Pankaj Kapoor essayed the important role of Ram/Shyam in the play. A subsequent play of his, Sundardas, was staged by the Department of Art and Aesthetics of the Jawaharlal Nehru University directed by the renowned playwright and theatre-person H.S.Shiva Prakash. It was also staged under the auspices of Indira Gandhi National Centre of Arts. JP Das has been closely associated with the new theatre movement in Odisha and is a founder trustee of the Utkal Rangamanch Trust, Bhubaneswar. He has been an office-bearer of Bharatiya Natya Sangh, the Indian branch of International Theatre. He was the vice-chairman of National School of Drama. He has been honoured with Nandikar Theatre Award Nandikar Award, Kolkata as an eminent playwright.

Below are given some comments on J.P.Das‚Äôs plays: * \\"J.P.Das is a versatile writer and his plays are literary works at their best. It is hoped that these works of an important Indian playwright will delight both readers and theatre-persons.\\" ‚Äì Nirmal KantiBhattachraje (in his Introduction to Complete Plays by J.P.Das) * \\"J.P.Das has now secured his place among the leading playwrights of the country.\\" -Enact * \\"J.P.Das is a poet turned playwright and his poetic sensitivity, compassion and perspective inform his plays. He leaves many things to the imagination of the audience or gives only suggestions, as a poet would. But he does succeed in saying many things with a minimum of words.\\" -J.N.Kaushal * \\"Sundardas is a significant addition to Indian dramatic literature. The play is an insightful treatment of the politics of conversion.\\" ‚Äì H.S.Shivaprakash  Association with films  J.P.Das has been closely associated with cinema, having been an active member of the Bhubaneswar and Delhi Film Societies.

Novel  =Desha Kala Patra (A Time Elsewhere)= Das has written one historical novel, a fictional account of Odisha in the second half of the 19th century. In its six hundred pages, it gives a panoramic picture of the political, social, cultural and literary history of the State of Odisha. Published in 1992, it has already got into several editions and has gained the status of a literary classic. The book was chosen for translation into all Indian languages by the National Book Trust under their Aadaan Pradaan scheme, and it has been translated into Hindi, Bengali and English. A film project based on the book is under way. In his translator‚Äôs note to the English translation A Time Elsewhere, published by Penguin Books, Prof. Jatindra K. Nayak has the following to say about the book: It tells the story of the transformation of a traditional society under the impact of colonial rule....it seeks to construct an alternate narrative in which the colonised is not content to be only written about; he is seen as shaping his own destiny. muse India Translations and Editing Besides translating some of his own work in Odia into English, he has also translated other works in different languages into both Odia and English. He has translated Odia Women Poets‚Äô Work into English (with Arlene Zide), Catherine Clement‚Äôs poems from French into English (with the poet), Gulzar‚Äôs poems from Urdu into English, Swedish poet Werner Aspenstrom‚Äôs poems into Odia, a medieval Odia text Lakshmipurana into English and the poetry of Odia Dalit poet Basudev Sunani into English.

Fellowships Das has been awarded the following Fellowships for research and creative writing: * Homi Bhabha Fellow (1979‚Äì1981) for research on Pata Paintings of Odisha * Emeritus Fellow of the Ministry of Culture, Government of India (1994‚Äì1996) * K. K. Birla Foundation Fellowship in Comparative Literature (1996‚Äì1998) Awards * Vishuva Award from Pajatantra Prachar Samiti ‚Äì 1976 and 1984 * Odisha Sahitya Akademi Award ‚Äì 1975 (for Je Jahara Nirjanata) * Sahitya Akademi Award ‚Äì 1990 (for Ahnika). He did not accept the award. * Sarala Award ‚Äì 1998 (for Priya Vidushaka) * Nandikar Playwright Award ‚Äì 2000 * Saraswati Samman ‚Äì 2006 (for Parikrama) Research work Though Odisha temple sculpture and architecture has been studied by scholars for a long time, no such study had been done of the rich tradition of pictorial arts of Odisha. This shortcoming was made good with the publication of Das's Puri Paintings: The Chitrakara and His Work (Arnold- Heinemann, New Delhi and Humanities Press, New Jersey, US) in 1982. It was the first book on the distinctive Pata style of painting of Odisha and received rave reviews on its publication. Eberhard Fischer had the following to say in his review of the book in Artibus Asiae, 2/3 1983: This book is an important contribution to our knowledge of traditional painters‚Äô role and of Orissa‚Äôs rich artistic heritage.... The text is well-written, scholarly and clear. The author, a well-known poet and an administrator, deserves high praise for his direct and unpretentious presentation. J.P.Das, also an amateur painter, has been acquainted since his childhood with traditional Orissan paintings and as a young IAS officer was involved in Handicraft Programmes of the Orissan Government. For his thesis, he lived and worked mainly in Raghurajpur near Puri, observed the painters‚Äô way of life and their working techniques, and conducted interviews. Furthermore, he obtained records from the Puri Temple Administration Office, and searched for relevant Civil Court records of Puri and for documents from the American Friends Service Organisation. He finally visited museums, mainly in Calcutta and London, studying their collections of Pata paintings to form his own ideas about historic questions.....What I enjoyed most when reading this important publication is the clear diction and the well-organised layout. J.P.Das is on the whole unprejudiced as a historian and yet critical in all questions concerning general assumptions. Miloslav Krasa, reviewing the book in Archiv Orientalni 54, 1986, wrote: This study is a basic and valuable contribution to a long-neglected subject, filling yet another lacuna in our knowledge of the social and cultural history of Orissa. Puri Paintings has helped in promoting this painting style in India and abroad and has gained respect and recognition of the painters. J P Das followed up this book with two other books on the pictorial arts of Orissa: Chitra-Pothi: Illustrated Palm-leaf Manuscripts from Orissa ( Arnold-Heinemann, New Delhi and Lotus Press, London, 1985) and Palm-leaf Miniatures: The Art of Raghunath Prusty of Orissa (Abhinav Publications, New Delhi,1991). The first of these books is about the art of illuminating kavya texts from medieval Odia literature on palm-leaves. The second book, written in collaboration with Prof. Joanna Williams of the University of Berkeley, California, is about one such palm-leaf artist, Raghunath Prusty who lived in the second half of the nineteenth century. Both books were highly appreciated and well- reviewed. Prof. Pratapaditya Pal wrote in Marg ( Vol.49 No.3 March 1998) : The recent research and publications by at least two enthusiasts, among others, will redress the balance [neglect of study of Orissan painting] and Orissan Painting will receive the attention it deserves. The scholars are J.P.Das of India and Joanna Williams of the United States Children's/nonsense verses During a period of illness in 1991 J.P.Das wrote some nonsense verses as also some poems for children which were published in 1993 in two books under the titles Alimalika (Publications Division, New Delhi)and Alukuchi-Malukuchi (Lark Books, Bhubaneswar). Both titles mean ‚Äòodds and ends‚Äô in Odia. Children‚Äôs and nonsense writing are rather neglected in Odia and the two books e hence were a pleasant addition to this genre of writing in Odia literature. J P Das himself translated some of the poems from these two books into English and published Alimalika: Children‚Äôs Nonsense Rhymes (Writers Workshop, Calcutta, 2004). In 2008, he published another such collection under the title Anabana ‚Äì also meaning ‚Äòodds and ends‚Äô in Odia ‚Äì (Ink Odisha, Bhubaneswar). Another similar collection by him, written during another period of illness, Aanamaana was published in 2015.

The case represents an equitable exception to the need for a complete transfer of property in law. Facts Mrs Ada Crampton wanted to transfer her 400 shares in a company called Crampton Bros. (Coopers) Ltd to her nephew, Harold. She asked Mr Pennington, who represented the company‚Äôs auditors, to prepare a share transfer form. She filled it in and gave it back to Mr Pennington. Mr Pennington put it on the auditors‚Äô files but never gave it on to the company for the registration of shares in Harold‚Äôs name to be completed. Ada died. The other people who stood to inherit, (including Philip Waine) argued that unlike Re Rose, Ada had not done all she could have, because she had not handed the completed transfer form to Harold or the company. Harold contended that the shares were held on trust for him, so that the transfer must be completed. Judgment The Court of Appeal held that the shares did indeed belong to Harold. Arden LJ held that it would have been unconscionable for Ada to change her mind and go back on the transfer. Ada had given the transfer form to Pennington so that he could do the registration. She had told Harold about the gift, and no action on his part was necessary. Moreover, Harold had agreed to be a company director, for which a shareholding was needed. Clarke LJ held that equitable title could transfer without registration. Completion of forms and delivery to a company was enough in Re Rose, but it should be recognised that delivery to the company was not a further essential step. It was enough that the transfer was intended to have immediate effect. He said the following. Schiemann LJ concurred with Arden LJ.

They orally agreed she would remain rent-free for life in her cottage. He sought to evict her. Judgment Scott LJ held that for a constructive trust: #The conveyance need not be obtained by fraud; #The transfer need not use technical language of a trust; #No weight needed to be given to the fact that the conveyance was at an undervalue. The fraud consists in the denial of the trust. The proprietary right was given to Mrs Bannister under constructive trust.[1948] 2 All ER 133 at page 136 At common law, the promise made to allow Mrs Bannister to stay in the property was not enforceable since it was not recorded in writing (as required by s40 Law of Property Act 1925‚Äînow s2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989).

It held that a trust arose to protect a payment made under a mistake, with the benefit of a proprietary remedy. This is seen important for the question of what response, personal or proprietary, may come from a claim in unjust enrichment. The decision in the case has been subjected to \\"sustained, authoritative criticism\\", both academically and judicially. Facts Chase Manhattan was instructed to pay $2m to the Israel-British Bank, but it paid the sum twice by mistake. The Israel-British Bank subsequently became insolvent and entered into liquidation after Yehoshua Ben-Zion, the managing director, was convicted of embezzling ¬£20 million ($39.4 million) from the bank. Chase Manhattan wished to claim back the money which it had mistakenly paid. However, because the Israel-British Bank was now insolvent, rather than make a claim for a dividend in the liquidation, where it would have to compete with all of the other creditors of the insolvent bank, Chase Manhattan sought to argue that the entire sums were held on trust and so should be returned as part of a proprietary claim to the money. The Israel-British bank had known about the mistake on the part of Chase Manhattan before it went into liquidation. Judgment Goulding J held that Chase Manhattan could recover the full sum, because the money was held on trust from the moment it was received. He said the following.[1981] Ch 105, 119 and 127-128 Criticism The decision has been subject to \\"sustained, authoritative criticism.\\" The case was reviewed in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC by Lord Browne-Wilkinson, and expressed doubts as to the reasoning. He stated \\"I cannot agree with this reasoning. First, it is based on a concept of retaining an equitable property in money where, prior to payment to the recipient bank, there was no existing equitable interest. Further, I cannot understand how the recipient's conscience can be affected at a time when he is not aware of any mistake.\\" at 714. However, his Lordship felt that the case was still correctly decided for other reasons. This view, expressed by way of obiter dictum, was particularly criticised by Peter Birks on the ground that the more straightforward way to establish a claim would be for unjust enrichment, should trigger a proprietary remedy in a similar circumstance, regardless of the position of one's notional conscience. Lord Millett, writing extrajudicially, has also criticised the decision, stating \\"It is easy to agree with Lord Browne-Wilkinson that [Chase Manhattan v Israel-British Bank] was wrongy decided, but it was wrongly decided not because [the transferee] had no notice of the [transferor's] claim ... but because the [claimant] had no proprietary interest for it to have notice of.\\"P.J.

Sinclair ([insofar] as it relied on or followed Heiron and Lister) was partially overruled in July 2014 by the UK Supreme Court in FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC. Facts Between 1995 and 1999 various investors, including Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd, paid money to Trading Partners Ltd to carry out trades in goods. Mr Cushnie was the director, transferred the money to another company he owned called Versailles Trade Finance Ltd, which was meant to engage in the factoring business. Instead, Versailles fraudulently used the money partly simply to pay ‚Äòprofits‚Äô to traders, but also was stolen by Mr Clough, or circulated around other companies so as to appear that genuine business was taking place. Mr Cushnie sold his shares for ¬£28.69m in 1999. Of this money, ¬£9.19m went to the Versailles group, ¬£1m to Mr Clough, ¬£1.75m to traders, ¬£2.25m loan repayment to NatWest, and ¬£11.47m to RBS, of which ¬£1.49m was an overdraft repayment and ¬£9.98m was repayment of the loan secured on the Kensington property. Versailles was discovered, and it was put into receivership. Trading Partners Ltd had lost money because of Versailles activities, and was also put into liquidation in July 2000. On behalf of creditors such as Sinclair, Trading Partners Ltd (now run by the liquidator) claimed a proprietary interest in Mr Cushnie‚Äôs profits from the sale of shares under a constructive trust. Versailles and the banks argued that they could exercise a bona fide purchaser defence. It also claimed to be entitled to the money that passed from Trading Partners to Versailles and were mixed with Versailles‚Äô money, which could be traced into the banks‚Äô hands. Cushnie and Clough were sentenced to jail for six years each (Clough reduced to five) and were disqualified from being directors for 15 and 10 years respectively. Judgment =High Court= Lewison J held that the Court of Appeal decisions in Metropolitan Bank v Heiron and Lister & Co v Stubbs had not been overruled in England, and still remained binding. As to the nature of the proprietary remedy, he held: Here, no trust would arise. TPL had no proprietary interest in the proceeds of the sale of the shares,EWHC, par. 81 and even if they did, the banks were bona fide purchasers, and the claim could not be asserted against them.EWHC, par. 98, 142 However, TPL did have a proprietary claim to money passed to Versailles, that Versailles mixed with its own, and could thus trace it into the sums given by the receivers to the banks.EWHC, par. 168 =Court of Appeal= In a unanimous decision, the appeal and cross-appeal were dismissed.EWCA, par. 161 Neuberger MR held that the old Court of Appeal authority was binding, and TPL only had a personal claim in equity over the assets. On appeal, the questions were:EWCA, par. 31 #Did T have a proprietary interest in the proceeds from the sale of shares? #Could it claim against the banks, or did they have a 'bona fide purchaser defence? #Was the limit on tracing correct? In its appeal, TPL argued that Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid should be followed. Neuberger responded: TPL had no proprietary claim over the proceeds from the sale of shares. Although the share profits could not have been received without Mr C having had his fiduciary office, the proceeds were not beneficially owned by TPL. The claimant could not get a proprietary interest rather than an equitable account for the money acquired in breach of trust, unless it had already been beneficially the property of the beneficiary, or the trustee acquired it by taking advantage of an opportunity or right that was properly that of the beneficiary.EWCA, par. 88 This should be distinguished from property obtained simply by being in the position of a fiduciary. There was a personal claim in equity to the funds. Mr C did not owe trustee like duties in relation to the shares Even if TPL had a proprietary claim over the proceeds of sale of the shares, the banks had had no notice of it when they received, and so Lewison J was entitled to decide that the banks took free of the claim.EWCA, par. 122 The banks had no notice of TPL‚Äôs proprietary interest in the mixed fund before the time it was claimed back. The general rule for tracing is that \\"If a man mixes trust funds with his own, the whole will be treated as trust property, except so far as he may be able to distinguish what is his own.\\", quoted with approval in , at EWCA, par. 140 This should be determined by the court on a balance of probabilities.EWCA, par. 141 In this case, the banks and receivers had acted in good faith, even though they might have properly sought legal advice about whether there was a proprietary interest in the mixed fund.EWCA, par. 146 Richards LJ and Hughes LJ concurred. Significance Lord Neuberger's analysisEWCA, par. 8889 divides into three broad categories the situations in which a fiduciary obtains a benefit in breach of fiduciary duty: #where the benefit is or was an asset belonging beneficially to the principal, #where the benefit has been obtained by the fiduciary by taking an advantage of an opportunity which was properly that of the principal, and #all other cases. While benefits in the first two categories will give rise to a constructive trust, those in the third category will not. However, one should also keep in mind the Supreme Court's decision in FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC, where bribes or secret commissions accepted by an agent will be held in trust for his principal. Sinclair has been viewed as a controversial decisionespecially in its conclusion that a proprietary interest did not arise, as proprietary rights carry priority in an insolvency, which is of central importance in a pyramid scheme such as that operated by Mr C. It is also argued that it will no longer be as easy to strip a recipient of a bribe or the profits made from it, or to trace it into the hands of third parties. It is at variance with other jurisdictions in the Commonwealth and the United States: the Federal Court of Australia preferred to follow Reid instead,. as has the British Columbia Court of Appeal., applying It should be borne in mind, however, that Sinclair ([insofar] as it relied on or followed Heiron and Lister) was (partially) overruled in July 2014 by the United Kingdom Supreme Court, in FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC.

The park is surrounded by the Mounts, Kingsley and Semilong estates. Due to the historical links of the Racecourse to Northampton's history, it remains one of the town's famous landmarks. As implied by its name, the Racecourse once staged regular horse racing meetings, however, these ceased in 1904 due to a high number of accidents, which included fatalities, caused by the sharpness of the track.  Geography  Located about 500 metres to the north of Northampton town centre, The Racecourse comprises around 118 acres parkland and includes public footpaths, changing rooms and open space. Access to the Racecourse from main roads includes via the Barrack Road (A508), Kingsley Road (A5095) and East Park Parade / Kettering Road (A5123). It can also be accessed from St George's Avenue (north-west), Colwyn Road, Beaconsfield Terrace and Leicester Street via the Mounts Estate.  History  From 1632, unofficial race meetings were held at Northampton Heath, the name originally given to the area including the Racecourse because of its location between the Kettering Road (A5123) and the Market Harborough Road (A508). Races continued here until 1681, when they were stopped due to the number of accidents. The park is believed to have been used from 1778 to 1882 as an area where freemen had grazing rights under the 1778 Act of Enclosure. Between these dates the Racecourse was known simply as the Freeman's Common. In 1882 when Commoners lost their right to graze cattle, the land was sold on by the Northampton Corporation Act. The park was then used by the public as a general recreation ground. Race meetings resumed in 1727, with the help of Lord Spencer, and in 1737 the first official race meet was held on the new course. The races were well-attended and frequently visited by royalty, including the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII. In 1844 new stands were erected on the site at a cost of more than ¬£2000. The racecourse was left-handed (anti-clockwise) around the park and a hotel was erected on the north-eastern corner of the park, now on the corner of Kingsley Road and Kingsley Park Terrace. The hotel known then as the Kingsley Park Hotel was built in 1889. It served as a residential club for ardent racegoers but was closed in 1904 following a fatal accident involving spectators. The Jockey Club left it empty for eighteen years, during which time local residents started to refer to it as \\"The White Elephant\\" - an epithet still used today. Gypsies camped along what was then known as Gypsy Lane (now Kingsley Road) where downhill towards Kingsthorpe \\"The Romany\\" pub is situated. = Public executions = From 1715 to 1818, the park was frequently used for public executions. The Racecourse has been the scene of hundreds of hangings. Condemned convicts were taken by cart to the gallows on the Racecourse. These marches were said to be intimidating and unruly, with huge crowds in attendance. One of the most famous executions was that of four members of the Culworth Gang who operated for two decades until 1787. Two of the gang, William Pettifer (alias \\"Peckover\\") and Richard Law were caught by police at an inn in Towcester. It is reported the two had arrived with bags, which they said contained birds as they had been cockfighting, however the landlord discovered that the bags contained the notorious masks and smocks which the gang used to hide their identity. Eventually, following a robbery in Blakesley the pair were served with search warrants and police constables found stolen property. The gang admitted forty-seven offences and were hanged at midday on Northampton Racecourse on 4 August. 5,000 people turned up to witness the hanging as the Culworth Gang were said to have terrorised as far as Oxford. > As was the fashion of the time, the condemned were supplied with drink at > the last inn on the way to the Racecourse ‚Äî the Bantam Cock on Abington > Square. The last executions on the Racecourse took place on Friday, March > 27th 1818 and were those of James Cobbett and George Wilkin found guilty of > passing forged bank notes. As usual, a large crowd assembled to witness the > scene. = 20th century = Before the turn of the 20th century, race meetings held were becoming increasingly dangerous leading to yet more fatal accidents with jockeys and spectators due to the Racecourse's 'pathways across the course, roving spectators and the sharpness of the bends'. Racing was suspended on 31 March 1904 prior to being permanently withdrawn the following September. By 1912, the council had turned the area into a sports recreation ground. During the First World War the park was used as an army base for the Welsh Division which included 16,000 men and 7,000 horses. In 1917 the park was ploughed up for wartime allotments, and in 1923 a new playground was built (on the side next to East Park Parade) as well as changing rooms and a restaurant converted from the old Racecourse stand and law houses which to this present day stands as the Jade Pavilion (circa 1930), a Grade II listed building. At the White Elephant junction, a tram shelter was built in 1924 which would have been used to serve the electric tram system up the Kettering Road however motor buses were said to have been already used in 1923 leaving the shelter redundant. During the Second World War, the Racecourse was again used as a barracks. In 1941, a Stirling bomber crashed into Gold Street in the town centre. Wreckage spread to George's Row but did not affect All Saints Church. The bomber's crew had baled out over Northampton and a body later found on the Racecourse was said to be that of the pilot. The park was returned to its now green state sometime between 1942 and 1948. Football, bowls, cricket and rugby were once again became the activities commonly played on the Racecourse. = Modern-day history = In 1974, the park was used as an International heat of the Eurovision contest Jeux Sans Frontiers. From 1990, during mid-August the Racecourse held the locally popular Northampton Balloon Festival. The festival drew tens of thousands of people for just under two decades (until 2008) and was seen as a similar event held on a larger scale in Bristol. Due to poor attendances due to a combination of bad weather and festival income, the council moved the festival to Billing Aquadrome. The Umbrella Fair based at the Pavilion building have an annual event boasting over 10 stages, arts and family events with over 20.000 visitors every August.  Sporting activities  The Racecourse remains one of the most popular places in Northampton for amateur football, cricket, rugby union, tennis, Parkrun, fitness and bowls. Over twenty Sunday League football teams use the park as their venue each weekend from early autumn to late spring. The changing rooms were redesigned to meet F.A. standards In 2007 ¬£1 million was spent on new changing room facilities adjacent to the Colwyn Road end behind the Jade Pavilion. Prior to that, the Pavilion was used by players as changing rooms but a series of leaks and a lack of hot water meant that by 2005, plans for the new facilities were warranted. Bad luck continued to hamper the building's use as in 2010, Legionella bacteria were found resulting in the changing rooms being closed three times in five years. The most recent of these occasions occurred in May 2012. By 2010 the Racecourse welcomed another development which saw the council spend ¬£85,000 on an adventure park space including a zip wire, climbing frame complex and five-person buddy swing. A Parkrun takes place each week comprising two laps of the racecourse.http://www.parkrun.org.uk/northampton/course/  Use in everyday Northampton  It is estimated that thousands of members of public use the park each week, the Racecourse sits adjacent to a park campus by the University of Northampton locally known as Avenue Campus and is used regularly by students. The Umbrella Fair Cafe and The Medieval Restaurant are both in the Listed Pavilion Building. Car parking is situated adjacent to the building and public toilet inside. There are playgrounds, a basketball court and a bowling green situated nearby.  Crime  Often blamed for its proximity to the town centre by authorities, the Racecourse has attracted a reputation as an area with high crime levels. On 22 June 1997 22-year-old Ryan McEwen King was sexually assaulted and murdered in bushes around the basketball courts on the Racecourse after walking back at night from a nearby pub. Her killer Raymond Ellis, unemployed was later jailed. In 2006, the park regularly made front-page news locally for its high levels of day and night-time robberies and assaults, leading to the Northampton Chronicle & Echo newspaper setting up The Friends of Northampton Racecourse (FONR). The partnership looked at reclaiming the Racecourse from the criminals, with its campaign eventually gaining respect from a national broadsheet The Guardian. The group continues to support the park's heritage and image.

Geology Detail of the area around the Santa Clara Avenue field, showing its location relative to Ventura, Oxnard, and Camarillo. Yellow dots represent locations of active oil wells as of 2008. The Oxnard field is within the Ventura Basin Province of southern California. Geologically, this area is part of a structural downwarp that occurred during the late Pliocene. Deposition within the basin occurred fast enough to fill it with up to seven kilometers of sedimentary rock in only five million years. While most of the rocks filling the basin are marine sediments, some igneous rocks from the Conejo Volcanics series overlie them.Richards, 1-3 Oil accumulations, which are common in the Ventura Basin, mainly occur in anticlinal settings modified by faulting. Stratigraphy is also influential in creating traps for hydrocarbons. Where the sedimentary rocks are sandstones with high porosity, and the structure and stratigraphy allow hydrocarbons to be trapped on their upward migration, oilfields are found.Keller, Margaret. Ventura Basin Province. 1988, Dept. of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey. p. 1. Available here. In the Santa Clara Avenue field, oil is trapped in numerous thin layers of oil sands within the Sespe Formation, of Oligocene age. Oil is trapped updip where it encounters the impermeable Conejo Volcanics.DOGGR, 470 This igneous unit was originally thought to be a canyon fill, but more recently has been interpreted to be a quickly cooling, finely crystalline intrusion.Richards, 30-33 Because the surface of the Oxnard Plain is flat, giving no hint of the subsurface structure potentially containing oil, the region was overlooked by early drillers. In spite of discoveries on all sides -- the Oxnard field to the south, the Ventura field to the northeast, and the South Mountain and Saticoy fields to the northeast -- the field was not found until 1972, by prospectors exploring the edge of the Epworth Syncline. Two productive pools were found, both in the Sespe Formation, separated by an igneous intrusion. The finds were in January 1972 and July 1973. Oil is found at great depth -- 9,000 feet in the first pool and 8,600 the other -- and is generally medium-grade, with API gravity of 16 to 28, with a sulfur content of about two percent by weight. History, production, and operations The discovery well for the field was drilled by McCulloch Oil Corp. in 1972. The first oil companies on the field quickly delineated its limits, finding a second productive pool a year and a half later. Oil companies active on the field during its history included Tenneco Oil Co, ARCO, Chevron, and Concordia Resources. Peak production from the field was in 1977. Venoco bought the field between 1994 and 1996, with some working interest remaining to the predecessor companies.Venoco, 2011 10-K, 12 All drilling on the field is done from two drilling islands set back about 100 yards from Santa Clara Avenue. Oil is stored in tanks at the southernmost of the two drilling islands. As of December 31, 2011, there were 17 producing oil wells on the field. Another two wells were used for water disposal.

It was located to the west of the city of Woudrichem, in the Land van Altena. Between 1812 and 1950 the territory was divided between as many as four municipalities, namely Almkerk, Rijswijk, North Brabant, De Werken en Sleeuwijk and Woudrichem. In the 21st century Honswijk belongs for most of its former area to Woudrichem, with a small section belonging to Werkendam. The territory consists of three polders, namely Ruigenhoek, P. Honswijk and Oudbroek, the latter also being a small hamlet. Honswijk has an estimated population of 35.A.M. Schouten, \\"Historische Gemeenten van Nederland en hun Vlaggen\\", 2012.  History  The village of Honswijk was inhabited already in the 11th century, but written history commences in 1264, with the foundation of a monastic grange, adhering to the Berne Abbey. The area was then further cultivated and the settlement grew, enjoying support from the Lord of Altena. A chapel, known as the \\"blaue caemer\\", was consecrated in 1364, dedicated to Saint Nicholas.\\"Een verdwenen dorp\\", Information panel on the roadside in Honswijk. in 1421 the area was devastated by the St. Elizabeth's Flood. The chapel and the abbey were badly destroyed and the village grounds were only regained from the water after forty years. Even though attempts of reconstruction by the abbey were initiated, the religious order lost its influence after the Reformation in the 16th century. Honswijk, along with its buildings gradually disappeared from the map. By the time of the introduction of the municipal system in the early 19th century, only its polders and water board remained.  Miscellaneous  Up until the 1920s, four polder windmills were located in Honswijk. Three of them (Rijswijk, Honswijk and Uppel) were destroyed or removed by 1930, leaving only the Uitwijkse Molen still standing. The flag of Honswijk is horizontally divided into three stripes of red, yellow and white, with over the center an armorial shield depicting a white carbuncle on a blue field.

Irwin was a right-handed batsman. He was born at Didsbury, Lancashire. Irwin was an acting sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy in 1905. It was in September of that year that he was given the full rank of sub-lieutenant. In April 1907, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Irwin made his debut for the Royal Navy in first-class cricket against the British Army at Lord's in June 1914, a match in which he scored his maiden half century in his first innings, with a score of 66 opening the batting. Irwin served in the Royal Navy during World War I, and at some point during the conflict he obtained the rank of lieutenant commander. Following the war, he was promoted to the rank of commander on 31 December 1918. In June 1919 he made a second first-class appearance for the Royal Navy, in a match against Cambridge University at Fenner's, making scores of 2 and 0 in a heavy loss for the Royal Navy. Irwin later joined Cornwall, most likely while posted at HMNB Devonport in Plymouth, with his debut for the county coming against Devon in the 1921 Minor Counties Championship. He played Minor counties cricket for Cornwall until 1925, making 41 appearances during that time. Playing for Cornwall made Irwin eligible to be selected for a combined Minor Counties team, appearing in one first-class match for the team in 1924 against HDG Leveson Gower's XI at The Saffrons, Eastbourne. Dismissed for a duck by Francis Browne in their first-innings, he improved in their second-innings with a score of 80, his second first-class half century. In that same season he appeared in another first-class match for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University at Lord's, though he had little success in this match. After retiring from the Royal Navy, Irwin joined the Foreign Office as a Vice consul in the General Consular Service. Irwin was later added the British Army reserve list with the rank of captain shortly after the start of World War II in September 1939. He served at some point in the war with the Black Watch, continued to serve with them until 1948, when age forced him to relinquish his command, after which he was granted the honorary rank of major. Irwin later died at Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, on 12 January 1958. His grandfather, Frank Wright, was a first-class cricketer in the 1820s and 1830s.

Austria-Hungary‚Äôs declaration of war on Serbia on 28 July 1914 marked the beginning of the First World War. After three unsuccessful Austro-Hungarian offensives between August and December 1914, a combined Austro-Hungarian and German offensive breached Serbian territory from the north and west in October 1915 while the Bulgarian army attacked from the south-east. By January 1916, all of Serbia was occupied by the Central Powers. Serbia was divided into two separate occupation zones, Bulgarian and Austro- Hungarian, both ruled by a military administration. The Austro-Hungarian occupation zone covered the northern three-quarters of Serbia, its military administration was set up with a governor and a civil commissioner at its head with the goal of denationalizing the Serb population and turn the country into a territory from which to draw food and exploit its economic resources. In addition to a severe military legal system, banning all political organizations, forbidding public assembly, and bringing schools under its control, a ruthless system of economic exploitation was instituted. Uprisings were crushed with the harshest measures, including public hanging and shooting. During the occupation between 150,000 and 200,000 men, women, and children were deported to camps, built for that purpose in Austro-Hungarian territories, most notably Mauthausen in Austria, Auschwitz in Austrian Poland, and Gy√∂r in Hungary. The breakthrough of the Salonika front in October 1918 followed by the liberation of Belgrade on 1 November brought to an end the occupation of the country.  Background  After the assassination of the Habsburg heir Franz Ferdinand by a Bosnian Serb student, the prestige of Austria-Hungary necessitated a punishing attack on the State that they deemed responsible. The Austrian military leadership was determined to destroy Serbian independence, which they saw as an unacceptable threat to the future of the empire and its large south Slav population. On 28 July 1914, one month after the murder of the Archduke and his wife, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, Habsburg batteries at Semlin on the Sava River immediately began hostilities by bombarding Belgrade, effectively beginning the First World War. Operations against Serbia were placed in the hands of Feldzeugmeister Oskar Potiorek, Governor-General of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the morning of 12 August 1914 the first invasion of Serbia began. =First occupation= Territory of the Military Governorate in Serbia (in dark grey) During the first punitive expedition of August, Austro-Hungarian forces occupied Serbian territories for 13 days, that occupation turned into a brutal war of annihilation, accompanied by mass violence against civilians; during that period between 3,500 and 4,000 Serb civilians were killed in executions and random violence by marauding troops. Mass execution took place in numerous northern Serbia towns. On 17 August 1914, in the Serbian town of ≈†abac, 120 residents, mostly women, children and old men, who had previously been locked in the church, were shot and buried in the churchyard by Austro-Hungarian troops on the orders of Field Marshal Lieutenant Kasimir von L√ºtgendorf. These type of attacks did not take place in the turmoil of the battle, but according to plan and by following orders of superiors. Swiss criminologist pioneer Professor Archibald Reiss reported on the multiple atrocities committed by the Austro-Hungarian Army in a report that was presented at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. A second invasion in November captured Belgrade, the conquered territory was divided into five county commands (). Austro-Hungarian Croat Field-Marshall Stjepan Sarkotiƒá was appointed Governor-General of the Military Governorate in Belgrade, concentration camps were set up and tens of thousands of Serbs interned. By mid-December the Serbs managed, against all odds, to defeat the invaders at the battle of Kolubara and repel them out of the country by 15 December. Humiliation at the hands of a small Balkan peasant kingdom badly wounded the pride and prestige of the dual monarchy and its military but although Austria-Hungary had failed to crush Serbia, the Serbs had exhausted their military abilities. Germany urged Austria-Hungary to restore lost prestige by yet another offensive, but without Bulgarian participation in an offensive against Serbia, the Austro-Hungarian commander-in-chief would not consider it until almost a year later. =The campaign of the central powers= In September 1915 a secret agreement and a military convention was signed between the Central Powers and Bulgaria in Plessa. In October Serbia fell to a combined German, Austro-Hungarian, and Bulgarian invasion that followed the offensive of the Central Powers. The massive superiority in numbers and equipment of the invaders, especially in artillery, as well as the failed intervention by British and French troops, meant that the campaign was complete within 6 weeks. The defeated Serbian army did not surrender but retreated across the mountains of Albania and Montenegro into exile with the government, the royal house and hundred of thousands of civilians. The Serb Army spent the rest of the war fighting against Bulgarian and German troops on the Salonika front. Towards the end of 1915, Serbia was divided among the victors who each set up harsh occupational regimes. Administration and governance Shortly after the retreat of the Serbian army, the Austro- Hungarian occupation zone was divided into thirteen approximately equal provinces () which were then additionally divided into sixty-four districts (), with the city of Belgrade as its own district. The Austro-Hungarian administrative zone stretched from the region west of the Morava valley to Macedonia; the areas east of the Morava, Macedonia itself and most of Kosovo fell under Bulgarian rule, tensions between Austria and Bulgaria regarding the Albanian-inhabited Serbian territory culminated in March 1916 with a military confrontation. Austria and Hungary both supported the repatriation on Muslim refugees in occupied territory in order to weaken Serbia and strengthen the Muslim presence. A German occupation zone was established in the area east of Velika Morava, Ju≈æna Morava in Kosovo and the Vardar valley, the Germans took control of railways, mines and agricultural resources. On 1 January 1916 the Austro-Hungarian supreme command ordered the formation of a military governorate, the (Military Governorate in Serbia or MGG/S) was established, with Belgrade as its administrative centre. The occupation was subordinated to the Austro-Hungarian Armeeoberkommando (Army High Command or AOK), under Franz Conrad von Hoetzendorff and later Arthur Arz von Strau√üenburg. The Military Governorate of occupation was headed by a General Governor with the rank of a corps commander. left rightThe first Governor General, Johann Graf Salis- Seewis, a Croat by ethnicity with experience of fighting insurgents in Macedonia, had been commander of the 42nd Honv√©d Infantry Division, an entirely Croatian Division known as or Devil‚Äôs Division, later found responsible of war crimes during the first Serbian campaign. Salis-Seewis was appointed in late 1915 by the Emperor, taking offically office on 1 January 1916. A civilian commissar in charged with all matters of civilian administration, Dr. Ludwig (Lajos) von Thall√≥czy, a prominent historian and specialist in Balkan affairs, was appointed by the Hungarian government as his deputy, he arrived in Belgrade on 17 January 1916. The separation of power quickly led to multiple clashes between civilian and military authorities as well as between Austrian and Hungarian authorities, Salis-Seewis' policies would lead to Serbia's annexation which Thall√≥czy, following the Hungarian prime minister‚Äôs directives, strongly opposed. After touring Serbia in May, Hungarian Prime Minister Count Tisza was alarmed by what he saw as Austrian's military efforts to make the occupation a prelude to annexation, he submitted a complaint to Foreign Minister Baron Buri√°n asking for a thorough reorganisation of the Military Governorate, the removal of Salis-Seewis and the condemnation of annexationist policy in Serbia; Burian took the complaint straight to the Emperor. By the Emperor‚Äôs decision of 6 July 1916, Salis- Seewis and his chief of staff, Colonel Gelinek were replaced by his former corps commander, General Adolf Freiherr von Rhemen and Colonel Hugo Kerchnawe on 26 July, Rhemen remained in office until the end of the war. Thall√≥czy was killed in a train crash while returning to Belgrade from Vienna in December 1916, in January 1917 Teodor Ku≈°eviƒá a high-ranking functionary from Bosnia- Herzegovina was appointed Civilian Commissioner to replace him. With the Austrians in charge of the military, the administration was mainly formed by Hungarians and Croats. Four administrative departments were set up, military, economic, judicial and political with the latter, which had its own intelligence and police, under future Usta≈°e leader Major Slavko Kvaternik. =System of occupation= The first measure of the occupiers was the inauguration of a new legal system that would prevent guerilla resistance and exploit Serbia‚Äôs economic resources, for this the Austro-Hungarian control over the population was done in accordance with \\"Directives for the Political Administration in the Areas of the General Military Governorate in Serbia\\" () and \\"General Principles for the Imperial and Royal Military Administration in the Occupied Territories of Serbia\\" (). MGG/S intended to ignore Hungarian objections and integrate Serbia as a part of the empire, but as an area which would remain under direct military rule for decades after the end of the war and where political participation would be prohibited. Life under the occupation =Denationalization and depoliticization of the population= Damaged buildings in ≈†abac, western Serbia. The policies of the Military Governorate of Serbia aimed to depoliticize and denationalize the Serb population since political and national awareness were perceived by the army to be the existential danger to the empire. Public assembly and political parties were banned, the Cyrillic alphabet was termed (dangerous to the state) and banned from schools and public spaces, streets were renamed and traditional Serbian clothing was proscribed. Teachers were brought from Austria, all Serbian students had to educated in the German language, according to Austrian academic standards. Publishing houses and bookshops were closed down. Political expression was severely limited with the prohibition of newspaper publication, except the official organ of propaganda MGG/S's Belgrader Nachrichten (published in Serbian as ), which featured letters and attractive photographs of ordinary life in the homeland. = Repression = The fear of a lev√©e en masse captured the imagination of the army, causing it to engage in conflict with the population through hostage-taking, reprisals, and summary justice; military law was employed to overcome Serbian national resistance and severe preventive measures were undertaken against civilians. Disarming the populace was done by holding village elders responsible for handing over a certain quota of weapons that were judged to be held before the war began. There were summary executions at the hands of the Austro-Hungarian authorities with little or no legal process. Military courts even tried Serbians for the crime of (insulting the Emperor or his family). If civilians were suspected to be engaging in resisting, they would face the harshest measures, including hanging and shooting. The house of the offending Serbian‚Äôs family would also be destroyed. = Deportation and forced labour = 224x224px After taking office Governor-General Salis-Seewis rounded up 70,000 ‚Äòdissidents‚Äô in internment camps. During the occupation between 150,000 and 200,000 men, women, and children were deported to camps. The largest-scale deportations took place from mid-August to the end of October 1916 after Romania declared war. A large portion of Serbian political, intellectual and cultural elite had left the country already during the Serbian army's retreat through Albania, the remaining ones, including many university professors, teachers, and priest, especially those who had participated in political, cultural or even sports societies were arrested by the authorities and deported. In addition to those despatched to concentration camps in Hungary, some 30,000 Serb civilians were sent to Austrian camps or used as forced labour. Those large scale deportations caused concern around Europe, in April 1917 the Vatican intervened, through the office of the Roman Catholic Church in Austria, against the internment of women and Serbian children between ten and fifteen years old in camps. = Economic exploitation and Famine = Austro-Hungarian reports on the state of Serbia in 1915 noted famine threatening the occupation zone and a population in a desperate state after nearly four years of constant war. Late 1915 reports spoke of the necessity of receiving urgent relief to avoid disaster. The return of refugees exacerbated the shortage of food. Harvest yields and produced goods had to be turned over to authorities; food was rationed, Serbia was to become the breadbasket for the army. News of the famine happening in Serbia spread across the world, American, Swiss and Swedish humanitarian organisations offered assistance. According to Red Cross reports, starvation killed more than 8,000 Serbs during the first winter, at the same time figures from the Habsburg High Command reported that 170,000 cattle, 190,000 sheep, and 50,000 pigs had been exported to Austria-Hungary by mid-May 1917. The exploitation of mines failed to satisfy the need for vital raw materials because Germany took two-thirds of all production from Serbia as reparations for its military aid. = Resistance = Immediately after the withdrawal of the Serbian army and the introduction of the military government, armed individuals and small groups of insurgents, made of former soldiers who had remained in the country started to appear, with the clear intention of waging a guerrilla campaign against the occupying forces. Komitadjis as the Army frequently called Serb chetniks were deemed outside international law and were to be ‚Äòcompletely wiped out‚Äô. In March 1916, General Conrad von H√∂tzendorf ordered that all resistance be destroyed with ruthless severity. Despite the repression, those guerilla groups managed to survive and when the Allied offensive started in the Summer of 1918 they proved themselves to be very valuable. Town officials and citizens were warned to not give or accept bribes. In Kru≈°evac, the local military commander forbidded any bribery, corruption, or defamation of \\"loyal citizens\\" Former Prime Minister of Serbia Jovan Avakumoviƒá attempted to suggest to Governor- General Johann Graf Salis-Seewis to issue a joint proclamation for the restoration of peace and order. Avakumoviƒá's proposal was turned down, and the suggestion that he sign his name next to Salis-Seewis angered the Governor so much that it led to Avakumoviƒá's arrest and internment. In late September 1916, the Serbian High Command flew in the experienced chetnik guerrilla leader Kosta Milovanoviƒá Peƒáanac from Thessaloniki to organize resistance in Serbia. In February 1917, a force of 4,000 armed men and women managed to liberate an area in the Morava valley before the uprising was put down. The Austro-Hungarian military reported from the Summer of 1917 20,000 Serbs dead and the escape of 2,600 into the forests. Liberation With the offensive on the Macedonian front and in particular the success of French and Serbian troops at Dobro Polje, Bulgarian troops could not resist and capitulated on 29 September. New Austro-Hungarian and German troops sent from Ukraine were unable to stop Serbian troops as part of Allied forces advancing north. On 29 October Governor-General von Rhemen and his staff left the country, the next day on 30 October Belgrade was liberated by Serbian troops, after four years of occupation the country was free of foreign presence.

Founded in 2000, the Enerkem technology converts pretreated municipal solid waste into transportation fuels and chemicals. Manufactured from waste biomass, instead of fossil sources like petroleum and natural gas, Enerkem's technology produces ethanol and renewable chemicals that are used in a broad range of industrial and consumer applications. Enerkem owns an innovation centre in Westbury. The company's first commercial facility is in Edmonton, Alberta. The company has two similar facilities under development in Varennes, Quebec and Rotterdam. Enerkem is majority-owned by institutional, clean-technology and industrial investors, including BlackRock, Braemar Energy Ventures, Cycle Capital, Fonds de solidarite FTQ, Fondaction CSN, Investissement Qu√©bec, National Bank of Canada, Rho Ventures, Sinobioway, Suncor, The Westly Group, Valero and Waste Management. In 2018, Enerkem raised the biggest cleantech deal in the history of Canada's venture market following a $280 million round in new financing. History Dr. Esteban Chornet (Ph.D. from Lehigh University; Professor Emeritus from Sherbrooke University) conceived the idea for a waste-conversion technology after being inspired by his father, who used wood waste from his sawmill to make electricity in the late 1930s in Mallorca, Spain. In 2000, Dr. Chornet co-founded Enerkem with his son Vincent Chornet. Under Vincent Chornet's expert guidance, Enerkem has established itself as an entrepreneurial leader in the field of advanced biofuels and green chemicals and grown to over 200 employees. Vincent Chornet, as President and CEO, was the guiding force behind Enerkem‚Äôs development from 2000 to 2019, obtaining over C$750 million in private financing and government support, and growing the company to 200 employees. Enerkem started operating its very first commercial facility in Edmonton, Canada, and additional biorefineries are currently being developed in North America and around the world.

He authored several books, notably, Behind Mud Walls, The Hindu Jajmani System, and many more. Early life He was born in Pottstown, Pennsylvania in 1890,U.S. Passport Applications, 1795‚Äì1925 and graduated from the University of Chicago. In 1933, while on furlough, he did his PhD in rural social organisation at Cornell University. He was married to Charlotte Melina Viall in December, 1916, at Allahabad, India. They had three sons. He was sent as a rural-missionary by Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church, US, in 1915. Missionary work He began missionary work by initially teaching at Allahabad Agricultural Institute, later joined by his wife Charlotte Viall, who arrived in India in 1916. He then served as a professor of rural sociology at the North India Theological College, Sahranpur, between 1933 and 1941, after he finished his doctorate from Cornell University. During their first term, his wife did teaching, social work, and worked at industrial cooperatives in Kanpur and Allahabad. He also directed the students in practical work in nearby villages. Between 1925 and 1930, they lived in the village as members of the North India mission of the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America. Thereafter they maintained close connections with the villagers from their mission headquarters in a nearby town. Their first account of life in Karimpur was published in 1930 as Behind Mud Walls. He later became a resident scholar at Cornell University where, with the assistance of the rural sociology department, he prepared The Hindu Jajmani System: A Socio-Economic System Interrelating Members of a Hindu Village Community in Services in 1936. In 1925, after six years of teaching at the Allahabad Agriculture College in India, they surveyed the farming community to better understand the agriculture conditions and life situations facing his students. The survey turned into a detailed study of Indian village life, that ultimately extended till 1930 leading to several books to be published, including his doctoral dissertation Social Institutions of a Hindu Village in North India, that he submitted to Cornell University in 1933. During their second term, they worked at Mainpuri , Uttar Pradesh. They lived in a village Karimganj, which falls under Mainpuri district, to get to know the village people and village life. Most of his works reflects life in Karimpur between 1925 and 1930. Both he and his wife began serving rural societies, conducting surveys, and performing extensive studies of social, economical, and religious life of rural peasants. Their intensive research and experience led to pioneering work in Indian Anthropology and publishing of books, namely, Behind Mud Walls in collaboration with Charlotte Wiser, The Hindu Jajmani System, and Social institutions of a Hindu village in North India, and more. These books have become a standard text that is still taught in colleges and universities throughout United States, particularly in Iowa state. From 1945 to 1960, both Wisers were instrumental in the development of India Village Service, a demonstration project for the improvement of village life. It later became India's Block Development Program at Marehra, Etah district, Uttar Pradesh. He also collected Indian folklore stories and songs. These stories and songs were translated from Hindi to English. He was a co-opted member of the Tambaram meeting of the International Missionary Council in 1938, and his research is quoted extensively in The Economic Basis of the Church. He died in 1961 in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, having retired in 1959.

These inequalities can be considered rules about how to bound calculations involving probabilities without assuming independence or, indeed, without making any dependence assumptions whatsoever. The Fr√©chet inequalities are closely related to the Boole‚ÄìBonferroni‚ÄìFr√©chet inequalities, and to Fr√©chet bounds. If Ai are logical propositions or events, the Fr√©chet inequalities are :Probability of a logical conjunction (&) ::max(0, P(A1) + P(A2) + ... + P(An) ‚àí (n ‚àí 1)) ‚â§ P(A1 & A2 & ... & An) ‚â§ min(P(A1), P(A2), ..., P(An)), :Probability of a logical disjunction (‚à®) ::max(P(A1), P(A2), ..., P(An)) ‚â§ P(A1 ‚à® A2 ‚à® ... ‚à® An) ‚â§ min(1, P(A1) + P(A2) + ... + P(An)), where P( ) denotes the probability of an event or proposition. In the case where there are only two events, say A and B, the inequalities reduce to :Probability of a logical conjunction (&) ::max(0, P(A) + P(B) ‚àí 1) ‚â§ P(A & B) ‚â§ min(P(A), P(B)), :Probability of a logical disjunction (‚à®) ::max(P(A), P(B)) ‚â§ P(A ‚à® B) ‚â§ min(1, P(A) + P(B)). The inequalities bound the probabilities of the two kinds of joint events given the probabilities of the individual events. For example, if A is \\"has lung cancer\\", and B is \\"has mesothelioma\\", then A & B is \\"has both lung cancer and mesothelioma\\", and A ‚à® B is \\"has lung cancer or mesothelioma or both diseases\\", and the inequalities relate the risks of these events. Note that logical conjunctions are denoted in various ways in different fields, including AND, &, ‚àß and graphical AND- gates. Logical disjunctions are likewise denoted in various ways, including OR, , ‚à®, and graphical OR-gates. If events are taken to be sets rather than logical propositions, the set-theoretic versions of the Fr√©chet inequalities are :Probability of an intersection of events ::max(0,P(A) + P(B) ‚àí 1) ‚â§ P(A ‚à© B) ‚â§ min(P(A), P(B)), :Probability of a union of events ::max(P(A), P(B)) ‚â§ P(A ‚à™ B) ‚â§ min(1, P(A) + P(B)). Numerical examples If the probability of an event A is P(A) = a = 0.7, and the probability of the event B is P(B) = b = 0.8, then the probability of the conjunction, i.e., the joint event A & B, is surely in the interval : P(A & B) ‚àà [max(0, a + b ‚àí 1), min(a, b)] :::: = [max(0, 0.7 + 0.8‚àí1), min(0.7, 0.8)] :::: = [0.5, 0.7]. Likewise, the probability of the disjunction A ‚à® B is surely in the interval : P(A ‚à® B) ‚àà [max(a, b), min(1, a + b)] :::: = [max(0.7, 0.8), min(1, 0.7 + 0.8)] :::: = [0.8, 1]. These intervals are contrasted with the results obtained from the rules of probability assuming independence, where the probability of the conjunction is P(A & B) = a √ó b = 0.7 √ó 0.8 = 0.56, and the probability of the disjunction is P(A ‚à® B) = a + b ‚àí a √ó b = 0.94. When the marginal probabilities are very small (or large), the Fr√©chet intervals are strongly asymmetric about the analogous results under independence. For example, suppose P(A) = 0.000002 = 2√ó10‚àí6 and P(B) = 0.000003 = 3√ó10‚àí6. Then the Fr√©chet inequalities say P(A & B) is in the interval [0, 2√ó10‚àí6], and P(A ‚à® B) is in the interval [3√ó10‚àí6, 5√ó10‚àí6]. If A and B are independent, however, the probability of A & B is 6√ó10‚àí12 which is, comparatively, very close to the lower limit (zero) of the Fr√©chet interval. Similarly, the probability of A ‚à® B is 4.999994√ó10‚àí6, which is very close to the upper limit of the Fr√©chet interval. This is what justifies the rare-event approximationCollet, J. (1996). Some remarks on rare-event approximation. IEEE Transactions on Reliability 45: 106‚Äì108. often used in reliability theory. Proofs The proofs are elementary. Recall that P(A ‚à® B) = P(A) + P(B) ‚àí P(A & B), which implies P(A) + P(B) ‚àí P(A ‚à® B) = P(A & B). Because all probabilities are no bigger than 1, we know P(A ‚à® B) ‚â§ 1, which implies that P(A) + P(B) ‚àí 1 ‚â§ P(A & B). Because all probabilities are also positive we can similarly say 0 ‚â§ P(A & B), so max(0, P(A) + P(B) ‚àí 1) ‚â§ P(A & B). This gives the lower bound on the conjunction. To get the upper bound, recall that P(A & B) = P(AB) P(B) = P(BA) P(A). Because P(AB) ‚â§ 1 and P(BA) ‚â§ 1, we know P(A & B) ‚â§ P(A) and P(A & B) ‚â§ P(B). Therefore, P(A & B) ‚â§ min(P(A), P(B)), which is the upper bound. The best-possible nature of these bounds follows from observing that they are realized by some dependency between the events A and B. Comparable bounds on the disjunction are similarly derived. Extensions When the input probabilities are themselves interval ranges, the Fr√©chet formulas still work as a probability bounds analysis. Hailperin considered the problem of evaluating probabilistic Boolean expressions involving many events in complex conjunctions and disjunctions. SomeWise, B.P., and M. Henrion (1986).

Dissertation, University of Queensland. have suggested using the inequalities in various applications of artificial intelligence and have extended the rules to account for various assumptions about the dependence among the events. The inequalities can also be generalized to other logical operations, including even modus ponens.Wagner, C.G. (2004). Modus tollens probabilized. British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 55: 747‚Äì753. When the input probabilities are characterized by probability distributions, analogous operations that generalize logical and arithmetic convolutions without assumptions about the dependence between the inputs can be defined based on the related notion of Fr√©chet bounds.Weisstein, Eric W. Fr√©chet bounds. MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.R√ºschendorf, L. (1991). Fr√©chet-bounds and their applications. Pages 151‚Äì187 in Advances in Probability Distributions with Given Marginals, Mathematics and Its Applications 67, edited by G. Dall'Aglio, S. Kotz and G. Salinetti, Kluwer, Dordrecht. Quantum Fr√©chet bounds It is interesting that similar bounds hold also in Quantum Mechanics in the case of separable quantum systems and that entangled states violate these bounds. Consider a composite quantum system. In particular, we focus on a composite quantum system AB made by two finite subsystems denoted as A and B. Assume that we know the density matrix of the subsystem A, i.e., \\\\rho^A that is a trace-one positive definite matrix in \\\\Complex_{h}^{n\\\\times n} (the space of Hermitian matrices of dimension n \\\\times n), and the density matrix of subsystem B denoted as \\\\rho^B. We can think of \\\\rho^A and \\\\rho^B as the marginals of the subsystems A and B. From the knowledge of these marginals, we want to infer something about the joint \\\\rho^{AB} in \\\\Complex_{h}^{nm\\\\times nm}. We restrict our attention to joint \\\\rho^{AB} that are separable. A density matrix on a composite system is separable if there exist p_k\\\\geq 0, \\\\\\\\{\\\\rho_1^k \\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{ \\\\rho_2^k \\\\\\\\} which are mixed states of the respective subsystems such that :\\\\rho^{AB}=\\\\sum_k p_k \\\\rho_1^k \\\\otimes \\\\rho_2^k where :\\\\sum_k p_k = 1. Otherwise \\\\rho^{AB} is called an entangled state. For separable density matrices \\\\rho^{AB} in \\\\Complex_{h}^{nm\\\\times nm} the following Fr√©chet like bounds hold: : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\rho^{AB} \\\\leq \\\\rho^{A} \\\\otimes I_m  \\\\rho^{AB} \\\\leq I_n \\\\otimes \\\\rho^{B} \\\\[6pt] \\\\rho^{AB} \\\\geq \\\\rho^A \\\\otimes I_m + I_n \\\\otimes \\\\rho^B-I_{nm}  \\\\rho^{AB} \\\\gneq 0 \\\\end{cases} The inequalities are matrix inequalities, \\\\otimes denotes the tensor product and I_x the identity matrix of dimension x. It is evident that structurally the above inequalities are analogues of the classical Fr√©chet bounds for the logical conjunction. It is also worth to notice that when the matrices \\\\rho^A,\\\\rho^B and \\\\rho^{AB} are restricted to be diagonal, we obtain the classical Fr√©chet bounds. The upper bound is known in Quantum Mechanics as reduction criterion for density matrices; it was first proven by and independently formulated by. The lower bound has been obtained in that provides a Bayesian interpretation of these bounds. =Numerical examples= We have observed when the matrices \\\\rho^A,\\\\rho^B and \\\\rho^{AB} are all diagonal, we obtain the classical Fr√©chet bounds. To show that, consider again the previous numerical example: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\rho^A & = \\\\text{diag}(p_{a},p_{\\\\bar{a}})=\\\\text{diag}(0.7,0.3)  \\\\rho^B & = \\\\text{diag}(p_{b},p_{\\\\bar{b}})=\\\\text{diag}(0.8,0.2) \\\\end{align} then we have: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\rho^{AB}&= \\\\text{diag}(p_{ab},p_{a\\\\bar{b}},p_{\\\\bar{a}b},p_{\\\\bar{a}\\\\bar{b}}) \\\\leqslant \\\\rho^{A} \\\\otimes I_2 =\\\\text{diag}(0.7,0.7,0.3,0.3)  \\\\rho^{AB}&= \\\\text{diag}(p_{ab},p_{a\\\\bar{b}},p_{\\\\bar{a}b},p_{\\\\bar{a}\\\\bar{b}}) \\\\leqslant I_2 \\\\otimes \\\\rho^{B} =\\\\text{diag}(0.8,0.2,0.8,0.2)  \\\\rho^{AB}&= \\\\text{diag}(p_{ab},p_{a\\\\bar{b}},p_{\\\\bar{a}b},p_{\\\\bar{a}\\\\bar{b}}) \\\\geqslant \\\\rho^{A} \\\\otimes I_2 + I_2 \\\\otimes \\\\rho^{B} - I_4 = \\\\text{diag}(0.5, -0.1, 0.1, -0.5)  \\\\rho^{AB}&=\\\\text{diag}(p_{ab},p_{a\\\\bar{b}},p_{\\\\bar{a}b},p_{\\\\bar{a}\\\\bar{b}}) \\\\geqslant 0 \\\\end{align} which means: :\\\\begin{align} 0.5 &\\\\leqslant p_{ab} \\\\leqslant 0.7  0 &\\\\leqslant p_{a\\\\bar{b}} \\\\leqslant 0.2  0.1 &\\\\leqslant p_{\\\\bar{a}b} \\\\leqslant 0.3  0 &\\\\leqslant p_{\\\\bar{a}\\\\bar{b}} \\\\leqslant 0.2 \\\\end{align} It is worth to point out that entangled states violate the above Fr√©chet bounds. Consider for instance the entangled density matrix (which is not separable): :\\\\rho^{AB}=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 &0 & 1 0 & 0 &0 & 0 0 & 0 &0 & 0 1 & 0 &0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, which has marginal :\\\\rho^A=\\\\rho^B=\\\\text{diag}\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\right). Entangled states are not separable and it can easily be verified that :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\rho^A \\\\otimes I_m-\\\\rho^{AB} geqslant0  I_n \\\\otimes \\\\rho^B -\\\\rho^{AB} geqslant0 \\\\end{cases} since the resulting matrices have one negative eigenvalue. Another example of violation of probabilistic bounds is provided by the famous Bell's inequality: entangled states exhibit a form of stochastic dependence stronger than the strongest classical dependence: and in fact they violate Fr√©chet like bounds.

Along the main line, the next station west towards Dearborn Station was Leavittsburg, while east towards Pavonia Terminal was Niles. The station was located from Pavonia Terminal and from Dearborn Station. Warren station consisted of a one-platform structure at the junction of South Street (U.S. Route 422 / State Route 169) at Main Avenue in the center of town. The station depot on Main Avenue was an Erie Type IV wooden frame depot that was shaped 24.5' x 50' x 17'. The site also included a watchman's shanty along Main Avenue and a Railway Express Agency building to the west of the station depot. The station also boasted a gauntlet track, that ran from milepost 53.12 to 53.67 (track miles from Cleveland), which ran trains at a maximum of . However, during the 1950s, congestion on South Street began, due to the short, two-lane length of the roadway, along with the disruption of freight and passenger trains along the street. Of nine proposals studied, the eighth of which proposed widening South Street along the railroad side, was put into effect in 1965. The Railway Express Agency building was demolished, and new rails were installed on the opposite side of the station depot. By 1966, the new two-track main line was in place, and the gauntlet track was being torn up. The station depot, constructed in 1884, was closed and demolished by the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, while remaining passenger service was redirected to the freight depot on Pine Avenue, which was reformatted into a combined passenger/freight station. Passenger service to Warren on the main line was terminated on January 4, 1970, with the final passing of the Lake Cities, while service on the subdivision was terminated on January 14, 1977, by the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail).  Station layout and design  The passenger station at Warren was located at the junction of South Street (U.S. Route 422 / State Route 169) and Main Avenue in the downtown of the city of Warren, Ohio. The depot, which ran alongside Main Avenue, was an Erie Railroad Type IV (types were determined in a 1918-1920 report to the Interstate Commerce Commission), with dimensions of wide, long, high. The station depot was built out of wood, similar to a nearby watchman's shanty. The station location was home to a Railway Express Agency building constructed just to the west of the passenger station. The freight station was constructed several blocks to the east, constructed out of full brick. The station boasted two passenger tracks, along with a gauntlet track, which served from mileposts 53.12 to 53.67 (which ran alongside the depot, with track miles from the station at Cleveland, Ohio, which served as the western terminus of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad).  History  = Atlantic & Great Western Railroad = The alignment that the Warren station was situated at was first started in July 1853, constructing the Franklin and Warren Railroad. This railroad changed names to the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad (A&GW;) two months later. After connecting to the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad in 1856, the railroads soon became part of the same system. The new A&GW; opened complete passenger service in 1864, after being connected to the rest of the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad. After becoming the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad (NYPANO), the railroad soon changed hands again to the Erie Railroad, which took over in 1896, and after being bought out by the railroad. During this time, a new Type IV station depot was opened in Warren, twenty years after the inaugural service. In the early 1900s, a new brick freight station was constructed at Pine Street, further down the line. This was due to the growth of freight throughout Trumbull County, necessitating a new depot being constructed. = South Street widening = In the 1950s, traffic within Warren was beginning to because more congested, and a study was conducted in 1951 by a professor at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio. The study concluded that were two types of problems in the city, geographic and mixture of different kinds of traffic. Warren suffered from factors of problematic locations for the commercial core, schools, churches, industries, along with various classes of people. However, a main problem stemmed from the lack of roadways. Warren boasted an insufficient number of alternate routes through the city. South Street (US 422 / OH 169) had considerable problems in terms of traffic due to the fact that between Main Avenue and Pine Avenue, the Erie Railroad ran down the center of the street. The north side of the street was for moving traffic, but the southern side was purely for parking. The trains running down the track was a hazard to the pedestrians and automobiles, but otherwise posed no serious threat. In 1947, South Street recorded 12.5% of the accidents within the city of Warren, and by 1948, this had been reduced by 24%. This was due to reduction of speed limits and a city campaign to slow down. The professor proposed nine solutions to solving the issues of congestion within the city of Warren. The first proposed rerouting trucks out of the city's downtown, however it was dismissed due to the fact that the time lost in bypassing would equal time lost in congestion. Other proposals included turning Warren's downtown into a maze of one-way streets, upgrading South Street with traffic- based green lights, police supervision, radio campaigns and razing a \\"slum\\" neighborhood for parking. Two options however, called for the widening of streets, including South Street, which would require the upgrade along the stretch that the railroad shares between Main and Pine. Warren station post-1966 site in August 2012 In the later months of 1965, widening of South Street through the center of Warren began. As a result, the Railway Express Agency building next to the depot was demolished for construction of a new right-of-way on the parking side of South Street. The new right-of-way would leave South Street just east of the current depot site, which required the demolition. The first rails were placed in December 1965, and by January 1966, the new two track-main had been installed and put into use. At that time, the old gauntlet track through Warren was being dismantled along South Street, which would be required to allow widening of South Street. It was at that point that the old station depot was closed by the Erie Lackawanna. The railroad did not put up proper signage for the change, deciding it was easier to scratch the notice of the station depot closing in the wood of the door. The freight depot located at the Pine Avenue crossing near South Street was renovated to allow a passenger depot area to be constructed within the building. The station depot back on South Street at Main Avenue was dismantled. = Closure = During the later years of the Erie Railroad, Warren station had been served by twelve trains daily, including the Lake Cities which ran between Dearborn Station in Chicago and Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, and local commuter runs from Youngstown to Cleveland Union Terminal on the Mahoning first-subdivision. In the late 1960s, the Erie Lackawanna was cutting several long distance trains from its schedule, including the Phoebe Snow in November 1966. By June 1969, the Erie Lackawanna had applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission to discontinue service of the Lake Cities, citing that is not worth the money being expedited combined with the railroad's financial status. On December 25, 1969 (Christmas Day), the ICC approved it, and the Erie Lackawanna promised to keep it running through the holiday season, with the last trains to run on January 4, 1970 out of Hoboken Terminal. On the evening of January 4, 1970, the last Lake Cities left Hoboken Terminal, guided by locomotive No. 826, marking the final through passenger train passing through Warren. The station site of the 1884 depot, seen in August 2012 After the discontinuing of the Lake Cities, the Erie Lackawanna maintained one passenger service west of the New York Division, and that was the commuter rail line from Youngstown to Cleveland. After Hurricane Agnes destroyed a lot of the right-of-way in 1972, and a Marion Yard in Marion, Ohio rebuild did not get the approved permits in 1975, the Erie Lackawanna agreed to merge with several other companies, including Penn Central to join a new government run railroad. On April 1, 1976, the merger went into effect and became the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). Conrail agreed to maintain the commuter line, but after six month test run by Conrail, the agency officially ended service from Cleveland Union Terminal to Youngstown, due to loss of money. On a snow-covered January 14, 1977, numerous passengers, including railfans, historians and people interested in seeing or riding the train. People crammed themselves into the three cars attached with Engine 4014, playing games, talking and having refreshments as Train 28 left the Union Terminal at 5:24. The train made stops along the line to Youngstown including East 55th Street, Lee Road, North Randall, Solon, Geauga Lake, Aurora, Mantua, Jeddoe, Garrettsville-Hiram, Warren, Niles and into Youngstown. At the end of the ride in Youngstown, the train stayed for twenty minutes while the train got photographed by the railfans of the Railroad Enthusiasts. After that, the train deadheaded into Brier Hill Yard for the passenger cars to be detached, while the locomotive, 4014, was converted for use to freight service.

Facts A husband and wife, joint tenants, divorced and she issued a summons under the Married Women's Property Act 1882, section 17 for the house to be sold and proceeds split between them. She swore an affidavit saying she wanted proceeds to be ‚Äòdistributed equally; alternatively, that [the husband] pay me one half the value ...‚Äô.

The question was whether a severance of the joint tenancy was effective. Judgment Plowman J held there was severance in equity with the affidavit supporting the summons on 11 February 1966. He noted counsel‚Äôs argument that the court has no power under the Married Woman‚Äôs Property Act 1882 to sever the beneficial joint tenancy.

Facts Mr Harris and Mrs Harris, joint tenants, fell out, she petitioned for divorce and asked under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, ‚ÄòThat such order may be made by way of transfer of property and/or settlement in respect of the former matrimonial home‚Ä¶ and otherwise as may be just‚Äô. Mr Harris was killed in an accident, before the divorce hearing. The issue was whether a divorce petition effectively severs the joint tenancy. If so, she will have acted against her own interests, as the property falls to be divided in accordance with the Will (subject to the legal matrix of rights for dependant widows) as her husband quickly died. Judgment Lawton LJ held that the petition was not effective to sever, because this was expressed so as to bring about the severance at some point in the future. His judgment continued.[1983] 3 All ER 242, 246 Dillon LJ said the following.[1983] 1 WLR 1203, 1210 Significance The underlying law as to survivorship and the default way in which spouses co-own (as joint tenants in equity, not tenants in common in equity) has not changed - it takes documented 'words of severance' to end the survivor's full-parts (\\"absolute\\") inheritance of a jointly owned asset (which is the resultant feature of being a 'joint tenant in equity'). English family law common process in divorce (replicated at this stage in separation) has increased the likelihood of the reflection of the end of the relationship affecting the financial affairs of the parties. Under the Family Law Act 1996 a spouse or other cohabitant with shared children will commonly register their interests as part of any separation or divorce while also severing the joint tenancy. This means any third parties interested in the other spouse's property alone (for example) are fixed with actual notice of the rights of the spouse and that those rights are solidified. Equity itself has shifted in favour of equal division further than in 1983, with extra considerable sums likely for children.

It confirmed that equity will not, in copyhold land for example, generally allow a widow the right to remain in a property where a mortgage remains in arrears. Facts This was a standard repossession action. The legal question arose as to enforcing repossession against a widow -- would it have to wait as with the rights of the lord of the manor in the custom of that manor, under the copyhold system, until her demise. As such a bill was filed for foreclosure, and to compel a surrender of a copyhold estate for three lives, under a covenant in the mortgage deed of 1792 (to surrender those premises as an additional security). Did a covenant of the mortgagor bar the right of his widow \\"to free-bench\\"? The custom of the manor appeared by the evidence to be, that the copyholder could convey these estates by surrender; but where he dies seised of the estate, the widow \\"is entitled to the estate during her widowhood as her free-bench\\".

Facts Mr and Mrs Dennis were joint tenants. He failed to comply with a bankruptcy notice, an act of bankruptcy. Then his wife died. Then he was declared bankrupt. There was no secured lending affecting their house (mortgage) to which the wife had assented. The question in law was whether the act of bankruptcy terminated (severed) the joint tenancy between the couple; if so then the husband's trustees would not receive automatically the wife's share, instead her Will would be free to allocate the property as she saw fit (or if she had died intestate, the Intestacy Rules would prevail). Judgment Held, under the Bankruptcy Act 1914, severance occurred at the date of the act of bankruptcy, so on her death the wife was a tenant in common with a half share and that passed to their children. Had a joint tenancy continued then the bankrupt's trustees would have acquired her share to consider in accordance with the bankruptcy rules.

Facts Mr Honick and Mrs Rawnsley were joint tenants, but Mr Honick occupied the property alone. They bought it thinking they would both live there. Mr Honick was thinking of marriage, but Mrs Rawnsley intended to live alone in the upstairs flat, as they found out after. Mrs Rawnsley did not move in and they agreed orally she would sell her share for ¬£750. But then she changed her mind and wanted more. Later on, Mr Honick died.

The subsequent repudiation made no difference.[1975] Ch 429, 440 He remarked Walton J was wrong on s 36(2) in Nielson-Jones v Feddon, and that severance also occurred through a course of dealings.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Eliot Crawshay-Williams was elected at the January 1910 general election as MP for Leicester, serving as parliamentary private secretary to David Lloyd George. He resigned from Parliament in 1913 following his being named as co-respondent in a divorce case brought by fellow Liberal Hubert Carr-Gomm the MP for Rotherhithe. Previous result This was a dual member seat where the Liberal party and the Labour party co-operated since 1906 by only putting up one candidate each against the Unionists. At the last election only one Unionist candidate stood. The sitting Labour MP was Ramsay MacDonald, who had been a leading figure in the party nationally and had been responsible for organising national electoral co-operation between the Labour and Liberal parties. Candidates Ald. George Banton was adopted as the Independent Labour Party candidate but was forced to withdraw by the refusal of Ramsay MacDonald and the Independent Labour Party national leadership to endorse his candidacy. This vacancy caused much personal embarrassment to the Labour party Leader, Ramsay MacDonald. Almost all the current Labour MPs owed their seat in Parliament either to individuals winning the endorsement of the dominant local trade union or to co-operation with the local Liberals. Those who owed their seats to Liberal/Labour co-operation were mostly in dual member seats like Leicester, where one Liberal and one Labour candidate ran in harness. MacDonald had recently been outspoken about the prospect of Labour candidates standing against Liberals at the next election, but he had no intention of arranging for two Labour candidates to stand in any dual member seat as this was likely to result in Labour losing many of its existing MPs. The wish of MacDonald's own local Labour party to run a candidate at the by-election seriously undermined his strategy. Without an official Labour candidate running, the field was open for a Socialist to run. The Yorkshireman Edward Hartley stood as a candidate for the British Socialist Party (BSP). He had previously stood for the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in Bradford East at the 1906 general election.Keith Laybourn and Jack Reynolds, Liberalism and the rise of Labour, 1890-1918, pp.133-136 He next stood for the SDF in the 1908 Newcastle by-election, then back in Bradford East in the January 1910 general election.Martin Crick, The History of the Social Democratic Federation, p.330 Campaign The Liberal and Labour parties in Leicester had become used to fighting each other (and the Unionists) in local elections. By 1913, the balance on the Town Council was: Liberal 18, Unionist 16, Labour 14.Liberalism and the Progressive Alliance in the Constituencies, 1900-1914 by George L. Bernstein Hartley sought support from the local branch of the Independent Labour Party with some success. Banton sent a telegram of support to Hartley.The Who's Who of Radical Leicester by Ned Newitt In addition the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the local branch of the Independent Labour Party supported Hartley. Result Gordon Hewart Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the summer of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. Boundary changes replaced the dual member seat of Leicester with three single member seats for the 1918 general election. The Liberal by-election victor Gordon Hewart was elected for Leicester East, defeating Labour's George Banton who had not been allowed to contest the by-election. A Unionist beat a Labour candidate in Leicester South. Ramsay Macdonald was defeated in Leicester West by a Unionist standing under a National Democratic and Labour Party label. As for the defeated by- election candidates, the Unionist Wilshere did not stand again and the Socialist Hartley joined the pro-war British Workers League the fore-runner to the National Democratic and Labour Party, whose candidate defeated Macdonald in 1918.

In one of her husband's uncontrollable rages he had followed her into a room and she picked up a loaded shotgun and took off the safety catch, merely intending to threaten him.

Facts Domenico and Carmine Citro went bankrupt and he had a solvent ex-wife. The remaining assets were a half share in their two family homes -- Domenico had separated from his ex-wife and had his own house, co- owned with his new wife with three children, youngest 12 years old in Dryfield Road, Burnt Oak, Edgware of mid-to-high price in outer north-west London, being typical of private housing in London Borough of Barnet. Carmine continued to live with three children, youngest 10 at Bell Lane, Hendon, a similar value house in the same Borough. The debts owed exceeded the value of the bankrupts' interests (equity) in the homes. The trustees in bankruptcy applied for declarations and for orders for sale under the Law of Property Act 1925, section 30 (now replaced by the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, section 14). Judgment =High Court= Hoffmann J made orders for possession and sale but considering the circumstances of the two (successive) wives and their children, and because a half share left for the wives would not be enough to buy accommodation in his view reasonably nearby, and his assessment of finding equally good education in the area, he ordered the sales be postponed until each of the youngest children became 16. =Court of Appeal= Nourse LJ allowed the lenders‚Äô appeal, whose interests would usually prevail. Financial hardship is not an exceptional circumstance. ‚ÄòExceptional‚Äô means beyond the normal ‚Äòmelancholy consequences‚Äô of bankruptcy so hardship, eviction, relocation do not qualify as exceptional circumstances. The circumstances must be special, not just unusual. Bingham LJ concurred, regretfully, because he said prior cases pointed this way and it was important to avoid arbitrariness. Still, he said submissions on a moratorium were to be invited. Waller LJ dissented.

Biography and bibliography on the site of the Archives de litt√©rature du Moyen √Çge (ARLIMA) or Jehan Bagnyon was a lawyer, historian, political writer, and translator born in 1412, in Croy, in the canton of Vaud, which was, at that time, a part of the Duchy of Savoy. He died sometime after 1487. Biography A citizen of Lausanne with a bachelor in law, Jean Bagnyon began his law career as a conscindic (syndic) in Lausanne, but the city's fiscal difficulties forced him to move to Geneva. In 1481, he was chosen by Lausanne to represent the city's proposal to unite with its lower city. In 1486, he wrote a treatise in Latin ‚Äî Tractatus de et super libertatibus, franchesiis, preeminenciis ac exemptionibus a subjectione dominiorum temporalium eminentis fructifere et solaciose civitatis Gebennarum, (Treatise on the freedoms, franchise, preeminences and exceptions from subjugation by worldly dominations of the eminent, fecund, and delightful city of Geneva), probably the oldest lay legal work printed in French-speaking Switzerland ‚Äî with the goal of defending the rights of the city of Geneva and of proving that the city was not ruled by the Duke of Savoy, but instead that its inhabitants were subjects of the Bishop. This work was only published some years later. He was awarded Geneva citizenship for his work favoring Genevan freedoms in the tax conflicts of 1486-1487. Bagnyon's principle work was a history of Charlemagne which included a prose adaptation of the chanson de geste Fierabras -- La Conqueste du grand roy Charlemagne des Espagnes et les vaillances des douze pairs de France, et aussi celles de FierabrasAuthur Tilly. Studies in the French Renaissance. New York: Barnes & Noble, 1968, p.16.‚Äîwhich had been requested of him as early as 1465 by Henri Bolomier or Bolmier, the canon of the chapters of Lausanne and Geneva, future confessor of Philibert I, Duke of Savoy (1465-1482). The work was first published as Rommant de Fierabras le geant in Geneva in 1478 (it was perhaps the first chanson de geste to be printed). La Conqueste du grand roy Charlemagne des Espagnes contains a brief history of the kings of France until Clovis, an encomium of Charlemagne and brief history of his reign, his trip to Jerusalem, the story of Fierabras, and Charlemagne's Spanish wars. The historical sections were largely based on the Historia Caroli Magni (also known as the \\"Pseudo-Turpin\\" chronicle), probably known to Bagnyon via the Speculum Historiale of Vincent de Beauvais, but the story of Fierabras occupies most of the work. This work became one of the most popular novels in France in the first half of the 16th century (15 editions printed to 1536) and was adapted into Castilian (Historia del emperador Carlomagno y de los doce pares de Francia by Nicola of Piamonte, 1528), Portuguese, German, and English (by William Caxton) Jean Miquet, ed. Fierabras: roman en prose de la fin du XIVe si√®cle. Ottawa: Editions de l'Universit√© d'Ottawa, 1983, p.18. and was published numerous times up to the 19th century. The giant Fierabras, engraving from the 1497 edition of Jean Bagnyon's Roman de Fierabras le G√©ant (P. Mar√©chal et B. Chaussard, Lyon), BNF RES-Y2-993 Jean Bagnyon shows himself a talented storyteller with a structured and unified storyline around his subject matter, without digressions. The fantasy elements of the original tales are attenuated and the moral questions are emphasized in authorial commentaries that show the author's mastery of rhetoric. He also makes references to classical texts and often cites the Bible.L'Essor savoyard, 11 September 2008, edited by R√©mi Mogenet.

Founded in 2010, the studio was composed of Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman, and closed down on its tenth anniversary after the two recognized they were moving in different directions in the industry. The studio was known for its games Super Crate Box (2010), Serious Sam: The Random Encounter (2011), Ridiculous Fishing (2013), Luftrausers (2014), and Nuclear Throne (2015), as well as for its stand on video game cloning.  History  Vlambeer's Rami Ismail (left) and Jan Willem Nijman at the 2013 Game Developers Conference Vlambeer was founded in 2010 by Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman after both dropped out from a game design course at the Utrecht School of the Arts. According to Ismail, they had been developing a game outside of the school but when the school found out, the school demanded the rights to the game, which they refused, leading to their decision to drop out. Ismail and Nijman began by working together to develop a prototype, initially created by Nijman, called \\"Crates from Hell\\". It was released on 11 May 2010 as Super Crate Box and earned the studio recognition in the form of an Independent Games Festival finalist position in the Excellence in Design category.The 14th Annual Independent Games Festival Finalists . Igf.com. Retrieved on 13 August 2012. During the development of Super Crate Box, Vlambeer developed Radical Fishing. It was released in November 2010. Radical Fishing was the first of many games released by the studio under a \\"Not Vlambeer\\" label, which encompasses the studio's games that are developed for money or as an experiment. Vlambeer was approached by publisher Devolver Digital to develop a game in the Serious Sam franchise. The studio and Devolver Digital agreed to develop and publish a turn-based role-playing game. The result, Serious Sam: The Random Encounter, was released on 24 October 2011. During the development of Serious Sam: The Random Encounter, Vlambeer released many small games, most notably Luftrauser. Vlambeer started development on an iOS version of Radical Fishing called Ridiculous Fishing. Development was halted after a San Francisco‚Äìbased studio released a clone of Radical Fishing on iOS.

On 14 March 2013, Vlambeer released Ridiculous Fishing on iOS, after resuming its development. In 2015, they have experimented with live streaming their development process and have over 12,000 paid subscriptions to their Twitch channel.

It has been cited in cases in relation to land but has no direct link to land e.g. occupation. It was landmark decision in the law of alcohol licensing (licensing law) and summarizes centuries of law as to licences -- it sets out the bold principles of licences of many kinds. Facts Thomas Sorrell owned a tavern in the village of Stepney, some east of the City of London. He was prosecuted by Edward Thomas, acting for the Crown, who demanded that Sorrell pay a penalty to the Crown of ¬£450 for selling having sold wine without a licence, contrary to the Taxation Act 1660. Sorrell claimed that he had a licence in his capacity as a member of the \\"Master, Wardens, Freemen, and Commonalty of the Mystery of Vintners of the City of London\\". The Taxation Act 1660 contained the following provision: Judgment =Jury= > That as to all the debt, except fifty pounds, the defendant owes nothing. > And as to the fifty pounds, they find the statute of 7 E. 6, c. 5, > concerning retailing of wines, prout in the statute. =Chief Justice advising jury on their decision and award= Vaughan said: > A dispensation or licence properly passeth no interest, nor alters or > transfers property in any thing, but only makes an action lawful which, > without it, had been unlawful. As a licence to go beyond the seas, to hunt > in a man's park, to come into his house, are only actions, which without > licence, had been unlawful. [...] So to licence a man to eat my meat, or to > fire the wood in my chimney to warm him by, as to the actions of eating, > fireing my wood and warming him, they are licences; but it is consequent > necessarily to those actions that my property be destroyed in the meat > eaten, and in the wood burnt, so as in some cases by consequent and not > directly, and as its effect, a dispensation or licence may destroy and alter > property.‚Äô(1673) Vaugh 330, at 351 Therefore, the conception of the statute was upheld, as was its proviso in favour of the Vintners. It was not illegitimately interfering with settled property rights nor discriminating unfairly against the general public, considering earlier statutes, nor putting the Vintners at an unfair advantage as Parliament had ordained such a licensing system. The special alternate verdicts put to the jury were: A) Si pro quer. quoad 50l. pro quer. (If for the claimant, ¬£50 for the claimant). As stated above this was the verdict. The Taxation Act of 1660 did contain a free liberty, a dispensation for the Vintners to sell without having to pay the usual penalty for no express specific licence to sell on a particular premises. The ¬£50 arose from the defeat of the dispensatory (royal) letters patent of 2 February the 9th Year of James I (1612) to the Vintners, incapable of modifying the taxation provisions of 7 E. 6, c. 5. (the Wines Act 1553) as purportedly made by James I against a law (the 1553 statute) which was for the public good.List of Acts of the Parliament of England, 1485‚Äì1601#7 Edw. 6 > So as now it is only insisted on, that the patent of 9 Jac. was void in its > creation, for two reasons. #For that the law of 7 E. 6 was such a law, pro > bono publico, as the King could not dispence against it, more than with some > other penal laws, pro bono publico.... #If he could to particular persons, > he could not to the Corporation of Vintners, and their successors, whose > number or persons the King could never know; and that it stood not with the > trust reposed in him by the law, to dispense so generally without any > prospect of number or persons. - Vaughan CJ [...] I must say as my brother > Atkins observed before, that in this case the plaintiffs council argue > against the Kings prerogative, for the extent of his prerogative is the > extent of his power, and the extent of his power is to do what he hath will > to do, according to that, ut summm potestatis Regis est posse quantum velit > sic magnitudinis est velle quantum potest; if therefore the King have a will > to dispense with a corporation, as it seems K.[King] James had in this case, > when the patent was granted, but by law cannot, his power, and consequently > his prerogative, is less than if he could. B) Si pro def. pro def. 1s. (If for the defendant, th of ¬£1 (a shilling) for the defendant). The jury did not reach this verdict. As directed, King James had exceeded his prorogative in his royal letters patent so the statute of Edward VI on wine taxation stood.

Plot summary Buck Rankin (Jack Holt) is a shady carnival promoter. After meeting and quickly falling in love with Helen (Lila Lee), he decides to go straight and sell the carnival. However, a fight over a con game causes a melee at the carnival, during which Rankin accidentally kills a man. He is convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to twenty years behind bars. Eight months later, Helen reveals to him in prison that she is about to have his child and refuses his request that she divorce him. For the good of his wife and child, Rankin decides to fake his own death. After seeing fellow prisoner Farley (Ward Bond) leap to his death in the roiling waters and deadly whirlpool surrounding the prison, Rankin, who works in the Warden's office, forges a letter to Helen saying that he has died trying to escape and that his body was never found. Many years later, Rankin is released from prison. He adopts the alias, Duke Sheldon, and he and his carnival partner Mac (Allen Jenkins) quickly become wealthy via the illicit skills that Rankin learned while incarcerated‚Äîincluding owning a nightclub. In the meantime, Helen has married Judge Jim Morrison (Willard Robertson). Her and Rankin's daughter, Sandra (Jean Arthur) has become a newspaper reporter who is engaged to marry fellow reporter Bob Andrews {Donald Cook). Of course, she knows nothing of her father's existence. Sandra is assigned to do a story on Duke and recognizes him as her father from an old photograph her mother has kept. She reveals herself to him as his daughter and he is overjoyed to see her. He has kept a low profile all these years, but his intention to testify on behalf of a fellow gangster threatens to bring him unwanted publicity. He realizes that this publicity will result in the humiliation of Helen, who is unintentionally guilty of bigamy, because they were never truly divorced. In the end, he kills the gangster's lawyer, who had been pressuring him to testify and was going to tell reporters of his sordid past. He then turns the gun on himself and commits suicide as Duke Sheldon while reporters are clamoring at his door. The secret of his past life is thus hidden forever.

The law intends to modernise divorce and to shift slightly towards \\"no fault\\" divorce from the fault-based approach of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The main part of the Act, dealing with divorce, was not proceeded with after pilot schemes found that it did not work well. Contents Part I of the Act sets out the philosophical approach to divorce. Part II set out a procedure for divorce which required spouses seeking divorce to attend a preliminary Information Session and to seek mediation as a first step. Part II and related sections of other parts were repealed and partially replaced by section 18 of the Children and Families Act 2014 after they were abandoned in practice in 1999. Part III of the act concerns provision of legal aid for mediation in family law and divorce. Part IV set out the mechanisms and principles related to family homes (in particular Family Law Act home rights Notices affecting land), occupation orders, non-molestation orders and domestic violence orders and principles. Sections 30 and 31 concern the award of a statutory licence to occupy a home. Part IVA contains provisions related to forced marriage. Part V contains supplemental sections.  Reception  The divorce sections of the Act received a great deal of media discussion and criticism, with some seeing the new approach to divorce as encouraging \\"quickie\\" divorces (although in practice, a fault-based divorce under the old scheme could be completed much quicker than under this Act). The political commentator Anne McElvoy welcomed the abandonment of the Act's divorce sections seeing the extensive waiting periods and required mediation as an intrusive compromise between a proper \\"no fault\\" divorce system and the needs of \\"family fundamentalists\\". Related developments Following the decision by the UK Supreme Court in Owens v Owens, in February 2019 Justice Secretary David Gauke said that he would introduce legislation enacting no-fault divorce in the next session of Parliament.

It confirmed the court will attach to licences, even where narrowly drawn to avoid giving away title, a right to occupy provided it meets with the clear commercial purposes of the contract. This means those third parties, in this case protestors, who interfered with such rights must be removed. Facts A second runway was being built and trees had to go on National Trust land. The National Trust gave Manchester Airport plc authority to let subcontractors enter. Mr Dutton and environmental protestors tried to stop the work in protest, and occupied the land. Manchester Airport plc had not put any people on site yet, but still claimed an injunction under Order 113 of the Rules of the Supreme Court for their removal. Judgment Laws LJ held that although the licensee could remove the protestors, ejectment (court bailiffs to assist) under settled law could only be claimed by someone with title or an estate in land. Also, the licensee (the Airport) was not in occupation, and did not have title, so the court could not grant any of the other possessory remedies (in trespass and nuisance). But given that the licensee had brought a claim in possession, the court would first consider the extent of licensee's actual or right to occupation arising out of any term of the licence contract. Then the court would consider any element of control arising out of the licence contract. Then the court would give such remedies as would vindicate the licensee's rights under the licence contract. But the licensee must first bring its claim under CPR 55 (then Ord 113) possession proceedings. That is the first step. The court does not then give possession back to the licensee (as licensee had no possession that was disturbed in the first place). The licensee was never entitled to possession only mere occupation. Indeed, the licensee could never obtain possession as National Trust was prohibited from alienating any of its land in possession. The court gave relief as would vindicate the construction contract. Such relief in this case included an injunction to remove the trespassers from the trees, possibly a (costs) award for the actual removal and other (mainly their legal advocates') costs (to be determined later) and an injunction that would prevent the protesters return. Relief is given not to put licensee in possession but to vindicate (uphold) such rights of occupation as are given by the contract. The court uses the contract to determine the control that arises from the contract. It then couples that with the right of occupation and then proceeds to grant relief as would vindicate licensee's rights of occupation arising out of the contract. Kennedy LJ concurred. Chadwick LJ dissented. ‚ÄòIn the latter case (which is this case) the plaintiff must succeed by the strength of his title, not on the weakness (or lack) of any title in the defendant.‚Äô[2000] QB 133, 146-7 See also *English trusts law *English land law *English property law Notes References * External links * Category:English land case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:1999 in British law Category:1999 in case law Category:Manchester Airport ","title":"Manchester Airport plc v Dutton"},{"id":"35736969","title":"Makeba Alcide"},{"id":"35736985","text":"is an English land law and English trusts law case, concerning a constructive trust of land (a home) which will often be irrevocable whilst the occupier is in occupation as opposed to a licence to occupy -- and/or a tenancy at will which is similar save that without transfer of the underlying property it can be revoked without cause. The case hinged on the fact there was an agreement specifying the existing occupier was to remain. Bannister v Bannister (1948) 2 All ER 133 was followed and approved. Facts Mr and Mrs Binions promised the sellers to allow Mrs Evans to remain in her cottage for life when they bought it.

He was the youngest of the five children of Eustolio Barrios Hern√°ndez - a local miner and farmer - and Isabel Prudencio Flores. Since his early childhood, Barrios was deeply fascinated with nature, which perhaps came to him from his father, who used to watch over the nearby forests and protect them against illegal logging every morning. And by doing so, he was also passing on to his son a true love and respect for the place where they lived. For several years, the Barrios made their living out of selling flowers and fruits which they collected around their plot. Barrios would then reflect all these memories through his paintings of still life and multicoloured flowers. His interest in painting was clearly noticeable since his early childhood days, for he would skip classes from time to time to go outside and make drawings of the surrounding fields. This resulted in a number of predicaments both at school and at home. During those early days, due to the poverty in which his family lived, he found a way to create his own painting materials. For instance, when he needed something to draw or paint with, he would manufacture his own paintbrush out of a few horsehairs tied up on a twig. > ‚ÄúI began painting at a very young age.

Thus, Barrios arrives in Cuernavaca, Morelos, in the year 1946, after receiving an invitation from a friend who had offered him to take painting lessons under the condition of moving to that city. How big was his disillusion when he received a large paintbrush, a can full of paint and the instruction on how to paint the walls of a local store. The artist ludicrously remembers that was his first official painting work. He stayed in Cuernavaca for an entire year before moving to Mexico City, Mexico, where he managed to enrol in the San Carlos Academy (1948), in part thanks to the support from the prominent Mexican painter Diego Rivera, with whom he met as soon as he stepped foot in the Mexican capital city. Rivera also gave Barrios some advice and guidance on drawing and colour techniques. In 1949, Barrios worked as a sign designer at Eureka R√≥tulos Ne√≥n, where he met his first sponsor, Mr. Alejandro Tajonar Torres. Barrios received a fixed salary (1950‚Äì1952) from Tajonar to help him with his then ongoing studies at the School of Arts and Advertising (Escuela Libre de Arte y Publicidad), where he was the student of Ricardo B√°rcenas. These were the years where he would know other eminent professors as Barrios grew in the artistic environment, including Carlos Incl√°n and General Ignacio Beteta. By the end of his studies, he was the winner of a drawing contest that opened for him the doors of the once important Airlines \\"Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n\\". It was in the now extinct airlines that Barrios met his second sponsor, Mr. Jos√© Antonio Pati√±o, who was quick to understand that Barrios was considerably more inclined to artistic painting rather than commercial drawing. And thus, Mr. Pati√±o felt moved to sponsor not only several of Barrios' voyages around the globe, but also a number of expositions. From that moment (1965), and held up by the ceaseless support of Mr. Pati√±o, Barrios began to devote all his efforts to the watercolour technique.  Education and influences  Despite studying for seven months at the San Carlos Academy (1948), for one year (1948‚Äì1949) at the La Esmeralda School of Painting and Sculpturing, where he was the student of the renowned muralist Ra√∫l Anguiano, Ignacio Barrios is, in strict terms, a self-taught artist who is constantly striving to renovate and remodel his work. As soon as he felt that Academy studies were not enough to satisfy his restless spirit, he decided to leave the schools to continue learning on his own. It is nonetheless undeniable that the artist Ricardo B√°rcenas had a strong influence at the beginning of his drawing career, and that of Ignacio M. Beteta strikes at first sight in Barrios' early landscapes. An important imprint in his work was exercised by the celebrated British painter William Turner, from whom the Mexican virtuoso took several elements which have allowed him to obtain his own textures and environments. And finally, his \\"free-style\\" brushing and the use of humidity are both elements taken from the American watercolourist John Marin.  Work  Barrios began his work painting classical and academic landscapes. Critics admire how he was able to move from costumbrismo, to impressionism, to surrealism.Dossier Ignacio Barrios, ‚ÄúEl recuerdo de la mano‚Äù en Cast√°lida, No. 31, primavera-verano, Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura, M√©xico, 2007, p. 49 In later years, he occasionally put figurative art aside to seek semi-abstract creations. His work is mainly characterised by landscaping (both Mexican and international), urban environment, Art Marine, still life, human body, portraits, abstract and semi-abstract art. While his early work took him to a position of privilege amongst the most renowned landscapers, the aesthetic level he reached in the development and reproduction of human figure is no less remarkable. From 1965 to 1981, his work was primarily notable for the use of gray and ochre tones that helped him find harmonious tonalities. Those were the years of Barrios' Europeanisation, since a large proportion of his artistic evolution as a painter took place in Europe. During the 80's, his work began to acquire a broader variety of colours which has advanced the expressive strength of his paintings. Barrios' work is clearly apparent. His unique mastery of water and handling of humidity make his watercolour technique even more complex, and along with his wide impressionism traits, he was able to, in his own words, \\"let water speak its own language.\\"  Awards and recognitions  Throughout his life, Ignacio Barrios received a number of well-earned homages, awards and recognitions. Some of the most notable are: the Award to the Best Watercolour, presented to him by the Watercolour Association of Mexico (C√≠rculo de Acuarelistas de M√©xico) for his piece \\"El Valle del Silencio\\" (\\"The Silent Valley\\"), in 1981; the Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Medal, presented by the State of Mexico in recognition of his achievements in the field of plastic arts, in 1986.Cuatro grandes artistas mexiquenses: Leopoldo Flores, Luis Nishizawa, H√©ctor Cruz, Ignacio Barrios. Gobierno del Estado de M√©xico, Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura, M√©xico, 1988, p. 19. In 2004, the former Governor of the State of Mexico, Arturo Montiel Rojas, organized an homage for Barrios during the re-opening of the Watercolour Museum of Toluca (capital city of the State of Mexico), wherein a permanent exposition of Barrios can be seen. Similarly, the \\"Noticiero Continental de Cine\\" (Continental Film News Program) has dedicated nine programs to this Mexican painter. From the 1980's, Barrios devoted part of his efforts to teaching and influenced a new generation of watercolourists. Some of his most important students included Gabriela Abud and Ulises Castro.  Expositions  His first individual exposition was held in the Canton Palace, in the city of M√©rida, Yucat√°n, in 1964. His work has been exhibited in Jamaica, United States, England, Canada, Japan, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, the former Soviet Union, Ukraine, Estonia, Argentina, El Salvador and Colombia.

Founded in 1883 as a manufacturer of crankshafts for looms, it has a long history of making forged metal components, particularly for the aerospace industry. Wyman-Gordon is now a subsidiary of Precision Castparts Corp., and is based in Houston, Texas. It has 13 plants in five countries, and employed about 2,500 people as of 2012. History =Early years= The Crompton Loom Works in Worcester, Massachusetts was the first customer of Wyman and Gordon's new company. The Worcester Drop Forge Works was founded in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1883 by Horace Wyman and Lyman Gordon. It was later renamed the Wyman-Gordon Company. The company began with eight people in a small wooden factory building, forging crankshafts for looms. A 50-horsepower steam engine provided power for the drop hammers and other equipment. The fathers of the founders were both managers at the Crompton Loom Works and helped their sons' business win contracts for the crankshafts and for pistol and micrometer components. The company won contracts from railroads for automatic couplers and from bicycle manufacturers for sprockets, spindles, and pedals, having gained a reputation for the high quality of its early work. From around 1902, it also began filling orders for crankshafts from manufacturers of the recently invented automobile. Horace Wyman died in 1905 and Lyman Gordon in 1914; George F. Fuller (1869‚Äì1962) succeeded to the company presidency upon Gordon's death. Fuller had joined the company as an accountant, but had invented several ways to improve the quality of the forged metal components. The company grew steadily under his leadership. =Growth with the aerospace industry= Curtiss JN-4 (Jenny) on a training flight during World War I (1918), using Wyman-Gordon components When World War I broke out, the U.S. government contracted with Wyman-Gordon to supply forgings for the 90-horsepower engines of Curtis Jenny biplanes. This was followed by contracts to produce airframe and engine forgings for almost all U.S. military aircraft. Wyman-Gordon maintained a close relationship with manufacturers of commercial and military airplanes after the war, making growing numbers of parts for engines, crankshafts, propellers, airframes, and landing gear. The company expanded the Worcester factory and opened a new plant in Harvey, Illinois. During World War II (1939‚Äì1945) the company expanded again to supply many types of forged components to airplane manufacturers. Every American plane in combat service included Wyman-Gordon components. A 50,000-ton press in Grafton, Massachusetts, put into use by the company in 1955 In 1944, Wyman- Gordon was chosen to receive an 18,000-ton closed-die hydraulic press, the largest in the United States. The War Production Board had found from captured airplanes that Germany had larger presses than U.S. engineers had thought practical, and was using that equipment to forge large aircraft components from lightweight magnesium. Seeking to replicate this capability in the U.S., the War Production Board contracted with the Mesta Machine Co. of Pittsburgh to fabricate a new large press to be operated by Wyman-Gordon. A new plant was built around the press in North Grafton, Massachusetts, completed after the war in 1946. The introduction of jet engines in the years after World War II caused a drastic switch in requirements, demanding fewer forgings, but forgings that were larger, lighter, stronger and more tolerant of heat than anything made so far. The new components produced by Wyman-Gordon were of much greater value, compensating for their decreased number. The Korean War stimulated demand for new airplanes, requiring even larger components than could be built by the North Grafton press. In 1951, construction began on a plant that opened in 1955 with two presses, one with 35,000 tons of force and the other 50,000 tons. The 50,000-ton press was the largest machine in the world at the time, 10 stories high and with foundations extending into bedrock. In 1983, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers designated the 50,000-ton forging press in North Grafton as a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark. Wyman-Gordon was a pioneer in forging titanium, with the first main use being for compressor disks in Pratt & Whitney engines. Westinghouse and General Electric also used the company's titanium forgings, and its products were used in building the engine of the LGM-30 Minuteman missile. Demand continued to grow during the 1960s and 1970s, with military demand due to the Vietnam war and growing demand from commercial civilian airplane manufacturers. The support beam for the Boeing 747 landing gear was larger than any closed-die titanium forging that had ever been made in the past. In 1980, Wyman-Gordon was hit by a severe shortage of titanium that hurt its ability to fulfil orders for hundreds of types of aircraft. In the early 1980s, the company bought International Titanium, a company based in Moses Lake, Washington, built a state-of-the-art facility for International Titanium to produce titanium sponge, and built a new facility in Millbury, Massachusetts, to alloy the sponge with other metals. Because the company now had complete control of its supply chain, customers were more certain of Wyman-Gordon's delivery capability, leading to increased orders. =Other aspects= Harry G. Stoddard became a vice president of Wyman-Gordon in 1911 and was appointed President in 1931. He also had interests in banking and was part owner of the Worcester Telegram. His son Robert Waring Stoddard joined the company in 1929 and succeeded Harry G. Stoddard as president in 1955, holding that position until being elected chairman in 1967. He was one of the founders of the right-wing and anticommunist John Birch Society. Stoddard was opposed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which would make racial discrimination illegal. In 1964, the company employed black workers only as janitors. Abbie Hoffman was the press officer for a group of civil-rights agitators who targeted the Worcester plant for picketing. Later, they filed petitions with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and the U.S, Air Force. In July that year the company agreed to change its hiring practices. As late as the 1970s, Wyman-Gordon was a major player in automotive forging. However, faced with growth of international competition in this market, the company decided to focus on aerospace. Wyman-Gordon India, a joint venture, went public in February 1962. In 1964, Wyman-Gordon India started mass production of forged steel crankshafts and other components for an Indian-made jeep that Mahindra & Mahindra was manufacturing. This was the first time crankshafts had been produced in India. Later the company changed its name to WG Forge & Allied Industries Limited. In the long run, the company was not successful. It was referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, which tried to revive it, but without success. In 1992, it went into liquidation. =Difficulties and acquisition= Wyman-Gordon plant, Houston Industrial Estate, West Lothian, Scotland In the late 1980s, the need for military components was reduced as the Cold War ended, coupled with a decline in demand for commercial aircraft parts. By 1993, the aerospace industry was just 60% of its size in the mid-1980s. Wyman-Gordon had to lay off employees. Despite financial difficulties, in March 1992, the company announced a joint venture with Pratt & Whitney and Perth, Western Australia- based Western Aerospace to form Western Australian Speciality Alloys. The new company would process Australian ores into nickel-based superalloys at a new plant at Canning Vale, near Perth. These alloys are designed to handle extreme heat (as in jet engines) and are extremely durable. Wyman-Gordon also acquired PFI investment cast facilities (1988), Arwood investment cast facilities (1990), and Cameron Forge (1994). Another view of the enormous building that can be seen from most of West Lothian In May 1999, Precision Castparts Corporation agreed to pay $721 million for Wyman-Gordon, while also assuming $104 million in debt. The combined company would be able to supply both castings and forgings for airplane engines. The purchase would have potentially reduced competition in the industry. To gain approval for the deal from the Federal Trade Commission, PCC was required to divest two of Wyman- Gordon's foundries, one in Albany, Oregon, and the other in Groton, Connecticut. The acquisition was completed on 12 January 2000. At least in the short term, it was planned that Wyman-Gordon would retain a separate identity. =Recent years= In April 2000, PCC announced that it was closing Wyman- Gordon's Buffalo, New York, pipe-making plant. The 12,000-ton extrusion press would be moved to the Wyman-Gordon facility in Houston. By consolidating production in one plant, the company would cut costs and speed up the production cycle. Wyman-Gordon purchased the UEF aerospace division of United Engineering Forgings in May 2000 for ¬£22m, calling the new subsidiary Wyman Gordon Lincoln. The division based in Lincoln, England, makes forged engine discs, engine shafts, and components of airframes and landing-gear. Its main customer is Rolls-Royce. In 2000, Wyman-Gordon built a manufacturing facility in Plze≈à, Czech Republic. The plant makes titanium, nickel, and steel alloy rotary parts for the power generation and aerospace industries, using immersion ultrasound to test the products. In December 2000, Wyman-Gordon acquired the Drop Dies and Forging Company, which had been founded in 1919 by Joseph F. Rice. In January 2011, it was reported that Wyman-Gordon had expressed interest in a joint venture with Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited to manufacture boiler tubes in India. Wyman-Gordon today creates products for marine, aerospace, power, fuel, and construction industries. It uses the world‚Äôs largest forging and extrusion presses (including a 35,000-ton press in Houston and a 30,000-ton press in Livingston), coupled with custom-made dies, to produce various complex components. Its plants can process a number of different alloys ‚Äì steel, titanium, and nickel-based materials, among others.

The case focussed on a farmer of a portfolio of farming businesses without any obvious heirs who made many promises and assurances of inheritance to two partial farm managers who were neighbours or tenants of his, one of whom had farmed for 38 years, the other co-farmed for the last 5 years of those 38 years. Facts In 1956, at age 12, Geoffrey Gillett met Mr. Holt, a 38-year-old farmer at Woodhall Spa golf club who kept employed a foreman, a small number of labourers and a housekeeper. He became his caddie and friend. In 1956, he began working on Holt's farm continuing this work over 38 years. In 1971 Holt (or his company) helped in various acquisitions leading to the relevant assets below. Holt had made seven separate representations to Gillett, from 1964 to 1989, as to his eventual inheritance of the farm - such as \\"all this will be yours\\" after Gillett brought in his first harvest in 1964 and at the christening of his first child in 1971, and \\"it was all going to be yours anyway\\" in 1975. Gillett's wife's brother attested to a conversation at his parents' house, at which Mr Holt said \\"something to the effect that he was going to look after Geoffrey and [my sister, his wife] Sally and that they would have an assured future\\". Holt had confirmed this in his Will of the time, sought adoption of Gillett when young, later seeking to add him instead to the Merton College agricultural tenancy; he soon gave too a 20% share of his main farming company as it first stood to Gillett and his wife. In 1995, Holt tried to sack Gillett and remove he and his wife from The Beeches and to remove him as his death beneficiary in favour of another neighbouring farmer, Wood, who had begun to manage part of the land. Holt first met him in 1992. Gillett claimed proprietary estoppel to remain in possession of the land he had worked, and be given land/compensation at the main farm. In 1997 Holt or his companies had enough money to buy the main farmland outright from Merton College, Oxford (for ¬£1,251,000) and did so. =Assets and relationship of claimant to assets= ;The Limes farmhouse (with about 19 acres and two cottages in Baumber) Holt transferred this to Wood as legal and beneficial owner with vacant possession. A minor complication (but an important one from the Gilletts' point of view) is that on part of the 19 acres remained polytunnels (prefabricated polythene greenhouses) in which Gillett started off trees and shrubs for his business Countryside Companions. Another court hearing decided Countryside Companions did not have an agricultural tenancy of these structures and the land it occupied. ;White House Farm (235 acres) Wood has been legal and beneficial owner since 1996. Its land, in hand, was farmed under a contract by Aubourn Farming Ltd (Aubourn). ;The Limes farmland (520 acres) KAHL was legal freeholder and beneficial owner. KAHL owed ¬£1m to Edgescan Ltd (Edgescan), its controlling shareholder, unsecured. The land was in hand and farmed by Aubourn. ;The Beeches (105 acres) \\"This land has the most complicated pattern of ownership and occupation. The freehold belong[ed] to KAHL, as it has since 1971, subject to a bank mortgage. The farmhouse is occupied by Mr and Mrs Gillett under a tenancy to Mr Gillett which has limited protection under the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976. The rent is ¬£70 a week. The central area of the land and a small area at the east end (in all about 39 acres) are [used by Gillett's business] Countryside Companions under a tenancy protected by the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986. The rest of the land is in hand and farmed by Aubourn; this year's crop is wheat.\\" ;KAHL A company part held (80 per cent) by Edgescan Ltd; part held (10 per cent) by Mr Gillett; part held (10 per cent) by Mrs Gillett. It had an unsecured debt of ¬£1m to Edgescan Ltd and a further liability (secured on The Beeches) of an unknown amount to the bank. The court was not told about any other assets which it owns, or of the precise terms of its contract farming arrangement with Aubourn. ;Edgescan Ltd A new company of the 1990s, owned 70% by Holt, 30% by Wood. The hearings judge in the High Court found against Gillett, applying the persuasive non-binding High Court decision, Dickens v Taylor [1998] 1 FLR 806, 821, holding that a promise to leave property in a Will could not give rise to a proprietary estoppel because wills are inherently revocable. He found the other promises and thwarted succession plans by third parties (i.e. Merton College's policy as to farmers, remaining active, transferring their tenancies and Gillett's father's refusal of Holt's proposed adoption of Gillett as a teenager) not strong enough; and he viewed as inadequate the detriment Gillett suffered during the time of the promise until its alleged breach. Judgment The decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal, rejecting the 'irrevocable promise' approach and in these circumstances held the court will impose a more liberal view of the requirement of detriment. Robert Walker held that Mr Gillett was entitled to a share of the property and could not simply be ejected: > \\"The fundamental principle that equity is concerned to prevent > unconscionable conduct permeates all the elements of the doctrine. In the > end the court must look at the matter in the round‚Ä¶ \\" The assurances of 1975 \\"were intended to be relied on, and were in fact relied on.\\" In persuasive, non-binding sources of law he noted esteemed legal academic criticism of Dickens v Taylor. Professor Swadling commented that decision is ‚Äòclearly wrong‚Äô because the whole point is they are promised ‚Äòunsupported by consideration, are initially revocable‚Äô but they are made binding by detrimental reliance, and then there is no question of the promisor changing their mind. There is a need for detriment and noted the judge focused on Mr Gillett being underpaid. The court instead applied the binding court decision of Wayling v Jones. > \\"The overwhelming weight of authority shows that detriment is required. But > the authorities also show that it is not a narrow or technical concept. The > detriment need not consist of the expenditure of money or other quantifiable > financial detriment, so long as it is something substantial... There must be > sufficient causal link between the assurance relied on and the detriment > asserted‚Ä¶ Whether the detriment is sufficiently substantial is to be tested > by whether it would be unjust or inequitable to allow the assurance to be > disregarded - that is, again, the essential test of unconcsionability. The > detriment alleged must be pleaded and proved‚Ä¶\\" Apart from being underpaid, Mr Gillett said he did not look for other employment, spent more time than a normal employee, spent money improving The Beeches, which was barely habitable when bought in 1971, new fittings and materials, working himself, and took no steps to secure his future, for example through getting a pension. The judge did not look at the matter in the round, and Mr Gillett‚Äôs case on detriment ‚Äòwas an unusually compelling one.‚Äô What matters is that there would be a detriment if there were no proprietary estoppel claim, citing Dixon J in Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Gold Mines Ltd (1938) 59 CLR 641, 674-5. The freehold of The Beeches farmhouse and the of land was ordered be transferred, and ¬£100,000 paid to Gillett for exclusion from all the rest of the farming businesses.

Formed in June 1941, the 25th Army did not see combat until the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, when it advanced into northern Korea. After World War II it was responsible for the Soviet Civil Administration in the northern Korean Peninsula, and helped establish a Communist state in North Korea under the rule of Kim Il-Sung. The army remained in North Korea until it was withdrawn in 1948, and was stationed in Primorsky Krai until its 1957 disbandment.  World War II  It was formed in the Soviet Far East Front on the basis of the headquarters of the 43rd Rifle Corps (in Primorsky Krai) on 20 June 1941 in accordance with an order of 8 March. Headquartered at Voroshilov, it was commanded by Lieutenant General Filipp Parusinov. The army initially comprised 39th Rifle Corps with 32nd Rifle Division, 40th, and 92nd Rifle Divisions, as well as the 105th Rifle Division and the 106th, 107th, 108th, 110th, and 111th Fortified Areas as Army troops.Combat composition of the Soviet Army, 22 June 1941 The army was responsible for defending the border in Primorsky Krai. On 10 August 1943, the army became part of the Maritime Group of Forces, which on 20 April 1945 became part of the Far Eastern Front, and was soon directly subordinated to the Stavka. In June, Colonel General Ivan Chistyakov took command of the army. On 5 August, the army became part of the 1st Far East Front, which was redesignated from the Maritime Group of Forces in preparation for the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. At the time, the 393rd Rifle Division and the 7th and 113th Fortified Areas were in the army's direct subordination. By the beginning of the invasion on 9 August, the army included the 39th Rifle Corps with the 40th, the 384th, and the 386th Rifle Divisions, the 393rd Rifle Division, and the 7th, 106th, 107th, 108th, 110th, 111th, and the 113th Fortified Areas.Combat composition of the Soviet Army, 9 August 1945 During the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, the army fought in the Harbin‚ÄìKirin Offensive Operation. By the end of 10 August the army overcame Japanese resistance to capture the Dongning, Dongxin-zhen, and the Hunchun fortified areas, cut the Dongning-Tumyntsa-Hunchun road, advanced through Japanese defenses to a depth of to . On 11 August, the 25th Army captured Laoheishan and Hunchun, and on the next day captured the ports of Unggi and Rason on the east coast of Korea alongside landing forces of the Pacific Fleet. As a result of its advances, the army received the 5th Army's 17th Rifle Corps and the 88th Rifle Division and 10th Mechanized Corps from front reserve. With the reinforcements, the army also received a new task: to advance south and cut the communications between Japanese troops in Korea and those in Manchuria, and in cooperation with the Pacific Fleet landing forces, to capture ports on the east coast of Korea. In fulfilling this task, the army defeated parts of the Japanese 3rd and 34th Armies and captured Wangqing on 15 August, Chongjin on 16 August, Ranan and Yanji on 17 August, among others. Between 18 and 20 August, the army disarmed surrendered Japanese troops, and was redeployed to the Pyongyang area at the end of the month.  Postwar  Troops of the army in Korea, October 1945 The army's headquarters was established at Pyongyang on 26 August after Chistyakov rejected the option of Hamhung on the previous day after the 25th Army was given the task of occupying what would become North Korea. The location of the 25th Army's headquarters in Pyongyang probably determined the location of the future North Korean capital. Immediately after the end of the war with Japan it included 39th Rifle Corps (40th, 384th Rifle Divisions and 10th Mechanised Division) and 88th Rifle Corps (258th, 386th and 393rd Rifle Divisions) and 8 fortified regions (including the 7th, 106th, 108th, 110th, 111th, 113th, 150th, 162nd) but they were all reorganised in 1946 into machine-gun artillery divisions. There were also the 72nd, 76th, 218th, 259th Tank Brigades. On 1 October, the army became part of the Primorsky Military District. The two corps were disbanded in August 1946 and 65th Rifle Corps (63rd and 144th Rifle Divisions) was transferred to the 25th Army from the 5th Army. The division of Korea between the United States and the Soviet Union after the defeat of Japan had been agreed to at the Tehran Conference in 1943. The 25th Army served as the occupation force in north of the 38th parallel while the U.S. Army Military Government in Korea was established in the south. Under the Soviet Civil Administration the 25th Army helped place Kim Il-Sung and the Korean Workers' Party into power. They also assisted with the purges of former collaborators, businessmen, landowners, and religious leaders. These people would either flee to the future South Korea or would be banished or imprisoned in the Hamgyong Province. In late 1948, the army was withdrawn from North Korea and stationed in southern Primorsky Krai on the Korean and Chinese borders, as well as on the Peter the Great Gulf coast. Its headquarters was located in Shkotovo. In March 1953 the army also included the 9th, 10th, 21st, and 24th Machine-Gun Artillery Divisions. The 10th Mechanized Division had become part of the 65th Rifle Corps by this time, and the 40th Rifle Division was directly subordinated to the army. In April 1953, the Primorsky Military District was disbanded, and the army became part of the Far Eastern Military District. The army's last commander was Lieutenant General (promoted to Colonel General 8 August 1955) Ivan Rubanyuk, who assumed command on 18 May 1953. The 65th Rifle Corps and its divisions were disbanded in the summer of 1956 and the remaining 25th Army rifle divisions became motor rifle divisions in the spring of 1957. On 1 May, the army included the 40th, 84th, 147th, and the 148th Motor Rifle Divisions. In December 1957, the army was disbanded and its remaining divisions transferred to the 5th Army. The 84th, 147th, and 148th Divisions were disbanded along with the 25th Army.

These may convey information about, for example, flora and fauna, soil science, geology, mining, ecology or cultural history. Longer trails, that link more widely spaced natural phenomena or structures together, may be referred to as themed trails or paths. In order to give a clearer explanation of the objects located at each station, display boards or other exhibits are usually erected, in keeping with the purpose of the trail. These may include: information boards, photographs and pictures, maps or plans, display cases and models, slides, sound or multimedia devices, facilities to enable experimentation and so on. The routes are regularly maintained. Educational trails with a strong thematic content may also be called \\"theme paths\\", \\"theme trails\\" or \\"theme routes\\", or may be specially named after their subject matter, for example the Welsh Mountain Zoo Trail, Anglezarke Woodland Trail, Cheshire Lines Railway Path, Great Harwood Nature Trail, Irwell Sculpture Trail, Salthill Quarry Geology Trail and Wildlife Conservation Trail. The purpose of such trails is to increase knowledge, sometimes this is linked to tourism and recreation or the raising of environmental awareness. Often, the stations provide imaginative and interactive ways to experience nature. Occasionally, guided tours with expert guides are available. History The first official educational trail was created in 1925 on the initiative of a museum director in the Palisades Interstate Park in New York and New Jersey in the United States. The first nature trail in the United States was created at Harriman State Park's Station for the Study of Insects, established by Dr. Frank E Lutz of the American Museum of Natural History in cooperation with the Palisades Interstate Park. Lutz developed a trail around the station and posted small signs to identify interesting trees, plants, insect haunts, and other natural features. In so doing, he created the first nature trail in the United States. In 1926 Lutz transplanted his educational techniques and scientific interest to Bear Mountain by establishing the Trailside Museum in cooperation with the American Museum of Natural History. The Trailside Museum and Wildlife Center remains a significant asset for the PIPC. At the beginning of the educational trail, the first sign read: \\"The spirit of the training trail: a friend somewhat versed in natural history is taking a walk with you and calling your attention to interesting things.\\" First sign along the Training Trail established by Dr. Frank E Lutz in 1925 at the Harriman State Park Nature Trail Quellen in der Region Basel at www.biogeography.unibas.ch. Retrieved 27 Oct 2017. In 1930 the first nature trail was laid in Germany. In the 1950s there was a sudden increase in nature trails in Germany, as growing urbanization led to a growth in the demand for recreation and an increase in car use led to greater mobility. From the 1960s in Germany nature trails were established primarily as forest trails to guide visitors. Most of them were signed paths that portrayed the forest ecosystem as worthy of protection in order to restrict the flood of urban drivers seeking recreation in natural areas. For this reason, circular nature trails were attached, initially, especially to large car parks on the edge of forests. In 1970 after the \\"European Nature Conservation Year\\" in Germany, the first Swiss educational trails were also established. At the beginning of the 1980s in Germany, educational trails were not just laid out as ordinary signed paths in which knowledge was conveyed by the written word only, but as trails where the perception and experience of nature with the senses was made more central. In 1998 it was estimated that the number of educational trails in Germany was around 1,000. Of these, 85% were forest and nature trails, and only 3% were nature experience trails. Since 2000 new media have increasingly been integrated into educational trails. Special types In addition there are also planet trails, which clarify the distances and dimensions of planets, and sculpture trails with artistic themes.

It is one of the nation's largest chambers of commerce, representing 4,000 businesses and nearly over 500,000 employees in southwestern Ohio, northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana, also known as Greater Cincinnati, or the Cincinnati‚ÄìNorthern Kentucky metropolitan area. An award-winning membership organization, the Chamber has been recognized as national Chamber of the Year twice. The Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce was founded October 15, 1839, by 76 firms and private individuals who placed an ad in the Cincinnati Daily Gazette urging local businessmen to attend a meeting at the Young Men's Mercantile Library Association headquarters in the old Cincinnati College Building at Fourth and Walnut Streets. This Chamber's founding preceded the United States Chamber of Commerce, which held its first meeting in Cincinnati, by 73 years. The Chamber celebrated its 175 Anniversary in 2014. The Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce met in six different temporary locations until in 1876 they began the process that led to a permanent structure. The Chamber's Board of Real Estate Managers invited six architects to compete in a selection competition. Henry Hobson Richardson's design won and that building was erected in 1889. A fire in 1911 caused substantial damage to the building, leading to the discovery that only $90,000 of insurance was carried on the building, which had cost $772,674.05 to build, and so it could not be repaired. When the property was sold, much of the granite from the building was saved and stored in Oakley, Ohio. In 1967, Professor John Peterson at UC's University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning coordinated an effort to build a memorial to Henry Hobson Richardson out of the surviving stones. A design competition whose jury included's Richardson's grandson was held in 1968 and the design by student Stephen Carter (architect) was selected. The memorial was completed in 1972 and resides in Burnet Woods. According to Charles Ludwig, a journalist in the 1920s and 1930s for the Cincinnati Times- Star, up to that time, the Chamber had been involved in most of the city's significant developments since its creation. As Cincinnati grew and became an eight-county metropolitan area in the mid-1960s, the Chamber changed its name to the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce to reflect its regional representation of businesses throughout Southwestern Ohio, Northern Kentucky and Southeastern Indiana. It is now called The Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber. The phrase \\"Cincinnati USA\\" is used to indicate that Greater Cincinnati extends beyond just one U.S. city and state. Cincinnati USA is a region of 15 counties (In Ohio: Butler, Warren, Hamilton, Clermont and Brown Counties. In Kentucky: Boone, Kenton, Campbell, Gallatin, Grant, Pendleton and Bracken Counties. In Indiana: Franklin, Dearborn and Ohio Counties) located in three states (Ohio, Kentucky & Indiana).

Facts The husband, was a fairly successful man of commerce and at all material times was and had been building up some capital assets which he invested in purchases of private and commercial property. After 10 years living in a house registered in his name with his wife, he left for a mistress. Soon he offered marriage, which she declined. They found a house in 1965 which he bought and he thereafter clearly assured her it would be hers. On the back of this she redecorated, buying carpets and curtains, improved and repaired, but there was never any written agreement or conveyance. Work she carried out and/or paid for: #Partly replumbing house, providing hot water from immersion system to kitchen and installing new sink unit and other fitments. Installing gas into the kitchen. #Joining outside toilet to rear door of premises by a blockwork-covered way. #Installing gas conduits and installing a gas fire into the lounge. #Repairing and retiling the roof where necessary and repairing lead valleys. #Repairing and redecorating interior. So she stayed on. He lived nearby and sometimes visited her. She continued to collect some rents for him. Then there was a quarrel. He decided to throw her out of the house if he could. In April 1976 his solicitors wrote to her giving her two months notice \\"to determine her licence to occupy\\", and demanded possession in June 1976. She refused to go. In this action he sued her for possession of what he regarded as his legal home; she counterclaimed for an order to give effect that he held the house on trust for her (and her heirs and assigns absolutely) and that the contents of the house belonged to her. Judgment The Court of Appeal held the mistress occupied the house under a bare licence, and had received an imperfect gift of the house. No trust could be inferred, but the encouragement to improve the house in the belief it was hers created a proprietary estoppel. A mere licence can be defeated by a sale of the house, so to comply with equity the legal owner, her ex-cohabitee was ordered to execute a conveyance.

Date accessed: 5 May 2012 He began a rise to prominence working for Sir Thomas Egerton, in whose household he was steward from 1602 to 1617. John Payne Collier published records by Mainwaring relating to a performance of Othello for Queen Elizabeth at this period; these were later recognised as forgeries, however. A genuine connection with William Shakespeare was an attempt led by Mainwaring in 1614 to enclose lands at Welcombe near Stratford-upon-Avon, defeated by local resistance. He was described as of Cheshire when he was knighted at the London Charterhouse on 11 May 1603.Knights of England Mainwaring also and concurrently became a courtier, carver in the household of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales from 1604. He was appointed Clerk of the Pipe at the Exchequer from 1610 to 1616. His financial position was improved when he became heir to Francis Wolley who died in 1609, despite litigation from family members. He became notorious as the lover of Anne Turner, hanged in 1615 for her part in the murder case of Sir Thomas Overbury. The relationship, seemingly tolerated by Anne's husband Dr. George Turner who died in 1610, led to children but no marriage. Arthur Wilson claimed that she bought powders from Simon Forman to try to bring him to wed her. In 1624, Mainwaring was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon for the Happy Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Huntingdon in 1625 and 1626. From 1628 to around 1642 he served as Lieutenant of Windsor Forest. In 1641 the forest was the scene of disorder and poaching of the deer, and he recommended firm action around Egham, which was however thwarted by local sympathies. He had objected at the beginning of the reign of Charles I to the East India Company's gunpowder mills on the edge of Windsor Forest;Edward Arthur Brayley Hodgetts and Tom Gregorie Tullock, The Rise and Progress of the British Explosives Industry (1909) pp. 240‚Äì1; archive.org. later, in 1635, he was himself in the gunpowder business with Andrew Pitcairn.Hodgetts and Tullock, pp. 276‚Äì7; archive.org.
