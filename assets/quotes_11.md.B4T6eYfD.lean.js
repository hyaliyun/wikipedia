John Bjorlie wrote that he was a \\"tidy-looking English gentleman with a bookish side who discovered ways of slipping into and out of countries that others just assumed were 'closed doors.' He was not a big man, and his pleasant, easygoing manner would not have conjured in your mind the picture of the fearless missionary.\\" Born in Crumpsall, Lancashire, England, Broadbent operated under the auspices of the Plymouth Brethren movement.Edmund Hamer Broadbent, Saint and Pioneer: recollections and reflections. London: Paternoster Press, 1946; by George Henry Lang His missionary work from 1900 into the 1920s took him to Austria, Belgium, Egypt, Germany, Poland, Russia, Turkey, the Baltic states, North and South America, and Uzbekistan. He spoke fluent French and German and could speak some Russian. Broadbent's book, The Pilgrim Church, first published in 1931, is an alternative history of the church, unrecorded by secular history. It covers the history of many small churches throughout the ages that have attempted to follow the New Testament church pattern, what he regarded as the success of those that followed the pattern laid out by the apostles and the consequences to the churches that fell away from the pattern. He looks broadly at many groups such as the Paulicians, the Bogomils, the Nestorians, the Waldensians, the Anabaptists, the Hutterites, the Methodists, the Russian Mennonites and the Mennonite Brethren. He classified early primitive churches to Anabaptist, and classified the Moravian Brethren as the historical roots to the later Brethren Movement. Broadbent married Dora Holiday in Bradford in 1891, and together they had eight children. Broadbent died in Stoke-on-Trent on 28 June 1945. TrueBridge network of churches works to restore the church to her ‚Äúroots‚Äù exemplified in the New Testament. As seen in E.H.

It was a small farming community situated south of Lincoln and northwest of Sleaford, composed of a church and several houses. During the English Civil War of 1642-1646 the church fell into ruins. Today only fields and one deserted farmhouse remain. History  Early history  Archaeological investigations in the area around Skinnand indicate the countryside was occupied from at least the Bronze Age, in about 600 BC. The remains of Iron Age farms have been found at nearby Navenby, west of Skinnand, as well as Bronze Age and Roman remains. Skinnand was recorded as \\"Schinende\\" in the Domesday Book of 1086, a name thought to be of Anglo-Saxon origin. Historians believe the original name may have come from the Old Scandinavian word \\"skinnari,\\" which means \\"skinner or tanner.\\"  Middle Ages  The ancient parish of Skinnand was recorded as the smallest village in the Deanery of Longoboby in 1332. It had the lowest tax assessment, a population of around 40 and was predominantly based on agriculture. The population of Skinnand stayed stable for many generations but, by 1563, only three of the original ten households remained. This decrease in numbers has been attributed, by some historians, to a reduction in arable farming and a rise in sheep production. Records show that the village of Skinnand had up to six houses before the English Civil War, most built as small single-storey stone dwellings with thatched roofs. Two, however, were much larger. One was owned by a John Chester, which boasted four domestic rooms with 'upper chambers,' and the other was the parsonage. The parsonage included a hall, two parlours, a kitchen, buttery, milkhouse, brewhouse and stable. It also had three upstairs rooms, as well as an orchard, garden, yard and dovecote. It is believed the parsonage was pulled down, however, during the Civil War and, by the time of the Hearth Tax returns of 1665, there were just three houses in Skinnand. Details about the Norman-built Anglican church of Skinnand are sketchy, although it was reputedly dedicated to St Matthew and burned down by Oliver Cromwell's forces in the 1640s. Historical records certainly show that it had begun to fall into ruins in the 17th century - at around the time of the English Civil War. The Glebe Terrier documents of 1700 recorded: \\"The church was in ruins, no house for the rector, more than this we find not, all the buildings being long since disappeared.\\" Despite the disappearance of the church, parish registers reveal that services were still held throughout the 19th century, at the home of Skinnand man John Woolfitt. The Skinnand burial ground was also in use until 1911.  19th century  Skinnand was a village of just 12 people in 1801, according to the Census returns. The population did rise slightly over the next 100 years, to 30 in 1901, but by 1921 numbers were once again decreasing and the figure stood at 25. Census returns also reveal that most of the village men worked on the land as unskilled labourers. The children of these poor labourers attended school at Wellingore, just south of Navenby, and at Carlton-le-Moorland and Bassingham - each village several miles walk away. As a result of the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act, the parish became part of the Lincoln Poor Law Union and, by the mid-19th century, Skinnand was a struggling parish in the Higher division of the wapentake of Boothby Graffoe. According to the Institute of Historical Research, it consisted of , of which 40 were arable and the rest \\"old pasture and meadow.\\" The records add: \\"The living is a discharged rectory, valued in the King's books at ¬£5. 13. 11¬Ω.; net income, ¬£85; patron, S. Nicholls, Esq. The church is in ruins.\\" Skinnand was also the main residence in the area for the Woolfitt family, land owners and clergy at the church. Headstones for members of the Woolfitt family, including local Methodist minister John Woolfitt, can be found in the remains of the cemetery. In 1871 it was recorded that \\"just a few stones remain to mark the location\\" of the old church. In the same year, the Census showed that the parish now consisted of only three farms, all belonging to Mr S. Nicholls of London. Other surnames in the parish at that time included Clawson, Burt and Picker.  20th century  The 1911 Census shows that the population of Skinnand was once again in decline at the turn of the 20th century, with just 28 people living in the village. Most were tenant labourers as, by 1913, William Grant of Grimsby was the principal landowner. The village was occupied for just a few more years, however, before the final families moved out. Today, just a boarded up old farm house stands where the thriving community of Skinnand once was.  Governance  The parish of Skinnand was in the higher division of the ancient Boothby Graffoe wapentake, in the North Kesteven division of the county of Lincolnshire. The term wapentake dates back to the Vikings and was used to describe a collection of local parishes. It meant \\"show your weapon\\" and the idea behind the term was that all those in favour of a resolution would raise their sword or axe to show agreement. A panoramic view across Navenby lowfields, where Skinnand once stood, taken from the top of the Lincoln Cliff at Clint Lane, Navenby The History of the County of Lincoln, a book written by Thomas Allen in 1834, states: Skinnand was classed as an ancient parish from the 11th to the 19th century, as it came \\"under the jurisdiction of a clergyman\\" and existed before 1597. Early records show that the Manor of Navenby and Skinnand was granted to the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln in 1292. The money generated by land rent was used by Roger de Newton, the first incumbent of the chantry chapel at Harby, Nottinghamshire, to maintain the building. This followed the death of Queen Eleanor, wife of Edward I, while on a visit to Lincoln. Eleanor died at de Newton's manor house at Harby in November 1290 and the chapel was erected in her honour.A derelict farmhouse - about one mile south-southeast of the site of Skinnand The parish began to take on civil and ecclesiastical duties following the 16th century Dissolution of the Monasteries and the Tudor Poor Law Acts of 1601. The ecclesiastical parish of Navenby was placed in the Longoboby Rural Deanery, but was transferred to the Graffoe Rural Deanery in 1968, and it is still part of the Diocese of Lincoln. Navenby became a civil parish in the 19th century and became a member of the Lincoln Poor Law Union in 1834. The parish was also part of the Lincoln Rural Sanitary District. The Skinnand civil parish boundaries were adjusted in 1931, to include the civil parish of nearby Navenby. Following the Local Government Act 1888, Skinnand was governed by Branston Rural District Council from 1894‚Äì1931. The village then came under the control of North Kesteven Rural District Council from 1931‚Äì1974, after the Local Government Act 1972 reformed the districts of Holland, Kesteven and much of Lindsey into the shire county of Lincolnshire. Today Skinnand remains part of the North Kesteven district. Before the 1832 Reform Act, Lincolnshire sent twelve members to parliament, including two for the county, two for the city of Lincoln and two for the boroughs of Boston, Grantham, Great Grimsby and Stamford. As a result of the act, Lincolnshire's electoral divisions were amended, and Skinnand became part of the South Division Parliamentary District for Lincolnshire. Two Whig candidates, Henry Handley and Gilbert John Heathcote, were returned in the first election. The village remained in the South Division until 1867, when it was transferred to the Mid Division. In 1885 it joined the North Kesteven Division, and in 1918 it became part of the Grantham Division, until 1974. Geography The civil parish of Skinnand lies close to the old Roman Ermine Street, known locally as High Dyke. The road runs between the neighbouring villages of Boothby Graffoe, Navenby and Wellingore and covers more than . The Viking Way, a 147-mile (237 km) footpath between the Humber Bridge in North Lincolnshire and Oakham in Rutland, also passes through the parish. Skinnand is located at and is situated just below the ridge of Jurassic limestone called the Lincoln Edge or Lincoln Cliff. The small cliff is one of only a few hills in Lincolnshire. Lying 8.7 miles (14 km) south of Lincoln and 8.9 miles (14.3 km) north- northwest of Sleaford, Skinnand enjoys warm summers and dry frosty winters. During the Ice Age, most of the region surrounding Skinnand was covered by ice sheets and this has influenced the topography and nature of the soils. Much of Lincolnshire is low-lying, in some places below sea level, including Skinnand. The parish of Skinnand and Navenby is elongated in an east‚Äìwest direction, extending east to the Lincoln Heath and west to the River Brant.Burnham, Barry C. (2001) Roman Britain in 2001. The size of the parish has varied over the past two centuries. In 1821 it covered ; in 1951 it was . Climate According to the K√∂ppen classification, the British Isles experience a maritime climate characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Compared with other parts of the country, Lincolnshire ‚Äì and Skinnand ‚Äì are slightly warmer and sunnier in the summer and colder and frostier in the winter. Owing to Skinnand's inland position, far from the landfall of most Atlantic depressions, it is one of the driest places to live in the UK, receiving, on average, less than 3 ft (600 mm) of rain per year. The mean annual daily duration of bright sunshine is four hours and 12 minutes; the absence of any high ground is probably responsible for the area being one of the sunniest parts of the British Isles.

It is an ancient dish derived from Levantine and North African cuisines,Anissa Helou, \\"Freekeh\\", in Alan Davidson, ed., The Oxford Companion to Food remaining popular in many countries of the eastern Mediterranean Basin where durum wheat originated. The wheat is harvested while the grains are green and the seeds are still soft; it is then piled and sun-dried. The piles are carefully set on fire so only the straw and chaff burn. Under these conditions, the high moisture content of the seeds prevents them from burning. The roasted wheat is then threshed and sun-dried to achieve a uniform flavour, texture and colour. This threshing or rubbing process of the grains gives this food its name, farƒ´k or ‚Äúrubbed‚Äù. Finally, the seeds are cracked into smaller pieces that resemble green bulgur.Freekeh - Farik - Green Wheat Clifford A. Wright. History Freekeh is mentioned in an early thirteenth-century Baghdad cook book as farƒ´kiyya. In that recipe, meat is fried in oil and braised with water, salt, and cinnamon bark. Then, dried coriander is stirred in with young wheat (\\"freekeh\\") and is cooked. Finally, the meal is served with cumin, cinnamon, and fresh lamb tail fat. Culinary Turkish firik (left) and bulgur (right) before cooking In Egypt, freekeh is served as ·∏•amƒÅm bi‚Äôl-ferƒ´k (pigeon stuffed with green wheat). Freekeh also is prepared in Egypt with onion and tomato, and sometimes, with chicken. Sh≈´rbat farƒ´k bi‚Äôl-mukh is a freekeh and bone marrow soup from Tunisia. , a green wheat pilaf dish with roasted lamb, spring peas, and pine nuts, comes from Jordan, and sh≈´rba al-farƒ´k is a Palestinian soup with green wheat and chicken. In Syria, freekeh usually is prepared with lamb, onion, butter, almonds, black pepper, cinnamon, cumin, and salt. In Tunisia and Algeria, freekeh is usually prepared as a main ingredient in a tomato-based soup called \\"chorba't frik\\", which is considered a traditional national dish. In Turkey, where this food is known as firik, a pilaf dish based on freekeh, called firik pilavƒ±, is found in traditional Southern Anatolian cuisine. It may be combined with bulgur; legumes such as chickpeas and various herbs and spices, and sometimes meat, may be added. With the influx since 2011 of millions of Syrian refugees, firik is available in markets all over Turkey. Nutritional value Freekeh's nutritional attributes are comparable to other cereal grains, especially durum wheat, from which it is derived, depending on the durum cultivar. Durum is notable for its high content of protein (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV), dietary fiber, B vitamins, and several dietary minerals, especially manganese (143% DV) (table). Before roasting, freekeh is 11% water, 71% carbohydrates, 2.5% fat, and 14% protein.

In July 1955, the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) subpoenaed Fuchs to see whether he could help identify members of the \\"Ware Group.\\" He testified that he had been a member of the Communist Party USA from 1934 to the late 1940s. He admitted to membership and activities for three Communist cells from 1934 to 1946. Initially, he refused to name names of fellow Party members. American University President Hurst Robins Anderson initially defended Fuchs after he testified to the committee. Fuchs had fully disclosed to Anderson the extent of his activities at the time the story of his Communist Party membership broke. The university later fired him on the basis that Fuchs had withheld information regarding his Party activities, but could only vouch that the information had been withheld prior to Fuchs being outed for his membership. In the University community, there was a contingent that believed Anderson had reneged on his initial position when he fired Fuchs for failure to disclose his Communist Party Membership at the time of his hiring. The full story behind the university's firing of Fuchs remains arguable and unclear as Fuchs was cooperating with the Committee at the time he was fired. For some former students the firing put a regretable black eye on an institution otherwise known for progressive leadership in law and governance.Unpublished oral history of Eugene Arthur Higgins In December 1955, Fuchs again testified before HUAC, and this time he named names. He had been recruited in 1934 in New York City by a \\"very good friend\\" and joined a taxicab communist group for a year. He then moved to a Consolidated Edison power plant, where comrades included James Stasinos and Leah Robison. In 1936, on the Wheeler Committee, Arthur Stein (a founder of the United Federal Workers of America) led that group of comrades, who included: James Gorham, Samuel Koenigsberg, Ellis Olim, and Margaret Bennett Porter (wife of John W. Porter). At the NLRB, his comrades were: Arthur Stein again, Allan Rosenberg, Martin Kurasch, Joseph Robison, Eleanor Nelson, Henry Rhine, Philip Reno, Sidney Katz, Julia Katz, and Bernard Stern. At the time, Nathan Witt was NLRB assistant general counsel. HUAC asked him detailed questions about Allan Rosenberg, who had also worked at the Board of Economic Warfare, where his supervisor was Max Lowenthal. Fuchs would not say whether Lowenthal was a communist but did confirm that Rosenberg had also worked in the office of Nathan Witt, by that time Secretary of the NLRB. Fuchs also admitted that he had known Joseph Robison in New York and that Leah Robison was a cousin. Fuchs also mentioned knowing David Rein at the NLRB, as well as afterwards when Rein entered private practice. Returning to comrades at the Board of Economic Welfare, Fuchs named Woodrow Sandler, Jacob H. Krug, Mortimer Riemer, Ruth Weyand, Margaret Bennett Porter, John W. Porter, Harry Cooper, Frank Donner, Edward Scheunemann, Bert Diamond. Eventually, Fuchs named Victor Perlo as Party dues collector at the NLRB; Arthur Stein succeeded him.Note: Party dues collector was one of the roles Whittaker Chambers had when running the Ware Group and other spy networks in Washington. Toward the end of his testimony, HUAC had an editorial read into the transcript from a December 10, 1955, issue of the Saturday Evening Post entitled \\"Why No Fuss When a Helpful Ex-Red Professor is Fired?\\" in support of Fuch's termination at American University. Fuchs was exonerated of any illegal activities with respect to his Party membership. Representative Gordon H. Scherer stated, \\"to start to fire men who cooperate with the committee can only... stop others from cooperating.\\" Return to government Emanuel Celler, Dean of the United States House of Representatives, rehired Fuchs to government as a committee staffer HUAC Chairman Francis Walters later helped Fuchs obtain a staff position with House Judiciary Committee chairman Emanuel Celler. Fuchs remained on the Judiciary Committee staff until he retired. Personal life and death Fuchs married Frances Rice; they had two children. Their daughter Margaret Fuchs Singer wrote about her father's ordeal in Legacy of a False Promise. Fuchs died in the Spring of 1988.

They were originated by Adolph Kolping, surnamed the Journeymen's Father (Gesellenvater). They had for aims the religious, moral, and professional improvement of young workers. Foundation In 1849 Kolping was appointed assistant-priest at the Cologne Cathedral. With friends, ecclesiastics and laymen, he founded a Gesellenverein, and began free instruction through it. The Cologne society soon acquired its own home, and opened there a refuge, or hospice, for young travelling journeymen. Kolping was energetic and eloquent both as speaker and writer. He visited frequently the great industrial centres of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Hungary. In a short time societies of young Catholic journeymen were formed in many Rhenish towns, in Westphalia, and finally throughout the German-speaking world. Movement When Kolping died (4 December 1865), the Gesellenverein numbered about 400 branch unions. In 1901 they had reached the number of 1086, with a membership of 80,000 journeymen and 120,000 master-workmen. They existed in many other European countries, also. Besides providing for Catholic doctrine, the societies conducted classes (book-keeping, arithmetic, drawing, literary composition, music, natural sciences, etc.) In the larger cities there were free classes in crafts. Instruction was designed especially for those workmen who aimed at establishing a business of their own. The principal publication was the Kolpingsblatt.

Goussis is currently detained in Flinders Peak Unit of Marngoneet Correction Centre in Lara, Victoria. Early life Goussis was born in Tashkent, in the former Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, of the USSR to a family of Greek immigrants in Uzbekistan. Ange Goussis' father, Aristides Goussis, had been a resistance fighter against the Nazis during World War II for Greece, and was a pro-Soviet guerilla in the brutal Greek Civil War of the late 1940s. In 1949, following the victory against the communist guerillas in Greece, Aristides and his wife, Mahi, a Red Cross child-care worker, fled to Uzbekistan. Goussis arrived in Australia, aged eight years. After leaving school, Goussis held various jobs such as an apprentice motor mechanic, a sheet metal worker, fitness consultant and nightclub bouncer. During his early twenties, Goussis drifted into a life of crime after meeting many criminal associates via his employment as a bouncer and via boxing. In November 1989, Goussis was convicted of attempted murder and trafficking in heroin and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.. In March 2004, he was convicted of carrying an unregistered firearm. Boxing and kickboxing career As a boxer, Goussis won the inaugural Lionel Rose Shield. By 1987, he was a contender for the 1988 Summer Olympics to be held in Seoul; however, he did not qualify.https://www.theage.com.au/national/the- hard-fall-of-goussis-the-contender-20080712-3e74.html In the early 1990s, Goussis competed in kickboxing. Goussis became the (WKA) World Kickboxing Association middleweight champion. Goussis' name stands alongside many other Greek kickboxing greats such as former world champions, Stan 'The Man' Longinidis and Tosca Petridis, Louie 'The Ice' Iosifidis, and current world champion 'Iron' Mike Zambidis and others. Goussis went eventually back to boxing, however, training with Keith Ellis. He had three professional fights, TKO-ing Shane Wirth in 39 seconds in March 1995 and drawing with Ricky Jackson two weeks later. In October 1997, at Bondi, he stopped Adam Turner in the first round. Melbourne gangland killings Murder of Lewis Caine Lewis Caine (also known as Sean Vincent) was an underworld figure based in Melbourne, and boyfriend of lawyer Zarah Garde-Wilson. Caine had lived with Garde-Wilson for a period of approximately two years before his death. On 8 May 2004 Goussis and associate Keith Faure travelled to Melbourne from Geelong to meet with Caine in a Carlton hotel at the invitation of Faure. The body of Caine was found with a single gunshot wound to his head in a dead-end Brunswick street on 8 May 2004. At his trial for the murder of Caine, Goussis claimed self-defence, stating Caine produced a gun and fired at him; however, the gun jammed. Goussis stated he then shot Caine to the head with a single shot before dumping his body in the laneway. Goussis was found guilty by a jury for the murder of Caine. Murder of Lewis Moran Masked gunmen entered the Brunswick Club on Sydney Road, Brunswick at approximately 6:40 pm on 31 March 2004. Moran ran from his place at the bar and through a poker machine room before the gunman caught up with him and shot him twice, the fatal bullet being fired into the back of his head from a few centimetres away. Associate Bertie Wrout was severely wounded but survived the attack. On 29 May 2008, Goussis was found guilty of the murder of Lewis Moran and on 9 February 2009, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum 30-year non- parole period. Other legal matters Goussis was under investigation for the murder of male prostitute, Shane Chartres-Abbott, who was shot dead in a professional hit outside his Reservoir home on 4 June 2003. Chartres-Abbott was travelling to the Melbourne County Court where he was due to appear to face rape charges. In 2010 the underworld assassin admitted to shoot dead Abbot, and has linked to corrupt cops to the murder. On 8 July 2014 the Victorian Supreme Court jury found that Goussis and two other co-accused were not guilty for the murder of Chartres-Abbott. The key point the decision was instructions from the defence advising the jury that if they could not be certain Goussis pulled the trigger that they should not find him guilty. Whilst his co-accused were released from custody resulting from the decision, Goussis himself is still serving time in the Acacia unit at Barwon prison for his other gangland adventures. In 2013 growing disquiet emerged regarding the nature of the evidence used to secure Goussis's convictions. It was revealed that contradictory accounts by the primary prosecution witness had been rewritten to fit in with telephone call records provided by police. In 2014 Goussis released his account of events, alleging police misconduct, and called for a royal commission.

The comedy series is produced by the television company talkbackTHAMES, a division of FremantleMedia (part of the RTL Group) Back story The Toyboize, a boy band, were formed in February 1988 by Scottish pop svengali Rab Morrison who came up with the idea whilst on holiday in Sri Lanka. Hot on the heels of his brief success with short-lived Glaswegian trio 'Boys Next Door', Morrison had an inkling that the world was ready for a talented child pop act. After appearing as a judge on TV's New Faces he recruited 12-year-old singer/songwriter duo Reece Phillips and Tim Hughes. Martin Power was spotted breakdancing on breakfast TV whilst JP Lambert and Nicky Naylor were found through a rigorous nationwide talent search. The resulting line up was christened the Toyboize. After a period of writing and rehearsal the Toyboize released their first single \\"Sherbert Dip\\" in June which struggled to make an impact but hinted at the promise of what was to come. In late October their second single \\"I Like U Girl\\" reached number 2 in the charts and it is this catchy pop classic that most people remember them for. Their album We Like U Girl was a big smash, reaching number 3 in the charts at its peak. Never one to miss an opportunity to satisfy an adoring public, Morrison rushed a seasonal Christmas album into production (A Very Toyboize Christmas) and this LP saw them register a second chart album hit in as many months. They were unable to replicate such levels of success in 1989 as they struggled to compete with Bros and New Kids On The Block. Most of the group knew they had outgrown their roles as child stars and felt it would be best to call it a day. The group were pleased, however, that Reece had decided to stick at the music and have watched on with delight as he has carved himself a career as an international pop star. Almost 20 years on, with the public clamouring for an encore, the other four Toyboize have decided to step back into the spotlight. Reece decided not to reunite with the other members for the 20th anniversary celebratory tour and events which was a minor blow to the remaining Boize. Production and reception The series is a sequence of episodes and diary clips that were initially released over a six-week period in May‚ÄìJune 2008. Additional videos were added in 2009 and 2010. The title music \\"I Like U Girl\\" was co-written and recorded by Ricky Gervais. The series also features actors from The Office including Stirling Gallacher and Ewen Macintosh. Primarily hosted on the Toyboize YouTube channel, Toyboize has been acquired by the UKTV network to play exclusively on its entertainment TV channel, Dave from Monday 9 March 2009. This was the first time that an online originated comedy series has been picked up by a broadcaster in the UK and comes off the back of the huge success of the comedy series on YouTube.

It was discontinued in 2010. Train to Gain was designed to deliver vocational training to employed individuals in the UK, primarily those in the 25+ age band who did not already have a Full Level 2 Qualification, via the Skills Funding Agency, formerly the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The initiative was rolled out nationally in September 2006.'Train to Gain' roll-out to boost UK business skills, Bytestart Limited, 2006-09-20 Train to Gain formed a part of the Employer Responsive training model. On 24 May 2010 the UK government announced a ¬£200 million reduction in this programme as part of its planned ¬£6.2 billion reduction in expenditure in the 2010-11 government financial year. The Train to Gain brand was scrapped in July 2010.FEWeek: Adult apprenticeships benefit from Train to Gain funding  Background  Train to Gain was designed to ameliorate the skills deficiency in the UK identified by the Leitch review.Leitch Review The purported idea of the service is to offer skills advice and match business needs with Further Education and training providers. The service will also identify any funding or grants that can be used to offset the investment in training. The support and advice offered by Train to Gain is claimed to be flexible, responsive and offered at a time and place to suit businesses. The supposed appeal to employers is that they receive targeted, quality approved training to upskill their staff in line with their individual and business related needs. The appeal to employees is allegedly that they are invested in, given training to help them in their role and the opportunity to certify their existing skills. In addition to this there is funding available to improve their overall skills and levels of literacy and numeracy. A NAO report published in July 2009 queried whether the tax payer was receiving good value for money from this programme.  The Skills Brokerage service  Train to Gain is designed to maximise on the effectiveness of the Skills Brokerage ‚Äî Skills Brokers liaise with employers to identify their skill needs and then provide a matching service with appropriate training providers. Thus Train to Gain can also reference the entirety of employer training and liaison.  Learner eligibility  The fundamental criteria for eligibility for Train to Gain core funding are: *No Full Level 2 or higher (equivalent to 5 GCSEs at A*-C) *25 and over *EU resident for the last 3 years *Employed (by an English employer) Learners in the 19‚Äì25 age band are eligible for funding through Train to Gain where an apprenticeship would not be considered appropriate, for example where the learner is on a temporary contract. Apprenticeships are the UK government's preferred route for vocational training in this age group. Learners below the age of 19 cannot be funded through Train to Gain.  Qualification eligibility  Qualifications that are eligible for funding via Train to Gain are identified as such in the LSC's Learning Aims Database (LAD). These are primarily NVQs at level 2 or level 3 alongside Skills for Life at levels 1 & 2\\\\.  Flexibilities  During the course of the 07/08 contract year the LSC released several additional \\"flexibilities\\" applying to learner eligibility. These allowed volunteers to access the Train to Gain service, as well as self-employed learners. A further flexibility allows exemption from the criteria concerning prior attainment (i.e. no full level 2), for learners coming through the local employment partnership (LEP) route. That is to say, those learners who find work through Jobcentre Plus and subsequently come on to Train to Gain. The LSC has outlined further enhancements to the Train to Gain service in a recent letter to training providers. These include additional level 2s and level 3s for those who already have them (under specific circumstances), accessibility to Skills for life for those ineligible due to prior attainment and funding for Skills for life at levels other than 1 and 2.

In 2016 it was refounded under the same name as the young wing of the Italian Communist Party (2016). History Constituted in 1949, its peak was in the 1960s, when its membership reached 200,000 and it thus sought to gain a profile independent of its parent organisation. The Federation's newsletters and publications thus assumed a more avant-garde role, most importantly \\"La citt√† futura\\" (taking its name from a special issue published in February 1917 by the Federazione giovanile piemontese del Partito Socialista drawn up by Antonio Gramsci himself) and \\"Nuova generazione\\" (drawn up, not without some protests, in 1956). On 8 October 1990 the Fgci's secretary Gianni Cuperlo, proposed to Ariccia, following the line of Achille Occhetto, that the FGCI be dissolved in order to create the Sinistra Giovanile, a federal organisation with the aim of creating four associations in schools, in territories, in universities, in workplaces, all federated together. The proposal was passed, with 91 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 13 against. On 19 December 1990, the 25th and last congress of the FGCI opened at Pesaro, and on 22 December the FGCI dissolved itself with 356 of the 491 votes (72.5%) being in favour, out of a membership of 55,000. Most of the FGCI moved to the new Partito Democratico della Sinistra, which in 1992 gave birth to the Sinistra Giovanile del PDS (renamed simply Sinistra Giovanile in 1998). A minority, which first adhered to the Movimento per la Rifondazione Comunista and then to the Partito della Rifondazione Comunista, in 1995 gave birth to the Giovani Comunisti (GC). When the Partito dei Comunisti Italiani (PdCI) was born in 1998 as the result of a split in the PRC, the new party created the Federazione Giovanile Comunisti Italiani (FGCI) on the model of the dissolved federation. Periodicals printed by the FGCI were Giovent√π d'avanguardia (1949‚Äì1953), Il costruttore (1950‚Äì1956), Nuova generazione (monthly then sometimes weekly, 1956‚Äì1977), La citt√† futura (weekly, 1977‚Äì1979).

History The community of McClure was established prior to 1836, the year its post office opened, and was originally known as Clear Creek Landing or Clear Creek. The community's name was changed to Wheatland in 1887 due to the large wheat fields in the region. Thomas J. McClure, for whose family the village was eventually named, moved to the village in 1842; he and his wife Caroline became prominent local farmers and raised seven children. Their son J. T. became the village postmaster, and he had the post office's name changed to McClure in 1895 to avoid confusion with the Wheaton, Illinois post office.

The pilot received great reviews and an Artios Award nomination for Best Casting for TV, Comedy Pilot (Nikki Valko, Ken Miller). In the week of October 1, 2003, the series was ranked 7th highest in the top ten shows of the week according to Nielsen Research, with an average 12.1/18 rating. Thanks to this, the series was able to air another 23 episodes, and was renewed for a second season in 2004. The DVD set was released on Region 2 on September 12, 2005, and on Region 1 on September 11, 2007. Its bonus material included: a blooper, outtakes, a backstage tour with Angus T. Jones and a behind-the-scenes special, with the cast and crew of Two and a Half Men. Production The series is set in a large oceanfront home in Malibu, California, although most of the series is filmed in Burbank, California at the Warner Brothers Burbank Studios at 4000 Warner Boulevard. The show features Charlie Sheen as Charlie Harper, Jon Cryer as Alan Harper, Angus T. Jones as Jake Harper, Holland Taylor as Evelyn Harper, Melanie Lynskey as Rose and Marin Hinkle as Judith Harper. Conchata Ferrell as Berta had a recurring role in the first season, but became a main cast member in the following season. The song, \\"Manly Men\\", was written by the show's creator Chuck Lorre, and the signature opening intro features the theme being lip-synced by the show's three main actors, but they are not the original performers. One of the performers is Elizabeth Daily. Casting Originally, actress Blythe Danner was cast to portray Evelyn Harper, but when she started to suggest changes to scenes, she was dismissed by the producers; one of the bosses commented: \\"Blythe is a wonderful actress who was put in a part that was not a good fit for her.\\" \\"Most Chicks Won't Eat Veal\\", the original pilot, with Danner as Evelyn, remained unaired. According to the Internet Movie Database, Sheen was cast because the creators saw him on Spin City, in which he also portrayed a charming bachelor afraid of commitment. The show was becoming a huge hit, and breathed much needed life into Sheen's fading career. Before their reunion on the series, Cryer and Sheen had both appeared in the comedy Hot Shots. Other connections between the actors are that Taylor, Sheen and Cryer have each appeared in a John Hughes film (Sheen in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Cryer in Pretty in Pink and Taylor in She's Having a Baby), and that Jones, Ferrell, Taylor and Hinkle have all made guest appearances in ER. Additionally, Sheen and Cryer each made guest appearances on the animated series Family Guy. Cast Main * Charlie Sheen as Charlie Harper, a cheeky-chappy, jingle-writing bachelor whose life is dramatically changed when his brother moves in after separating from his wife, with his son visiting on the weekends. Charlie has a bad relationship with his mother, and has sex with an endless string of women. * Jon Cryer as Dr. Alan Harper, Charlie's younger brother. A chiropractor who has just separated from his wife of twelve years, Judith Harper, and is the father of Jake, who has a big appetite. Initially, Alan still loves Judith and does everything he can to be reconciled, but eventually they are divorced, with Alan paying alimony and child support. * Angus T. Jones as Jake Harper, the son of Alan and Judith Harper, who is upset by the separation of his parents. Jake is considerably sharp-witted for a boy his age, but his personality drastically changes as the series progresses. * Marin Hinkle as Judith Harper, the ex-wife of Alan Harper and mother of Jake Harper. Judith and Alan had just separated in the pilot episode, when she told him that she is gay, but she was later seen with other men and also briefly reunited with Alan. Alan pays Judith alimony and child support, but it is never mentioned whether she has ever held a job when living with Alan or afterwards. * Melanie Lynskey as Rose, the boundary-challenged stalker of Charlie Harper. They had a one-night stand and she will not let him forget it, claiming that she loves him. Regardless, the two eventually become close friends. Rose has a close friendship with Jake and eventually forms friendships with Alan, Berta, and Evelyn. * Holland Taylor as Evelyn Harper, the four-time widowed mother of Charlie and Alan Harper. Evelyn has her own real estate agency, is sexually rapacious and has a strained relationship with her sons and grandson. Evelyn loathes Judith and Berta. Recurring * Conchata Ferrell as Berta, Charlie's heavyset, acid-tongued housekeeper.

The model shows how banks' mix of illiquid assets (such as business or mortgage loans) and liquid liabilities (deposits which may be withdrawn at any time) may give rise to self-fulfilling panics among depositors. Theory The model, published in 1983 by Douglas W. Diamond of the University of Chicago and Philip H. Dybvig, then of Yale University and now of Washington University in St. Louis, shows how an institution with long-maturity assets and short-maturity liabilities can be unstable. Structure of the model Diamond and Dybvig's paper points out that business investment often requires expenditures in the present to obtain returns in the future. Therefore, they prefer loans with a long maturity (that is, low liquidity). The same principle applies to individuals seeking financing to purchase large-ticket items such as housing or automobiles. On the other hand, individual savers (both households and firms) may have sudden, unpredictable needs for cash, due to unforeseen expenditures. So they demand liquid accounts which permit them immediate access to their deposits (that is, they value short maturity deposit accounts). The banks in the model act as intermediaries between savers who prefer to deposit in liquid accounts and borrowers who prefer to take out long-maturity loans. Under ordinary circumstances, banks can provide a valuable service by channeling funds from many individual deposits into loans for borrowers. Individual depositors might not be able to make these loans themselves, since they know they may suddenly need immediate access to their funds, whereas the businesses' investments will only pay off in the future (moreover, by aggregating funds from many different depositors, banks help depositors save on the transaction costs they would have to pay in order to lend directly to businesses). Since banks provide a valuable service to both sides (providing the long-maturity loans businesses want and the liquid accounts depositors want), they can charge a higher interest rate on loans than they pay on deposits and thus profit from the difference. Nash equilibria of the model Diamond and Dybvig point out that under ordinary circumstances, savers' unpredictable needs for cash are likely to be random, as depositors' needs reflect their individual circumstances. Since depositors' demand for cash are unlikely to occur at the same time, by accepting deposits from many different sources the bank expects only a small fraction of withdrawals in the short term, even though all depositors have the right to withdraw their full deposit at any time. Thus, a bank can make loans over a long horizon, while keeping only relatively small amounts of cash on hand to pay any depositors that wish to make withdrawals. Mathematically, individual withdrawals are largely uncorrelated, and by the law of large numbers banks expect a relatively stable number of withdrawals on any given day. However a different outcome is also possible. Since banks lend out at long maturity, they cannot quickly call in their loans. And even if they tried to call in their loans, borrowers would be unable to pay back quickly, since their loans were, by assumption, used to finance long-term investments. Therefore, if all depositors attempt to withdraw their funds simultaneously, a bank will run out of money long before it is able to pay all the depositors. The bank will be able to pay the first depositors who demand their money back, but if all others attempt to withdraw too, the bank will go bankrupt and the last depositors will be left with nothing. This means that even healthy banks are potentially vulnerable to panics, usually called bank runs. If a depositor expects all other depositors to withdraw their funds, then it is irrelevant whether the banks' long term loans are likely to be profitable; the only rational response for the depositor is to rush to take his or her deposits out before the other depositors remove theirs. In other words, the Diamond‚ÄìDybvig model views bank runs as a type of self-fulfilling prophecy: each depositor's incentive to withdraw funds depends on what they expect other depositors to do. If enough depositors expect other depositors to withdraw their funds, then they all have an incentive to rush to be the first in line to withdraw their funds. In theoretical terms, the Diamond‚ÄìDybvig model provides an example of an economic game with more than one Nash equilibrium. If depositors expect most other depositors to withdraw only when they have real expenditure needs, then it is rational for all depositors to withdraw only when they have real expenditure needs. But if depositors expect most other depositors to rush quickly to close their accounts, then it is rational for all depositors to rush quickly to close their accounts. Of course, the first equilibrium is better than the second (in the sense of Pareto efficiency). If depositors withdraw only when they have real expenditure needs, they all benefit from holding their savings in a liquid, interest-bearing account. If instead everyone rushes to close their accounts, then they all lose the interest they could have earned, and some of them lose all their savings. Nonetheless, it is not obvious what any one depositor could do to prevent this mutual loss. Policy implications In practice, due to fractional reserve banking, banks faced with a bank run usually shut down and refuse to permit more withdrawals. This is called a suspension of convertibility, and engenders further panic in the financial system. While this may prevent some depositors who have a real need for cash from obtaining access to their money, it also prevents immediate bankruptcy, thus allowing the bank to wait for its loans to be repaid, so that it has enough resources to pay back some or all of its deposits. However, Diamond and Dybvig argue that unless the total amount of real expenditure needs per period is known with certainty, suspension of convertibility cannot be the optimal mechanism for preventing bank runs. Instead, they argue that a better way of preventing bank runs is deposit insurance backed by the government or central bank. Such insurance pays depositors all or part of their losses in the case of a bank run. If depositors know that they will get their money back even in case of a bank run, they have no reason to participate in a bank run. Thus, sufficient deposit insurance can eliminate the possibility of bank runs. In principle, maintaining a deposit insurance program is unlikely to be very costly for the government: as long as bank runs are prevented, deposit insurance will never actually need to be paid out. Bank runs became much rarer in the U.S. after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was founded in the aftermath of the bank panics of the Great Depression. On the other hand, a deposit insurance scheme is likely to lead to moral hazard: by protecting depositors against bank failure, it makes depositors less careful in choosing where to deposit their money, and thus gives banks less incentive to lend carefully.

Tom Kuntz described edupunk as \\"an approach to teaching that avoids mainstream tools like PowerPoint and Blackboard, and instead aims to bring the rebellious attitude and DIY ethos of ‚Äô70s bands like The Clash to the classroom.\\" Many instructional applications can be described as DIY education or edupunk. The term was first used on May 25, 2008, by Jim Groom in his blog, and covered less than a week later in the Chronicle of Higher Education. Stephen Downes, an online education theorist and an editor for the International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, noted that \\"the concept of edupunk has totally caught wind, spreading through the blogosphere like wildfire\\". Aspects Edupunk has risen from an objection to the efforts of government and corporate interests in reframing and bundling emerging technologies into cookie-cutter products with pre-defined application‚Äîsomewhat similar to traditional punk ideologies. The reaction to corporate influence on education is only one part of edupunk, though. Stephen Downes has identified three aspects to this approach: * Reaction against commercialization of learning * Do-it-yourself attitude * Thinking and learning for yourself Examples An example of edupunk was the University of British Columbia's course \\"wikipedia:WikiProject Murder Madness and Mayhem\\" experiment of creating articles on wikipedia in spring 2008, \\"(having) one‚Äôs students as partners and peers.\\" A video clip illustrating an edupunk approach, produced by Tony Hirst at the Open University in the UK, on 8 June 2008, illustrated how quickly the edupunk concept has been adopted outside North America. A website set up by Australian educators illustrates how edupunk spread, and a presentation by Norm Friesen of Thompson Rivers University identifies a number of possible intellectual precursors for the movement. Hampshire College, Evergreen State College, Marlboro College, New College of Florida, and Warren Wilson College are collegiate institutions imbued with edupunk ideology.

On 18 May 2000, after the appointment of Mikhail Kasyanov as Prime Minister of Russia, Shuvalov became a minister of the Russian Federation as Chief of Staff of the Government. On 28 May 2003, following a conflict with Kasyanov, he left the Government and was appointed to the position of Assistant to the President, where he coordinated the activities of the working group responsible for the development of measures to double the GDP, the fight against poverty, and military reform. In October 2003, Shuvalov was appointed Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration. In 2004, he was appointed as the President's Representative to the National Banking Council, and he became Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sovcomflot until July 2008. In 2005, Shuvalov became the personal representative of the president at the G8 and, in 2006, he was Deputy Chairman of the organizing committee for the preparation and securement of Russia's chairmanship of the G8. On 12 May 2008, he was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia. In the same year, he headed the government commission on the development of small and medium-sized businesses, the commission to coordinate government actions to combat the effects of the global financial crisis, the commission on the socio-economic development of the Far East and Transbaikal, and the organizing committee on preparation for the APEC summit. Since 19 March 2009, Shuvalov has been the national coordinator of the affairs of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In October 2009, he was discharged from the National Banking Council. In January 2010, he headed the Joint Governmental Commission on economic development and integration. WEF 2011 Since August 2010, Shuvalov has been responsible for coordinating the efforts of federal executive agencies to consider inquiries from Russian and foreign investors, and formally remains in that position, following the June 2012 appointment of Boris Titov as Commissioner for the Protection of Entrepreneurs' Rights. Following the September 2011 resignation of the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Kudrin, Shuvalov took charge of the government's economic bloc. The same year he was appointed to replace Kudrin as Head of the Council on Financial Markets and Representative of Russia on the board for the Eurasian Economic Commission. On 25 March 2011, the newspaper Vedomost reported that Shuvalov considered the possibility of heading the Right Cause political party, citing a federal official and a source within the party. In 2011, Shuvalov headed the regional electoral list of the United Russia party as a Primorsky Krai candidate for the State Duma of the VI Convocation at the 4 December elections. In January 2012, Shuvalov became the head of the government commission on transport and communication. On 21 May 2012 Shuvalov was appointed as First Deputy Prime Minister in the government formed that month. Professional activities President Medvedev, 2008. In 2009, an analyst with the electronic news site Slon.ru, Konstantin Gaaze, referred to Igor Shuvalov as \\"Putin's 'chief commander'\\" and an \\"engine in charge of 'it all'\\". The expert noted that for Putin Shuvalov was the \\"official with the driving force who could get things off the ground\\", which is why he gets assigned \\"projects that are economic in nature but with an extremely important public policy component as well as strict deadlines that cannot be breached\\". Among these projects, the author named the G8 summit the \\"ideological support for national projects\\", and described it as the \\"finishing touches\\" on the trilateral Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, which was the first step toward building an economic supranational institution in the post-Soviet space. According to Slon.ru, Dmitry Medvedev wanted to see Shuvalov as the head of his administration during his presidency. However, Shuvalov allegedly refused and joined the Putin government, thus becoming \\"a kind of a macroeconomic incarnation of the prime minister\\". Government projects Vladivostok APEC Summit 2012 In 2008, Igor Shuvalov became head of the organizing committee on preparation for the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, which was held in Vladivostok in September 2012. Preparation for the forum involved revamping of the city's infrastructure. The main construction sites were the cable-stayed bridge across the Eastern Bosphorus Strait to Russky Island, the cable-stayed bridge across the Zolotoy Rog Bay, and the new campus of the Far Eastern Federal University. The construction project for facilities for the summit was subjected to public criticism because of the high costs. Igor Shuvalov stated that none of the facilities built in Primorye were akin to a \\"Potemkin village\\". According to the First Deputy Prime Minister, facilities \\"for the show\\" and \\"Potemkin villages\\" were instances of an external facade with nothing behind, while, with the facilities built in Primorye, one could \\"come and see for yourself ‚Äì you can either work or study here\\". After completion of the summit, the director of the Center for Support for Regional Initiatives for the HSE NRU (Higher School of Economics National Research University) Ivan Ognev referred to Ivan Shuvalov as the \\"organizer of Putin's victories in Vladivostok, including the APEC summit of 2012, which drastically changed the city and the local mentality\\". In January 2013, the Accounts Chamber announced that the total investment in the construction of facilities for the APEC summit was 690 billion roubles, of which 239 billion was funded by the state, the remaining funds coming from extra-budgetary sources; 99% of the funds were disbursed as budgeted. Shuvalov supported investigations into potential corruption in preparation for the APEC 2012 summit. In November 2012, Roman Panov, the former Deputy Minister of Regional Development for the Russian Federation, was charged with large-scale fraud. At that time he held the post of Prime Minister of Primorsky Krai. On 20 November 2012, the head of the Far Eastern Directorate of the Ministry of Regional Development, Oleg Bukalov, resigned his post. Shuvalov stated that the Far Eastern Directorate of the Ministry of Regional Development was a \\"redundant link\\". He expressed the hope that the perpetrators of the embezzlement would be convicted. If someone steals during a project, \\"they should be thrown in jail,\\" according to Shuvalov. Shuvalov believes that the APEC 2012 forum should help shift Russia's foreign trade balance toward Asian countries.Russia‚Äôs trade with APEC to exceed that of Europe in 5-10 years Socio-economic development of the Far East In 2008, the Russian government established a state commission on the socio-economic development of the Far East, the Republic of Buryatia, the Transbaikal Krai, and the Irkutsk Oblast. The commission was headed by the First Deputy Prime Minister, Igor Shuvalov. In 2013, the government raised the question of whether or not the existence of the Ministry of the Russian Federation for the Development of the Far East, formed in 2012, served a useful purpose. The proposed plan for socio-economic development of the Eastern Territories prepared by the agency had not been approved by any of the key ministries, while the amount of requested appropriations was more than 5.7 trillion roubles, which was beyond the resources of the Treasury. The government returned to the idea of consolidating the faculties for the development of the Far East region within a specialized state corporation. Igor Shuvalov, who oversaw the construction of facilities for the APEC summit in Vladivostok, was among the potential candidates considered for the position of Agency Chief. On 31 August 2013, Vladimir Putin signed a decree dismissing Viktor Ishaev from his posts as Plenipotentiary Envoy of the President of the Russian Federation to the Far Eastern Federal District, and Minister for Development of the Far East. By another decree, the head of state appointed Yuri Trutnev as both Deputy Prime Minister and Plenipotentiary Envoy of the President to the Far Eastern Federal District. The media referred to Trutnev's appointment as a \\"strategic success\\" for Igor Shuvalov. In April 2013, the Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, signed a program covering up until 2025, for the socio-economic development of the Far East and the Transbaikal Krai. In the next 12 years approximately 10 trillion roubles will be invested in the program implementation from both the state budget and the funds of private investors. Financial Mega-Regulator In 2012, Igor Shuvalov proposed the idea of creating a regulator of the Russian financial markets based in the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). According to Shuvalov's plan, the strengthened Federal Financial Markets Service that is charged with the supervision, including that of insurance companies, would be merged into CBR. The concept of creating a mega-regulator proposed by Shuvalov was approved by the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, in January 2013. Universiade 2013 In 2009, Igor Shuvalov became the head of the organizing committee for the 27th World Summer Universiade. In May 2011, he reported that the construction schedule for more than 30 new sports facilities in Kazan was ahead of schedule. In May 2012, the General Director of the Kazan 2013 Executive Directorate, Vladimir Leonov, noted that over a period of three or four years, Kazan has been undergoing development that most cities take 20 years to achieve. In December 2012, Igor Shuvalov announced that all preparations for the Universiade were proceeding on schedule. In mid-December, 2012, Sergei Stepashin, Chairman of the Accounts Chamber for the Russian Federation, stated that the Universiade 2013 facilities in the Capital of Tatarstan are 90% ready for launch. On his official trip to Kazan, on 19 March 2013, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, visited the major Universiade facilities and noted the efficiency of the use of the funds for the construction of the main stadium for the games. Altogether, 64 sports facilities were ready. As part of the development of transport infrastructure of the city many commissions were granted, including: the new terminal 1A and the reconstructed terminal 1 of the Kazan International Airport along with the new Kazan-2 rail-bus interchange station, the reconstructed Kazan-1 main railway terminal, the second stage of the Kazan underground railway, the Kazan high-speed tram line, the Aeroexpress Line to the Kazan International Airport, 11 junctions, 41 pedestrian crossings, 23 highways with a total length of 65 km, and 63 city streets. The final report for the FISU was issued on 30 June. After that, the Mayor of Kazan, Ilsur Metshin, President of FISU, Claude-Louis Gallien, and Chairman of the Russian University Sports Union, Oleg Matitsyn, declared Kazan 100% ready for the Universiade. After the opening of the competition, Vladimir Putin stated that all the funds had been directed toward the development of the city, and to construction of the sports infrastructure and road junctions. \\"All of this has greatly improved the image of Kazan, which today has become a luxurious European city,\\" said the President of Russia. Upon completion of the Universiade, Igor Shuvalov was awarded an Order for Service to the Republic of Tatarstan and the badge of Honorary Citizen of the City of Kazan with the wording \\"for economic development and prosperity, enhancing the city‚Äôs reputation, and strengthening the image of the capital of Tatarstan in Russia and in the international arena\\". The sports facilities built in Kazan will remain available to the people of the city and the republic, in contrast to the infrastructure of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, where some of the facilities will be moved to other cities. FIFA World Cup 2018 Shuvalov (fourth from left) celebrates winning the World Cup bid with Andrei Arshavin (center) and others On 16 December 2009, it was announced that Igor Shuvalov was heading the organizing committee in support of the nomination of Russia as a candidate to host the FIFA World Cup in 2018/2022. Russia, England, Belgium, Holland, Spain, and Portugal presented their bids in Zurich on 2 December 2010. Igor Shuvalov was part of the Russian delegation together with the Minister of Sports, Tourism, and Youth Policy, Vitaly Mutko, and football player Andrei Arshavin. Following the presentation, the 22 members of the FIFA Executive Committee held a secret ballot in which Russia was chosen as winner. In January 2011, the honorary president of the Russian Football Union, Vyacheslav Koloskov, suggested that Igor Shuvalov should head the organizing committee for the 2018 World Cup. As part of the government formed in May 2012, Igor Shuvalov, among other things, coordinates the organization, preparation, and holding of the World Cup in 2018, including the issues of creating and developing the necessary transport infrastructure. In March 2013, it was announced that the regions had requested 540 billion roubles to prepare for World Cup 2018, but the First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Igor Shuvalov, stated that the amount was excessive. It was decided that, in order to avoid misuse of federal funds, funding would only be made available for the construction of stadia and training facilities, as well as reconstruction of city airports and roads connecting the airports to the stadia. Expenditure on city infrastructure and road transport networks was excluded from the proposed preparation program. The regions must raise the funds for those purposes themselves, because those expenditures are not part of Russia's obligations to FIFA. Controversies Accusations of a conflict of interest In December 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released information about Shuvalov's participation \\"in deals to acquire assets in the United States in the amount of $319 million, as well as providing Shuvalov with a loan for these purposes in the amount of $119 million at an astronomical rate of 40% per annum\\". In March 2012, the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal reported that the family of Igor Shuvalov acquired shares from Gazprom worth approximately $18 million via Sevenkey, a company registered in the Bahamas. Two days later, Alexei Navalny posted on his blog copies of documents that indicated that Shuvalov's company account received transfers of tens of millions of dollars from companies that, according to Navalny, were owned by billionaires Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov. The First Deputy Prime Minister reacted swiftly to the publications in the Western media by issuing the following statement: \\"Regarding declaring my income and the income of my family, I have always approached the matter in an exceptionally responsible manner. As a lawyer, I have invariably followed the rules and principles concerning conflicts of interest. The funds that I earned as a businessman, which are now in a managed trust, form the basis of my independence from various interested parties, in making my decisions as an official\\". Artem Dymskoy, a partner at the law offices of ALM Feldmans, stated that the information about the activities of Igor Shuvalov's family trust may have been disseminated by his former lawyer Pavel Ivlev, who, having sticky fingers himself, was currently wanted by Interpol on charges of embezzling 2.4 billion dollars from YUKOS. Dymskoy also confirmed that \\"Ivlev is acting to the detriment of the Shuvalov family by deliberately distorting the facts... We believe that Ivlev is deliberately manipulating the actual facts and circumstances to present a picture favorable to him, and he is doing so exclusively to advance his political goals and objectives\\". In February 2012, the media reported that Pavel Ivlev had a business relationship and financial arrangements with Alexei Navalny, since Ivlev had hired Navalny as his own lawyer in the YUKOS case. The Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation conducted an audit and found no improprieties in the Shuvalov family's sources of income. On 10 April 2013, Igor Shuvalov met with the editors of leading publications and demonstrated his assets and income declaration for 2011, mentioning the Severin Enterprises company that had been the focus of media attention. Severin Enterprises is an offshore company in the jurisdiction of the British Virgin Islands, owned 100% by Olga Shuvalov, the wife of the First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. Alexei Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of the Echo of Moscow radio station, wrote about the meeting with the media leaders, explaining that in the prior version of Igor Shuvalov's assets and income declaration for 2011, published on the internet earlier, Severin Enterprises was not mentioned because the law at the time did not require public disclosure of the assets of officials' family members. Accordingly, the presence of Olga Shuvalova on the list of Offshore Leaks published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists is considered lawful. Extravagant lifestyle The press regularly covers Shuvalov's extravagant lifestyle. The Times wrote that he \\"uses a ¬£38 million private jet to transport his wife‚Äôs corgis to dog shows across Europe\\". In February 2018, Transparency International reported that lawyer and activist Alexei Navalny has claimed that Shuvalov owns two apartments in London's Whitehall Court worth ¬£11.4 million. The Washington Times has covered the controversy surrounding Shuvalov's alleged ownership of an enormous $9.4 million apartment in Moscow. Family Igor Shuvalov is married to Olga Viktorovna Shuvalova. The income of Shuvalov's spouse over two years amounted to more than 1 billion roubles: she earned 642 million roubles in 2009 and 365 million in 2008. She is a major business figure engaged in the sale of real estate in the Skolkovo Innovation Center offshore business, and trading in shares of Russian raw materials companies. The Shuvalovs have two sons and two daughters. Their elder son, Evgeny, served in the Pacific Fleet Special Forces based on Russky Island from September 2011 through September 2012. Their elder daughter Maria is studying ballet at the Moscow State Academy of Choreography. According to the official assets and income data for 2009, Shuvalov's annual income was approximately 6.5 million roubles; his wife's approximately 642 million. The Shuvalovs' property includes several apartments and land plots with buildings, as well as seven cars. According to the Vedomost' newspaper, the Shuvalov family has a house in Austria and an apartment in the UK. In the assets and income declaration for 2011, the overseas real estate is marked by Shuvalov as \\"in use\\", as he had transferred all the family assets into a blind trust. According to the 2012 declaration filed and posted on the Government of the Russian Federation's website, Igor Shuvalov is the wealthiest member of the government. His income was 226,386,929 roubles. In the same year his spouse Olga Shuvalova earned 222,009,378 roubles.

The gunfight The Regulators, to include Billy the Kid, Charlie Bowdre, and led by Richard \\"Dick\\" Brewer, were in the process of hunting down anyone believed to have been associated with the murder of John Tunstall, which had sparked the Lincoln County War. Roberts had been implicated in crimes associated with the \\"Murphy-Dolan\\" faction, but in reality it is believed he wanted nothing to do with the ongoing range war. Blazer's Mill was located on a hillside between Lincoln, New Mexico and Tularosa, and was owned by Dr. Joseph H. Blazer, a dentist. The area included a large two story house, a large square office building, a sawmill, a grist mill, several one story adobe structures and houses, a post office, a general store, and a number of corrals and barns. Three days earlier, the Regulators had killed Sheriff Brady and Deputy Hindman, and were in Blazer's Mill to have a good meal at Mrs. Godfrey's Restaurant. (See Dead Right: the Lincoln County War. Clifford Caldwell) The Regulators known to be present that day included Brewer, Bowdre, William McCarty (aka Billy the Kid), Doc Scurlock, Frank McNab, George Coe, Frank Coe, John Middleton, Jim French, Henry Newton Brown, Fred Waite, and several lesser-known others. Buckshot Roberts wanted no part in the Lincoln County War and had made plans to leave the area, selling his ranch and waiting for the check from his buyer. On the day in question, Roberts rode his mule into Blazer‚Äôs Mills, a sawmill and trading post located on the Rio Tularosa. Looking to collect his check, he was shocked to discover that the entire upper echelon of the Regulators were eating lunch in a nearby building. They had left the area around Lincoln, New Mexico after killing Sheriff Brady just three days earlier. One of them, Frank Coe, sat with Roberts on the steps of the main house and tried to talk him into surrendering. The old gunman refused, believing he would be killed by the vengeful cowboys. (Dead Right: the Lincoln County War, Clifford R. Caldwell 2011) Regulator chief Dick Brewer grew impatient with the stand-off and sent a few of his men outside to take Roberts into custody. At the sight of the armed, quickly walking cowboys, Roberts jumped up, aiming his Winchester. Both he and Charlie Bowdre fired at the same time. Roberts was struck in the stomach while his shot hit Bowdre‚Äôs belt buckle, severing his gun belt and knocking the wind from him. Dangerously wounded, Roberts kept pumping bullets at the Regulators as he retreated to the doorway. John Middleton was seriously wounded in the chest. One slug grazed Doc Scurlock and another struck George Coe in the right hand, costing him his trigger finger. Once Roberts' rifle clicked empty, Billy the Kid dashed from cover to finish off the wounded gunman, only to be knocked senseless by the barrel of the Winchester. Barricading himself in the house, Buckshot Roberts ignored both his painful wound and the Regulators‚Äô gunshots, armed himself with a single-shot .50-70 Government Springfield rifle belonging to Blazer (one source claims it was a Sharps rifle which belonged to Dr. Appel) and readied himself for a fresh onslaught. Stunned by the turn of events, the Regulators tended to their wounded and tried to get Roberts to come out. Frustrated that none of his men dared to approach the fortified adversary, Brewer circled around the main house, and took cover behind some stacked logs and opened fire on the room where the wounded man was lying prone on a mattress in front of the barricaded doorway. Roberts, seeing the cloud of gun smoke from the log pile, opened fire when Brewer put his head up again, striking the cowboy in the eye. The Regulators, demoralized by their casualties, pulled out and left the area. Buckshot Roberts died the next day and he and Dick Brewer were buried side by side near the big house where the gunfight occurred.

It is now known as the Wayne State University Music Annex. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. History Herman Strasburg, Sr., established was one of the leading dance teachers in Detroit in the 19th century. His son, Herman Strasburg Jr., was born in Detroit in 1860.Herman Strasburg House from Detroit1701.org After graduating from high school in 1876, he joined his father's dancing school, and in 1883 became owner of the business after his father's death. In 1914, Strasburg and his wife Ida purchased this lot on Cass. The following year, they hired architect Marcus R. Burrowes to design the house on Cass Avenue. This was shortly after Burrowes left the firm of Stratton-Baldwin, a leader in bringing Arts and Crafts style to Detroit. Herman Strasburg died in 1918, leaving his dance academy and house to his son Paul. The Strasburg family occupied the home until 1925,Herman Strasburg House from Woodward Avenue although it is not clear if the house was used as a private residence or a dance studio. From 1925 to 1928, Harrison B. Anderson and Jean Campbell occupied the house, and from 1928 and 1931, Mary Fitzpatrick, who lived nearby, rented out rooms in the house to tenants. In 1931, Bendetson Netzorg purchased the house, and lived there with his parents and sister. He also used the house for his piano school, living there until 1944. In 1949, Wayne State University bought the property, using it first as the Wayne University Choral Studio and later as the Wayne State University Music Annex. Architecture The Herman Strasburg house is an asymmetrical, two-and-one-half-story house, and is one of the best examples of Tudor Revival architecture in Detroit containing Arts and Crafts elements. The first floor is clad in attractive red brickwork, while the second floor is characteristically half-timbered. The roof is cross-gabled, with projecting half-timbered gable ends and a pendant decoration at the peak. Most windows are double-hung, although there are some leaded casement windows on the first floor. The interior has been extensively renovated. However, the original oak woodwork, paneling, and cabinetry remains intact. The main staircase is ornately carved, and the living room has a plastered barrel vault ceiling.

A Wolves fan throughout his childhood, he joined as an apprentice in July 1970 and turned professional on his seventeenth birthday the following year. After remaining in the reserves over the next two seasons, he made his senior debut on in the FA Cup 3rd/4th Place Play Off against Arsenal. The right-back retained his place through the rest of the 1973‚Äì74 season at the expense of Gerry Taylor, which culminated in winning the League Cup after a 2‚Äì1 victory over Manchester City at Wembley.

He stuck with the club after relegation in 1982, winning promotion back at the first attempt. However, after another relegation, Palmer left Molineux for Burnley in November 1984. His stay at Burnley was short-lived though, as he stayed for just over a year, during which time Burnley were relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time in their history, before rejoining Wolves, under his old manager Bill McGarry, in December 1985 in a campaign that saw the club relegated to the fourth tier for the first time in their history.

Since its foundation in 1933, the club has been actively involved in the development of canoe sport, particularly in the competitive disciplines of Canoe Polo and Canoe Slalom. History Foundation Manchester Canoe Club was formed at an inaugural meeting in May 1933 following the publication of a letter by Hans Renold to the Times Newspaper to contact people interested in paddling on White Water. It became part of the British Canoe Association, making it one of the oldest canoe clubs in the United Kingdom. MCC founded the British Canoe Union in 1936, along with Clyde Canoe Club, the Royal Canoe Club, and the Canoe section of the Camping Club. In the early years, Manchester Canoe Club was primarily focused on touring and canoe camping. When canoe slalom gained popularity in 1939, MCC became a pioneering club in the sport. During the WW2 years the Club was kept \\"afloat' by Maurice Rothwell who acted as secretary and with others celebrated the end of the war by paddling on the River Spey. It was his records of Club Tours that helped to confirm access to the River Spey in a later court case. The Club took part in all aspects of White Water Paddling ‚Äì Slalom, River Racing and Touring. On one of their trips to the French Alps they came across a French Rivers Competition that was run on Several Rivers and in Age Groups. They found they had members to compete in all the groups and won many of the competitions. The trophies they received were brought home and formed the basis of a Club Competition they called the Quinzaine Series. Maurice Rothwell had become prominent in the Canoe Slalom hierarchy. As one of the few car owning people at that time he would assist the British Team when travelling abroad, and in his Official capacity officiated at the first Televised Slalom event which was in Doncaster. During the 60s and 70s the Club became very much involved in Canoe Slalom and ran many events each year for the BCU's Slalom Calendar, not just on their home water in Marple but also as far afield as Easby Abbey in Yorkshire, Langollen in Wales, (this event was known as the Serpent's Tail), and the Tryweryn also in Wales. In 1981 the Tryweryn was the site of the first World Canoe Championships held in Britain and the Club's expertise was called on to provide the Results Service for the Slalom event. Over 40 members took part in receiving, checking and recording the competitors results which were then displayed on the main and also 2 remote score boards. It was said that this was the first time at a World Slalom Event that the competitors could see their provisional results as soon as they got off the water. Members attending Nottingham University were, amongst others, instrumental in arranging for Nottingham Council Officials to attend the event which was to pave the way for the first Artificial Slalom Site at Holme Pierrepoint. In the late 60s, the club began searching for a permanent club site, and found the current site at Dale Road, Marple. Initially, MCC could only lease the site for a year at a time, so plans for a permanent club headquarters had to be abandoned; instead, a caravan was brought onto the site and used. In 1974, as a long-term lease agreement looked more possible, the caravan was replaced with a World War II nissen hut. After years of searching, MCC negotiated a 7-year lease of the club site in 1988. In 1992, MCC was able to purchase the site permanently; to do this, the club received a grant from the Foundation for Sports and Arts. Plans for a new clubhouse were started however changes to the funding system meant further plans were stalled and leadership from Dave Higson eventually got things moving again and funding from Sports England was approved in February 2002, this together with a considerable bequest from Maurice Rothwell together with the Club's own Building Fund allowed for the construction of the new clubhouse which began shortly afterwards, and finished in August 2003. Present To avoid conflict between different disciplines of canoeing, MCC has club officers who are responsible for the training, promotion, and co-ordination of each area. In spite of this, MCC host several national slalom races for divisions 3 and 4 during the Canoe Slalom season. Training courses are also held at the local Hazel Grove baths during winter. MCC takes an active role in campaigns and political debates. In January 2008, Mark Davies (club chairman) appeared on the BBC Politics North West show, campaigning for river access. The club is also partnered with local canoeing retailer, Brookbank Canoes. Canoe Polo Manchester Canoe Club has a canoe polo team, which is a separate branch of the club. The polo team competes in National League divisions, as well as organising the North West local league. MCC also compete in the National Canoe Polo championships and the annual International tournaments. River Goyt The River Goyt runs from the Errwood, Fernilee, and Etherow reservoirs, which tends to stabilise the river level. The stretch of the River Goyt at the club site is fairly placid (grade 2). but can become grade 3 and higher in heavy rain. The stretch has rapids either side, and contains a number of pools and eddies; the water is also very clean, shown by the rise in fishing. In Summer 2008, extensive work was carried out at the club site to alter the river flow, creating new river features and obstacles.MCC newsletter: September 2007MCC newsletter: May 2008 References External links *Official site *Manchester University Canoe Club *Manchester Metropolitan University Canoe Club Category:Canoe clubs in the United Kingdom Category:Sports clubs established in 1933 Category:Sports clubs in England Category:Sport in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport Category:1933 establishments in England Category:Canoeing in England ","title":"Manchester Canoe Club"},{"id":"17685264","text":"Matthew Michael \\"Matty\\" Malneck (December 9, 1903 ‚Äì February 25, 1981) was an American jazz violinist, songwriter, and arranger.

Born the youngest of seven children of Russian-Jewish immigrants who disembarked in Baltimore, and settled on 4 1/2 Street, Southwest, in Washington, D.C., Markowitz learned the trumpet at the local Police Boys' Club. He played early in his career in a number of big bands, including those of Charlie Spivak (1941‚Äì42), Jimmy Dorsey, Boyd Raeburn, and Woody Herman (1946). He played in Buddy Rich's orchestra in 1946-47, then returned to service under Herman in 1947-48. Moving his family from Washington, D.C. to New York in 1958, and eventually settling in Nyack, he worked primarily as a studio musician in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Some live appearances included work with Herman, Gene Krupa (1958), Lee Konitz (1959), Ralph Burns, George Russell, Al Cohn (1962), Paul Desmond (1969), and Bill Evans (1974). Marky was a \\"first call\\" trumpeter for many top artists of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including Paul Simon, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, the Young Rascals, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Dionne Warwick, Maynard Ferguson, George Segal, and many others, as well as hundreds of advertising \\"jingles\\", TV ads and movie scores. He was a perennial on the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon for Muscular Dystrophy, and known for a \\"sweet\\" tone on the trumpet and flugelhorn, as well as a better-than-average vocal impression of Louis \\"Satchmo\\" Armstrong, which was featured on a 1970s TV commercial for Hecker's Flour. In January 1985, just the year before his death at age 62, Marky returned to his hometown of Washington, D.C. to perform with an All-Star band, led by famed composer/arranger Nelson Riddle, at the Inaugural Ball for President Ronald Reagan's 2nd term. He led only one recording session, for Harry Lim's Famous Door label in 1976.

The term is sometimes extended to include suicide attacks such as kamikaze and suicide bombings, whose perpetrators actively commit suicide during execution of the mission. Distinctions The risks involved with suicide missions are not always apparent to those participating in them or to those who plan them. However, for an action to be considered a suicide mission someone involved must be aware of the risks; therefore, a mission that goes wrong is not a suicide mission. Rather, in some instances, an individual or group taking part in a mission may perceive the risks involved to be far greater than what they believe to be acceptable, while those planning or commanding the mission may think otherwise; these situations can lead to refusals to participate in missions on the basis that they are \\"suicide missions\\". Conversely, planners or commanders may be well aware of the risks involved with missions while those participating in them may not. Military and wartime In a military context, soldiers can be ordered to perform very dangerous tasks or can undertake them on their initiative. For example, in the First World War, French soldiers mutinied en masse in 1917, after appalling losses convinced them that their participation at the front would inevitably lead to their deaths, and in October 2004, during the Iraq War, 17 soldiers in the US Army refused orders to drive unarmored fuel trucks near Baghdad, calling the task a \\"suicide mission\\". Those soldiers faced investigations for breakdown of discipline. At the same time, many individuals or groups voluntarily undertake suicide missions in times of war. For example, both the Waffen SS and the Imperial Japanese Army were known for executing what could be labeled as suicide missions throughout the Second World War. Suicide missions can also be an act of desperation, such as a last stand. The latter end of the Battle of Stalingrad could be seen as a suicide mission from the German perspective, as they were ordered to fight to the death with no option of surrendering nor the chance of escape. Special forces Special forces units are often sent on missions that are exceedingly dangerous with the hope that their superior training and abilities will allow them to complete them successfully and survive. An example is a desperate attempt by two U.S. Delta Force snipers to protect a downed helicopter pilot (Michael Durant) from being killed or captured by masses of Somali militia during the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993. While the sniper team held off overwhelming numbers of Somalis long enough for the pilot to survive, both snipers were killed, and the pilot was eventually captured but then later released. However, even special forces groups refuse to participate in some missions. Operation Mikado, a plan for a Special Air Service raid on the R√≠o Grande, Tierra del Fuego during the 1982 Falklands War, was ultimately not executed due in part to significant hostility from members of the SAS who saw the mission as exceedingly risky. Armed hostage takings Armed hostage takings, particularly those planned (e.g., by a terrorist group) for political purposes, could be considered suicide missions. As most governments have a policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists, such incidents usually end with a bloody confrontation between the hostage-takers and an armed force (e.g., police or military) attempting to free the hostages. Also, such hostage-takings often occur in a country foreign to the perpetrators, thereby limiting their chances of escape. Notable examples include the 1972 Munich massacre, the 1977 Landshut hijacking, the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege, the 1996 Japanese embassy hostage crisis, and the 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis. All of these high-profile hostage-takings ended with the hostage- takers being engaged by the military forces of the country in which the incident occurred, with the vast majority of the hostage-takers being killed in the aftermath. The extent to which the hostage-takers in each incident expected to survive or simply desired to capitalize on their publicity to send a message is a matter of speculation.

Dedicated business class airlines Current Currently, only one all business class airline, La Compagnie, which was founded in 2013, provides an all business class service between Orly Airport in Paris and Newark Liberty International Airport. Service is currently provided using two Boeing 757-200 aircraft, to be supplemented with two Airbus A321neos from 2019. Additionally, a startup known as Odyssey Airlines is planning to launch all business class flight from London City Airport to New York using Airbus A220-100 aircraft, though the initial launch date of 2016 was not met and, as of December 2019, service was expected to start at the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021. History =2000s= In the decade of 2000s, several dedicated business class airlines, including Eos Airlines, MAXjet Airways, SilverJet and L'Avion have been launched. Early on, the idea was considered potentially lucrative, however the business model became vulnerable when in 2008 oil prices surpassed $100 a barrel. Between late 2007 and 2008, MAXjet, Silverjet and Eos Airlines all ceased operations, with Silverjet ceasing operations on 2008 and L'Avion on 2009.https://centreforaviation.com/insights/analysis/all-business-class-north- atlantic-airlines-dreamjet-seeks-to-avoid-lavions-paris-nyc-nightmare-171655 All-business class North Atlantic airlines: Dreamjet seeks to avoid L'Avion's Paris-NYC nightmare] Virgin Atlantic and British Airways both proposed founding rival all-business class subsidiaries until the oil crisis put an end to Virgin Atlantic's plans. L'Avion continued to trade, and was purchased by British Airways for its subsidiary OpenSkies at a price of ¬£54m in July 2008. OpenSkies operated an all Boeing 757 business-class service from Paris Orly Airport during October 2008 to June 2012. Since June 2012, the premium economy Eco class was reintroduced to OpenSkies. Airlines with all-business class service Current In October 2009 British Airways launched the first longhaul jet operations using a STOLport runway, named \\"Club World London City\\" (aka CWLCY) offering a business class only Airbus A318 service between New York JFK and London City Airport. The westbound service touches down in Ireland to refuel. To minimise wasted time CWLCY passengers on BA001 go through US Immigration and Customs in Shannon Airport as the aircraft refuels. The flight then lands as domestic flights into New York JFK, without the need to clear customs again. Eastbound flights are direct from New York JFK to London City Airport LCY. It uses the same flight numbers (BA001-BA004) as were previously used by Concorde. Concorde, which was a single cabin all-premium service, could have been said to be the world's first all business class service, although Concorde's on the ground and on board service was significantly better than that in both Business and First Class. Saudia launched all business class flight with Airbus A319-100 between Jeddah and Riyadh in year 2016, operate by PrivatAir. Historical Until October 2013, Singapore Airlines flights flew the longest and biggest all-business class flights on their Airbus A340-500 from Singapore to New York, also the world's longest scheduled flight and to Los Angeles. Lufthansa once offered all-business class service from year 2002 on routes from Germany to India, Middle East and North America using leased Privatair Boeing Business Jets and Airbus Corporate Jets. However, those service have been reconfigured to include economy class section on board. The Swiss International Air Lines in the Lufthansa group also offered all business class flight with Boeing Business Jet 2 between Zurich and Newark before being replaced by three-class A340 in 2012. Hong Kong Airlines formerly operated flights from Hong Kong to London with their all-premium Airbus A330-200 with business and first class sets on board. This product was discontinued in September 2012. Subsequently, these A330s were wet leased to Hainan Airlines, which operated all-business- class flights between Beijing and Shenzhen in the same configuration. Until October 2015, Scandinavian Airlines operated an all business class route between Houston and Stavanger, using a Boeing 737-700. The route was primarily aimed at people working in the oil industry. The aircraft is then used to fly between Newark and Copenhagen before being reconfigured. All Nippon Airways once operated an all-business class configuration Boeing 737-700ER from Tokyo Narita to Mumbai, from 2007 to their retirement in 2013. After the aircraft's retirement, the route have been upgauged to a Boeing 787-8 which also include economy and premium economy class seats. KLM once offered the service by using Boeing Business Jet wet leased from PrivatAir on the route of Amsterdam to Houston. In 2014, Qatar Airways launched the all-business class Qatar Airways Flights 15 and 16 travelling between Doha and London Heathrow Airport with A319LR. The flight was then upgraded to use Boeing 787 after a year's operation. The aircraft were also used on routes to Jeddah and Dubai before being reconfigured.

David M. Cheney. Retrieved 26 August 2016 Naples Brancaccio was born on 15 April 1592, the son of Baron Muzio II Brancaccio, governor of Apulia and Zenobia in the Kingdom of Naples. He was educated by the Jesuits in Naples. He was ordained there as a priest in 1619 and was rose through local ecclesiastic ranks until 1627 when he became Bishop of Capaccio which was then within the Kingdom of Naples. On 8 Sep 1627, he was consecrated bishop by Cosimo de Torres, Cardinal-Priest of San Pancrazio, with Giuseppe Acquaviva, Titular Archbishop of Thebae, and Francesco Nappi (bishop), Bishop of Polignano, serving as co-consecrators. While a bishop, he came into conflict with the local foot guards with whom he had a disagreement about local ecclesiastic jurisdiction.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) When the disagreement was elevated to armed conflict, a castrato in Brancaccio's employ killed the captain of the guard. The Vice-KingNote: usually a local count or other noble charged with the administration of the kingdom. ordered the bishop to stand trial and he obeyed; making arrangements to travel to Naples to give his account. But rather than travel to Naples he fled in a felucca towards Rome and upon arrival sought an audience with Pope Urban VIII to explain his side of the story. Urban agreed to defend the bishop and a furious Kingdom of Naples took custody of all the wealth and assets of Brancaccio's bishopric. Pope Urban absolved Brancaccio of any crime and ordered that he be returned to Capaccio but the Vice-King opposed it and urged the pope to send him elsewhere. The Pope, in need of more cardinals loyal to the Barberini cause, instead kept Brancaccio in Rome and he was elevated to the rank of cardinal in his consistory of 28 November 1633. Cardinalate Now as a cardinal, there were few who would publicly speak ill of Brancaccio, though they may have wanted to. He was restored to his bishopric where he remained until 1635 when yet another conflict with yet another Vice-King saw him resign. While in Naples he worked closely with cardinals Francesco Boncompagni and Ippolito Aldobrandini. He became Bishop of Viterbo in 1638; then he became cardinal-bishop of Sabina (1666‚Äì68), of Frascati (1668‚Äì71), and finally of Porto e Santa Rufina (1671‚Äì75). He attended the papal conclaves of 1644, 1655, 1667 and 1669, which elected popes Innocent X, Alexander VII, Clement IX and Clement X respectively. Patron of the arts Grave of Francesco Brancaccio During his time in Rome he formed the Biblioteca Brancacciana (which later moved to Naples and became that city's first public library - it is now part of the National Library of Naples) and housed the artist Salvator Rosa. In 1642 Giovanni Gentile dedicated a teaching-collection of music entitled Solfeggiamenti et ricercari a due voci (Solf√®ges and ricercari for two voices - Lodovico Grignani, Rome, 1642) to him. The frontispiece gives him as \\"CARD.

He graduated from Yale University with a bachelor of engineering degree in 1947 before joining the Chrysler Institute of Engineering; in 1949 he started work at the Plymouth Assembly Plant before spending 1950‚Äì1952 with the Navy in the Korean War. In 1954 Weertman became the first resident engineer for the Plymouth Mound Road V8 engine plant, which started producing A-engines in 1955. In December 1955, Weertman was promoted up to the Engine Design Department of Chrysler's Central Engineering department and assigned a title of Manager - Engine Design. In this capacity he worked on the Chrysler B engine and Slant Six, which would become known for its durability and at the time was considered to have high performance for its size. Valiants powered by this engine took first through seventh place in the first and only NASCAR sanctioned compact-car race. After the success of these engines, Weertman was promoted to Assistant Chief Engineer-Engine Design. He worked on the successful adaptation of the Chrysler A engine to a new lightweight casting design, which incorporated other improvements as well, and was designed the Chrysler LA engine; this series was made from 1964 through 1993, with a major redesign during those years resulting in SMPI \\"Magnum\\" engines which continued until 2002, while a racing engine based on the design is still made, as is the derivative V-10 all-alloy engine which is in every Dodge Viper to this day. An iron V-10 was available for HD pickup trucks, filling in for the B and RB engines which were discontinued after 1978. Weertman also had a major influence on the overhead valve straight-six engines made and sold in Australia known as the Hemi Six Originally destined for US light truck duty (which never happened), these engines were designed primarily for performance and light weight; a Valiant Charger equipped with the largest of the Hemi Sixes was actually faster than the same car powered by a larger V8 engine, and set a local-production acceleration record that endured until 1988. Following this, Weertman was promoted to Chief Engineer - Engine Design and Development, a position which he held until retirement. From this point he worked mainly on four cylinder engines, as well as a V6 adaptation of the successful LA design for the Dodge Dakota. Willem Weertman retired from Chrysler Corporation after forty years but remained active, producing a 400-page book covering every engine made by Chrysler from 1922 until the company was taken over in 1998, \\"Chrysler Engines 1922-1998,\\" published by the Society of Automotive Engineers.

Overview The charm consists of a partially Christianized prayer and a day-long ritual that began at night with four sods taken from the field, to the root-mats of which a poultice was applied in the form of yeast, honey, oil and milk mixed with parts of all the good herbs that grew, save buckwheat and woody plants. In Christian times the sods were taken to mass and returned to the field before nightfall, each with a small cross planted in it. This was the extent to which the ritual was Christianized. Once more in the field, the healer faced the east, where the sun would rise, turning three times clockwise and calling upon the \\"holy guardian of the heavenly kingdom\\" to \\"fill the earth\\", that the crops would grow. A plough was then anointed with a \\"hallowed\\" mix of oil, paste, frankincense, salt and fennel, of which the imported frankincense lent a Christian element; a chant was then sung, beginning Erce, erce, erce eor√æan modor, mother of earth\\".Gordon (1962:88-90). The field was then ploughed with a chant hailing \\"Erce, eorthan modor.\\" The significance of erce has been the subject of scholarly commentary and speculation. Grimm connected Old High German erchan \\"genuine, true\\".Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie (1935), trans. Stallybrass (1888), chapter 13: Goddesses \\"Can there lie disguised in erce a proper name Erce gen.

Herbert comments that while \\"√Ücerbot\\" is referred to as a charm, it is in fact a \\"full-scale ritual\\" that would take an entire day to perform, plus additional time for collecting and preparing the materials necessary.Herbert (2007:13).

During the summer, P. rudis can be found in fields and open areas. It is only when there is a sudden drop in temperature that the cluster fly shifts to the interior of structures, holes in trees, loose bark, or other crevices and cavities. History The common name \\"cluster fly\\" was derived from the clustering behavior in adults of this species in attics and lofts. The common name, \\"buckwheat fly\\", is derived from the odor of buckwheat honey the species gives off when they are crushed.Alm, Steven R. \\"Cluster Fly\\" University of Rhode Island GreenShare Factsheets 1999 Retrieved on 2009-03-17.

The Cluster Fly.‚Äù Ninth Report on the Injurious and Other Insects of the State of New York For the Year 1892, 1893. pg 309-314.

The change of genus to Pollenia (suggested by the pollen of flowers) occurred for Muscids having, among other features, the thorax covered with \\"down-like clothing\\". P. rudis has also been previously described under the name of Musca familiaris in 1869 by Dr. T.W. Harris. The cluster fly is a European species and the date of its introduction into the United States is not known. This species gained particular attention in the United States when Dr. W. H. Dall, of the Smithsonian Institution, published an article in the Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum for 1882. Dr. Dall secured specimens of P. rudis for identification. Dr. Dall also documented the species appearance in Geneva, NY thirty years prior to his publication. P. rudis may have been introduced to the United States upon slow sailing vessels in the cooler months of the year that traveled from Europe. This is possible due to the hibernation behaviors of the adult cluster flies to seek shelter for overwintering. The species also could have been transported to North America in the ballast of ships containing soil and the cluster fly host, earthworms.Jacobs, Steven B. \\"Cluster Flies\\" Penn State Entomological Notes 2003-03 http://www.ento.psu.edu/Extension/factsheets/clusterflies.htm Retrieved on 2009-03-17. Characteristics Distinctive markings  All flies can be identified from other species by certain characteristics. They can differ in thoracic coloring, basicosta coloring, and spiracle coloring. Size and shape are aids in identification. Pollenia rudis eggs are oblong-shaped. They are very small and white. The P. rudis larvae are white with posterior spiracles.Richards P. G. Morrison F. O. ‚ÄúA Summary of Published information on the cluster fly Pollenia rudis (Fabricus) (Diptera: Calliphoridae).‚Äù Phytoprotection. 53(2-3). 1972. 103-111. Pg 105. The adult Pollenia rudis looks like most of the other Pollenia species such as pallida, and dasylpoda. They are dark gray with checkered black and silvery-black abdomens. A newly emerged fly has many golden hairs on its thorax which may be lost throughout the life of the fly. The stripes on the thorax are not as prominent as on the house fly and the tips of the wings overlap when at rest. The cluster fly is slightly larger than a house fly at 9.525-12.7mm (3/8-1/2 inch) long.Cervenka, Valerie J.; Hahn, Jeffrey \\"Fall Nuisance Flies\\" University of Minnesota Extension 2008 http://www.extension.umnedu/distribution/housingandclothing/DK7579.html Retrieved on 2009-03-17. The similarities between pallida and rudis are seen in the female specimens. P. pallida has a broad, flattened facial keel. P.dasyloda has a black head with yellow tint on the frons. The basicosta can be found in many colors ranging from yellow to light brown. Some specimens have black basicosta. The posterior spiracle ranges from yellow in color to light brown. The number of bristles and setae found on this species are characteristic of this species only. There are 2-3 rows of setae located on the thoracic section and 6-8 strong frontal bristles (bristles are thick setae).Mih√°lyi F. ‚ÄúContribution to the knowledge of the Genus Pollenia R.-D.

Pg 104 Behavior  The behavior of the P. rudis fly varies with the annual seasons and conditions of the day. During the summer, on a sunny day these flies can be found without much trouble. When it is cold these flies tend to find somewhere warm and dry. They are mainly found in forest or wooded areas during the cold season. The flies tend to frequent dry areas because of their aristae antennae. The aristae are sensitive to minute temperature and pressure changes. During the winter, adult P. rudis' have a habit of overwintering. This ritual begins when the weather starts to get cold. The flies will inhabit the old tunnels created by past insects. They can also be found in old bird nests, under the bark of trees, or in homes. P. rudis will overwinter until spring, living off of its own fat. Food sources  Earthworms are a major source of food for Pollenia rudis. The main species of earthworm that these cluster flies infect are Aporrectoda caliginosa, Aporrectoda chlorotica, Eisenia lucens, Lumbricus rubellus, and Lumbricus terrestris. Immediately after the larvae hatch, they begin looking for worms. The first instar larvae eat their way through the integument section of the earthworm‚Äôs epidermis. While feeding, the P. rudis larvae leave the spiracles outside of the earthworm. Inside the earthworm, the larvae feed until they are ready to pupate.Houskova L. Rozkosny R. ‚ÄúDiptera as Bioregulators of Earthworms in Southern Moravia Czechoslovakia. Scripta Facultatis Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Purkynianae Brunensis. 19(5-6). 1989. 213-222. Pg.214. The adult P. rudis are, in most cases, herbivores. They feed on many types of organic matter. Plant sap, fruit, flowers and feces are common energy pathways for P. rudis. P. rudis is also attracted to malt extract, acetyl acetate and the proteins in animal meat. Predators Entomophthora muscae or Entomophthora schizophorae is a fungus that commonly infects adult flies. This fungus causes disease within the fly resulting in a swollen abdomen. This swollen abdomen makes the wings and legs spread apart, ultimately causing the fly to have trouble flying. After some time with this disease, a P. rudis adult will lose the ability to fly. Without flight, this fly has no way of protecting itself from predators. The main predator of P. rudis larvae is the sphecid wasps. These wasps will sting the fly and inject some poison. Once the fly has died, the wasp will feed the fly to their young. There are also other generalist predators of this fly, such as ants, birds, and certain plants.Richards P G. Morrison F O. ‚ÄúA Summary of Published information on the cluster fly Pollenia rudis (Fabricus) (Diptera: Calliphoridae).‚Äù Phytoprotection. 53(2-3). 1972. 103-111. Pg 106.  Life cycle  Europe There are very specific differences between the life cycle of Pollenia rudis in Europe and North America.Thomson AJ (1973) The biology of Pollenia rudis, the cluster fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae). I. Host location of first-instar larvae. Can Entomol 105:335‚Äì341. In Europe, it takes 10‚Äì12 months for an egg to fully develop into an adult, resulting in one generation per year. P. rudis adults of European origin copulate in the autumn , leaving their first instar larvae in a dormant state in the bodies of earthworms over the winter. The larvae will then molt twice over approximately 20 days and then pupate outside of the host. Usually, the pupal stage lasts from 32‚Äì45 days, but at high temperatures (e.g. 27¬∞C) the pupal stage can be as short as 7 days. North America In North America, P. rudis eggs generally require 27‚Äì39 days to fully develop into an adult. In Canada, 25‚Äì30 days are required when the temperature is 23¬∞C, and 11-14 of these days are spent in the pupal stage. Cluster flies in North America overwinter in their adult stage, and copulation takes place in the spring. There are three species in the rudis species complex of North America, and the life cycle of each species may differ. The variety of species in North America may account for the discrepancies between European and North American cluster flies life cycles. Female cluster flies preferentially oviposit eggs in humid areas with dense surface vegetation and high soil moisture.Thomson AJ, Davies DM (1973) The biology of Pollenia rudis, the cluster fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae). II. Larval feeding behaviour and host specificity. Can Entomol 105:985‚Äì990 Each egg is either deposited by itself or in a small cluster of about seven eggs. In total, a female cluster fly will lay an average of 100-130 eggs by ovipositing a small group, then crawling or flying some distance before ovipositing each subsequent group of eggs. Once the larvae hatch, they burrow into the soil by following natural pore spaces, such as holes near plant stems or paths that earthworms have already created. By randomly moving through these pores, P. rudis larvae find their host worms. A larva is prompted to penetrate an earthworm when it senses ‚Äúpenetration inducing factor,‚Äù a substance that is present in the slime and coelomic fluid of an earthworm. The larvae then use their mandibles to penetrate the dorsal side of a worm. It is important that they find their host quickly, because larvae must penetrate a worm within three days in order to survive. More than one larva can penetrate a single earthworm, and two or more larvae can share a penetration site. Once the host worm begins to decompose and is no longer useful to the larvae, the larvae can either leave to find another host or move to a less decomposed section further down on its host worm. If a first instar larva decides to move to another host, it must penetrate its new host quickly in order to survive. Towards the end of the first instar stage and into the second and third instar stages, the larvae are able to survive longer separations from their hosts. Usually, the first and second instars act as internal parasites while the third instar can parasitize the host and feed on the surface of the host. Currently there are no reports of P. rudis reducing earthworm populations or causing horticultural problems. = Overwintering = Adult cluster flies in North America are slow-flying insects that are active during warmer months. Once the weather becomes much cooler, P. rudis will seek shelter, usually in homes and buildings. The flies have also been documented staying in tunnels made by beetles in timber and in animal burrows. Before overwintering, cluster fly‚Äôs abdomens are full of fat globules that may be left over from its larval fat bodies. When spring begins and the flies emerge, they appear shrunken because their fat was used up during the winter. Human importance Pest status Pollenia rudis is most commonly known for being a household nuisance. The first reports of cluster flies as pests in homes occurred as early as the nineteenth century, and these flies continue to cause problems today. Cluster flies tend to enter homes and buildings in large masses in late summer or early autumn to seek shelter for the winter months.Howard, Russell \\"Insects and Arthropods\\" Diagnostic Services at Michigan State 2006 http://www.pestid.msu.edu/InsectsArthropods/ClusterFlyPolleniarudis/tabid/254/Default.aspx They possess the ability to squeeze their bodies through any exterior crevices of a home, such as cracks around windows and doors, air conditioning vents, screening vents, and loosely hung siding. Once cluster flies enter a home, they usually hibernate in inaccessible areas between walls and in ceilings until spring when they emerge and seek access to the outdoors. P. rudis is extremely troublesome to home and business owners, but does not cause any true damage to home structures, textiles, foods, or humans. Piles of dead flies left in the walls can sometimes lead to secondary infestations of carpet or larder beetles and rodents. Control methods Attempting to control the cluster fly by controlling their earthworm host is not recommended or effective since flies may originate from more than a mile away from the infestation site. Once Pollenia rudis enters a home, it is almost impossible to kill enough of the flies to fully eradicate them. In order to prevent cluster flies from entering a house, all exterior cracks and openings should be caulked or sealed. This includes (sealing) light fixtures, electrical outlets, windows, and baseboards. Persistent use of insecticides has also been shown to reduce fly numbers if sprayed on the exterior of a home. However, these methods are not guaranteed for preventing infestations. When cluster flies do invade the home, they are extremely difficult to exterminate. Trying to kill the flies with a fly swatter leads to greasy spots on walls and upholstery as well as a lingering smell of buckwheat honey. Once spring arrives the flies will try to leave on their own in order to lay eggs, but many times they enter other living areas of the home instead. Vacuum cleaners and aerosol insecticides may be used to control visible, sluggish flies, but professional extermination is the most reliable method for eliminating an infestation. Importance in forensic entomology Unlike the majority of blow flies in the family Calliphoridae, Pollenia rudis does not play a large role in the medico-criminal subfield of forensic entomology. While most blow flies are attracted to rotting or decomposing matter, P. rudis is solely parasitic on earthworms and is unable to complete larval development on carrion.Greenberg, Bernard, and Kunich, John C. Entomology and the Law. 1st ed. Cambridge UP, 2002 This unique characteristic makes it uncommon to see this particular blowfly near forensic investigations. However, the urban subfield of forensic entomology has been closely monitoring P. rudis because of its tendency to infest buildings and its status as a potential disease vector. Urban entomology, which deals with the insects that affect man and his immediate environment,Byrd, Dr. J.H. \\"What is Forensic Entomology\\" Forensics Entomology 2009 http://www.forensicentomology.com/definition.htm is responsible for investigating economic issues and civil proceedings involving arthropods. There have been several economically hampering cases of P. rudis infestation around the world. For example, in New Zealand an entire city‚Äôs water reservoir tank was drained due to high levels of fecal coliform bacteria produced by mass amounts of cluster flies residing in the tank. Due to cases like these, scientists have investigated the association of Pollenia rudis and its disease vector capability. In 1973, a massive infestation of cluster flies in a German Hospital triggered an investigation of the relationship between P. rudis and bacteria pathogen transmission.Faulde, M; Sobe, D; Burghardt, H; Wermter, R. ‚ÄúHospital infestation by the cluster fly, Pollenia rudis sensu stricto Fabricius 1794 (Diptera: Calliphoridae), and its possible role in transmission of bacterial pathogens in Germany.‚Äù International Journal of Hygiene & Environmental Health. 203(3):201-4, 2001 Mar. Careful examination of the flies revealed P. rudis is only capable of transmitting bacteria that causes opportunistic infections. These results indicate that ‚Äúmass infestations of cluster flies occurring in sensitive areas, especially in hospitals, may cause a low, but not neglectable health threat due to mechanical transmission of bacterial pathogens.‚Äù References Category:Polleniidae Category:Insects described in 1794 Category:Diptera of Europe Category:Taxa named by Johan Christian Fabricius ","title":"Pollenia rudis"},{"id":"17685852","text":"Christian Heim (born 1960) is an Australian psychiatrist,\\"Christian Heim, Associate Composer\\" , Australian Music Centre composer and public lecturer.

A former professional cyclist who specialised in time trials and hilly races, she later transferred to endurance running, duathlon and triathlon, and is currently a professional triathlete and duathlete, and the reigning quadruple world champion in long-distance duathlon. She won an Olympic silver medal in the time trial in 2008 and was world time trial champion in 2010. She has won six UCI Women's Road World Cup one-day races, as well as several stage races including the ten-day Tour de l'Aude. She is three-times a British time trial champion and in 2010 also won the British road race championships. Pooley retired from professional cycling after the 2014 Commonwealth Games to concentrate on triathlon, duathlon and long-distance running, having won the Lausanne Marathon and the Swissman triathlon the previous year. She went on to win the ITU Powerman Duathlon World Championships at Poweran Zofingen in September 2014 and again in 2015. On 16 December 2015,Pooley announces return for Rio from bbc.co.uk/sport Pooley announced that she would be returning temporarily to cycling, seeking to qualify to represent Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, as she felt the unusually mountainous time trial course on offer played to her strengths. In June 2016, Pooley came out of retirement and re-signed for her former team, , in time for the 2016 Giro Rosa.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/pooley-signs-with-lotto-soudal-ladies After racing in the Olympic time trial and road race she returned to duathlon with two further world championship titles at ITU Powerman Duathlon World Championships at Poweran Zofingen in September 2016 and 2017 as well as a European middle-distance duathlon title in 2017. Between February 2018 and March 2019 Pooley worked at Global Cycling Network as a presenter. Early life Born in Wandsworth, London, Pooley grew up in Norwich, where she attended Norwich High School for Girls and the sixth form of Norwich School. She began studying for an engineering degree at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 2001. She started cycling at university after suffering an injury from cross- country running. At Cambridge she won her university sporting blue for cross- country running and the triathlon. Cycling career 2005 to 2008 After a surprise fourth place in the national road championship in 2005, she was signed by UK national team Team Fat Birds UK and rode in the British team supporting Nicole Cooke in the road race at that year's world championships, but crashed out of the race. She rode for the same trade team in 2006 when they were based in Belgium and registered as an international-level UCI Women's Team under the name Team FBUK. She signed with the Switzerland-based Team Specialized Designs for Women for 2007, with whom she won her first UCI race, stage 3 of the Th√ºringen Rundfahrt der Frauen, after a 120 km solo escape, the first of many wins from solo breakaways. She represented Britain in the 2007 UCI Road World Championships, finishing 8th in the time trial and 9th in the road race. This earned Great Britain one of their places in the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2008, she won the Trofeo Alfredo Binda UCI Road World Cup in Italy after another solo breakaway. She finished 23rd in the Olympic road race on 11 August 2008, where she rode in support of Nicole Cooke's successful gold medal bid but her greatest success of the summer came in the time trial on 13 August, where she won the silver medal behind American Kristin Armstrong. 2009 to 2012 Pooley (with Sharon Laws behind) during the 2009 UCI Road World Championships in Mendrisio, Switzerland In 2009, Pooley signed to the Cerv√©lo Test Team, where she remained until their disbandment at the end of 2011. She won the 2009 national time trial championships and took wins for the team in the Coupe du Monde de Montreal, GP de Plouay, and Grand Prix Costa Etrusca one-day races, and the final edition of the Grande Boucle F√©minine, once dubbed \\"the women's Tour de France\\". Due to financial issues the 2009 Grand Boucle was reduced to only four stages, leading Pooley to joke that it was \\"more of a Petite Boucle than Grande\\". She also wore the leader's jersey for three stages of the Giro d'Italia Femminile, but finished the race in fourth place in the general classification after losing the race lead due to her poor descending, which she improved after the 2009 season with the help of her coach Tim Williams and British Cycling psychiatrist Steve Peters. 2010 saw several of Pooley's greatest successes. She won her first major stage race in May, the final edition of the Tour de l'Aude, the longest-running event on the UCI women's calendar. She went on to win another top-level stage race in June, the Giro del Trentino Alto Adige- S√ºdtirol. She also won two UCI Women's Road World Cup one-day races, the La Fl√®che Wallonne F√©minine and the GP de Plouay, and earned a rainbow jersey by winning the time trial at the Road World Championships. She was British national time trial champion for the second year running and also took her only national road race champion's jersey. She finished the year 5th in the 2010 UCI Women's Road World Rankings, the highest end-of-year ranking of her cycling career, and received one of the British Olympic Association's Athlete of the Year trophies, recognising her performance that year as the best by any British cyclist of either sex in any Olympic cycling discipline. 2012 Olympics time trial in London In March 2011, Pooley won the one-day Trofeo Alfredo Binda World Cup race for a second time, again after a lengthy lone breakaway. She broke her collarbone in training on 12 April so was unable to defend her Fl√®che Wallonne title and did not race again until the women's invitational time trial at the Tour of California on 20 May, in which she placed fifth. Later in the year, however, she won the hilly Tour de l'Ard√®che stage race in France and finished second to Marianne Vos in the Giro d'Italia Femminile, both achievements that she would repeat in 2012. Following the discontinuation of the Garmin Cerv√©lo women's team at the end of 2011, Pooley began riding for the Dutch team AA Drink-Leontien.nl which, in turn, wound up at the end of the 2012 season. At the 2012 Summer Olympics she competed in the Women's road race, helping teammate Lizzie Armitstead to win a silver medal, and placed sixth in the Women's time trial. 2013 to 2014 Pooley took a step back from pro-racing when she signed for the long-established, but non-UCI registered, Swiss-based Bigla Cycling Team for the 2013 season in order to concentrate on completing her PhD in geotechnical engineering. In a severely reduced season, she missed the 2013 UCI Road World Championships. Pooley managed to win four UCI-ranked races including the six-stage Tour Languedoc Rousillon in May. Pooley signed for the Lotto Belisol team for 2014.\\"Post-PhD, Pooley is back in the saddle full-time\\", Nick Bull, Cycling Weekly, Thursday 14 November 2013 She claimed her third national time trial champion's jersey and won three stages and the mountains classification at the Giro d'Italia Femminile. Pooley announced during the 2014 Commonwealth Games that she would retire from cycling after competing in the Games' road race in order to concentrate on competing in long-distance triathlons and mountain running. Following her retirement announcement, Pooley took the silver medals in both the women's road time trial and road race, and played a key role in helping England teammate Lizzie Armitstead win the road race gold medal. 2015 to 2016 Pooley made a return to competitive cycling in October 2015 when she competed at the Chrono des Nations time trial, where she finished sixth. In December 2015 she announced that she would aim to compete for Team GB in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro after being approached by British Cycling's technical director Shane Sutton, who had studied the Olympic road racing courses and felt that Pooley would have a good chance of winning a medal in the time trial and of helping Lizzie Armitstead to win the road race. She also confirmed that she would continue to compete in triathlon and duathlon competitions in 2016. Pooley made her first appearance in a mass start road race for two years in April 2016 for the British national team at the Women's Tour de Yorkshire, where she helped teammate Alice Barnes to fourth place. In June 2016 announced that Pooley had rejoined the team for the remainder of the 2016 season, and that she would be part of the team's squad for the 2016 Giro d'Italia Femminile with a role as a domestique for Claudia Lichtenberg. At the Olympics, Pooley rode in the service of Armitstead in the road race, whilst in the time trial she finished 14th, just over two minutes down on winner Kristen Armstrong. 2020 On 8 July 2020, Pooley set a new Everesting women's record by climbing the Haggenegg climb (6.8 km with an average gradient of 13%), near Schwyz in Switzerland, ten times in a time of 8 hours 53:36. Her ascent (and descent) covered 129.8 km, and beat the previous female Everesting record of 9 hours 08:31 set by Hannah Rhodes on the Kirkstone Pass in England on 8 June 2020. Running and triathlon career Pooley on her way to winning the 2017 Ventouxman triathlon Pooley won the Lausanne Marathon in October 2013 with a time of 2:44:29 hours, which placed her inside the top 20 fastest British women in 2013.Emma Pooley.

In the teaching-collection's frontispiece, Gentile is called \\"Signor Giovanni Gentile of Olevano\\", which means he was a layman not a clergyman, and that his birthplace was Olevano Romano (the existence of another Olevano, in Lomellina, may make even the second of these facts doubtful, but the fact that Gentile's artistic career only appears in Rome makes Olevano Romano more likely to be correct). As regards his teaching activity, the inclusion of solfeggiamenti a due (solf√®ges for two voices) in its title is the only clue, along with the record in the aforementioned inventory, that on the date of 13 December 1729 reports: \\"Giovanni Gentile was from 1645-49 registered as a musician at Santo Stefano del Cacco (Rome), along with 3 grandchildren and some guests, possibly his student.

Like the Lp spaces, they are Banach spaces. The spaces are named for W≈Çadys≈Çaw Orlicz, who was the first to define them in 1932. Besides the Lp spaces, a variety of function spaces arising naturally in analysis are Orlicz spaces. One such space L log+ L, which arises in the study of Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood maximal functions, consists of measurable functions f such that the integral :\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)\\\\log^+ f(x)\\\\,dx < \\\\infty. Here log+ is the positive part of the logarithm. Also included in the class of Orlicz spaces are many of the most important Sobolev spaces.  Terminology  These spaces are called Orlicz spaces by an overwhelming majority of mathematicians and by all monographies studying them, because W≈Çadys≈Çaw Orlicz was the first who introduced them, in 1932.√úber eine gewisse Klasse von R√§umen vom Typus B, Bull. Internat. Acad. Polon. Sci. Lett., Class. Sci. Math. Natur.: S\\\\'{e}r. A, Sci. Math. 1932:8/9, 207--220. A small minority of mathematicians, including Wojbor Woyczy≈Ñski, Edwin Hewitt and Vladimir Mazya ‚Äì include the name of Zygmunt Birnbaum as well, referring to his earlier joint work with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Orlicz. However in the Birnbaum‚ÄìOrlicz paper the Orlicz space is not introduced, neither explicitly nor implicitly, hence this naming convention is incorrect. By the same reasons this convention has been also openly criticized by another mathematician (and an expert in the history of Orlicz spaces), Lech Maligranda.Lech Maligranda, OsiƒÖgniƒôcia polskich matematyk√≥w w teorii interpolacji operator√≥w: 1910‚Äì1960, 2015, ‚ÄûWiadomo≈õci matematyczne‚Äù, 51 , 239-281 (in Polish). Orlicz was confirmed as the person who introduced Orlicz spaces already by Stefan Banach in his 1932 monography.Stefan Banach, 1932, Th√©orie des op√©rations lin√©aires, Warszawa (p.202) Formal definition Suppose that Œº is a œÉ-finite measure on a set X, and Œ¶ : [0, ‚àû) ‚Üí [0, ‚àû) is a Young function, i.e., a convex function such that :\\\\frac{\\\\Phi(x)} x \\\\to \\\\infty,\\\\quad\\\\text{as }x\\\\to \\\\infty, :\\\\frac{\\\\Phi(x)} x \\\\to 0,\\\\quad\\\\text{as }x\\\\to 0. Let L^\\\\dagger_\\\\Phi be the set of measurable functions f : X ‚Üí R such that the integral :\\\\int_X \\\\Phi(f)\\\\, d\\\\mu is finite, where, as usual, functions that agree almost everywhere are identified. This might not be a vector space (i.e., it might fail to be closed under scalar multiplication). The vector space of functions spanned by L^\\\\dagger_\\\\Phi is the Orlicz space, denoted L_\\\\Phi. To define a norm on L_\\\\Phi, let Œ® be the Young complement of Œ¶; that is, :\\\\Psi(x) = \\\\int_0^x (\\\\Phi')^{-1}(t)\\\\, dt. Note that Young's inequality for products holds: :ab\\\\le \\\\Phi(a) + \\\\Psi(b). The norm is then given by :\\\\f\\\\_\\\\Phi = \\\\sup\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\fg\\\\_1\\\\mid \\\\int \\\\Psi\\\\circ g\\\\, d\\\\mu \\\\le 1\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Furthermore, the space L_\\\\Phi is precisely the space of measurable functions for which this norm is finite. An equivalent norm , called the Luxemburg norm, is defined on LŒ¶ by :\\\\f\\\\'_\\\\Phi = \\\\inf\\\\left\\\\\\\\{k\\\\in (0,\\\\infty)\\\\mid\\\\int_X \\\\Phi(f/k)\\\\,d\\\\mu\\\\le 1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, and likewise LŒ¶(Œº) is the space of all measurable functions for which this norm is finite. Example Here is an example where L^\\\\dagger_\\\\Phi is not a vector space and is strictly smaller than L_\\\\Phi. Suppose that X is the open unit interval (0,1), Œ¶(x) = exp(x) ‚Äì 1 ‚Äì x, and f(x) = log(x). Then af is in the space L_\\\\Phi but is only in the set L^\\\\dagger_\\\\Phi if a < 1\\\\. Properties * Orlicz spaces generalize Lp spaces (for 1) in the sense that if \\\\varphi (t) = t^p, then \\\\ u \\\\_{L^\\\\varphi (X)} = \\\\ u \\\\_{L^p (X)}, so L^\\\\varphi (X) = L^p (X). * The Orlicz space L^\\\\varphi (X) is a Banach space -- a complete normed vector space. Relations to Sobolev spaces Certain Sobolev spaces are embedded in Orlicz spaces: for X \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} open and bounded with Lipschitz boundary \\\\partial X, :W_0^{1, p} (X) \\\\subseteq L^\\\\varphi (X) for :\\\\varphi (t) := \\\\exp \\\\left(  t ^{p / (p - 1)} \\\\right) - 1. This is the analytical content of the Trudinger inequality: For X \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} open and bounded with Lipschitz boundary \\\\partial X, consider the space W_0^{k, p} (X), k p = n. There exist constants C_1, C_2 > 0 such that : \\\\int_X \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\left( \\\\frac{ u(x) }{C_1 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{D}^k u \\\\_{L^p (X)}} \\\\right)^{p / (p - 1)} \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x \\\\leq C_2  X . Orlicz norm of a random variable Similarly, the Orlicz norm of a random variable characterizes it as follows: :\\\\X\\\\_\\\\Psi \\\\triangleq \\\\inf\\\\left\\\\\\\\{k\\\\in (0,\\\\infty)\\\\mid \\\\operatorname{E}[ \\\\Psi(X/k)] \\\\le 1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. This norm is homogeneous and is defined only when this set is non-empty. When \\\\Psi(x) = x^p, this coincides with the p-th moment of the random variable. Other special cases in the exponential family are taken with respect to the functions \\\\Psi_q(x) = \\\\exp(x^q)-1 (for q \\\\geq 1 ). A random variable with finite \\\\Psi_2 norm is said to be \\"sub-Gaussian\\" and a random variable with finite \\\\Psi_1 norm is said to be \\"sub-exponential\\". Indeed, the boundedness of the \\\\Psi_p norm characterizes the limiting behavior of the probability density function: :\\\\X\\\\_{\\\\Psi_p} = c \\\\rightarrow \\\\lim_{x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} f_X(x) \\\\exp(x/c^p) = 0, so that the tail of this probability density function asymptotically resembles, and is bounded above by \\\\exp(-x/c^p). The \\\\Psi_1 norm may be easily computed from a strictly monotonic moment-generating function. For example, the moment-generating function of a chi-squared random variable X with K degrees of freedom is M_X(t) = (1-2t)^{-K/2}, so that the reciprocal of the \\\\Psi_1 norm is related to the functional inverse of the moment-generating function: :\\\\X\\\\_{\\\\Psi_1} ^{-1} = M_X^{-1}(2) = (1-4^{-1/K})/2.

Family and early life Burghardt was born and raised in the small town of Greenfield, Illinois, where his father and grandfather were barbers. He traced his family eight generations to an ancestor who fought in the American Revolution and was related to William Edward Burghardt \\"W. E. B.\\" Du Bois. College Burghardt competed in football and track and field at Eureka College, where he was co-captain of the football team his senior year. At Eureka, he was on the football team with future president Ronald Reagan, who was two years ahead of him. In 1931, while playing a road trip against another small college in Illinois, a hotel refused to allow Burqhardt and the team's other black player to stay. The coach was angry and decided that the whole team would sleep on the bus. Reagan, Burqhardt later recalled, worried that this would cause the team's performance to suffer and thus humiliate the black players and harm their morale, and suggested instead that the coach tell the team that the hotel did not have enough rooms. Reagan paid for a taxi for Burqhardt and their teammate to Dixon, Illinois, to stay with his parents, Jack and Nelle Reagan, who warmly welcomed them. In Reagan's 1986 autobiography, Where's the Rest of Me?, he told a story about a racist player on an opposing team who was \\"filled with hatred and prejudice\\" and \\"played dirty\\" while targeting Burghardt. Though Burghardt was injured, he refused to play dirty and astounded the other team with his strength and skill. At the end of the game, the defeated player turned around to shake Burghardt's hand, telling him he was the greatest human being he had ever met. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1986, President Reagan shared the same story at a school in Washington, D.C. Reagan and Burqhardt remained friends, many decades later.https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/08/ronald-reagan-and-race-richard- nixon-tape/ Coaching and later life Burqhardt served as the seventh head football coach at the North Carolina College for Negroes ‚Äî now known as North Carolina Central University ‚Äî in Durham, North Carolina and he held that position for five seasons, from 1937 until 1941, compiling a record of 22‚Äì17‚Äì4.North Carolina Central University coaching records Burghardt was also the head basketball coach at North Carolina Central from to 1937 to 1940, tallying a mark of 47‚Äì21.

It lies between the Northern and Southern Patagonian Ice Field in the Capit√°n Prat Province in the Ays√©n Region. The commune is administered by the municipality in Caleta Tortel, the principal settlement. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the Chilean National Statistics Institute, Tortel spans an area of and has 507 inhabitants (322 men and 185 women), making the commune an entirely rural area. The population grew by 13% (59 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Tortel is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008‚Äì2012 alcalde is Bernardo L√≥pez Sierra (PPD). Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Tortel is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Iv√°n Fuentes Castillo (Nueva Mayor√≠a) and David Sandoval (UDI) as part of the 59th electoral district, which includes the entire Ais√©n Region. The commune is represented in the Senate by Antonio Horvath Kiss (RN) and Patricio Walker Prieto (PDC) as part of the 18th senatorial constituency (Ais√©n Region). Landmarks and main features Tortel commune is one of the most remote in southern Chile and its unspoiled landscape is one of its principal attractions. Features include: * Caleta Tortel is a lumber town with an intricate walkway system built by the town‚Äôs inhabitants which run several kilometres around the cove (‚Äúcaleta‚Äù). Without these walkways, the only way to communicate and travel between houses would be by boat, given the density of the vegetation and the steepness of the hills around the cove.Tortel walkways Atlas vivo de chile, retrieved December 09, 2013 The walkway system has become part of the town‚Äôs culture and a local tourist attraction. * Laguna San Rafael National Park is a park located on the Pacific coast of southern Chile. The park is named for the San Rafael Lagoon formed by the retreat of the San Rafael Glacier. Created in 1959, it covers an area of and includes the Northern Patagonian Ice Field. A fjord of more than in length is one of the park's principal attractions. * The Southern Patagonian Ice Field (), located in the Southern Patagonian Andes between Argentina and Chile, is the world's second largest contiguous extrapolar ice field.At about 16,800 square kilometers, it is second only to southeastern Alaska's approximately 25,000 square kilometer Kluane / Wrangell‚ÄìSt. Elias / Glacier Bay / Tatshenshini-Alsek Ice Field. It is the bigger of two remnant parts of the Patagonian Ice Sheet, which covered all of southern Chile during the last glacial period, locally called the Llanquihue glaciation. * Katalalixar National Reserve is a natural reserve located in an archipelago between the Southern Patagonian Ice Field and the Northern Patagonian Ice Field in the Ays√©n Region of Chile. The reserve was created in 1983 and has no infrastructure. It covers an area of within the Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregion and exhibits more biodiversity than other areas of southern Chile. This may appear contradictory, as the area is supposed to have been covered by the Patagonian Ice Sheet during the last glacial maximum. * Bernardo O'Higgins National Park () is the largest of the protected areas in Chile, covering an area of in both the Ays√©n and Magallanes and Ant√°rtica Chilena regions. Management of this and other national parks in Chile is entrusted to the Corporaci√≥n Nacional Forestal (CONAF).

The Stenborg Company was a Swedish Theatre Company, active in Sweden and Finland in the 18th century. It was also called Stenborgska sk√•debanorna ('Stenborg Stages'), Svenska komeditruppen ('Swedish Comedy Troupe') and Svenska Comedien ('Swedish Comedy') or Svenska Teatern ('Swedish Theatre'). It is one of the most famous theatre troupes in its country's history. In the period of 1754‚Äì73, between the closure of the first national Swedish theatre in Bollhuset and the foundation of the next, The Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theatre, it was the only Theatre performing in the native language in Stockholm. It also has an importance for the history of Finland, being the first professional secular theatre troupe in this country. It was a traveling troupe in 1756‚Äì80 and then housed in several buildings.  History  When the Swedish troupe, active on the theater since 1737, was fired in 1753 and replaced with the French Du Londel Troupe, half of the staff left for the countryside to work as a traveling theater company under Peter Lindahl and Johan Bergholtz, while the rest remained in Stockholm in an attempt to start a new theatre. In 1756, The actor Petter Stenborg applied and was given permission to lead a theater company in the city of Stockholm, and between 1758 and for twenty years forward, he performed as the director of a troupe of native actors in both Stockholm, in temporary locales, and touring the country, mostly in Finland, first in companionship with the tight-rope-walker von Carl Fredrik von Eckenberg; when the troupe visited √Öbo in 1761, it was probably the first time a theatre troupe visited Finland.  The first period  The Stenborg troupe is most known for its activity in Stockholm, where it preserved a Swedish- speaking theater during a period when the French culture otherwise dominated the Swedish stage. The theatre did not have a good reputation among the upper- classes; the actors were from \\"the jail, soldiers, alcoholized lawyers, servants, and washing-women\\", the costumes were from rag shops and the music from public-houses, (where they often performed), and the plays was described as vulgar; these judgements were given by members of the upper classes, who preferred French theater, but the Stenborg Company was much appreciated by the public, who could not understand the French language at Bollhuset. They represented a native speaking theater in the 1750s and 1760s. During the period of 1754‚Äì71, Swedish plays were only performed in the city stage of Bollhuset two times; Syrinx (1761) and Herkules p√• skiljov√§gen (1762) to the benefict of musician Petter Lillstr√∂m, husband of Elisabeth Lillstr√∂m actress in the Stenborg Troupe. At the performance of Jeppe p√• Berget by Holberg in 1763, the theatre on Kindstugatan, it was noted that the locale had places for three hundred spectators. Among the actors were former tailor Jean L√∂fblad, the Harlekin of the troupe, the Harlekin of the company, Fredric Neuman, Johanna L√∂fblad, earlier active both at Bollhuset and the Lindahl troupe and active at the Stenborg troupe until the 1790s and thereby one of the longest active actors in Sweden in the 18th century, and the prima donna Christina Catharina Lindberg, also earlier active in Bollhuset. The performances were often Harlequin-comedys, in which the star was Jean L√∂fblad, but also the old Swedish plays from Bollhuset and foreign plays, often from France. The most popular play was The defended Venus, which was first performed in Bollhuset, and it was said, that whenever the theatre needed money and had to be sure to have a large audience, the gave this play. In 1770, the Houseghost and then The enchanted bridegroom by Holberg was performed, which was aroused attention as the first play was performed only by men, the latter only by women. In 1771, king Gustav III of Sweden fired the French theater company, and the Swedish actors, led by Petter Stenborg, saw their chance and asked to perform a play at the opening of the parliament of 1772. In the play, Stenborg asked the monarch to protect the native speaking theatre. At the opening of parliament in 1772, the troupe of Petter Stenborg appeared before King Gustav III and all the public in Bollhuset after the French troupe had left it, in which play the son of Stenborg, Carl, again asked for protection for the native theatre. The play was considered very bad by the nobility, but the public applauded it immensely, which was seen as a public appeal to open a theatre in the native language again. After this, the monarch decided to found a native speaking opera and theatre, though not with the Stenborg troupe.  The second period  In 1773, the troupe, whose biggest problem was the difficulty of getting venues, and had to move from one place to the next over the years. Finally, they found a good place to perform; the so-called Humleg√•rdsteatern, \\"The Humleg√•rden Theatre\\", where they performed every summer until 1780. This was described as a sort of pavilion, Rotundan, in the public park Humleg√•rden. Here, they played simple comedies in the native language, sometimes caricatures of the solemn performances in Bollhuset. Humleg√•rdsteatern became a very popular part of the city's summer life; the opera-performances Thetis och Phel√©e became Petis och Nasenblom, Acis och Galathea became Kasper och Dorotea.  The last period  In 1780, Petter Stenborg retired, and his company was taken over by his son Carl Stenborg; he was a singer at the Opera and could not tour outside the city, and therefore searched for a real house for the troupe, where they could perform all year. He found one at Eriksberg, thereby called the Eriksbergsteatern (Eriksberg Theater), but it was uncomfortably outside town. In 1784, he found the final location for the company at Munkbron, called the Munkbro Theater but commonly referred to as Stenborg Theater, who were the second most important theater in Stockholm until the monopoly of the Royal Dramatic Theater closed it down in 1799. In 1804‚Äì09, Carl Stenborg toured in the countryside with his own troupe, which could be considered as the very least period of the Stenborg troupe. Localities for the Stenborg Theater in Stockholm Until 1780, the troupe toured the country in both Sweden and Finland when it was not performing in Stockholm. When it performed in Stockholm, it used various localities until 1773. * 1760 The Theater in the Bergstrahl house. * 1762 The Theater in the loft on Kindstugatan. * 1768 The Theater at the camp of the royal guard. * 1769 The Theater in Dowager Lafont's Coffee-house at J√§rntorget. * 1773 The Pavilion Rotundan in the park of Humleg√•rden, \\"Humleg√•rdsteatern\\". * 1780 The Eriksberg Theater, (\\"Eriksbergsteatern\\"). * 1784 The Munkbro theater.

Chief Kineubenae (also recorded as Golden Eagle, Quinipeno, Quenebenaw, etc.) (fl. 1797‚Äì1812), was a principal chief of the Mississauga Ojibwa, located on the north shore of Lake Ontario. His name Giniw-bine in the Anishinaabe language means \\"golden eagle[-like partridge]\\". He was a member of the Nigig-doodem (Otter Clan). Biography Born in the mid-18th century, Kineubenae grew up in the last decades of Ojibwa domination of present-day southern Ontario. Two generations earlier his ancestors had swept southward from the Mississagi River of the Georgian Bay and by 1700 had expelled the Iroquois. For the next 75 years Mississaugas alone would occupy the north shore of Lake Ontario. But all changed with the outbreak of the American revolution. Kineubenae soon witnessed the arrival in his homeland of thousands of white and Iroquois refugees. Suddenly the Mississaugas were obliged to cede their territory at the western end of the lake in order to provide land for the newcomers. Retaining for themselves the \\"Mississauga Tract,\\" an area lying between Burlington Bay (Hamilton Harbour) and the Credit River, they agreed in 1784 to the surrenders on the understanding, in Kineubenae‚Äôs later words, that \\"the Farmers would help us,\\" and that the Indians could \\"encamp and fish where we pleased.\\" In fact ‚Äì as the chief himself complained in 1805 ‚Äì the promises were not kept. Instead of assisting the Indians, the farmers \\"when we encamp on the Land . . . drove us off and shoot our dogs and never give us any assistance as was promised to our old Chiefs.\\" Meanwhile, the Mississaugas were fast disappearing. Close contact with Europeans had brought to the villages diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis, against which they had no natural immunity. Over the period from 1787 to 1798 the Mississaugas at the western end of Lake Ontario declined from more than 500 to approximately 350. As the principal chief of the Mississaugas on Twelve Mile (Bronte) Creek, Kineubenae frequently spoke for the Mississaugas in the early 19th century. In 1805, for example, he negotiated with the British over the proposed sale of the \\"Mississauga Tract.\\" The surviving minutes of the conference reveal that Kineubenae was a shrewd bargainer. On the first day he firmly opposed the surrender of more land, for, as he told William Claus, deputy superintendent general of Indian affairs in Upper Canada, \\"the young Men & Women have found fault with so much having been sold before: it is true we are poor, & the Women say we will be worse, if we part with any more.\\" Only after the British applied pressure on the second day did he comply. Then, in return for ceding the entire lakefront of the tract (the Indians retained the interior section until 1818), Kineubenae extracted a promise from the British that the Mississaugas would keep the river mouths and their rights to the fisheries there. Within a year, however, Kineubenae was protesting against the settlers‚Äô encroachments on the fisheries. In 1806 he complained about the white man who had taken over his cornfield at Bronte Creek and then destroyed it, as well as that of a poor Indian widow who had four children to support. The same white settler, Kineubenae reported, was building a weir to catch salmon on their way upstream to spawn. In addition, a white squatter at the Credit River had so disturbed the waters \\"by washing with sope and other dirt, that the fish refuse coming into the River as usual, by which our families are in great distress for want of food.\\" Death By 1812 Kineubenae was becoming extremely weak and on his own admission \\"getting too old to walk.\\" For nearly two decades he had led his people and during this time most of their lands had been taken, the fish and game populations had declined drastically, and their own numbers had been severely reduced. Then the war between the British and the Americans had extended to the north shore of Lake Ontario. It was at this point that Kineubenae, in order to inspire his band with an example of the strength of their traditions, fasted and obtained \\"warrior‚Äôs medicine.\\" A group of Mississaugas gathered by a river mouth at the western end of Lake Ontario. As the warriors squatted around him the old chief, Kineubenae, slowly began to tell of the fast in which, through the grace of unseen spirit powers, he had obtained protection against arrows, tomahawks, and even bullets. And he would demonstrate this gift. He took a tin kettle and, with some difficulty on account of his age, walked a short distance away from the circle. As soon as he raised the kettle up before his face a warrior was to fire, and Kineubenae would collect the bullet in the kettle. The marksman, like the others, believed in Kineubenae‚Äôs \\"medicine\\" and he fired. The chief instantly fell. The band, to their horror, found that \\"the lead went into his head and [had] killed him on the spot.\\" That one bullet did more than kill a respected leader; it shook the faith of many Mississaugas in their traditional way of life. Kineubenae's death, decades later, would facilitate the work of Peter Jones in converting the demoralized Mississaugas to Christianity.

It was initiated in 2002 and offers masters programs, academic certificate programs and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) on sustainable development, social justice, international labour standards and trade/labour unions, economic policies and global institutions. Universities and workers‚Äô organisations from around the world have jointly developed these unique global programmes. The programmes aim at allowing labour organisations and social movements to engage more effectively in social dialogue, public debate and policy implementation. Project concept The GLU is a network of trade unionists, researchers and ILO (International Labour Organisation) experts who have combined their experience and knowledge to further academic expertise relative to the global labour market. This network develops and delivers high- level academic programmes, usually one year masters courses. It is a new approach to strengthening the intellectual and strategic capacity of workers‚Äô organisations and to establish much stronger working relationships between trade/labour unions, the ILO, and the scientific community. The GLU contributes to strengthening union capacity and competence to defend workers' interests, to promote the \\"Decent Work\\" agenda and to enable workers‚Äô organisations to engage more effectively in social dialogue on social and economic policy issues such as employment, social protection and the implementation of international labour standards. The programs support unions in upgrading their intellectual profile by building a channel for the development of qualified trade union leaders, as well as supporting the recruitment of younger experts. The courses in all countries are conducted in English. As part of their course, students analyse and discuss, in a multidisciplinary fashion, the challenges of globalisation from a labour and trade/labour union perspective. The programmes offer a multicultural and multiregional environment: students and lecturers come from developing, transition and industrialised countries. Participants may also study one term of the programme in South Africa or Brazil and one term in Germany. The curriculum of a pilot masters course was first developed in 2003/04, the first course starting in Germany in 2004/05, followed by courses in Africa (South Africa 2007) and Latin America (Brazil 2008), then in mid-2008, in Mumbai, India. Recently, the Penn State University, USA and the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi joined the network. Discussions have been held with a number of other universities in other countries. Whenever possible, students from all regions will be represented in the courses. Governance structure The governance structure of the Global Labour University network is based on the partnership between the ILO, the national and international trade union movement, the partner universities and the funding bodies. A steering committee is heading the overall direction. The Global Labour University is supported by the International Labour Organisation. A limited number of scholarships are available, usually for students from developing countries. The endorsement by a trade union is a requirement for a scholarship. The scholarship is conditional on a contribution of 1500 euros from the student, her/his supporting trade union or another donor.

The writer of the 1794 Survey of Somerset, Billingsley was a leading agriculturalist who was one of the founders of the Bath and West Society, known today as the Royal Bath and West of England Society. He lived all his life at Ashwick Grove.  Family life  He was born in 1747, the grandson of Nicholas Billingsley, a Presbyterian dissenter who was minister at Ashwick from 1699 to 1729. Little is known about his early life but by 1782, he was listed as Brewer along with Ryan Gosling of the Oakhill Brewery in the neighbouring village of Oakhill, and may have been involved in the wool trade before that. He was described as a leading member of the Presbyterian church although at some stage he was reconciled with the Church of England.  General View of the Agriculture of the County of Somerset  Cover of the book: General view of the agriculture in the county of Somerset with observations on the means of its improvement by John Billingsley ... Drawn up for the consideration of the Board of Agriculture and Internal Improvement. Published 1794. Printed by W. Smith in London. The 18th century was largely one of peace in Somerset, but the Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelled the end for most of Somerset's cottage industries. Farming continued to flourish however, with Billingsley farming about , and the Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures and Commerce was founded in 1777 to improve farming methods. Despite this, 20 years later John Billingsley conducted a survey, for the Board of Agriculture, of the county's agriculture in 1795 and found that agricultural methods could still be improved. He provided estimates, based on his local knowledge, of the land use of the one million acres (4,000 km2) in the county. He suggested that 584,500 were enclosed meadow and pasture land, 260,000 were enclosed arable and convertible land with smaller areas for other purposes. were considered uncultivated wastes. It advocated ways of modernising farming practices, particularly through mechanisation, which including instructions for hedge building and crop rotation (also how to treat sick animals with hay tea and improve cucumber production with horse dung!). It also includes a chapter on political economy related to the narrow margin of British food supplies, in view of the outbreak of war with France in 1793, and mentions developments on the Somerset coalfield. His General View of the Agriculture of the County of Somerset divided the county into three districts- north-east, middle and south-west. It included proposals for the enclosure of Exmoor and the building of a village at Simonsbath. For the middle section the plans he advocated improved drainage, including the straightening of sections of the rivers Brue, Axe and Parrett, were more successful and lead to some significant reclamation of the Somerset Levels. He also deplored the failure of many farmers to manure the land, exhausting it by constant cropping and overstocking. In 1798 he wrote about the water-meadows of the Brendon and Quantock Hills describing them as the best in the country.  Other activities  Billingsley was also actively involved in turnpike trusts, and canal building, including the Kennet and Avon Canal, Somerset Coal Canal and the Dorset and Somerset Canal. One eulogy by Sir Benjamin Hobhouse, President of the Bath and West Society, exaggerates considerably, referring to him as having \\"drained Sedgemoor and enclosed Mendip\\"! Because of the moribund state of the lead mines in the Mendip Hills, he proposed to drive a level from Compton Martin to Wookey Hole at a depth of below the surface to remove the water which was flooding the mines ‚Äì nothing came of this plan. He was also responsible for the introduction and adoption of the double-furrow plough. Atthill considers that his greatest achievement was the enclosure of the Mendip Hills. The first Mendip commons to be enclosed were those in the parishes of East and West Cranmore, which had been completed by 1769. By 1794, Billingsley estimated that had been enclosed by Dry stone walls, leaving 11,550 unenclosed.  Memorials  At the west end of the aisles in the Church of St James, Ashwick two memorial tablets can be seen. These are dedicated to John Billingsley, his wife Mary, and their family.

The game is played similar to Spades and Hearts. A standard deck of playing cards is dealt out (excluding jokers) evenly among the players. The objective is to get ten points (called plucks) before the other team. Methodology Dealing Thirteen cards are dealt singly in turn to each of the four players. *The player who is dealt the two of clubs on the first deal gets to call the first \\"trump suit\\". The Play The player that calls the initial trump suit plays a card and all other players must play a card of that suit if they have it. Highest card wins. If the player doesn't have a card of that suit but has a card of the trump suit, he/she may play that card and win unless another player plays a higher card of that suit. The trump suit cannot be played until a player is out of a suit and cuts the hand. If a card of neither suit is played, the player loses that hand. After the first hand, the call of the trump suit passes to the left. Scoring To score, each team must win a certain number of times (each win is called a book). The team with the call must get eight books before earning plucks (points) and the team without it must get five. After all thirteen books have been played, that's the end of the first round and the cards are re-dealt. The first team that reaches ten points wins. Plucking The team with the most plucks after each round then gets to pluck the other team. This means that for every point earned, someone from that team may give a card to someone of the other team. That person must then give the person who is plucking the highest card of that particular suit (even if it means returning the card given). Shooting the Moon Shooting the Moon is when a team wins all thirteen books in one round. Some also refer to this as \\"Going to Boston\\" or simply \\"Boston\\". Strategy One of the most primary strategies is plucking. One must know whom to pluck and in what suit to pluck. Also, it is wise to choose a cut suit that at least one person in the team is strong in. It also takes skill to know when to cut over ones partner (this may be done to avoid the other team from cutting over the top card). For example, if the Queen of a suit has been played by your side and you suspect that the player after has the King, you play the Ace. Pluck for three Pluck is a three-person trick-based card game. It's different from most of these games in at least one way: it's explicitly designed for three players. On a complexity level, it's probably a little less challenging than spades: the trump is declared by the dealer, but the number of tricks each player must take is fixed. First player to get 10 plucks wins the game. The Deck It uses the standard 52-card (poker) deck, with some modifications: remove all twos (\\"deuces\\") except the two of clubs; add both of the jokers into the deck, and make sure that the two jokers have different faces. One of these will be the \\"big joker\\" and the other will be the \\"little joker\\"; these are the highest-ranked trump cards in any turn. This should leave you with a deck of 51 cards (52 - 3 deuces + 2 jokers). Since there are three cards played every trick, this gives us 17 tricks per hand. Aces are high. The Goal The point of each round is to win at least as many tricks as your position (relative to the dealer) dictates. Of the 17 total tricks per round, you need to take: * Dealer: 7 tricks * Left of dealer: 6 tricks (deals next round) * Right of dealer: 4 tricks (dealt last round) Falling short of this goal in one round means you will get plucked at the beginning of the next round. If you fell short, someone else must have an excess‚Äîand that person is the one who gets to pluck from you! The Order of Play =Shuffle and Deal= Each round starts by having the dealer shuffle (optionally letting one of the other players cut), and dealing out all 51 cards. =Plucks= There are no plucks in the first round. The person who has the most plucks (that is, the player that went over their quota by the most tricks in the previous hand) goes first. If two players are entitled to the same number of plucks, start with the dealer and go left. To pluck, the plucker passes a card face-down to the . After looking at this card, the must pass back the highest-ranked card in the same suit. The jokers are not in any suit, and are always valuable‚Äîso, a plucker would not want to pass one, and a cannot be forced to give them up. =Dealer declares trump= After plucking (or getting plucked), the dealer has to declare trump. Since they have to take the most tricks, they get this serious advantage. They can pick any suit; as with any trick-based game, this is a tradeoff between quantity and quality. Finally, the dealer should remember that there are two jokers in the game, and they are higher than any card in the actual trump suit. =Play opens with the Deuce of Clubs= Whoever is holding the deuce (two) of clubs puts it down as the first lead card. This has two side effects: one, it's a guaranteed loss; and, if clubs were chosen to be trump, then trumps are open from the very start. =Play 17 tricks= This portion of the game should be very similar to any other trick game. Whoever took the last trick has to lead for the next trick. You have to play in suit if you can; if you have a void in that suit, you can either slough or trump. You can't lead trumps until they have been opened (but see the comment above regarding clubs as trumps.) For the purposes of determining which cards are in what suit, the jokers are considered to be the same suit as trump. A trick is taken by the highest- ranked lead-suit or trump card on the pile. =Determining Plucks= Players receive (or get taken from them) as many plucks as they won tricks over (or below) their targets. Unless player receives 0 books. =Deal passes to the left= After a hand is scored, deal passes to the left of the current dealer. .

Cessation of due payments (or receivables) may either be accompanied by that government's formal declaration that it will not pay (or only partially pay) its debts (repudiation), or it may be unannounced. A credit rating agency will take into account in its gradings capital, interest, extraneous and procedural defaults, and failures to abide by the terms of bonds or other debt instruments. Countries have at times escaped some of the real burden of their debt through inflation. This is not \\"default\\" in the usual sense because the debt is honored, albeit with currency of lesser real value. Sometimes governments devalue their currency. This can be done by printing more money to apply toward their own debts, or by ending or altering the convertibility of their currencies into precious metals or foreign currency at fixed rates. Harder to quantify than an interest or capital default, this often is defined as an extraneous or procedural default (breach) of terms of the contracts or other instruments. If potential lenders or bond purchasers begin to suspect that a government may fail to pay back its debt, they may demand a high interest rate in compensation for the risk of default. A dramatic rise in the interest rate faced by a government due to fear that it will fail to honor its debt is sometimes called a sovereign debt crisis. Governments may be especially vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis when they rely on financing through short-term bonds, since this creates a maturity mismatch between their short-term bond financing and the long-term asset value of their tax base. They may also be vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis due to currency mismatch: if few bonds in their own currency are accepted abroad, and so the country issues mainly foreign currency-denominated bonds, a decrease in the value of their own currency can make it prohibitively expensive to pay back those bonds (see original sin). Since a sovereign government, by definition, controls its own affairs, it cannot be obliged to pay back its debt. Nonetheless, governments may face severe pressure from lending countries. In a few extreme cases, a major creditor nation, before the establishment of the UN Charter Article 2 (4) prohibiting use of force by states, made threats of war or waged war against a debtor nation for failing to pay back debt to seize assets to enforce its creditor's rights. For example, in 1882, the United Kingdom invaded Egypt. Other examples are the United States' \\"gunboat diplomacy\\" in Venezuela in the mid-1890s and the United States occupation of Haiti beginning in 1915. Today a government that defaults may be widely excluded from further credit; some of its overseas assets may be seized; and it may face political pressure from its own domestic bondholders to pay back its debt. Therefore, governments rarely default on the entire value of their debt. Instead, they often enter into negotiations with their bondholders to agree on a delay (debt restructuring) or partial reduction of their debt (a 'haircut or write-off'). Some economists have argued that, in the case of acute insolvency crises, it can be advisable for regulators and supranational lenders to preemptively engineer the orderly restructuring of a nation's public debt ‚Äì also called \\"orderly default\\" or \\"controlled default\\". In the case of Greece, these experts generally believe that a delay in organising an orderly default would hurt the rest of Europe even more.Louise Armitstead, \\"EU accused of 'head in sand' attitude to Greek debt crisis\\" The Telegraph, 23 June 2011 The International Monetary Fund often lends for sovereign debt restructuring. To ensure that funds will be available to pay the remaining part of the sovereign debt, it has made such loans conditional on action such as reducing corruption, imposing austerity measures such as reducing non-profitable public sector services, raising the tax take (revenue) or more rarely suggesting other forms of revenue raising such as nationalization of inept or corrupt but lucrative economic sectors. A recent example is the Greek bailout agreement of May 2010. After the 2008 financial crisis, in order to avoid a sovereign default, Spain and Portugal, among other countries, turned their trade and current account deficits into surpluses. Currently, some member countries of the CIS (Armenia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan), some African countries (Cameroon, Egypt), as well as many other nations, have accumulated central government debt levels surpassing six months of those countries' annual GDPs.  Causes  According to financial historian Edward Chancellor, past instances of sovereign default have tended to occur under some or all of the following circumstances:Reflections on the sovereign debt crisis, Edward Chancellor, GMO White Paper, Juli 2010. * A reversal of global capital flows * Unwise lending * Fraudulent lending * Excessive foreign debts * A poor credit history * Unproductive lending * Rollover risk * Weak revenues * Rising interest rates * Terminal debt A significant factor in sovereign default is the presence of significant debts owed to foreign investors such as banks who are unable to obtain timely payment via political support from governments, supranational courts or negotiation; the enforcement of creditors' rights against sovereign states is frequently difficult. Such willful defaults (the equivalent of strategic bankruptcy by a company or strategic default by a mortgager, except without the possibility of the exercise of normal creditors' rights such as asset seizure and sale) can be considered a variety of sovereign theft; this is similar to expropriation (including inadequate repayment for the exercise of eminent domain). Some also believe that sovereign default is a dark side of globalization and capitalism. Insolvency/over-indebtedness of the state If a state, for economic reasons, defaults on its treasury obligations, or is no longer able or willing to handle its debt, liabilities, or to pay the interest on this debt, it faces sovereign default. To declare insolvency, it is sufficient if the state is only able (or willing) to pay part of its due interest or to clear off only part of the debt. Reasons for this include: *massive increases in public debt *declines in employment and therefore tax revenue *government regulation or perceived threats of regulation of financial markets *popular unrest at austerity measures to repay debt fully Sovereign default caused by insolvency historically has always appeared at the end of long years or decades of budget emergency (overspending), in which the state has spent more money than it received. This budget balance/margin was covered through new indebtedness with national and foreign citizens, banks and states. Illiquidity The literature proposes an important distinction between illiquidity and insolvency. If a country is temporarily unable to meet pending interest or principle payments because it can not liquify sufficient assets, it is \\"in default because of illiquidity\\". In this concept the default can be solved as soon as the assets that are \\"only temporarily illiquid\\" become liquid (again), which makes illiquidity a temporary state - in contrast to insolvency. The weakness of this concept is that is practically impossible to prove that an asset is only temporarily illiquid. Change of government While normally the change of government does not change the responsibility of the state to handle treasury obligations created by earlier governments, nevertheless it can be observed that in revolutionary situations and after a regime change the new government may question the legitimacy of the earlier one, and thus default on those treasury obligations considered odious debt. Important examples are: *default of debts of the Bourbon France after the French Revolution. *default of bonds through Denmark in 1850, which were issued by the government of Holstein instated by the German Confederation. *default of debts of the Russian Empire after the Soviet government came to power in 1917.Landon-Lane J., Oosterlinck K., (2006), \\"Hope springs eternal: French bondholders and the Soviet Repudiation (1915-1919)\\", Review of Finance, 10, 4, pp. 507-535. *repudiation of debts of the Confederate States of America by the United States after the Civil War through the ratification of Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Decline of the state With the decline of a state, its obligations are turned over to one or several successor states. Lost wars significantly accelerate sovereign default. Nevertheless, especially after World War II the government debt has increased significantly in many countries even during long lasting times of peace. While in the beginning debt was quite small, due to compound interest and continued overspending it has increased substantially.  Approaches to debt repayment  There are two different theories as to why sovereign countries repay their debt.  Reputation approach  The reputation approach stipulates that countries value the access to international capital markets because it allows them to smooth consumption in the face of volatile output and/or fluctuating investment opportunities. This approach assumes no outside factors such as legal or military action because the debtor is a sovereign country. Debtor countries with poor reputations will lack access to these capital markets.  Punishment approach  The punishment approach stipulates that the debtor will be punished in some form, whether it be by legal action and/or military force. The creditor will use legal and/or military threats to see their investment returned. The punishment may prevent debtors from being able to borrow in their own currency. Consequences Creditors of the state as well the economy and the citizens of the state are affected by the sovereign default. Consequences for creditors The immediate cost to creditors is the loss of principal and interest owed on their loans to the defaulting country. In this case very often there are international negotiations that end in a partial debt cancellation (London Agreement on German External Debts 1953) or debt restructuring (e.g. Brady Bonds in the 1980s). This kind of agreement assures the partial repayment when a renunciation / surrender of a big part of the debt is accepted by the creditor. In the case of the Argentine economic crisis (1999‚Äì2002) some creditors elected to accept the renunciation (loss, or \\"haircut\\") of up to 75% of the outstanding debts, while others ( \\"holdouts\\") elected instead to await a change of government (2015) for offers of better compensation. For the purpose of debts regulation debts can be distinguished by nationality of creditor (national or international), or by the currency of the debts (own currency or foreign currency) as well as whether the foreign creditors are private or state owned. States are frequently more willing to cancel debts owed to foreign private creditors, unless those creditors have means of retaliation against the state. Consequences for the state When a state defaults on a debt, the state disposes of (or ignores, depending on the viewpoint) its financial obligations/debts towards certain creditors. The immediate effect for the state is a reduction in its total debt and a reduction in payments on the interest of that debt. On the other hand, a default can damage the reputation of the state among creditors, which can restrict the ability of the state to obtain credit from the capital market. In some cases foreign lenders may attempt to undermine the monetary sovereignty of the debtor state or even declare war (see above). Consequences for the citizen If the individual citizen or corporate citizen is a creditor of the state (e.g. government bonds), then a default by the state can mean a devaluation of their monetary wealth. In addition, the following scenarios can occur in a debtor state from a sovereign default: * a banking crisis, as banks have to make write downs on credits given to the state. * an economic crisis, as the interior demand will fall and investors withdraw their money * a currency crisis as foreign investors avoid this national economy Citizens of a debtor state might feel the impact indirectly through high unemployment and the decrease of state services and benefits. However, a monetarily sovereign state can take steps to minimize negative consequences, rebalance the economy and foster social/economic progress, for example Brazil's Plano Real. Solutions With the reputation of the Big Three - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Group - coming under fire since the 2008 financial crisis, many have questioned their ratings methods. Marc Joffe, a former Senior Director at Moody's and now Principal Consultant at Public Sector Credit Solutions (PSCS), has recently argued that economists and other academic social scientists, via logit and probit econometric models, are better equipped than ratings agencies to assess the default risk of sovereigns and municipalities. To support better ratings methods, PSCS (in partnership with Wikirating) maintains a comprehensive public database of sovereign defaults, revenues, expenditures, debt levels, and debt service costs. PSCS has also developed the Public Sector Credit Framework, an open source budget simulation model that helps analysts assess default probabilities. Examples of sovereign default A failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. Medieval England lived through multiple defaults on debt, Philip II of Spain defaulted on debt four times ‚Äì in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. This sovereign default threw the German banking houses into chaos and ended the reign of the Fuggers as Spanish financiers. Genoese bankers provided the unwieldy Habsburg system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further military ventures. In the 1820s, several Latin American countries that had recently entered the bond market in London defaulted. These same countries frequently defaulted during the nineteenth century, but the situation was typically rapidly resolved with a renegotiation of loans, including the writing off of some debts.Erika Jorgensen and Jeffrey Sachs, \\"Default and Renegotiation of Latin American Foreign Bonds in the Interwar Period\\" In: Barry J. Eichengreen and Peter H. Lindert, The International Debt Crisis in Historical Perspective A failure to meet payments became common again in the late 1920s and 1930s. As protectionism by wealthy nations rose and international trade fell, especially after the banking crisis of 1929, countries possessing debts denominated in other currencies found it increasingly difficult to meet terms agreed under more favourable economic conditions. For example, in 1932, Chile's scheduled repayments exceeded the nation's total exports; or, at least, its exports under then-current pricing. Whether reductions in prices ‚Äì forced sales ‚Äì would have enabled fulfilling creditors' rights is unknown. A number of states in the U.S. defaulted in the mid-19th century. The most recent U.S. state to default was Arkansas, which defaulted in 1933. More recently Greece became the first developed country to default to the International Monetary Fund. In June 2015 Greece defaulted on a $1.7 billion payment to the IMF.

Previously, he was chairman and CEO of Arkla, Inc. (1983-1992), a natural gas company. During that time, he was appointed by President George H.W. Bush to the National Petroleum Council and the National Council on Environmental Quality, and served on the St. Louis Federal Reserve Board. He is currently the Chairman of McLarty Associates, an international strategic advisory firm headquartered in Washington, DC, and chairman of the McLarty Companies, based in Little Rock, Arkansas. Early life McLarty was born in Hope, Arkansas, the son of Helen (n√©e Hesterly) and Thomas F. McLarty, Jr. His father owned and operated an automotive dealership founded by his grandfather in 1921. His mother was \\"the first woman named to the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission\\". An all-star high school athlete and football quarterback, McLarty also served as president of the Hope High School student council. In 1963, he attended Arkansas Boys State, where he was elected governor‚Äîthe same year his childhood friend Bill Clinton was elected Senator. McLarty attended the University of Arkansas, where he was elected Student Body President. He graduated summa cum laude in 1968, with a degree in business administration. While at the University of Arkansas, he met classmate and fellow business student Donna Kaye Cochran. They were married in 1968 and returned to Hope, where Mack joined his father in the family business.  Business career  At the age of 23, McLarty ran successfully for the Arkansas House of Representatives, serving one term (1971‚Äì73) under Governor Dale Bumpers. He then concentrated his efforts on growing the McLarty family's truck leasing business, first called M&M; Leasing, and later McLarty Leasing. McLarty played leading roles in politics, business and the community. Amongst other roles, he was president of Hempstead County Industrial Foundation, a member of the Democratic National Committee (1974‚Äì76) and the Chairman of the State Democratic Party. He acted as treasurer in the successful campaigns of Governor David Pryor and President Bill Clinton. McLarty also helped create the IMPAC program, which worked to mobilize private sector support for putting personal computers in Arkansas classrooms. McLarty was Named the youngest board member of the Fortune 500 natural gas company Arkla, Inc., becoming its Chief Executive Officer in 1983. White House years Following Bill Clinton's 1992 election victory, McLarty helped lead the transition team, and then entered public service as a member of the Clinton administration, serving as the president's first White House Chief of Staff from 1993 to June 1994. McLarty is a lifelong friend of Clinton's, having attended the same kindergarten class in Hope, Arkansas. In the first year of the Clinton presidency, McLarty and his team helped to put in place President Clinton's deficit reduction plan; set up the first National Economic Council; passed the Family and Medical Leave law; passed NAFTA and facilitated the passage and signing of the Brady Bill. McLarty went on to serve as counselor to the president, serving more than five years in the President's Cabinet and on the National Economic Council. In this role, he served as White House Coordinator for the Centennial Games in Atlanta. He also organized the 1994 Summit of the Americas in Miami, which ultimately led to his December 1996 appointment as Special Envoy for the Americas. In recognition of his work, McLarty was awarded the Secretary of State's Distinguished Service Medal and the highest civilian honors of seven Latin American countries. McLarty left the Clinton administration in June 1998.  McLarty Associates  After leaving government, he founded an international strategic advisory firm, in partnership with fellow White House alumnus Nelson Cunningham, and later Henry Kissinger. McLarty Associates, based in Washington D.C., is a global team of former ambassadors and senior foreign policy experts, journalists, and business leaders, with expertise in all the world's major markets. After eight years with McLarty Associates, Kissinger left as a principal from McLarty Associates on February 21, 2008, but remained with firm on the board of counsellors.

The British said it was flying French national colours, a charge the Germans denied. The British condemned the attack in the House of Commons as an example of Nazi callousness.Paterson 2015, 72. On 25 July 1940 T√∂niges left port aboard \\"S-19\\" on another patrol. The group claimed three ships sunk‚Äî\\"S-19\\" torpedoed SS London Trader (646t). The German crew reported it as a 10,000t steamer and all of the ships were reported to have been much larger and heavier than they were.Paterson 2015, 73. On 19 February 1941, T√∂niges sortied with \\"S-28\\" and \\"S-101\\". He spotted a freighter in the Thames Estuary, and claimed it sunk. British losses show the vessel to be Algarve (1,335t).Smith 2007, p. 156. All 21 crewman were lost. \\"S-102\\" fired on a second ship that could be seen through the fog via the fog-lamps. An explosion was heard and T√∂niges claimed it sank; no further British loss was recorded.Paterson 2015, 100. He commanded the Schnellboote \\"S 24\\", \\"S 26\\" and \\"S 102\\". T√∂niges was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross after 88 combat patrols on 25 February 1941.Paterson 2015, 100. On 18 March 1941 the group engaged convoy FN34. The French steamer SS Daphne II (1,970t) was badly damaged by T√∂niges. It was placed under tow but broke apart in the Humber days later.Paterson 2015, 104. Black Sea T√∂niges was relocated to the Eastern Front and operated in the Black Sea. On 27 June 1942, T√∂niges sank the passenger ship SS Belostok (2,034t) which was evacuating wounded soldiers from Sevastopol.Paterson 2015, 237. On 7 August 1942 T√∂niges sank the Sevastopol (1,339t).Paterson 2015, 240. On 31 August he claimed a 3,000-ton freighter. On 3 September he claimed a 2,000-ton ship and two 1,200-ton light freighters. The claims are hard to substantiate, but by the 5 September 1942 the German vessels claimed to have sunk 20 Soviet ships evacuating Red Army forces on the Taman Peninsula.Paterson 2015, 241. He soon also received the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross on 13 November 1942, the first in the Schnellboot service. At this point T√∂niges had sunk 18 war and merchant ships plus two U-boat hunters. He was transferred to the Naval Academy M√ºrwik (Marineschule M√ºrwik) in Flensburg-M√ºrwik as company commander at the end of September 1942. Here he received the Fast Attack Craft War Badge with Diamonds. As of September 1943 he served as a training officer in the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine, where he was promoted to Korvettenkapit√§n on 1 January 1945.

Zuo1 has been identified in vitro as a tRNA and Z-DNA binding protein. The name \\"zuotin\\" is derived from the Chinese word \\"zuo\\" meaning \\"left\\". It is a member of Hsp40 family. Like all other Hsp40 members it also contains a classic J domain. Zuotin and related proteins contain a unique Zuotin homology domain (ZHD). It associates with the Hsp70 family Ssz1 to form a ribosome associated complex (RAC). In such a complex, the N-terminal domains (including the J domain) associates with Ssz1p on the surface of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit. ZHD provides further contacts with the 60S subunit and connects to a subunit-spanning medium domain (MD), the \\"neck\\" of RAC. The four-helix-bundle RAC head domain is located at the C-terminus and binds the small (40S) subunit. The J domain-Ssz1p complex, located over the peptide exit tunnel of the large ribosomal subunit, helps the nascent peptide fold.

It comes in blued steel, case colored, and a gloss stainless finish (the latter gloss stainless finish is intended to resemble closely a 19th-century nickel-plated finish), all of which are available with wood, hard rubber, simulated ivory or black micarta grips and fixed sights. It arose with the popularity of Cowboy Action Shooting from which came demand for a single-action revolver that was more traditional in appearance. Design details The Ruger Vaquero is a New Model Blackhawk with fixed sights consisting of a front blade and a notch milled into the frame at the rear. The first version was a barrelled revolver chambered in .45 Colt with a simulated color case-hardened frame and a blue barrel, grip frame, and cylinder. This was followed by models with a barrel and a barrel based on the other common barrel lengths of the Colt SAA. The three versions were offered in stainless steel and other calibers including .44 Magnum, .357 Magnum, and .44-40 Winchester. Originally all Ruger Vaqueros were shipped with walnut grips incorporating a Ruger logo in a medallion. In 1998 some models began shipping with a faux-ivory grip and limited runs with gold inlay and engraving were offered. Like the New Model Blackhawk the Vaquero does not require the hammer to be half-cocked for loading and unloading, and uses a transfer bar mechanism which prevents the cartridge under the hammer from being fired without the trigger being pulled. The \\"New Model Vaquero\\" comes with checkered black plastic grips, which look similar to the checkered black rubber grips Colt used in the late 19th century. Ruger placed the safety warning which used to appear on the left-side of the barrel beneath the barrel on these models to make the gun more aesthetically pleasing. Variants Two major variants of Vaqueros exist. The original Vaquero was marketed from 1993 until 2005, and was slightly larger than the Colt Single Action Army. The New Vaquero, produced from 2005 to the present is closer to the dimensions of the Colt Single Action Army. Unlike original Single Action Army revolvers, both versions are safe to load all six cylinders, having a transfer bar design; additionally, both variants permit reloading by simply opening the loading gate, thereby freeing the cylinder to rotate freely, without pulling the hammer into the half-cock notch. These initial Vaqueros have only two hammer positions: fully down, and fully cocked. The original Vaquero was built to safely fire higher pressure 45 Colt ammunition than the Black powder chamberings, having significantly thicker cylinder walls than other revolvers. Many reloading manuals contain Ruger-only recommended handloads that are considered unsafe for use in other than Ruger Blackhawk, Redhawk, Thompson/Center and Ruger Vaquero model revolvers. Ruger New Vaquero model revolvers, having thinner cylinder walls, are not considered safe for use with the Ruger-only loads taken from the older editions of these manuals. Ruger states that the \\"New Model Vaquero\\" will handle +P and +P+ ammunition without any issues, but warns users not to shoot reloads in any of their guns as it will void the warranty. Three grip variants exist for Vaqueros. The standard grip is very similar to the grip on the original Single Action Army revolver. The Bisley variant incorporates the target grip that was incorporated on the Bisley variant of the Single Action Army revolver that was intended for target shooting. The Bisley grip is also better suited for users with larger hands, having a longer frame that better fits larger hands. Users with smaller hands may not find the trigger to be comfortable to shoot on Bisley variants, by reason of not being able to place their trigger finger properly on the trigger, the trigger being located farther from the grip. The third variant is the Birdshead grip, similar to the pattern found on the Colt M1877 and M1878 models. In 1999 a limited run of 500 guns in stainless steel and 500 guns in blue with color case hardened frames were offered by Davidson's with a barrel and a shortened ejector rod and housing. These were called the \\"Sheriff's Model\\". In 2005, this barrel was added as a standard option to the catalog. History The Vaquero was introduced in 1993 to meet the growing demand for quality modern firearms used in the growing sport of cowboy action shooting. In 2005, Ruger introduced the \\"New Vaquero\\" which incorporated a smaller frame, based on Ruger's XR-3 grip frame, making the pistol closer to the size of the Colt Single Action Army Revolver of 1873. The New Vaquero will accept two-piece stocks made for the Colt Single Action Army. Calibers * .32-20 WCF/.32 H&R; Magnum * .357 Magnum/.38 Special * .44WCF * .44 Magnum * .45 Colt The Firearms Distributor known as Davidson's offered three exclusive chamberings of the Vaquero with convertible cylinders: * .357 Magnum/9 mm Convertible * .45 Colt/.45 ACP Convertible * .38-40 Winchester/.40 S&W; Convertible San Diego Sheriff's Association .40 S&W; model In 2000, the San Diego Sheriff's Association ordered a Commemorative Edition Vaquero chambered in .40 S&W; (the caliber of the SDSA's service weapon), to celebrate the agency's 150th anniversary. Approximately 1,000 models were produced, most of which were sold to SDSA members embossed with their logo on the barrel. Around 125 were overruns and sold lacking such markings; particularly sought after by collectors are 25-30 of said overruns in which the user warning traditionally stamped on the left side of the barrel was instead stamped on the underside of the barrel.

He was one of the foremost cartographers of his time and an author of the Dieppe maps. His maps were distinguished by their sophistication and detail; they influenced generations of cartographers, navigators and explorers. Le Testu was successful as a privateer during the early years of the French Wars of Religion. In 1573, he and Sir Francis Drake attacked a Spanish mule train escorting gold and silver to Nombre de Dios on the Atlantic coast of Panama, and he was subsequently killed following his capture by the Spanish. Suggestions that Le Testu may have mapped (or even visited) Australia are based on: first, his maps' depiction of a large island (or continent), south of Java, which Le Testu identified as the Jave la Grande (\\"Java Major\\" or \\"Great Java\\") mentioned by Marco Polo (and was otherwise known at the time as Terra Australis) and second, Le Testu's incorporation in these maps of birds that resemble black swans and cassowaries, which are both native to Australia.Eisler, William. The Furthest Shore: Images of Terra Australis from the Middle Ages to Captain Cook. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1995. (pg. 23) However, he did not claim to have seen Jave la Grande in person and many cartographers at the time incorporated hypothetical, mythological or fantastic elements, a practice that is clearly also true of Le Testu.McIntosh, Gregory C. The Piri Reis map of 1513. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2000. (pg. 45) His maps also showed unicorns and monstrous creatures such as 200 metre long giant snakes, basilisks, satyrs, Blemmyes (headless humans) and Cynocephalics (dog-headed humans).Pettegree, Andrew. Europe in the Sixteenth Century. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers, 2002. (pg. 228) Le Testu's work was used by Admiral Gaspard de Coligny and French Huguenots hoping to establish themselves in Brazil, Florida, the Caribbean and even the Terra Australis derived from Le Testu's \\"Jave la Grande\\". However, these attempts were abandoned following Coligny's assassination in 1572 and Le Testu's death the following year.Quinn, David B. Explorers and Colonies: America, 1500-1625. London: Hambleton Press, 1990. (pg. 63) Biography Guillaume Le Testu, Jave la Grande, in Cosmographie Universelle, 1555/56. Note that North is to the left Guillaume le Testu was born sometime around 1509-12, in either Le Havre, Normandy or Grasse, Provence. He was one of the last students to be taught cartography at the famed school of Dieppe. Le Testu subsequently took part in voyages of exploration throughout the Atlantic Ocean. In 1550, Le Testu was commissioned by King Henry II to create a map of the Americas, particularly where the French were trading. In June 1551, he sailed to Brazil on both an exploration and reconnaissance mission from Henry II, charting as far as the Rio de la Plata. His ship, the Salamandre,The salamander was a royal device favoured by Henry II and his father, Francis I. reached as far south as 26 latitude a fair distance past present-day Rio de Janeiro. In late December, he became involved in a firefight with two Portuguese ships near Trinidad and sustained heavy damage to his ship, although he was successful in mapping much of the South American coastline by the time of his return to Dieppe in July 1552.McGrath, John T. The French in Early Florida: In the Eye of the Hurricane. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2000. (pg. 17) Le Testu was also involved in the founding of a French colony near Rio de Janeiro in 1555. In 1555 or 1556, Le Testu composed a world atlas entitled Cosmographie Universelle selon les Navigateurs, tant anciens que modernes and was consequently awarded the title of Pilote Royale by Henry II.Cosmographie universelle, Guillaume Le Testu, Le Havre, 1556. The Cosmographie Universelle contained 56 maps reportedly based on charts Le Testu had personally drawn by hand on his expeditions.Buisseret, David, ed. Monarchs, Ministers, and Maps: The Emergence of Cartography as a Tool of Government in Early Modern Europe. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992. (pg. 103) This atlas extolled the military triumphs and imperialist dreams of the French monarchy, and was dedicated to Le Testu's mentor and patron Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, who had become leader of the Huguenots three years earlier. The manuscript was based on charts from French, Spanish and Portuguese sources supplied by Coligny. Included in this atlas were twelve charts of Jave le Grand/Terra Australis, which Le Testu located southward of the Moluccas. Le Testu commented: \\"However, what I have marked and depicted is only by imagination, and I have not noted or remarked on any of the commodities or incommodities of the place, nor its mountains, rivers or other things; for there has never yet been any man who has made a certain discovery of it.\\"Jacob, Christian. The Sovereign Map: Theoretical Approaches in Cartography Throughout History. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006. (pg. 146) ; Frank Lestringant, Mapping the Renaissance World, (transl. by David Fausett), Cambridge, Polity/Blackwell, 1994, p.133.. Coligny subsequently supported a proposal from the d'Albagno brothers, for an expedition to Terra Australis to investigate the possibility of a French colony there.Amy Glassner Gordon, \\"Mapping La Popelini√®re's Thought: Some Geographical Dimensions\\", Terrae Incognitae, vol.9, 1977, pp.60-73; Numa Broc, \\"De l‚ÄôAntichtone √† l‚ÄôAntarctique\\", Cartes et figures de la Terre, Paris, Centre Georges Pompidou, 1980, pp.136-49. Three centuries later, the English scholar Edward Jenks suggested that a chart said to have been created in 1542 and later held by the British Museum may have been Le Testu's source for Jave la Grande.Jenks, Edward. A History of the Australasian Colonies (From Their Foundation to the Year 1893). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1895. (pg. 5-6) Le Testu's Cosmographie Universelle (1555) and world atlas (1556) are both in the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris.Clarke, Marcus. History of the Continent of Australia and the Island of Tasmania (1787 to 1870). Melbourne: F.F. Bailliere, 1870. (pg. 4) The map, said Jenks, was said to have been ‚Äúthe property of a man named Rotz, a French sailor who passed some part of his life in England‚Äù. Jenks commented: ‚Äúthis fact gives some colour to the claim put forward by the French, that their countryman, Guillaume le Testu, was the true discoverer of Australia. The claim is based mainly upon the fact that Testu‚Äôs name appears on a map dated 1555, on which a southern continent, styled Jave la Grande (‚ÄúGreat Java‚Äù), is outlined. But this fact, of course, merely proves that Testu had heard of such a country...\\" Aulcuns portugais allans aux Indes furent par contrari√©t√© de temps transport√©s fort Su du cap de Bonne esperance.

Guillaume Le Testu, Mappemonde en deux h√©misph√®res, Le Havre, 1566.Le Testu, Mappemonde , 1566 The next several years saw the outbreak of the French Wars of Religion, civil wars between the Huguenots and Catholics; in 1567, Le Testu sided with the Protestant Huguenots, conducting privateering raids for two years before his capture by the Catholics. He would remain imprisoned for over four years until he was released by order of King Charles IX, due to public interest on his behalf. Raid on Nombre de Dios and death On March 23, 1573, Le Testu unexpectedly encountered Sir Francis Drake near \\"Cabo de Cativas\\", near Cativ√°, Panama. Le Testu was in command of the 80-ton warship Havre (or the New Haven) with a crew of seventy; although it is unknown what Le Testu's mission was, he may have been there at the behest of an Italian sponsor.Lane, Kris E. Blood and Silver: A History of Piracy in the Caribbean and Central America. Oxford, UK: Signal Books, 1999. (pg. 40) He reportedly presented to Drake a scimitar, formerly belonging to the condottiero Piero Strozzi, as a gift on behalf of Coligny.Knox, Robert. Nineteen Years Captivity in the Highlands of Ceylon, March 1660 - October 1679. New Delhi and Chennai: Asian Educational Services, 2004. (pg. xix) It was during this meeting, having brought news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, that he offered to join Drake in a final raid against a Spanish mule train en route to Nombre de Dios before leaving the area. He and Drake sailed their combined fleet to the \\"Francisco River\\" (probably Rio Cuango, near Cuango, Panama). Le Testu and Drake landed with their men just east of Nombre de Dios. Le Testu had 70 men under his command while Drake himself led 31 men including his Cimarron allies.Sugden, John. Sir Francis Drake. Random House UK, 2006. (pg. 72) As their ships sailed off, with orders to return for them in four days, the party headed inland to a spot two leagues south of the city, arriving on April 29, where they awaited the Spanish mule train. It was soon after their arrival that the party heard bells in the distance signaling the arrival of the caravan. Cimarrons scouts also warned of their approach reporting the size of the caravan consisting of almost 200 mules each carrying up to three hundred pounds of treasure. Drake had chosen the spot for the ambush, believing the Spaniards to be at their most vulnerable as they were nearing their destination after traveling through miles of jungle, to take the mule train off guard in a surprise attack. They drove off the Spanish guards, although at a cost of several Cimarron and Frenchmen.Whitfield, Peter. Sir Francis Drake. New York: New York University Press, 2004. (pg. 34) The attack was a complete success and nearly 30 tons of gold and silver were captured by Drake and Le Testu. Between 80,000-100,000 pesos in gold were taken by the privateers: in fact, there was so much treasure that the privateers were unable carry all the silver off and buried what remained. Le Testu's share came to ¬£20,000. However, he was seriously wounded during the first assault and chose to rest with two of his men by the roadside until he was able to travel. As the rest of the party continued to meet the scheduled rendezvous with their fleet, they discovered a Spanish fleet waiting for them instead. Drake was forced to construct a raft and sail out to an island roughly three leagues offshore, where he contacted his own ships. Safely aboard with his crew once more, he sent a rescue party back for La Testu. When Drake's men returned, they reported that Le Testu and his men had been caught by Spanish soldiers and executed. Le Testu was beheaded. One of his men had also been tortured until he revealed the location of most of the buried silver.Andrews, Kenneth R. Trade, plunder and settlement: Maritime enterprise and the genesis of British Empire, 1480-1630. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1984. (pg. 131) Le Testu's head was taken back to Nombre de Dios where it was displayed in the marketplace. Drake's men had managed to find some silver which had been missed, which they brought back to split between the English and French crews before sailing back for Europe.Kelsey, Harry. Sir Francis Drake: The Queen's Pirate. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1998. (pg. 63-64) The surviving French later complained the English had taken the majority of the proceeds, however. It is possible that Le Testu mentioned plans for an expedition to Jave la Grand/Terra Australis to Drake and his associates, and/or otherwise inspired Drake's voyage to the Pacific Ocean and circumnavigation of the world during 1576‚Äì1578.R.

This free movement results from the fact that in railroad practice cars are loosely coupled, and the coupling is often combined with a shock-absorbing device, a \\"draft gear\\", which, under stress, substantially increases the free movement as the train is started or stopped. Loose coupling is necessary to enable the train to bend around curves and is an aid in starting heavy trains, since the application of the locomotive power to the train operates on each car in the train successively, and the power is thus utilized to start only one car at a time. United Kingdom The UK formerly used three-link couplings, which allowed a large amount of slack; these have since been replaced by buffers and chain couplers. While the couplings are held tight by buffers and shortened by a turnbuckle, other railways decided to replace them with automatic couplings, such as the Scharfenberg coupler and the Janney coupler.

Phraya Pichai (th: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏¢), or popularly known as Phraya Pichai Daap Hak (th: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏¢‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏ö‡∏´‡∏±‡∏Å; lit: Phraya Pichai of the shattered sword) (1741 ‚Äì 1782) was a historic Mon hero of Thonburi period who fought with a sword in each hand until one was broken. Background Phraya Pichai was a Siamese general serving under King Taksin. After the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, Phraya Pichai and Chao Phraya Chakri (who later become the first King of Chakri Dynasty) followed Phraya Taksin in repelling the Burmese and reuniting Siam. They were considered Phraya Taksin's left and right hands. In 1782, King Taksin showed signs of mental illness. At that time, the nation still lacked stability and was in need of a strong ruler. King Taksin was deposed and later executed following a coup, after which Chao Phraya Chakri took the throne . Phraya Pichai, a devout follower of King Taksin, was not spared, and by most account, requested for his own execution to follow King Taksin to his death. He was executed soon after. He gained the name Phraya Phichai Daabhak or Phraya Pichai Broken Sword in a battle in which he kept fighting (and won) even after one of his blades (daab) was broken in half. Early life Birth Phraya Pichai was born in 1741 at Ban Huai Kha, Phichai, Uttaradit Province, having four brothers and sisters but three of them died before Phichai\\"s birth. His parents were unknown. His birthname was Choi (th: ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏¢; means: the little one). Childhood When Choi was a young boy, he loved to practice Thai boxing and would always be running away without his parents knowing, to train in the art. He trained with many teachers of that time. One day, Choi left home northernwards and met with a boxing instructor named Thiang (th: ‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏á) at Wat Ban Kaeng (th: ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏á). Choi then became a beloved student of Instructor Thiang and renamed as Thong Di (th: ‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏î‡∏µ), his instructor called him as Master Thong Di Fan Khao (th: ‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏ü‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏ß; means: Thong Di whose teeth are white) as he did not chew betel nut. The Thai people loved chewing betel nut, which made their teeth black, since the ancient time until the Government under the premiership of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram issued a ban on chewing the nut in 1942. Career Serving the Crown One day, Phraya Tak (later to become King Taksin the great of Thonburi kingdom) was holding a boxing contest in the city of Tak during a traditional festival. Now a young man of twenty years, Thong Di asked the ring master to find him a match. The towns people having never seen the boxer before suggested that he take an opponent who had little experience so that it would make an exciting fight, but Thong Di insisted that he would fight the most skillful boxer in the town. A famous boxing master of Tak, Nai Hao, who nobody dared to challenge, gladly agreed to take the fight. A huge crowd gathered to see the young boxer Thong Di fight the invincible Nai Hao. Throughout the bout Thong Di showed brilliant Thai boxing style. Seeing a resounding victory over Nai Hao after witnessing such a formidable display, Phraya Tak showed no hesitation in asking Thong Di to join his army. Thong Di were very pleasing to Phraya Tak who appointed him to be his personal bodyguard. Commander-in-Chief The Emperor of China Qianlong, was alarmed by the military might of the Burmese. From 1765‚Äì1769, the Emperor sent his armies four times to subdue the Burmese, but all four invasions failed. Siam was under the control of the Burmese since the sacking of Ayutthaya in 1767, but the Burmese had to withdraw the bulk of garrison army from Siam to ward of the Chinese invasions, leaving behind only a small contingent. Phraya Tak taking advantage of the situation, organized his men into an army and drove back the Burmese force. Phraya Tak started off as a guerrilla leader with only five hundred followers. But within a decade the Siamese Kingdom was reborn and grew into an empire that subdued both Laos and Cambodia under its dominion. During the independence war, Phraya Taks managed to escape to Rayong on the East coast of Siam. Here with the help of Thong Di, now his Commander-in-Chief, raised an army and declared all out war on Burma. The action was to eventually regain freedom for the Siamese people. Thong Di, under the guidance of Phraya Tak and using guerrilla tactics, won back many small towns and villages from the Burmese. It was during one of the many battles, that Thong Di was to become famous. In 1773 an army under celebrated Burmese General Bo Supia was sent to capture the City of Pichai. Thong Di led the Siamese army and fought him at Wat Aka and Chao Phya Surasi helped him battle the Burmese. The Burmese general was driven into retreat while sustaining great losses to his troops. The One with Broken Sword In the heat of the battle which Thong Di fought with daab song mue (two handed swords) and after many fierce engagements he slipped and used one of his swords to control himself by pointing it into the ground, as he leaned on the sword it broke in half. Thong Di used his Thai boxing techniques. One dap and one broken one, he led his army to victory forcing the Burmese back across the border. As a result of this battle he was known as \\"Phraya Pichai Daap Hak\\". Eventually after fifteen years of war the Siamese under king Taksin had forced the Burmese army back and Siam regained all of its original frontiers. Death and legacy When King Taksin died in 1782, the new King Rama I of the Chakri Dynasty (the present day rulers), declared his new capital Bangkok. As a reward for his loyalty and service to his country King Rama asked Phraya Pichai if he would continue his good work as the king‚Äôs guard. (In these times the law of the land stated that once a King died, his bodyguards and loyal servants should die with him, but King Rama offered to take an exception for Phraya Pichai.) However, Phraya Pichai was so saddened by the death of his beloved King Taksin that he ordered the executioner to do away with him, despite King Rama's kindness. Such was the loyalty that Phraya Pichai had for King Taksin. Instead he asked King Rama to raise his son and in time that son could become King's personal bodyguard in his father's place. Phraya Pichai was executed on his own order when he was 41 years old. A monument built to the memory of Phraya Pichai in 1969. The bronze image of the great warrior stand proudly in front of the Parliament Building in Uttaradit and serves to remind each generation of the amazing man's courage and loyalty to his King and the Thai nation. The epitaph reads \\"In memory and loving honor for the pride of our nation\\".

The station began broadcasting under program test authority as \\"KMBQ\\" in December 2008. Currently owned by Alaska Multimedia, LLC, the station received its broadcast license on January 27, 2012. Programming The station broadcasts a mix of talk radio programming and 1960s oldies music. Syndicated talk programming includes America's Morning News (a radio news service of The Washington Times), The Ron Insana Show (a business news show from Compass Media Networks), and talk shows hosted by Neal Boortz, Don Imus, and Lars Larson. Nights, overnights, and weekends are predominantly music hours focused on the hits of the 1960s. History Early days In January 2004, Thomas L. Sweeney of Spokane, Washington, applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. The FCC granted this permit on December 15, 2005, with a scheduled expiration date of December 15, 2008. However, Sweeney died on January 31, 2006, at the age of 83. His daughter, Ruth Ann Sweeney, acting as her father's personal representative, notified the FCC of the involuntary transfer of control of the permit and the FCC approved the transfer on June 30, 2006. While awaiting FCC action, Ruth Ann Sweeney reached an agreement in May 2006 to sell the construction permit to Charles Dunham, owner of Northern Radio, Inc., and the license holder for KSWD and KSWD-FM in Seward, Alaska. The FCC approved this sale on August 31, 2006, and the transaction was formally consummated on October 2, 2006. Klapperich era Dunham's tenure as owner was short-lived as in November 2006, he reached an agreement to sell the permit to John N. Klapperich. The FCC approved this sale on December 28, 2006, and formal consummation of the deal took place on January 29, 2007. Klapperich had the FCC assign the under-construction station call sign \\"KMBQ\\" on April 26, 2008. Facing a December 15, 2008, deadline to begin broadcast operations or risk losing the construction permit, Klapperich faced a literal roadblock to completing construction as neighboring property owners blocked the access road to the property. Their objections included claims that the wetlands area in which the tower was located was a bird and salmon habitat and that \\"AM radio waves can cause brain damage\\". Klapperich and his crew were able to complete construction and begin broadcasting on December 10, just days ahead of the deadline, with a simulcast of then-sister station KMBQ-FM (99.7 FM). He immediately filed an application for the station's broadcast license which the FCC accepted on December 22, 2008, but it would require more than three years of filings and counter-filings before the Commission would take further action. In January 2009, Klapperich applied to the FCC to transfer the KMBQ construction permit from his personal control to Spirit of Alaska Broadcasting, Inc., a company wholly owned by Klapperich and his wife, Joan. The FCC approved the transfer on January 23, 2009, and formal consummation was filed on February 1, 2009. Financial problems In July 2010, Spirit of Alaska Broadcasting, Inc., licensee for KMBQ, KMBQ-FM, and KBYR, was placed into receivership by creditor Gladstone Capital Corp. The broadcaster owed the lender more than $2 million, according to published reports. The FCC granted an involuntary transfer of control of the broadcast licenses on August 19, 2010. Spirit of Alaska Broadcasting co-owner John Klapperich told the Anchorage Daily News that this was \\"an unbelievable situation\\" and that he and his wife \\"cleaned the potties on Sundays and we did everything we could for the station and the community.\\" Although the station group reported a $10,000 profit for June 2010, the creditor took action when the broadcaster failed to promptly make payroll tax payments. Control of the stations was given to Virginia-based Bob Woodward, acting as receiver, with the goal of paying off \\"as much of its debt as possible\\". In August 2011, sister stations KBYR (700 AM) and KMBQ-FM (99.7 FM) plus FM translators K203BY and K261AO were sold by Woodward, as receiver for Spirit of Alaska Broadcasting, Inc., to Ohana Media Group, LLC, for a reported $1.227 million. As KMBQ (1430 AM) was not part of this transaction, the licensee requested a new call sign for the station and it was assigned \\"KWAP\\" by the FCC on October 28, 2011. Falling silent In August 2010, the station's transmitter facility was damaged, taking the station dark from the 15th until the damage was repaired and normal operation resumed on August 20. The station fell silent again on December 29, 2010, but temporary measures returned them to the air a few days later. However, in February 2011, KMBQ notified the FCC that \\"technical issues impeding normal operations\\" had again taken the station dark on January 23, 2011. The station's licensee reported that \\"dangerous ice and snow conditions immediately surrounding the transmitter site\\" prevented them from accessing the site to inspect or repair the equipment. The station's silence continued through the spring and summer, prompting the FCC to grant the station special temporary authority on October 12, 2011, to remain silent through no later than January 23, 2012. As a matter of law, if any U.S. broadcast station remains silent for a full year then its license is subject to automatic forfeiture and cancellation by the FCC. The station resumed regular broadcasting on November 22, 2011. Broadcast license After construction and testing were completed and with normal broadcast operations under program test authority continuing, the station applied for its broadcast license on January 10, 2012. The FCC granted the station its license on January 27, 2012. The station changed its call sign to KKNI on January 22, 2014. Launch of dance format On April 4, 2016, KKNI operated its own automation and studio providing an in house classic rock format. The Wasilla station was a clone of KKNI-FM in Sterling AK but was not a simulcast. The station switched from the classic rock-format to dance, branded as \\"K Hitz 107 FM\\" (simulcast on FM translator K296FP 107.1 FM Willow Creek, Alaska). Effective May 2, 2016, Alaska Multimedia, LLC acquired KKNI and K296FP for $225,800. The station changed its call sign to the current KVHZ on January 18, 2017.

He and an accomplice were shot dead in an ambush by FBI agents in downtown Bangor, Maine, in 1937. The spectacular public gun-battle that led to the demise of \\"The Brady Gang\\" is an essential part of Maine history, and was even the subject of a re-enactment in 2007. Biography Al Brady lost his father at age 2, his mother at age 16 and his stepfather at age 18. Two months after his stepfather's death he committed his first robbery, in Indianapolis, Indiana, in which he was shot and wounded. On release from jail, he teamed up with Clarence Lee Shaffer Jr., James Dalhover, and Charles Geisking. The gang stole cars and committed armed robberies across Indiana, mostly of grocery stores. They eventually murdered a 23-year-old Indianapolis store clerk, and then Indianapolis policeman Richard Rivers.Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial ‚Äì Indianapolis Police Officer Richard Rivers The gang was also suspected of killing a policeman in Anderson, Indiana, in 1935.Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial ‚Äì Anderson Patrol Officer Frank M. Levy The four were captured in 1936, but Brady, Dalhover, and Shaffer escaped from a jail in Greenfield, Indiana, and then robbed a bank in Goodland, Indiana, in May 1937. In fleeing the robbery, they managed to ambush and kill one of their pursuers, Indiana State Police trooper Paul Minneman,Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial ‚Äì Indiana State Trooper Paul Vincent Minneman and severely injure another. The gang then relocated, first to Baltimore, then to Bridgeport, Connecticut, and eventually to Bangor, Maine. In Bangor, Maine Marker in Bangor, Maine, where Al Brady was killed by FBI agents. The four arrived in Bangor, having accumulated about $5,000 from their spree of robberies. Brady believed Maine to be an easy place to procure large numbers of guns and amounts of ammunition without suspicion, because of the extensive hunting in the area. Relaxing their guard in Bangor, the trio began negotiating the purchase of Thompson submachine guns at the downtown Dakin's Sporting Goods Store. On September 21, 1937, they first approached the store. Brady asked the owner, Everett Hurd, for 500 rounds of .30-caliber ammunition. One of the party took out a large roll of money in large bills, which drew the suspicion of the owner. Hurd contacted the police after taking their order and telling them to return in a few weeks. When the three later returned to pick up the guns, on October 12, 1937, a large number of FBI agents were waiting in ambush, inside the store and across the street. Dalhover entered Dakin's alone and was apprehended after a scuffle. Brady and Shaffer drew their weapons in the street and were shot down in a furious exchange. Photographs of their bullet-ridden bodies lying dead in the middle of Central Street became iconic local images, and long hung behind the counter at Dakin's. In the photographs, a large crowd of people is shown gathered. Coincidentally, it was Columbus Day, and celebrants had already thronged the streets before the shooting began. Brady and Shaffer were killed by FBI agent Walter Walsh, who had been badly wounded, but survived, and lived to be the FBI's oldest retired special agent. Dalhover was convicted in Indiana under federal statutes for the bank robbery in Goodland and the murder of the state trooper. He was executed by electrocution on November 18, 1938, at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Indiana. With no living relatives, Brady's body went unclaimed, and he was buried in an unmarked grave at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor. In 2007 the grave was finally marked with a stone and a brief religious ceremony conducted, in conjunction with a re-enactment of the shoot- out in Bangor's downtown.

Matlock Town 2005 Northern Premier League Controversy NPL meeting The end of this season saw Spennymoor United fail to fulfil nine of their league fixtures after folding. The Northern Premier League's Board of Directors met on 24 April 2005 to consider how these unplayed games would be treated in the fairest possible manner to all Premier Division member clubs. At this meeting it was decided to expunge the record of Spennymoor United from the table. Subsequent to this meeting the member clubs of Gateshead, Radcliffe Borough, Hyde United and Workington appealed to the Football Association (the FA) against the decision.Chaotic finale to Unibond season One of the grounds of appeal was that the meeting did not have a quorum and the FA recommended that the Northern Premier League withdraw their decision to expunge the record of Spennymoor United from the table and for the issue to be considered by a meeting that had a quorum. Second board meeting At the emergency board meeting held on 1 May 2005, the Board of the Northern Premier Football League confirmed their decision to expunge Spennymoor United's playing record. This meeting came a day after the final day of the Northern Premier League Premier Division season where Workington had finished in first place, Hyde United in second (having played 41 games to Workington and Farsley's 42) and Farsley in third. The confirmation to expunge Spennymoor United's playing record then saw Farsley finish in first place, Hyde United finish in second and Workington finish in third. Gateshead, Hyde United, Radcliffe Borough and Workington followed up their appeal to the FA and on 4 May 2005 the FA overturned the Northern Premier League Board's decision to expunge the playing record of Spennymoor United. The FA ruled that the Northern Premier League was bound by an undertaking, duly minuted at its management committee meeting in January 2005, that Spennymoor United would not be expelled, nor its record for the season expunged. The FA decided that Spennymoor United‚Äôs playing record would re-instated into the league records and, in addition, three points would be awarded to other teams for each game outstanding against Spennymoor United, although no goals for or against will be allocated. Hyde United were one of the teams awarded three points which awarded them the 2004‚Äì05 Northern Premier League Premier Division Championship. Farsley Celtic celebrated winning the Championship on the last day of the season, ignoring the fact that the original meeting on 24 April 2005 did not have a quorum however, as a result of the new overruling finished third in the table. Burscough, who had slipped from fifth to sixth, and out of the final promotion playoff place, thanks to Prescot Cables being awarded six points due to their two unplayed games against Spennymoor United, were aggrieved by this decision and, on 11 May 2005, attempted to get the FA to go to arbitration. This was rejected outright by the FA, and so Farsley Celtic and Burscough attempted to get the FA Appeal Board decision on 4 May overturned by the High Court of Justice in London on 12 May 2005. Conclusive finding On 13 May 2005 the FA and the Northern Premier League confirmed that Hyde United were the champions of the Northern Premier League Premier Division, and were presented with the trophy at their end of season party by Northern Premier League Chairman, Duncan Bayley. Workington, who had finished first on the last day of the season having played a game more than Hyde United, were promoted along with Hyde United having beaten Farsley Celtic in a penalty shootout in the play-off final.Unibond League play-offs go ahead  References   External links  * Unibond Football League 2004‚Äì05 Tables * Northern Premier League Tables at RSSSF Category:Northern Premier League seasons 7 ","title":"2004‚Äì05 Northern Premier League"},{"id":"17686791","text":"Edsel Ford was the son of Henry Ford and president of Ford Motor Company.

Toronto Star, (1947, June 4) page 31Camp Channel Background The camp was founded in 1946 by Aubrey and Marjorie Rhamey and operated from its location on Big Doe Lake for more than 50 years. Big Doe Camp was an accredited member of the Ontario Camping Association and the Canadian Camping Association by its affiliation with the Ontario Camping Association.Trent University Archives - Ontario Camping Association Fonds The summer camping season at Big Doe was broken down into sessions where campers could attend for two, four, or six weeks at a time. Big Doe often hosted other entities such as sports camps or religious camps during the last two weeks of August in which groups would come in to use the facilities after the regular camping season had concluded. The Camp was operated for more than merely commercial purposes. Aubrey and Marjorie aimed to break even every summer, though quite often they didn't even do that. It was a family tradition, family run operation about giving something back to the community and watching the boys' grow into young men.Generations of boys were changed by Big Doe Lake camp. Toronto Star (1975, April 1) Page E1 During the prime years of operation, Aubrey and Marjorie Rhamey had a tough time trying to keep a balance between bringing in new younger campers and allowing the older campers to keep returning every year. They just didn't have the space for everyone that wanted to attend and were at times forced to turn boys away. But even with that pressure, they also kept a few spaces for boys from the Children's Aid Society who were allowed to attend camp for free. These boys were never grouped together, singled out, or identified.  Program & Activities  The camp program consisted of three periods of assigned programs in the morning and two period of optional in the afternoon. Due to the number of camp activities which revolved around the water swimming was a core program and all campers had swimming as one of their assigned programs during one of the morning periods to receive swimming lessons. Camp Activities included: Swimming, Fishing, Sailing, Canoeing, Campcraft, Water Skiing, Wakeboarding, Nature Lore, Horseback Riding, Archery, Arts and Crafts, Riflery (Shooting) and numerous sports including: Badminton, Volleyball, Basketball, Soccer, Football, Baseball, Rugby, Street Hockey, Tennis, and more.Camp Channel - Big Doe Camp  Football Camp  Football camps were held at Big Doe beginning in 1949 and ran for many years. The football camps were a brainchild of Argo's professional football player and U of T sports hall of fame member Ted Toogood and former North Toronto Collegeiate coach Bob Coulter. In 1955 the football camp attracted 52 Toronto High School students and a couple of out of towners all trying to get into shape and prepare for the upcoming football season. Camp founder Aubrey Rhamey was himself head grid coach of the Malvern Collegiate football team at the time. There were very few if any football camps operating at the time and this was considered very much needed as the time to get the boys into shape and the start of the football season only a couple of weeks into the start of the school year was very short. The boys attending the camp were not from any one school but came from Lawrence Park, Bloor, UTS, East York, Downsview, Malvern, Scarborough, Vaughn Road and Forest Hill as well as a few out of towners from Brantford, Brampton, and Kirkland Lake.Special Grid Tuition for High School Lads. Toronto Daily Star (1955, August 27) Page 15 Among the notable alumni of the football camps is Dr. Murray Brown, a retired professor at Dalhousie University, who attended Big Doe for a football camp in the summer of 1953.and bayne Norrie a two year veteran of the camp who later went on to a half of fame career at queens and 8 years including a grey cup with the Eskimos.Polio Survivors of Nova Scotia Newsletter  Canoe Tripping  The camp also operated a small canoe tripping program in which most campers got out on a canoe trip every summer. For beginners at Camp they lasted 1 or 2 nights, for the more experienced Campers up to 10 or more days. Some trips went to far off places such as Lake Temagami, Northern Quebec, James Bay, Algonquin Park, and Georgian Bay. Common trips for boys with beginner to intermediate skill level included: * The Big Doe - An overnight in which the boys spend the day paddling around and camping on Big Doe Lake. * The Mag - A trip lasting 3 days starting at Camp and heading down the Magnetawan River through Burk's Falls and Lake Cecebe and ending at the historic Village of Magnetawan. * The Ahmic - a trip following the same route at the Mag but lasting 4 days and travelling farther to the end Ahmic Lake.  Competition  Competitions and challenges always existed at camp and were a regular tradition. Competitions existed in Swimming, Running, and Portaging among others. Some of the Competitions Included: * The Mile Swim - just that a mile long swim across the lake * The Kilometre Race - a kilometre long running race * The Portage Race - a kilometre long run portaging a canoe. * The Canoe Regatta * The Swim Meet  Following Closure  Following the closing of the camp, many of the camps cabins, buildings, docks, canoes, and sailboats were auctioned off. Today the main lodge of the camp where the dining hall and main office was located remains and was used as a cottage by the family until its sale in 2018.

The programming was done by Pax Softnica. The game takes place in a sci-fi setting instead of a fantasy world. The characters were designed by Go Nagai, who also drew the illustrations for the game's package. The game's background music was composed by Yukihiro Takahashi. Takahashi included an arranged version of Yellow Magic Orchestra's \\"Rydeen\\" as the battle theme. Plot In the year 2300, the human race created an Earth federation government and spread out into space to begin colonizing the surrounding planets. However, an alien species from the far reaches of outer space began attacking the human forces, putting the very survival of the human race at stake. Though it was only a matter of time before Earth fell to the enormous power of the enemy forces, the Earth's army commander issued an order calling all of the units dispersed around the colonized planets to return to Earth. The player takes the role of a young soldier who was stationed with the Rayieza unit on the planet Mars. The journey begins as he makes his way back to Earth along with the other members of his unit. Characters ; :The main character's default name is Kenshiro. He was originally stationed in Mars, but lost most of his comrades in the battle against the aliens and makes his way back to Earth with the only other surviving member, Blue. ; :Blue is the only other surviving member of the Rayieza force, which was decimated by in a battle against the alien forces. He is an expert user of ESP, and he can sense dead souls remaining in the world. His appearance differs completely in the Family Computer version of the game. ; :Rimi is a girl discovered in a cold sleep state in a capsule recovered in the space station (the moon level in the Family Computer version). She decides to assist the Rayieza unit by communicating with them from Earth. ; :Mio is the computer program that manages the Rayieza unit's operations. Ginga no Sannin (Family Computer version) The Family Computer port of the game was released on December 15, 1987. Though the game is largely a faithful port of the PC version, some arrangements were made, such as the addition of a side-scrolling screen when the player lands on a planet's surface, or Rimi being able to use psychic powers. During the later parts of the game, enemies begin to appear very frequently, and new enemy special attacks were added which can lower the maximum hit-points of allied characters (lowered points return the next time the character's level increases). Game designer Makoto Kuba stated in an interview that the name was changed due to trademark issues. He also stated that Nintendo may have published the game so that Enix would not have to be associated with a \\"low-quality\\" game.

By the middle of the 3rd century, there were several churches organized in Roman Gaul, and soon after the cessation of persecution the bishops of the Latin world assembled at Arles, in AD 314. The Church of Gaul passed through three dogmatic crises in the late Roman period, Arianism, Priscillianism and Pelagianism. Under Merovingian rule, a number of \\"Frankish synods\\" were held, marking a particularly Germanic development in the Western Church. A model for the following Frankish synods was set by Clovis I, who organized the First Council of Orl√©ans (511). Establishment of Christianity in Gaul The first mention of Christianity in the context of Roman Gaul dates to AD 177 and the persecution in Lyon,Lejay, Paul. \\"Christian Gaul.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 Aug. 2020 the religious center of Roman Gaul where the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls was located. The forty-eight martyrs at Lyon (ancient Lugdunum, \\"citadel of Lugus,\\" the so-called Gallic Mercury) represented every rank of Gallo-Roman society. Among them were Vettius Epagathus, an aristocrat; the physician Attalus of Pergamus, of the professional class; from the Church, Saint Pothinus Bishop of Lyon, with the neophyte Maturus and the deacon Sanctus; and the young slaves Blandina. Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"St. Blandina.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. and Ponticus. The sole account of the persecution is a letter preserved by Eusebius,Historia Ecclesiastica, V, i-iv. from the Christians of Lyon and Vienne, the latter still known then as Vienna Allobrogum and the capital of the continental Celtic Allobroges. The letter is considered one the gems of Christian literature. It implies that the Church of Lyons was the only organized church in Gaul at the time. That of Vienne appears to have been dependent on it and, to judge from similar cases, was probably administered by a deacon. How or where Christianity first gained a foothold in Gaul is purely a matter of conjecture. The firm establishment of Christianity in Gaul was undoubtedly due to missionaries from Asia. Saint Pothinus was a disciple of St. Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, as was also his successor, Irenaeus. Most likely the first missionaries came by sea, touched at Marseilles, and progressed up the river Rh√¥ne till they established the religion at Lyon, the metropolis and centre of communication for the whole country. The Christians of the community in Lyon and Vienne were \\"predominantly of eastern background\\"Behr, John. \\"Gaul\\", Cambridge History of Christianity: Volume 1, Origins to Constantine, (Margaret M. Mitchell, Frances M. Young, K. Scott Bowie, eds.) Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 371 and maintained closed ties with the community in Rome. Eusebius speaks of letters written by the Churches of Gaul of which Irenaeus is bishop.Hist. Eccl., V, xxiii. These letters were written on the occasion of the second event which brought the Church of Gaul into prominence. Easter was not celebrated on the same day in all Christian communities; towards the end of the 2nd century Pope Victor wished to universalize the Roman usage and excommunicated the Churches of Asia Minor which were Quartodeciman. Irenaeus intervened to restore peace. About the same time, in an inscription found at Autun (ancient Augustodunum, the capital of the Celtic Aedui), a certain Pectorius celebrated in Greek verse the Ichthys or fish, symbol of the Eucharist.See also Roman Catholic Diocese of Autun: History. A third event in which the bishops of Gaul appear is the Novatian controversy. Bishop Faustinus of Lyon and other colleagues in Gaul are mentioned in 254 by St. CyprianEp. lxviii. as opposed to Novatian, whereas Marcianus of Arles was favourable to him. Local legends A series of local legends trace back the foundation of the principal sees to the Apostles. Early in the 6th century, Caesarius of Arles disregards anachronism in making the first Bishop of Vaison, Daphnus, a disciple of the Apostles, even though his signature appears at the Council of Arles in 314.Lejay, Paul. Le r√¥le th√©ologique de C√©saire d'Arles, p. 5. One hundred years earlier one of his predecessors, Patrocles, based various claims of his Church on the fact that St. Trophimus, founder of the Church of Arles, was a disciple of the Apostles. Such claims were flattering to local vanity; during the Middle Ages and over the centuries many legends grew up in support of them. The evangelization of Gaul has often been attributed to missionaries sent from Rome by St. Clement. This theory inspired a whole series of fallacious narratives and forgeries that complicate and obscure the historical record. Gregory of Tours More faith can be placed in a statement of Gregory of Tours in his Historia Francorum (I, xxviii), on which was based the second group of narratives concerning the evangelisation of Gaul. According to him, in the year 250 Rome sent seven bishops, who founded as many churches in Gaul: Gatianus the Church of Tours, Trophimus that of Arles, Paul that of Narbonne, Saturninus that of Toulouse, Denis that of Paris, Stremonius (Austremonius) that of Auvergne (Clermont), and Martialis that of Limoges. Gregory's statement has been accepted with some reservations by historians. Nevertheless, even though Gregory, a late successor of Gatianus, may have had access to information on the beginnings of his church, but an interval of three hundred years separates him from the events he chronicles; moreover, this statement of his involves some serious chronological difficulties, of which he was himself aware, e. g. in the case of the bishops of Paris. The most we can say for him is that he echoes a contemporary tradition, which represents the general point of view of the 6th century rather than the facts. It is impossible to say how much legend is mingled with the reality. Extent of Christian belief By the middle of the 3rd century, as St. Cyprian bears witness, there were several churches organized in Gaul. They suffered little from the great persecution. Constantius Chlorus, the father of Constantine, was not hostile to Christianity, and soon after the cessation of persecution the bishops of the Latin world assembled at Arles (314). Their signatures, which are still extant, prove that the following sees were then in existence: *diocese of Vienne, *diocese of Marseilles, *diocese of Arles, *diocese of Orange, *diocese of Vaison, *diocese of Apt, *diocese of Nice, *diocese of Lyon, *diocese of Autun, *diocese of Cologne, *diocese of Trier, *diocese of Reims, *diocese of Rouen, *diocese of Bordeaux, *diocese of Gabali,I.e. diocese of G√©vaudan; later in the diocese of Mende. and *diocese of Eauze. Also: *diocese of Toulouse, *diocese of Narbonne, *diocese of Clermont, *diocese of Bourges, and *diocese of Paris. This date marks the beginning of a new era in the history of the Church of Gaul. The towns had been early won over to the new Faith; the work of evangelization was now extended and continued during the 4th and 5th centuries. The cultured classes, however, long remained faithful to the old traditions. Teacher and humanist Ausonius was a Christian, but gives so little evidence of it that the fact has been questioned. His pupil Paulinus entered the religious life, at which, however, the world of letters was deeply scandalized; so much so, indeed, that Paulinus had to write to Ausonius to justify himself. At the same period there were pagan rhetoricians who celebrated in the schools, as at Autun, the virtues and deeds of the Christian emperors. By the close of the 5th century, however, the majority of scholars in Gaul were Christians. Generation by generation the change came about. Salvianus, the fiery apologist (died c. 492), was the son of pagan parents. Hilary of Poitiers, Sulpicius Severus (the Christian Sallust), Paulinus of Nola, and Sidonius Apollinaris strove to reconcile the Church and the world of letters. Sidonius himself is not altogether free from suggestions of paganism handed down by tradition. In Gaul as elsewhere the question arose as to whether the Gospel could really adapt itself to literary culture. With the inroads of the barbarians the discussion came to an end. It is nonetheless true that throughout the Empire the progress of Christianity had been made chiefly in the cities. The country-places were yet strongholds of what the Christians viewed as idolatry, which in Gaul was upheld by a twofold tradition. The old Gallic religion, and Graeco-Roman paganism, still had ardent supporters. Among the Gallo-Roman population the use of spells and charms for the cure of sickness, or on the occasion of a death, was still commonplace; the people worshiped spirits in springs and trees, believed in other nature spirits such as the Graeco-Roman nymphs, observed days of solar and lunar significance as sacred, and practiced divination. Some of these customs were survivals of very ancient traditions; they had come down through the Celtic and the Roman period, and had no doubt at times received the imprint of the Gallic and Graeco-Roman beliefs. The Gallic folk beliefs and practices dated back into the obscurity of pre-Roman times. These forms of spirituality were the principal obstacle encountered by the missionaries in the rural places. Saint Martin, a native of Pannonia, Bishop of Tours, and founder of monasteries, undertook especially in Central Gaul a crusade against this rural idolatry. On one occasion, when he was felling a sacred tree in the neighbourhood of Autun, a peasant attacked him, and he had an almost miraculous escape. Besides Saint Martin other popular preachers traversed the rural districts, e.g. Victricius, Bishop of Rouen, another converted soldier, also Martin's disciples, especially Saint Martin of Brives. But their scattered and intermittent efforts made no lasting effect on the minds of the peasants. About 395 a Gallic rhetorician depicts a scene in which peasants discuss the mortality among their flocks. One of them boasts the virtue of the sign of the cross, \\"the sign of that God Who alone is worshipped in the large cities\\" (Riese, Anthologia Latina, no. 893, v. 105). This expression, however, is too strong, for at that very period a single church sufficed for the Christian population of Trier. Nevertheless, the rural parts continued the more refractory. At the beginning of the 5th century, there took place in the neighbourhood of Autun the procession of Cybele's chariot to bless the harvest. In the 6th century, in the city of Arles, one of the regions where Christianity had gained its earliest and strongest foothold, Bishop Caesarius was still struggling against popular superstitions, and some of his sermons are yet among our important sources of information on folk-lore. Gallic monasticism The Christianization of the lower classes of the people was greatly aided by the newly established monasteries. In Gaul as elsewhere the first Christian ascetics lived in the world and kept their personal freedom. The practice of religious life in common was introduced by Saint Martin (died c. 397) and Cassian (died c. 435). Martin established near Tours the \\"grand monast√®re\\", i.e. Marmoutier, where in the beginning the monks lived in separate grottoes or wooden huts. A little later Cassian founded two monasteries at Marseilles (415). He had previously visited the monks of the East, and especially Egypt, and had brought back their methods, which he adapted to the circumstances of Gallo-Roman life. Through two of his works \\"De institutis coenobiorum\\" and the \\"Collationes XXIV\\", he became the doctor of Gallic asceticism. About the same time Honoratus founded a famous monastery on the little isle of L√©rins (Lerinum) near Marseilles destined to become a centre of Christian life and ecclesiastical influence. Episcopal sees of Gaul were often objects of competition and greed, and were rapidly becoming the property of certain aristocratic families, all of whose representatives in the episcopate were not as wise and upright as Germanus of Auxerre or Sidonius Apollinaris. L√©rins took up the work of reforming the episcopate, and placed many of its own sons at the head of dioceses: Honoratus, Hilary, and Caesarius at Arles; Eucherius at Lyons, and his sons Salonius and Veranius at Geneva and Vence respectively; Lupus at Troyes; Maximus and Faustus at Riez. L√©rins too became a school of mysticism and theology and spread its religious ideas far and wide by useful works on dogma, polemics, and hagiography. Other monasteries were founded in Gaul, e.g. Grigny near Vienne, Ile Barbe at Lyons, R√©om√© (later known as Moutier-Saint-Jean), Morvan, Saint-Claude in the Jura, Chinon, Loches etc. It is possible, however, that some of these foundations belong to the succeeding period. The monks had not yet begun to live according to any fixed and codified rule. For such written constitutions we must await the time of Caesarius of Arles. Monasticism was not established without opposition. Rutilius Namatianus, a pagan, denounced the monks of L√©rins as a brood of night-owls; even the effort to make chastity the central virtue of Christianity met with much resistance, and the adversaries of Priscillian in particular were imbued with this hostility to a certain degree. It was also one of the objections raised by Vigilantius of Calagurris, the Spanish priest whom St. Jerome denounced so vigorously. Vigilantius had spent much time in Gaul and seems to have died there. The law of ecclesiastical celibacy was less stringent, less generally enforced than in Italy, especially Rome. The series of Gallic councils before the Merovingian epoch bear witness at once to the undecided state of discipline at the time, and also to the continual striving after some fixed disciplinary code. Theological strife The Church of Gaul passed through three dogmatic crises. Its bishops seem to have been greatly preoccupied with Arianism; as a rule they clung to the teaching of the Council of Nicaea, in spite of a few temporary or partial defections. Athanasius, who had been exiled to Trier (336-38), exerted a powerful influence on the episcopate of Gaul; one of the great champions of orthodoxy in the West was Hilary of Poitiers, who also suffered exile for his constancy. Priscillianism had a greater hold on the masses of the faithful. It was above all a method, an ideal of Christian life, which appealed to all, even to women. It was condemned (380) at the Synod of Saragossa where the Bishops of Bordeaux and Agen were present; nonetheless it spread rapidly in Central Gaul, Eauze in particular being a stronghold. When in 385 the usurper Maximus put Priscillian and his friends to death, Saint Martin was in doubt how to act, but repudiated with horror communion with the bishops who had condemned the unfortunates. Priscillianism, indeed, was more or less bound up with the cause of asceticism in general. Finally the bishops and monks of Gaul were long divided over Pelagianism. Proculus, Bishop of Marseille, had obliged Leporius, a disciple of Pelagius, to leave Gaul, but it was not long before Marseille and L√©rins, led by Cassian, Vincent and Faustus, became hotbeds of a teaching opposed to St. Augustine's and known as Semipelagianism. Prosper of Aquitaine wrote against it, and was obliged to take refuge at Rome. It was not until the beginning of the 6th century that the teaching of Augustine triumphed, when a monk of L√©rins, Caesarius of Arles, a follower of Augustine, caused it to be adopted by the Council of Orange (529). In the final struggle Rome intervened. We do not know much concerning the earlier relations between the bishops of Gaul and the pope. The position of Irenaeus in the Easter Controversy shows a considerable degree of independence; yet Irenaeus proclaimed the primacy of the See of Rome, which he based on the Apostolic Succession and, equally importantly, right teaching, orthodoxy (whereas the Gnostics whom he opposed were mere itinerant preachers without authority). About the middle of the 3rd century the pope was appealed to for the purpose of settling difficulties in the Church of Gaul and to remove an erring bishop (Cyprian, Epist. lxviii). At the Council of Arles (314) the bishops of Gaul were present with those of Brittany, Spain, Africa, even Italy; Pope Sylvester sent delegates to represent him. It was in a way a Council of the West. During all that century, however, the episcopate of Gaul had no head, and the bishops grouped themselves according to the ties of friendship or locality. Metropolitans did not exist as yet, and when advice was needed Milan was consulted. \\"The traditional authority\\", says Duchesne, \\"in all matters of discipline remained always the ancient Church of Rome; in practice, however, the Council of Milan decided in case of conflict.\\" The popes then took the situation in hand, and in 417 Pope Zosimus made Patrocles, Bishop of Arles, his vicar or delegate in Gaul, and provided that all disputes should be referred to him. Moreover, no Gallic ecclesiastic could have access to the pope without testimonial letters from the Bishop of Aries. This primacy of Aries waxed and waned under the succeeding popes. It enjoyed a final period of brilliancy, under Caesarius, but after his time it conferred on the occupant merely an honorary title. In consequence, however, of the extensive authority of Arles in the 5th and 6th centuries, canonical discipline was more rapidly developed there, and the \\"Libri canonum\\" that were soon in vogue in Southern Gaul were modelled on those of the Church of Aries. Towards the end of this period Caesarius assisted at a series of councils, thus obtaining a certain recognition as legislator for the Merovingian Church. The invasions The barbarians, however, were on the march. The great invasion of 407 across the Rhine disrupted Gaul for almost 3 years until they passed over into Spain in September or October 409. Gaul was free of invaders but subjected to civil wars between imperial contenders until 413, when the imperial government of Emperor Honorius restored order. The Visigoths left Italy in 411 and settled in southwest Gaul and northeast Spain until finally being settled in a swatch of territory from Toulouse to the Atlantic coast north of Bordeaux in 416. The Visigoths were Arians and hostile to Catholicism. Gradually the necessities of life imposed a policy of moderation. The Council of Agde, really a national council of Visigothic Gaul (506), and in which Caesarius was dominant, is an evidence of the new temper on both sides. The Acts of this council follow very closely the principles laid down in the Breviarium Alarici‚Äîa summary of the Theodocian Code drawn up by Alaric II, the Visigothic king, for his Gallo- Roman subjects‚Äîand met with the approval of the Catholic bishops of his kingdom. Between 410 and 413 the Burgundians had settled near Mains and were settled in Savoy in 443. In 475 they moved farther south along the Rh√¥ne, and about this time became Arian Christians. The Franks, soon to be masters of all Gaul, left the neighbourhood of Tournai, defeated Syagrius, the last representative of Roman authority in central north Gaul, in 486, and extended their power to the Loire. In 507 they defeated the Visigoth Kingdom in the Battle of Vouill√©, confining their domain to Spain, except for a strip of territory along the Mediterranean coast. In 534 the Burgundians were defeated; in 536 by the conquest of Arles they succeeded to the remnants of the great state created by King Theodoric the Great. The transition from one regime to another was eased by the bishops of Gaul. The bishops had frequently played a role as intermediaries with the Roman authorities. It was long believed that they had been invested with special powers and the official title of defensores civitatum (defenders of the states). While this title was never officially borne by them, the popular error was only formal and superficial. Bishops like Sidonius Apollinaris, Avitus, Germanus of Auxerre, Caesarius of Arles, upheld the social fabric. The bishops were guardians of the classical traditions of Latin literature and Roman culture, and long before the appearance of monasticism had been the mainstay of learning. Christianity in Merovingian Gaul Throughout the 6th and 7th centuries manuscripts of the Bible and the Church were copied to meet the needs of public worship, ecclesiastical teaching, and Catholic life. The only contemporary buildings that exhibit traces of classical or Byzantine styles are religious edifices. Regional synods had been held regularly in the Church of Gaul, more than thirty of them between 314 and 506.Halfond, Gregory I. (2009). Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, AD 511-768. p. 2. Under Merovingian rule, a number of \\"Frankish synods\\" were held, marking a particularly Germanic development in the Western Church: to the usual regional or provincial councils, Germanic peoples added a traditional element from their systems of government, the idea of a national council, which was influenced by the Christian East. They also indicate a growing congruence between church and state. While Arian rulers kept their distance from the general councils, Visigoth rulers began influencing the councils only after the conversion of Reccared I. As soon as they had established themselves, Merovingian kings (and the Carolingians after them) exerted their influence on the councils.Rahner, Karl (1975). Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi, 301f. According to Gregory Halfond, such congruence was a particular quality of the Gallo-Roman church, in which the Roman aristocracy made up an important part of the leadership of the Gallo-Roman (and later the Frankish) church; continuity in this power nexus is indicated also by the continued use of Roman procedures in the councils.Halfond, Gregory I. (2009). Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, AD 511-768, pp. 4-6. An early important churchman is Caesarius of Arles, who organized regional synods, which were mostly concerned with conforming the canons and practices of the Church of Gaul to those of other Churches. At Orange, for instance, he had earlier (Pelagian) practices of the Gallic church anathematized, and at the ensuing council in Vaison liturgical conformity with other Churches (Italy, Africa, the East) was established.Markus 155-56. A model for the following Frankish synods was set by Clovis I, who organized the First Council of Orl√©ans (511); though he did not himself attend it, he set the agenda and followed the proceedings closely (at stake was \\"the unification of the Roman church under Frankish rule\\").Halfond, Gregory I. (2009). Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, AD 511-768, pp. 8f. After the waning of Caesarius's influence and the establishment of Merovingian rule, the focus of the soon-to-be Frankish Church shifted north, to deal with the growing problem of adjusting to \\"deeply embedded Germanic practices\\"; rather than Pelagianism or Predestinatarianism, bishops now had to deal with problems involving \\"marriage, the relations between a warrior aristocracy and clergy, or monks and nuns, the conflicts born of royal influence and control, or of property rights\\". By the eighth century, the regular organization of synods had largely disappeared, and when Boniface complained to Pope Zacharias in 742 that there hadn't been a synod in the Frankish church in at least eighty years, he was not exaggerating by much.Hartmann 59.Schuler, Matthias (1947). \\"Zum 1200j√§hr.

It is situated in the valley of the river Essonne between Corbeil and La Fert√©-Alais, on the territory of an old Templar commandery. It is built on the ruins of a 15th-century feudal castle, and is a rare collection of two 18th- century ch√¢teaux facing each other at the entrance to a Romantic park surrounded by water. Inside, their reception rooms evoke the lives of their inhabitants. History The property of Olivier Le Daim, barber to the French kings from Louis XI to Louis XV, the ch√¢teau was burned by the Spanish during the Wars of Religion. The owner obtained permission from Henry IV by letters patent to surround the ch√¢teau with water. He then rebuilt the ch√¢teau in the brick-and-stone style. The property of Me de Gaumont, a member of parliament, it was handed down by the women of the Bragelongne family, by Canclaux and finally Colbert at the start of the 19th century. In 1735 a pavilion - identical in appearance to the original ch√¢teau - was built facing it, to give the appearance (surviving to this day) of two ch√¢teaux opening onto a park. Just before the French Revolution, the entry building and raised bridge were demolished and replaced with two elegant pavilions in the style of the architect Nicolas Ledoux (end of the 18th century). In the 19th century the Colberts doubled the size of the main pavilion and endowed the ch√¢teau with a magnificent library. At the start of the 20th century, the ch√¢teau passed to the Bourbon Busset family, and the park was redesigned by the great landscape artist Achille Duch√™ne, joining the charm of parks in the English style with classical harmony of gardens in the French style. His redesigned park was made up of three perspectives, several water features, and lawns framed with topiary or planted with rare trees. The acad√©micien Jacques de Bourbon Busset lived in this ch√¢teau, where his children, grandchildren and great- grandchildren still live today.

The originally intended opening movement of the suite, Contrastes, instead became the closing movement of the fantasia. Both works were also intended initially as more mainstream compositions than they became; the fantasia was intended as a piano concerto, while the suite was conceived as a symphony. The suite's first performance was in Saint Petersburg, Russia on January 24, 1885, under the direction of Hans von B√ºlow. It was dedicated to the conductor Max Erdmannsd√∂rfer, who gave the Moscow premiere a few days later, and who had conducted the premieres of the first two suites.  Instrumentation  The Orchestral Suite No. 3 calls for: 3 flutes (one of them piccolo), 2 oboes, 1 English horn, 2 clarinets (in A), 2 bassoons, 4 horns (in F), 2 trumpets (in F and D), 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, side drum, tambourine, triangle, cymbals, bass drum, harp and strings (violins 1 & 2, violas, celli, double basses). Form The suite is divided into four movements, the fourth a theme and variations longer than the other three movements combined: I) √âl√©gie (Andantino molto cantabile, G major) : Wiley calls this movement \\"resolutely melodic.\\" A change from B to B-flat \\"produces tension in the misalignment of theme and key,\\" he comments. The first theme group returns in the key of the second, then to a bridge. He then returns to the home key and reprises the second theme group in the key of the first and follows it with a lengthy epilogue.Wiley, 276. II) Valse m√©lancolique (Allegro moderato, E minor) : Wiley contends that while Tchaikovsky referred to this movement as the \\"obligatory waltz number,\\" it is not typical of his work in this vein. The somber character of the opening theme is exceptional and the syncopated second subject much like that in the scherzo. Wiley adds, \\"The unusual periodicity in long, uneven spans is acharacteristic, as is the formal pattern, a tripratite reprise that also mimics the scherzo. The unwaltz-like result, sustained for 100 bars, is enigmatic. Abbreviating the reprise makes the Trio even more striking.\\"Wiley, 274, 276. III) Scherzo (Presto, E minor) : The opening theme of this movement, Wiley writes, is similar to its counterpart in the Second Suite. The constant shift of timbral combinations and the tempo make this music, alternating between 6/8 and 2/4, a challenge for the orchestra. Tchaikovsky \\"plays with emphasis throughout,\\" Wiley adds, \\"sometimes enriching the tonic triad with the addition of the sixth, creating a chord with the pitches of both chords simultaneously, and so creates a merging of G major and E minor.\\" The orchestration of the Trio section, a march, includes snare drum and triangle.Wiley, 273-4. IV) Tema con variazioni (Andante con moto, G major) : 1. Andante con moto, 2/4 : 2. Andante con moto, 2/4 : 3. Andante con moto, 2/4 : 4. Pochissimo meno animato, B minor : 5. Allegro vivo, 3/4, G major : 6. Allegro vivace, 6/8, G major : 7. L'istesso tempo, 2/4, G major : 8. Adagio, 3/4, A minor (closing in E major) : 9. Allegro molto vivace, 2/4, A major :10. Allegro vivo e un poco rubato, 3/8, B minor :11. Moderato mosso, 4/4, B major :12. Finale. Polacca--Moderato maestoso e brillante, 3/4, G major Composition \\"I meant to write a symphony, but the title is of no importance\\", Tchaikovsky wrote Sergei Taneyev.Quoted in Warrack, 161. When he had gone to the Davidov family estate at Kamenka in the Ukraine, he had contemplated ideas for a piano concerto and a symphony. Neither plan really materialized the way the composer intended. He quickly recognized his ideas for the symphony were better suited for an orchestral suite like the two he had previously written. The problem lay with the opening movement. Titled Contrastes, it was to be a fantasia of contrasting musical sounds and patterns, not unlike the Jeu de sons movement that opened the Second Orchestral Suite. The more he worked with the music, the more recalcitrant the music became and the more he hated it. Contrastes finally found its way into the Concert Fantasia.Warrack, 180. Tchaikovsky's original layout for the Third Suite was similar to that of his Second--a fairly large opening movement as in his first two orchestral suites, then three smaller ones and a theme-and-variations finale.Brown, Wandering, 267. The developments that Contrastes underwent, while good for the Concert Fantasia, left the suite unbalanced, with three small-scale movements followed by a theme-and-variations movement as large as all three previous movements placed together. Even without Contrastes, the suite remains a long work. Wiley writes that Tchaikovsky composed the scherzo first. The theme-and-variation finale came last, beginning with the concluding polonaise. This, he says, might have helped the composer clarify his strategy in pacing the movement and guiding its overall momentum. He also links the theme of the finale to the other movements: \\"its opening chord is presented as a triad with added sixth, [which he used for the scherzo immediately preceding it] and, like the [opening] Elegie, the movement is resolutely melodic.\\" Wiley also says the quality of Prelest' (meaning \\"charming\\" or \\"pleasing\\") in the Third Suite \\"is too prominent for a symphony, while at the same time the suite's coherence advances well beyond the casual miscellency of the Second.\\" This continuity, he suggests, \\"casts doubt on the freedom he so cherished when writing the First Suite six years earlier.\\" The Third Suite, Wiley adds, is also much darker music in tone than in the two suites that preceded it.Wiley, 277. In the fourth variation (pochissimo meno animato, B minor) of the fourth movement, a quotation of the Dies Irae theme is distinctly heard.http://www.victoryvinny.com/svr_and_di/RachmaninovandDiesIrae- Version04.pdf, page 10 Reception Tchaikovsky believed the public would appreciate the new suite; of the reception at its premiere, he wrote to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck six days after the event that \\"reality far exceeded my expectations. I have never before experienced such a triumph. I saw that then entire mass of the audience was moved, and grateful to me. These moments are the finest adornment of the artist's life. Thanks to these it is worth living and laboring.\\"Quoted in Brown, Wandering, 268. The composer's brother Modest later claimed it was the greatest public triumph up to that point for a Russian symphonic work. The press was uniformly favorable, with the composer's friend Herman Laroche declaring Tchaikovsky's music the true music of the future.Brown, Wandering, 268. Tchaikovsky's first two orchestral suites had also been received very warmly by the public and the critics, but the composer had not attended either of their premieres. Laroche's comment can serve as a useful reminder that what may now sound conventional was taken at the time it was written as something very fresh and original. Tchaikovsky does not plumb any new emotional depths in this work, but his level of invention is at its most inspired. The Third Suite most notably explores further the melodic and orchestral possibilities exposed in its two predecessors as well as for Tchaikovsky's return to large-scale variation form. The final movement, Tema con variazioni, is a wonderful example of the composer's creative genius and it is a locus classicus of scoring. During Tchaikovsky's lifetime it was not uncommon for him to be asked to perform this finale without the rest of the suite, such was its universal popularity; and the finale alone has been performed numerous times since.

This is a list of jazz violinists who have become notable. Jazz violin is the use of the violin or electric violin to improvise solo lines. The earliest references to jazz performance using the violin as a solo instrument was during the first decades of the 20th century. Early jazz violinists included Eddie South, who played violin with Jimmy Wade's Dixielanders in Chicago; Stuff Smith; Claude \\"Fiddler\\" Williams, who played with Andy Kirk and his Twelve Clouds of Joy. Joe Venuti was best known for his work with guitarist Eddie Lang during the 1920s. Georgie Stoll was a jazz violinist who became an orchestra leader and film music director. Since that time there have been many superb improvising violinists including Noel Pointer, St√©phane Grappelli, and Jean-Luc Ponty. While not primarily jazz violinists, Darol Anger, Adam Taubitz and Mark O'Connor have spent significant parts of their careers playing jazz, while emerging artists like Scott Tixier and Jeremy Kittel have devoted themselves almost exclusively to jazz both modern and traditional. Violins also appear in string ensembles or big bands supplying orchestral backgrounds to many jazz recordings. Lately also extensive academic research on jazz violin has been conducted and published.

While first excavations were started after the second half of the 19th century, the significance of some of the findings was not realized until 1969. The most significant finding was a small ivory statue called the L√∂wenmensch, which is one of the oldest pieces of figurative art ever found. The name of the cliff is derived from a combination of Hohlenstein meaning \\"hollow rock\\" and Stadel meaning \\"barn\\". The Hohlenstein cliffs are made of limestone which was hollowed out by natural causes to create caves. The Stadel is one of three caves in the area that are of important paleontological and archaeological significance. The other two are Die kleine Scheuer (Small barn) and the B√§renh√∂hle (Bears' cave). In 2017 the site became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura\\". Excavations The first excavations at Hohlenstein were made in 1861 by Oskar Fraas, geologist and paleontologist, who was searching for Cave bear bones at the B√§renh√∂hle and the Stadel. He returned in 1866, realizing the archeological importance of the site. In 1935, archaeologists returned to excavate the cave. An initial trial dig under Robert Wetzel was followed by further work in 1936. Between 1937 and 1939 further excavations were conducted directed by Wetzel and Otto V√∂lzing, a geologist. On the very last day of digging, on 25 August 1939, V√∂lzing found a large number of broken pieces of ivory. They were little noted and went into storage at the Museum Ulm. It was not until 1969 that Joachim Hahn came across the more than 200 pieces and assembled them into a 31 cm tall figurine of a humanoid with a lion's head. This is now known as the L√∂wenmensch, at 35,000 to 40,000 years old qualifying as one of the oldest pieces of figurative art ever discovered. Further excavations followed in 1956 and 1957, and between 1959 and 1961. The stratigraphy includes layers from the Neolithic, Mesolithic, Upper Paleolithic, notably the Magdalenian and the Aurignacian periods and finally the Middle Paleolithic. More work followed in 1996 and 1997, when a dig led by Nicholas Conard, Michael Bolus and Andrew Kandel was conducted in the valley in front of the caves. Interior excavation was resumed in 2008 to 2013 by the Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege Baden-W√ºrttemberg. This work, led by Thomas Beutelspacher and C.J. Kind managed to locate the exact spot in which the Lion-man had been discovered and to find numerous additional ivory splinters that were found to fit onto the figurine. Dating of bones found immediately next to them yielded an age of 35,000 to 41,000 years. Archaeogenetics On August 27, 1937, excavators discovered the right femur diaphysis, measuring around in length, of an archaic hominin in the cave. The femur came from a layer associated with Middle Paleolithic Mousterian artefacts. This femur represents the only archaic hominin fossil found in a Mousterian context within the entire Swabian Jura region. Attempts to radiocarbon date the femur have yielded inconsistent results; however, molecular dating suggests that the femur is roughly 124,000 years old. In 2017, researchers successfully sequenced the full mtDNA genome from the femur. The results confirmed that the femur belonged to a Neanderthal. The mtDNA from the Hohlenstein-Stadel sample is highly divergent from those of other available Neanderthal samples. The addition of this mtDNA sample itself results in a near doubling of the genetic diversity of available Neanderthal mtDNA using Watterson's estimator theta; this suggests that Neanderthal mtDNA diversity was higher than previously presumed. Researchers estimate that the Hohlenstein-Stadel mtDNA diverged from other Neanderthal lineages around 270,000 years ago. 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. UNESCO World Heritage Site In January 2016, the federal government of Germany applied for the status of World Heritage Site for two valleys with six caves named H√∂hlen der √§ltesten Eiszeitkunst (\\"Caves with the oldest Ice Age art\\"). The site would encompass areas in the Lonetal (valley of the Lone) and the Achtal (valley of the Ach) both in the southern Swabian Jura. The former includes the caves Hohlenstein-Stadel, Vogelherd and Bocksteinh√∂hle, the latter Geissenkl√∂sterle, Hohle Fels and Sirgenstein Cave. Each valley would contain a core area of around length, surrounded by a buffer zone of a least width. In the argument why these sites deserve recognition as a part of the universal human heritage, the area is described as the source of the currently oldest (non-stationary) works of human art in the form of carved animal and humanoid figurines as well as the oldest musical instruments. Their creators lived, were inspired and worked in and around these caves. The caves also served as the repositories of the figurines which may have been used in a religious context. In addition, they were the venue where performers used the excavated musical instruments and where the social groups lived from which the artists sprang. The committee awarded the status of WHS in July 2017.

It was built in 1928 as the new main headhouse (entrance building) for the previously-opened Harvard Square subway station. After the station closed in 1981 for major renovations, the kiosk was moved slightly and renovated. The Out of Town News newsstand, which opened in 1955, occupied the kiosk from 1984 to 2019. , the City of Cambridge (which owns the structure) plans to convert it for public use. History Subway entrance The original 1912-built headhouse, which was demolished in 1927 A 1930s postcard of Harvard Square with the headhouse at center foreground After debate about running an elevated rapid transit line above business districts in Cambridge, the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) agreed in late 1906 to build a subway line from Boston to Harvard Square. Construction began on May 24, 1909. The Cambridge subway opened from Harvard Square to Park Street Under on March 23, 1912. Early plans called for an upright stone entrance (headhouse) in the center of Harvard Square, similar to those at Scollay Square and Adams Square. The headhouse was ultimately constructed as a oval-shaped brick-and-stone structure, with several smaller entrances and exits around the Square. Although originally considered a worthy addition to the Square, the headhouse attracted criticism beginning in 1919. Its size meant that motorists could not see traffic approaching on other streets, and it left no room for sidewalks where passengers could wait for streetcars. In 1921, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) determined that it would not be feasible to completely replace the central headhouse with smaller headhouses located elsewhere in the Square. The DPU was not opposed to Cambridge constructing a smaller headhouse structure, but would not allow the state or the BERy to bear the costs. MIT civil engineering professor Charles B. Breed completed a study of the headhouse in February 1925, concluding that the headhouse could be reduced to 20% of its original size at a cost of $20,000 (). Breed proposed to have the structure cover only the exit escalator and one of the two stairwells; the remaining stairwell would be covered with a hatch and only used on high-demand days. On April 30, 1925, the state legislature authorized the DPU to modify the headhouse at a cost up to $30,000. Cambridge was to pay half the cost; the state would loan the BERy the remaining half. That July, the DPU viewed models of Breed's proposal, as well as a larger proposal by the BERy that kept both stairwells. Public reaction to Breed's utilitarian design was \\"swift and overwhelmingly negative\\"; one state representative likened it to an outhouse. In November 1925, architect Clarence H. Blackall began advising the DPU on the headhouse design. Blackhall's design was eventually approved by the Cambridge City Council in February 1927, and the BERy began engineering work that February. The DPU awarded a $15,950 construction contraction on October 21, 1927; work began in November and was completed in January 1928. Despite his previous prominence as an architect, the contribution of Blackhall's firm (Blackall, Clapp & Whittemore) was largely ignored in the press. The new headhouse measured , covered by a roof measuring about . It was divided into two pavilions: the south section around the exit stairwell and the north section around the entrance stairwell, with an exit escalator and a pedestrian passage between them. The structure was of industrial style, though it fit in with the Colonial Revival architecture of Harvard Square. The pavilions were each supported by steel pillars clad in limestone and brick salvaged from the old headhouse. Three sides of each had low walls, with wire glass above to allow visibility through the structure for motorists. The thin copper roof was shaped as intersecting barrel vaults, with flat rectangles at the corners. The \\"artistic appearance\\" of the new structure was favorably compared to the former \\"pillbox\\". At some point within the next decade, internally-illuminated signs reading \\"HARVARD SQUARE\\" were added inside the arches. Rooftop signs reading \\"Rapid Transit to All Points/Eight Minutes to Park Street\\" were added in the 1940s. The city again considered relocating the headhouse in 1944, but found the $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) cost too high. In 1962, the MTA (successor to the BERy) proposed to relocate the station southward into Bennett Yard, with the kiosk and buses removed from the Square. However, by this time, the kiosk was beginning to be recognized as a significant symbol of the Square; in the mid-1960s, architecture critic Ian Nairn called it \\"an urban epigram in a tiny space... probably the most important space in Harvard.\\" The 1964-formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) renamed the Harvard‚ÄìAshmont subway line as the Red Line in 1967. Among the MBTA's expansion projects was a long-proposed northwest extension of the Red Line. Several alignments near Harvard Square were considered; by 1977, the MBTA planned to reroute the line northwards through the Square itself. The wholly reconfigured station would have three smaller headhouses around the Square. That year, the Cambridge Historical Commission nominated the headhouse for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) - a designation which requires mitigation of any adverse effects by federally- or state-funded projects. It was added to the NRHP on January 30, 1978 as \\"Harvard Square Subway Kiosk\\". In August 1977, the MBTA agreed to preserve the structure by dismantling it during construction, then reassembling it for reuse as a newsstand. By 1978, the MBTA planned for the restored kiosk to occupy its original location, with a single new headhouse to the south. Harvard station closed for reconstruction on January 31, 1981. The headhouse was disassembled that February; the copper roof and the brick and limestone of the pillars were placed in storage. The kiosk was included in the Harvard Square Historic District in its 1982 NRHP addition, though it also retained its separation registration. In 1983, ownership of the disassembled kiosk was passed to the City of Cambridge. Out of Town News Circa-1970s postcard of Harvard Square, showing Out of Town News in its former location (dark roof) next to the subway entrance kiosk Out of Town News in 2006 Out of Town News was founded in 1955 by Sheldon Cohen. Cohen operated several other businesses around the square, and was known as the ‚Äúunofficial mayor of Harvard Square\\". Originally located just north of the subway headhouse, the newsstand was long noted for stocking leading newspapers, magazines, and periodicals from around the nation and around the world ‚Äì many of which were flown to Boston to be available just one day after printing. Customers, especially academics, came to get the most recent editions of their hometown paper or of newspapers from parts of the world where important news events were unfolding. The newsstand also became famous for its regular clientele and visitors. John Kenneth Galbraith and Julia Child were both regular customers, and Robert Frost once asked for directions at the stand on the way to a poetry reading. Paul Allen, then a young programmer at Honeywell, bought the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics at Out of Town News. The magazine inspired Allen and his friend Bill Gates to found Microsoft that April. In 1984, Out of Town News moved into the former subway kiosk structure, which had been relocated a few feet north of its original location on June 8. In 1994, Cohen sold Out of Town News to Hudson News, although it kept its name and unique business model. Responding to the 1994 sale, a citizen group submitted a petition to landmark the kiosk, but the Cambridge Historical Committee decided that the lease restrictions on the kiosk were sufficient protections. In 2008, it was announced that the newsstand might go out of business, principally because its unique function of supplying yesterday's newspapers was made obsolete by the ability to read them online. By then, the physical structure also required hundreds of thousands of dollars for repairs. In January 2009, a new owner, Muckey's Corporation, won a bidding competition and signed a lease to take over the newsstand. Muckey's diversified the stand's offering with more typical magazines and convenience store fare, but maintained the original name. In 2013, the city began studying use and possible renovation of Harvard Square, including possibly further restoration or reworking of the kiosk. When the long-term lease expired in January 2016, the city signed a month-to-month lease ending in July 2017, while exploring its options for the space. In August 2016, the city announced plans to convert the structure to a glass- walled public space, despite the lessee's offer to contribute to the renovations if the business could stay. In September 2016, a citizen group again petitioned the Cambridge Historical Commission to designate the kiosk as a protected landmark, which would effectively stop the proposed major renovation. In November 2016, the Cambridge Historical Commission voted in support of proceeding with a landmark study. Out of Town News closed on October 31, 2019. Temporary artwork will be placed in the kiosk until renovation of the building begins, planned for early 2020.

Architecture and design The front of the building The building was constructed at 44 Bow Street not far from Harvard Yard and close to the \\"Gold Coast\\" of residences for undergraduates of Harvard College before the creation of Harvard's \\"house system\\" (some of them now part of Adams House). Designed by Edmund M. Wheelwright, who also oversaw the construction, it was first opened on February 19, 1909. Wheelwright had attended Harvard University and was one of the founders of the Harvard Lampoon. Wheelwright's design was inspired in part by an old church in Jamestown, Virginia, and by the Flemish Renaissance details of Auburn Street buildings in its vicinity. The building has been described as a \\"Satirical Castle\\". During the construction phase of the project he traveled to Europe to procure appropriate furnishings and windows. He purchased leaded windows in Belgium and an Elizabethan mantelpiece in England. The building also features 17th-century Delft tiles that were imported from the Netherlands. The Delft tiles are blue, white, and aubergine. The tiles were used in a room with an open ceiling and plain furniture and timbers. The ground floor features a small entrance and a round library used for editorial meetings. The floor opens up and there is a secret chamber beneath the library (a \\"basement\\") used for \\"secret\\" events. The building features a copper ibis, symbol of the Lampoon, mounted on the top of the dome. The statue is roughly high and weighs roughly . Though it was first installed in 1909, it has frequently been stolen and returned ever since. On one occasion members of The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper and rival of the Lampoon, which issues an annual Crimson parody issue, stole the statue and presented it as a gift to the Russian delegation to the UN. After initially promising to install it on top of a building at Moscow State University, the delegation returned the statue. The building cost approximately $40,000 to construct, making it then the most expensive headquarters of a college newspaper in the United States. After the building was first constructed, it initially hosted a small store on the ground floor in addition to the Harvard Lampoon offices and meeting spaces on the other floors; for years the site housed a used book shop, Starr Books. Reception Barrett Wendell once described the building as \\"sturdily honest as the founder who designed it, yet laughing at every turn with freakish gayety and beauty.\\" However, the building's architecture has been criticized, most notably by former Cambridge mayor Alfred Vellucci. He once described it as \\"one of the ugliest buildings in the world\\" and claimed that \\"it does nothing but scare strangers\\" and \\"looks like a witch on a broomstick.\\" He also noted that the location of the building \\"is an ideal spot for a restroom\\", and once unsuccessfully proposed a city ordinance declaring the building a public urinal. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Foliage Vellucci later clashed with the Harvard Lampoon due to a tree that he planted on city land in front of the building in 1961 in order to block the view of the building. He wished to obscure the face of the building because he found it ugly and to avenge local Italian Americans, whom he believed the Lampoon had insulted by claiming that an Irishman (rather than the Italian Christopher Columbus) discovered America. Vellucci's opposition was also fueled in part by the proposal from members of the Harvard Lampoon to rename a nearby intersection \\"Lampoon Square\\", and by the satirical portraits of Vellucci that they published. During the sixties, seventies, and eighties the tree was routinely vandalized, its branches often chopped off and acid was poured on the tree twice. However, in 1991 the tree was completely chopped down. The Harvard Lampoon refused to confirm or deny involvement in the event and a smaller tree was planted in its place. Three years later the tree was felled on the night of Harvard's commencement. The leadership of the Harvard Lampoon denied any complicity, and suggested that it may have been a false flag operation by members of the Harvard Crimson.

He became a general officer of cavalry during the Napoleonic Wars and fought in a number of major battles under Emperor Napoleon I of France in 1805-1807. He was killed by a long range shot fired by a British rifleman during the Peninsular War in 1809 . Early career Colbert joined the army as a private, but soon became aide-de-camp to Emmanuel Grouchy, then to Joachim Murat and served in the Army of Italy. During the Egyptian campaign, he took part in the Sal√©hieh affair and the Siege of Acre, receiving a serious wound in the latter action. He returned to France with Louis Desaix then went to Italy, where he behaved with distinction at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800. His actions merited the star of the L√©gion d'honneur, granted him on 11 December 1803, and on 25 December 1804, he was made a colonel of the 10th Chasseurs √† cheval Regiment. Napoleonic Wars Colbert distinguished himself at the Battle of Elchingen on 14 October 1805. During the combat, he led the 3rd Hussar and 10th Chasseur Regiments in support of Marshal Michel Ney's attacking infantry.Young 1987, p 377 He also fought at the Battle of Austerlitz in December. Promoted to Brigadier General at the end of 1805, he was given an important mission to St Petersburg by Napoleon, where he was accompanied by his great friend Claude Testot-Ferry, later a colonel in the cavalry of the Imperial Guard. He and Ferry met again in Spain. He married the daughter of senator Canclaux, and they had 2 sons in 1805 and 1808. On 14 October 1806 while commanding the cavalry of Ney's VI Corps, Colbert served at the Battle of Jena, leading several charges of the 3rd Hussar and 10th Chasseur Regiments against enemy infantry.Smith 1998, p 224 Still with VI Corps, he led his troopers at the Battle of Eylau on 8 February 1807Smith 1998, p 241 and the Battle of Friedland on 14 June.Smith 1998, p 249 At this period Ney said of him, \\"I sleep peacefully when Colbert commands my outposts.\\"Young 1987, p 363 Sent to Spain in 1808 to join the Peninsular War, Colbert fought at the Battle of Medina del Rioseco on 14 July 1808 while serving under Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessi√®res. On 23 November, he led his cavalry at the Battle of Tudela under Marshal Jean Lannes.Smith 1998, does not list Colbert at either of the 1808 battles. That winter, he commanded the 3rd Hussars and 15th ChasseursSmith 1998, p 277 in the cavalry advance guard of Marshal Nicolas Soult, who was pursuing Sir John Moore's British army in its retreat to A Coru√±a. Arc de Triomphe. On the Astorga road not far from Villafranca, Colbert's troopers captured 2,000 prisoners and wagon trains carrying rifles, as well as releasing some French troops captured by the British. Later the same day, however, at the Battle of Cacabelos, Irish Rifleman Thomas Plunket, a noted sharpshooter in the 95th Rifles, one of the British units still under effective military discipline, advanced alone towards the French. Plunket killed Colbert with a single long-range rifle shot, then killed an officer who came to Colbert's assistance with a second shot. These shots were likely taken beyond the normal rifle range of 200-300 meters, and well beyond the musket range of 80 meters, so Colbert would not have considered himself close enough to the British rearguard to be in any danger. His last words are : \\"I am still very young to die; but at least my death is that of a soldier of the great army , because, exhaling, I see flee the last and eternal enemies of my country! \\" When Ney learned of his death, he sent an aide to collect his personal effects. He wrote, \\"His wife and child will one day attach value to having what belonged to him. Besides it is the only and final proof of friendship that I could give to this brave young man.\\"Young 1987, pp 363-364 By a decree of 1 January 1810, Napoleon decided that a statue of Colbert should be placed on the pont de la Concorde, though this project never came to fruition. The name COLBERT is engraved on Column 38 on the west face of the Arc de Triomphe. Notes References * * Smith, Digby (1998). The Napoleonic Wars Data Book.

Election ink uses silver nitrate, and excessive exposure can cause argyria. It was first used during the 1962 Indian general election, in Mysore State, now the modern-day state of Karnataka. Application Electoral stain is used as an effective security feature to prevent double voting in elections. Ink is normally applied to the left hand index finger, especially to the cuticle where it is almost impossible to remove quickly. Ink may be applied in a variety of ways, depending on circumstance and preference. The most common methods are via dipping bottles with sponge inserts, bottles with a brush applicators, spray bottles, and marker pens. Composition Electoral stain typically contains a pigment for instant recognition, a silver nitrate which stains the skin on exposure to ultraviolet light, leaving a mark that is impossible to wash off and is only removed as external skin cells are replaced. Industry standard electoral inks contain 10%, 14% or 18% silver nitrate solution, depending on the length of time the mark is required to be visible. Although normally water-based, electoral stains occasionally contain a solvent such as alcohol to allow for faster drying, especially when used with dipping bottles, which may also contain a biocide to ensure bacteria are not transferred from voter to voter. Silver chloride can be easily removed by hydroxides, hence other photosensitive pigmentation needs to be added. Longevity Election stain typically stays on skin for 72‚Äì96 hours, lasting 2 to 4 weeks on the fingernail and cuticle area. The election ink used puts a permanent mark on the cuticle area which disappears only with the growth of new nail. It can take up to 4 months for the stain to be replaced completely by new nail growth. Stain with concentrations of silver nitrate higher than 18% have been found to have no effect on stain longevity, as even with stronger solutions silver nitrate doesn't have a photosensitive reaction on live skin cells. This means that the stain will wear off as new skin grows. Silver nitrate is an irritant and frequently harmful at 25% solution and above, even being used as an effective, if painful, cauterizing agent in the treatment of rhinitis at that concentration. At 25% the silver nitrate content will also start to precipitate depending on conditions, forming fine crystals which can also be irritating on skin and reducing the active dissolved silver nitrate back to as low as 18%. Colour Electoral stain is traditionally violet in colour, before the photosensitive element takes effect to leave a black or brown mark. However, for the 2005 Surinamese legislative election, orange replaced violet as the colour for marking the voters' fingers as it was found to last just as long and be more appealing to voters, as it resembled the national colours. Efficiency Marker pens are the most efficient use of ink, with one 5 ml pen able to mark 600 people, although dipping bottles are often preferred, despite a 100 ml bottle only marking 1000. This may be due to the iconic images associated with the Iraqi and Afghan elections of the early 21st century. Dipping bottles can leave a more comprehensive stain of slightly longer longevity (depending on silver nitrate content) than markers can. However marker pens are much cheaper and easier to transport, reducing costs to the election organisers considerably, and the advised option when stains are only needed to be guaranteed for 3 to 5 days. Marker pens also leave a much smaller mark when properly applied, which is more agreeable to many voters. Controversies In the 2004 Afghan presidential election, allegations of electoral fraud arose around the use of indelible ink stains, which many claimed were easily washed off. Election officials had chosen to use the more efficient marker pen option; however, regular marker pens were also sent out to polling stations, which led to confusion and some people being marked with less permanent ink. In the 2008 Malaysian general election, the election authorities canceled the use of Electoral Stain a week before voters went to the polls, saying it would be unconstitutional to prevent people from voting even if they had already had their fingers stained. Additionally they cited reports of ink being smuggled in from neighboring Thailand in order to mark peoples' fingers before they had a chance to vote, thus denying them their rights. During the 2008 Zimbabwean presidential election, reports surfaced that those who had chosen not to vote were attacked and beaten by government sponsored mobs. The mobs attacked those without ink on their finger. During the 2010 Afghan elections the Taliban delivered night letters threatening to cut off anybody's finger who was marked with indelible ink. During the 2013 Malaysian general election, in light of the first ever implementation of Electoral Stain, voters reported that the ink could be easily washed off with running water, despite assurances by the Election Commission of Malaysia on the contrary.

Hamlet, 113 U.S. 449 (1885), was a bill in equity filed by the appellants, September 3, 1879. Facts The complainants are the administrator de bonis non of Samuel D. Morgan, deceased, and the children and heirs at law and widow of the intestate, citizens of North Carolina. The female defendants are the children and heirs at law of John G. Morgan, deceased, sued with their husbands, and all citizens of Arkansas.Morgan v. Hamlet, 113 U.S. 449 (1885) Justia.com In 1860, a partnership was formed between two brothers, Samuel D. Morgan and John G. Morgan, the former advancing the means, the latter being bankrupt, for stocking and cultivating a cotton plantation in Arkansas, purchased in the name of the firm, but paid for only in part. Samuel D. Morgan continued to reside in North Carolina. John G. Morgan lived on the plantation in Arkansas, and personally conducted its operations. This he did during several years, including the year 1865, when the plantation was sold, under judicial proceedings, to pay the unpaid purchase money. Samuel D. Morgan died in January 1864. John G. Morgan died in 1875, the defendants, his heirs at law, having come into possession of the property in his possession at his decease, more than sufficient to satisfy the claim of the complainants. Of the complainants, Samuel T. Morgan became of age September 8, 1876, and William W. Morgan in May 1878. They never had a guardian, and allege their ignorance of the frauds charged to have been practiced against them by John G. Morgan until in 1879. The answer of the defendants, though admitting the fact of such a partnership as alleged, denies that any profits were made and denies all the allegations of fraud. It also shows that John G. Morgan died in April 1875, leaving him surviving Emma S. Morgan, his widow, and the defendants, Alice R. Hamlet and Emma G. Abell, and Lula Morgan, an infant, his only children; that letters of administration were issued on his estate by the Probate Court of Chicot County, Arkansas, in which he lived at the time of his death, on August 6, 1875, to his widow, who acted as administratrix of his estate until October 13, 1875, when she resigned, and the defendant John C. Hamlet was appointed by the same court administrator de bonis non, and qualified and acted as such. And it is relied on as a defense that the demands made in the bill were not authenticated and presented to the administratrix or the administrator de bonis non of John G. Morgan, deceased, according to law, within two years of the granting of letters of administration on his estate. On final hearing the bill was dismissed. From this decree the complainants brought this appeal. Judgment In Arkansas, it appears that there is a special statute of limitations governing claims against estates of deceased persons, commonly called the \\"Statute of Nonclaim.\\" It is as follows: It has been decided that the statute runs against all creditors, whether resident or nonresident. Erwin v. Turner, 6 Ark. 14. And that all claims fall within the provisions of the statute that are capable of being asserted in a court of law or equity existing at the death of the deceased or coming into existence within two years after the grant of administration, whether due or not, if running to a certain maturity. And the effect of a failure to present the claim as prescribed in the statute is not to let it in against the heirs or devisees, but it is to bar is forever as against all persons. Bennett v. Dawson, 18 Ark. 334; Brearly v. Norris, 23 Ark. 771. In 84 U. S. 530, in a like case, it was held by this Court that the failure to present the claim is, in the absence of circumstances constituting an excuse, fatal to the bill for relief in equity. It is sought in argument on behalf of the appellants to distinguish their case--at least the case of the two infant children of Samuel D. Morgan--from any case within the statute of nonclaim on the ground that at the death of their father, his title to the real estate, which constituted the plantation, descended to them as his heirs at law, and thereafter, as to the operations conducted by John Morgan in 1864 and 1865, having no guardian, the latter was in equity their representative and guardian de son tort and trustee, so that upon his death and until they arrived at age, there was no one competent to make a demand against his administrator, within the terms of the statute. But we are unable to appreciate the force of this supposed distinction. The statute in question contains no exception in favor of claimants under disability of nonage or otherwise; the claim of the complainants against John G. Morgan was adverse to his administrator, although it may have originated in consequence of a relation of trust, and there is no ground that we are able to understand on which it can be excepted out of the operation of the statute in question. Their claim was equally against the administrator of John G. Morgan whether the latter be considered as the defaulting partner of themselves or of their father. Whatever its description, it was a claim against the estate of John G. Morgan, and for which his personal representative was in the first instance liable, and the statute is a bar to every such claim unless presented within the time prescribed. On this ground the decree of the circuit court was affirmed.

Today's BBC Symphony Chorus. Founded in 1928 as the BBC National Chorus, it changed its name to the BBC Chorus in 1932, before changing it again in 1935 to the BBC Choral Society (going on to adopt its current name in 1977). * 2. A 42-strong professional chorus developed in the 1930s. It would perform either alone or with the BBC Choral Society as a \\"choir within a choir\\". It was abolished in 1961 following changes to the BBC's choral structures. * 3. Today's BBC Singers. Founded in 1924 as a 16-strong BBC Wireless Chorus, and formally renamed The BBC Singers in 1935, it was expanded to 28 in 1961 and renamed The BBC Chorus as part of reforms to the BBC's choral set-up. It was then renamed The BBC Singers once more in 1972.  History  Founded in late 1922, the BBC's initial output was heavily music oriented. The General Manager, John Reith, made arrangements with Percy Pitt, musical director of the British National Opera Company, to broadcast operatic performances from the Royal Opera House, and by May 1923 Pitt was on the BBC pay-roll as a part-time musical advisor. Under Pitt's guidance, in-house musical ensembles such as the \\"2LO Dance Band\\", the \\"2LO Military Band\\", the \\"2LO Light Orchestra\\", and the \\"2LO Octette\\" were developed, and the BBC began broadcasting symphony orchestra concerts in the same year. By 1924, the company felt it was in a position to develop its in- house choral output. Stanford Robinson was engaged as chorus master, and he proceeded to form a 16-voice choir, the BBC Wireless Chorus, made up entirely of professional singers, which was called upon to rehearse and perform on-air near daily. A larger choir, the BBC Choir, was developed for bigger works, recording Handel's Messiah in 1927 and Gounod's Faust in 1929-30, both with Thomas Beecham; a vocal octet, the BBC Wireless Singers, was created using Wireless Chorus singers as a semi-separate entity; and in 1928 a full sized symphony chorus was created, named the BBC National Chorus. This last, which recorded Elijah under Stanford Robinson in 1930, was renamed The BBC Chorus in 1932. Significant changes to the BBC's choral set-up came in 1934-5 with the appointment of Leslie Woodgate as the Corporation's chorus master. Under him, three distinct but inter-related choirs were established. The Wireless Chorus, with its sub-group the Wireless Singers, remained a 16-person group, entirely professional, paid a weekly salary, and rehearsing and performing daily; Woodgate however renamed it The BBC Singers, and divided it into Section-A and Section-B, each of 8 people. Section-A specialised in \\"madrigals and modern music\\", and was paid ¬£1 per week more than Section-B, which specialised in light music, \\"part-songs and glee, and other small types\\"; the two sections would sometimes combine in bigger or complex works. Section-B of the BBC Singers also formed the core of the BBC's new mid-sized choir, The BBC Chorus. This was a choir of 42 professional singers, tasked with performing the more complicated choral pieces broadcast by the BBC considered unsuitable for an amateur chorus. The Chorus was sometimes sub-divided into Sections-A, -B, and -C, and also into the BBC Men's Chorus and the BBC Women's Chorus: the Men's Chorus was a popular presence, performing \\"students songs, chanties, and so on\\", with the accompanist Ernest Lush delivering commentary from the piano; the Women's Chorus was less frequently heard, Woodgate on one occasion explaining \\"not many listeners are keen about women's voices over the air\\". Unlike the BBC Singers, the BBC Chorus (and its subdivisions) had fewer performances commitments on the BBC schedules, and so rehearsed less frequently. Its numbers also varied from performance to performance - anywhere between 9 and the full 42 might be required in any performance, and its numbers were occasionally augmented. The BBC Chorus, in turn, served as a core section of what was now to be called The BBC Choral Society (the former BBC Chorus). This choir was made up of 250 people- all amateurs, excepting the 42 professionals of the BBC Chorus, who acted as a semi-chorus where required, and supported the amateurs in challenging works. The Choral Society was the main performer in symphony concerts, and was admired for its capabilities in tackling modern music. Besides its work within the BBC Choral Society, the BBC Chorus between 1935 and 1961 established a presence in broadcasts and in the recording studio as a creditable chorus in its own right, performing both with BBC orchestras and outside groups. Notable recordings include the broadcast premiere of Ralph Vaughan Williams Dona Nobis Pacem under the composer, and Delius' Sea Drift under Thomas Beecham. The death of Leslie Woodgate in 1961 brought significant changes to the BBC's music department. His replacement Peter Gellhorn abolished the 42-member BBC Chorus; the BBC Singers were renamed the BBC Chorus, their subdivisions scrapped, and their numbers brought up from 16 to 28. The BBC Choral Society became an entirely amateur body, although the new BBC Chorus would sometimes perform alongside it in concerts. The newly named BBC Chorus, significantly larger than the old BBC Singers, and sometimes augmented in numbers, was able to take on the mantel of its predecessor to a certain extent. Significant recordings would include the Faure Requiem under Nadia Boulanger and the Bach Mass in B Minor under Otto Klemperer. However, it reverted to its old name of the BBC Singers in 1972. Following this, the BBC Choral Society was in 1977 renamed the BBC Symphony Chorus.

The arms of this family are decreed in the \\"Armorial G√©n√©ral de France\\". After the death of his great-uncle and godfather, Jean-Claude Testot-Ferry, knight of the order of Saint-Louis and captain in the Grenadiers Royaux, Claude Testot joined the name of Ferry to his own. This addition was confirmed by a royal ordinance of 17 January 1815. Military career In 1789, he signed on as a volunteer in the 10e r√©giment de chasseur √† cheval. In 1791 Mesdames Victoire and Ad√©la√Ødes de France, daughters of Louis XV (and thus aunts of Louis XVI), passed Arnay- le-Duc on their way to Italy and the town's inhabitants turned out to protest against their emigration and imprisoned and insulted them in a very confined space for eleven days. Claude Testot-Ferry, then a sous-officier in the 10e R√©giment de Chasseurs √† Cheval and dressed his uniform, climbed on a wall and greeted them in an ostentatiously respectful and courteous manner. This courageous act was admired by the crowd; the \\"prisoners\\" were won over by this young man and offered him an audience to propose he accompany them on their trip. It was with the 10e r√©giment de chasseur √† cheval that he distinguished himself at the Battle of Valmy in 1792 and participated in the Italian campaign of 1795. In 1797, he became a Sous-lieutenant, under the orders of general Mass√©na and until 1800 served in the Arm√©e du Rhin. In 1803, he left for Russia as a young lieutenant with his friend Colonel Auguste Fran√ßois- Marie de Colbert-Chabanais on a diplomatic mission. On Colbert-Chabanais's recommendation, he became a captain and aide de camp of general Marmont, whose career he followed as far as Spain and then again from the Restoration. Testot-Ferry and Marmont became great friends and were buried in the same cemetery, the cimeti√®re Saint-Vorles in Ch√¢tillon-sur-Seine. In 1805, Testot- Ferry distinguished himself at the battle of Reifling(Austria), where he captured a whole Austrian battalion (450 soldiers and 19 officers). In 1807, he fought at the battle of Castel Nuovo (Albania) On 3 March 1808, having strongly impressed Napoleon on their first meeting, Napoleon personally named Claude Testot-Ferry chef d'escadron, and he set out to join the 13e Cuirassiers for the Peninsular War. In that campaign he recovered general Auguste Fran√ßois-Marie de Colbert-Chabanais's body shortly after his death, and distinguished himself at the siege of Saragossa. In 1811 Napoleon summoned him to join the regiment of dragoons in the Imperial Guard, known as the \\"Empress's Dragoons\\", at the rank of major. In 1813, he was put in command of the 3rd squadron of the Old Guard at the battle of Leipzig, then the 2nd squadron at the battle of Hanau. At Hanau he received 22 sabre and lance cuts before safely reaching the rear to have his wounds treated. On this campaign he was promoted to colonel, then Colonel-Major in 1813, and took command of the 1er R√©giment des Eclaireurs de la Garde Imp√©riale, with whom he served throughout the campaign in France in 1814. (The dolman worn by him as a colonel-major in the 1er r√©giment des √©claireurs is now held at the mus√©e de l'Arm√©e in the ch√¢teau de l'Emp√©ri at Salon de Provence, as part of the famous Raoul & Jean Brunon collection). His deeds at Craonne are accounted his bravest. In effect, the regiment he was commanding was charged with clearing the plateaus of the Russian batteries located on the heights. Unfortunately, the cavalry found itself entirely routed by the Russian infantry but Testot- Ferry, saving the situation, reorganised his troops and led another charge within sight of Marshal Ney and Napoleon. This charge succeeded in clearing away the Russian batteries and Testot-Ferry was made a baron by Napoleon on the field of battle. However, he was taken prisoner two weeks later at the battle of Arcis-sur-Aube but succeeded in escaping and rejoined his regiment at Sens. During the Hundred Days, Colonel Testot-Ferry was made first aide de camp of Marshal Marmont and in March 1815 escorted king Louis XVIII as far as the frontier on his way to exile in Ghent. Following Marmont's tracks, in 1817 he participated in the organisation of the Garde Royale and the king made him Colonel in the Corps Royal d'√âtat-Major. In 1826, under Charles X, he retired at the rank of Mar√©chal de Camp (equivalent of G√©n√©ral de Brigade). Aged around 70, he was one of only two officers of the army of the First Empire ever to be photographed, in a daguerr√©otype, since the end of his life coincided with Daguerre's invention of this format in 1835. Analysis Rejecting political intrigues, G√©n√©ral Baron Testot-Ferry distinguished himself on the field of battle - seriously wounded on several occasions and several times remarked upon by Napoleon - and was faithful to his oaths under all regimes in one of the most troubled periods of French history, with one of his mottoes being il vaut mieux m√©riter sans obtenir, qu'obtenir sans m√©riter (\\"it is better to deserve without gain, than gain without deserving\\").

About the Jubilee Centre  The Jubilee Centre was founded in 1983 by Michael Schluter to explore the continued relevance for modern societies of the biblical social vision. Characterised by its concern for right relationships - and applied to areas as diverse as debt and the economy, criminal justice, care for the elderly, asylum and immigration, the environment, and sexual ethics - this relational agenda led to the publication in 2005 of the charity's comprehensive 'Jubilee Manifesto: a framework, agenda and strategy for Christian social reform' (see Books by the Jubilee Centre, below). It also produces the quarterly Cambridge Papers, an influential collection of peer-reviewed studies on contemporary issues. Inspired by the example of Christian reformers such as William Wilberforce, the Jubilee Centre's work led to the launch in 1985 of the now independent Keep Sunday Special campaign, which was instrumental in bringing about Margaret Thatcher's first and only defeat in the Commons. Its work later gave rise to a number of other organisations involved in social reform, including Credit Action, the Relationships Foundation and the international peace-building charity Concordis International. Most recently, it launched the informal Fair Sex Movement, which seeks to promote a greater awareness of the personal, social and economic consequences of sexual relationships. A number of groups are now drawing upon the experience and expertise of the Jubilee Centre to establish similar organisations internationally in countries as diverse as Singapore, Kenya, and the US. The Jubilee Centre is a British registered charity (No. 288783), financed by private donations.

It is currently developed by Fidelity National Information Services (hereafter FIS).  History  PSL is a language that implements object orientated concepts such as classes, methods, encapsulation, inheritance, and strong data typing as extensions to the MUMPS language. PSL was initially conceived in December 1998 by Frank Sanchez, then President of Sanchez Computer Associates, as a transformation tool that could reverse engineer a very large and complex banking application (Fidelity National Information Services 'Profile') which was written predominantly in MUMPS. Frank Sanchez developed the original language semantics, syntax, parser, compiler and optimizer, database interface, schema binding, intrinsic classes and methods over the Christmas holiday in 1998 and early 1999. He was assisted in the development of the initial commercial releases (version 1 - 2) by the late Bob Chiang, the Head of Data-Qwik tool development at Sanchez, and Mark Spier, a Senior Software Developer with Sanchez at the time. Sanchez Computer Associates (SCAI) was acquired by Fidelity National Financial (FNF), now FIS, in April 2004. In later versions the compiler has been maintained and significantly enhanced by Frans Witte, a Senior Technical Lead at FIS, and Dan Russell, formerly the Head of Technology Development at Sanchez and now a remote Senior Technical consultant to FIS. Frans and Dan have focused on implementing the database independent features of the language, and more recently the Java source target code.  Language concepts  The initial language concepts included the ability to bind the source code to a database schema which generates dynamic Data Access Classes (preempting similar persistent class generation in Java) and database methods that could be code generated into either MUMPS globals or a commercial RDMS. The PSL Data Access Classes are identified in the source code as Record. PSL interprets legacy MUMPS code, though some legacy commands (such as GO, NEW and KILL) can be disabled or marked as deprecated (generating compiler warnings). Direct references to MUMPS globals can also be disabled or deprecated. Numerous PSL compiler directives (e.g., #IF/#ELSE, #ACCEPT) were also added to the PSL language, as were Java style blocks and comments, modern error handling semantics and white space. Two MUMPS language elements were eliminated initially (M-style blocks and goto label+offset) as they could not be supported within the PSL object scope handling. PSL allows a Class to be defined as either Intrinsic or Extrinsic. Extrinsic classes implement Class, Method and Instance variable definitions consistent with common OO languages, and are generated into compiled code (accessed at runtime). Intrinsic Classes and methods, on the other hand are implemented as extensions to the PSL compiler itself, and are executed at COMPILE time in order to generate runtime code. This feature can generate heavily optimized or specialized code depending on compile time or program conditions. This capability was considered to be critical to the ability to generate code that optimized both a MUMPS global database and multiple commercial RDMS's from the same PSL source.  Releases  The initial release of PSL (originally called M++) was in the summer of 1999, as part of the Profile version 6.2. In that release, less than 5% of the MUMPS code was converted to PSL, though new development was predominantly in PSL source code and analysis for widespread reverse engineering was underway. The Profile application conversion from MUMPS to PSL was 100% completed in 2006, with the release of Profile version 7.0. Profile version 7.0 was also the first commercial version of the application that could be targeted to run on either a GT.M MUMPS database or an Oracle 9 database, with GT.M MUMPS source code as the PSL target. Currently PSL is continuing to be actively enhanced to support IBM DB2 as a target database and to optionally generate either GT.M MUMPS or Java target code from the same PSL source code. Furthermore, PSL is supported by a modern Eclipse-based development environment, with integrated schema and code management and numerous interactive plug-ins. Jim Joyce, a senior R&D; Developer at FIS has been responsible for much of the IDE vision and development.  Uses  As of June, 2011, PSL remains the source code language for the FIS Profile banking system, deployed in 26 countries and over 200 institutions, including some of the world‚Äôs largest banks. While Java and commercial RDMS deployments are possible in the future, today 100% of the deployments are on the GT.M MUMPS target language and database, with the exception of a single Oracle DBMS deployment.

Plot Willy Loman returns home exhausted after a canceled business trip. Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car crash, his wife Linda suggests that he asks his boss Howard Wagner to allow him to work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda that their son Biff, who is visiting, has yet to make good on his life. Despite Biff's promise as an athlete in high school, he flunked senior year math and never went to college. Willy is prone to frequent flashbacks in which he sees events and figures from his past, such as his long-deceased older brother Ben, Willy's idol. Unable to distinguish between his memories and present-day reality, he speaks to the people in his flashbacks as if they were real, startling those around him. Biff and his brother Happy, who is also visiting, discuss their father's mental degradation while reminiscing about their childhood together. When Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything, Biff and Happy tell Willy that Biff plans to make a business proposition the next day in an effort to pacify their father. The next day, Willy goes to ask Howard for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but neither are successful. Willy gets angry and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him that he needs a rest and can no longer represent the company. Biff waits hours to see a former employer who does not remember him and turns him down. Biff impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the office of his neighbor, Charley, where he runs into Charley's son Bernard (now a successful lawyer). Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to do well in summer school to salvage his academic and athletic career after flunking math, but when Biff made an emergency trip to Boston to seek help from Willy, who was then on a sales trip, something occurred there that changed Biff's mind. Happy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear bad news from Biff. Happy tries to get Biff to lie to their father. Biff tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him. Willy had been in a hotel on a sales trip with a young woman named Miss Francis when Biff unexpectedly arrived and realized that Willy was cheating on Linda. From that moment, Biff's view of his father and all of his father's cherished hopes and dreams for him changed irrevocably, setting Biff adrift. Biff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls, Miss Forsythe and Letta, that Happy has picked up. They leave a confused and upset Willy behind in the restaurant. When they later return home, their mother angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains talking to himself outside. Biff goes outside to try to reconcile with Willy. The discussion quickly escalates into another argument, at which point Biff forcefully tries to convey to his father that he is not meant for anything great, that he is simply ordinary, insisting that they both are. The feud culminates with Biff hugging Willy and crying as he tries to get him to let go of the unrealistic dreams that he still carries for Biff and wants instead for Willy to accept him for who he really is. He tells his father he loves him. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy realizes that his son has forgiven him and thinks that Biff will now pursue a career as a businessman. Willy‚Äîwith encouragement from Ben, whom he \\"sees\\" and speaks to in one of his flashbacks‚Äîkills himself by intentionally crashing his car so that Biff can use the life insurance money to start his business. However, at the funeral, Biff retains his belief that he does not want to become a businessman. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father's footsteps. Cast * William \\"Willy\\" Loman (Dustin Hoffman): A self-deluded traveling salesman. He is 63 years old and very unstable and insecure, tending to imagine events from the past as if they are real.

His first name, Willy, reflects this childlike aspect as well as sounding like the question \\"Will he?\\" His last name gives the feel of Willy being a \\"low man,\\" someone low on the social ladder and unlikely to succeed. * Linda Loman (Kate Reid): Willy's loyal and loving wife. Linda mostly just smiles and nods when Willy talks unrealistically about hopes for the future, although she seems to have a good knowledge of what is really going on. She berates her sons, particularly Happy, for not helping Willy more, and supports Willy lovingly, despite the fact that Willy sometimes ignores her opinion over that of others. She is the first to realize Willy is contemplating suicide at the beginning of the play and urges Biff to make something of himself, while expecting Happy to help Biff do so. * Biff Loman (John Malkovich): Willy's older son. Biff was a football star with much potential in high school, but failed math his senior year and dropped out of summer school due to seeing Willy with another woman while visiting him in Boston - a shock which completely disillusioned him about the father he formerly loved and idolized. He goes between going home to try to fulfill Willy's dream for him to be a businessman and ignoring his father and going out West to be a farmhand where he is happiest. He likes being outdoors and working with his hands yet wants to do something worthwhile, so Willy will be proud. Biff steals because he wants evidence of success, even if it is false evidence, but overall Biff remains a realist, and informs Willy that he is just a normal guy and will not be a great man. * Harold \\"Happy\\" Loman (Stephen Lang): Willy's younger son. He has lived in the shadow of his older brother Biff most of his life and seems to be almost ignored, but he still tries to be supportive towards his family. He has a very restless lifestyle as a womanizer and dreams of moving beyond his current job as an assistant to the assistant buyer at the local store but is unfortunately willing to cheat a little in order to do so, by taking bribes. He is a smooth, fast-talking liar, as shown by the tall tales he tells the two girls in the restaurant in order to impress them. He is always looking for approval from his parents but rarely gets any, and he even goes as far as to make things up just for attention, such as telling his parents he is going to get married. He tries often to keep his family's perceptions of each other positive or \\"happy\\" by defending each of them during their many arguments but still has the most turbulent relationship with Linda, who looks down on him for his lifestyle and apparent cheapness, despite him giving them small sums of money. * Charley (Charles Durning): Willy's wisecracking yet understanding neighbor. He pities Willy and frequently lends him money and comes over to play cards with Willy, although Willy often treats him poorly. Willy is jealous of him because his son is more successful than Willy's. Charley offers Willy a job many times when visiting him, yet Willy declines every time, even after he loses his job as a salesman. * Bernard (David S. Chandler): Charley's son. In Willy's flashbacks, he is a nerd, and Willy forces him to give Biff test answers. He worships Biff and does anything for him. Later, he is a very successful lawyer, married, and expecting a second son. * Ben Loman (Louis Zorich): Willy's older brother who became a diamond tycoon after a detour to Africa. He is dead but Willy frequently speaks to him in his hallucinations of the past. He went into the jungle when he was 17 and returned at 21 very rich. He is Willy's role model, although he is much older and has no real relationship with Willy. He represents Willy's idea of the American Dream success story, and is shown coming by the Lomans' house while on a business trip to share his stories. Willy tries to impress him with his own largely-imagined success as a salesman, but Ben is skeptical of any kind of intangible \\"wealth\\" that can't be held in one's hand, such as a diamond. Ben later appears to Willy in another flashback and (Willy thinks) encourages his wild scheme to kill himself to get the insurance money that Biff can inherit. * Woman from Boston (Kathryn Rossetter, as Kathy Rossetter): A woman with whom Willy cheated on Linda. * Howard Wagner (Jon Polito): Willy's considerably younger boss, who inherited leadership of his company from his now-deceased father, Frank, Willy's friend and original boss. Willy, who was already working for Frank when Howard was born, claims he was responsible for choosing the name Howard. Yet he only sees the aging Willy as a liability for the company and lets him go, ignoring the 35 years that Willy has given to the company. Howard is extremely proud of his wealth, which is manifested in his recording machine, and his family. * Jenny (Anne McIntosh): Charley's secretary. * Stanley (Tom Signorelli): A waiter at the restaurant who seems to be friends or acquainted with Happy. * Miss Forsythe (Linda Kozlowski): A girl whom Happy picks up at the restaurant. She is very pretty and claims that she was on several magazine covers. Happy lies to her, making himself and Biff look like they are important and successful (Happy claims that he attended West Point and that Biff is a star football player). * Letta (Karen Needle): Miss Forsythe's friend. * Waiter (Michael Quinlan) Reception The film received critical acclaim. On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an overall 100% approval rating based on 8 reviews, with a rating average of 8.4 out of 10. Style The film is mostly told from the point of view of the protagonist, Willy, and the previous parts of Willy's life are revealed in the analepsis, sometimes during a present-day scene. It does this by having a scene begin in the present time, and adding characters onto the screen whom only Willy can see and hear, representing characters and conversations from other times and places. Many dramatic techniques are also used to represent these time shifts. For example, leaves often appear around the current setting (representing the leaves of the two elm trees which were situated next to the house, prior to the development of the apartment blocks). Biff and Happy are dressed in high school football sweaters and are accompanied with the \\"gay music of the boys\\". The characters will also be allowed to pass through the walls that are impassable in the present, as told in Miller's original stage directions in the opening of ACT 1, \\"Whenever the action is in the present the actors observe the imaginary wall-lines, entering the house only through its door at the left. But in the scenes of the past these boundaries are broken and characters enter or leave a room by stepping 'through' a wall onto the fore-stage.\\" However some of these time shifts/imaginings occur when there are present characters on-screen. For example, during a conversation between Willy and his neighbor Charley, Willy's brother Ben comes on screen and begins talking to Willy while Charley speaks to Willy. When Willy begins talking to his brother, the other characters do not understand to whom he is talking, and some of them even begin to suspect that he has \\"lost it.\\" However, at times it breaks away from Willy's point of view and focuses on the other characters: Linda, Biff, and Happy. During these parts of the film, the time and place stay constant without any abrupt flashbacks that usually happen while the play takes Willy's point of view. The film's structure resembles a stream of consciousness account. Willy drifts between his living room, downstage, to the apron and flashbacks of an idyllic past, and also to fantasized conversations with Ben. When we are in the present the characters abide by the rules of the set, entering only through the stage door to the left. However, when we visit Willy's \\"past\\" these rules are removed, with characters openly moving through walls. Whereas the term \\"flashback\\" as a form of cinematography for these scenes is often heard, Miller himself rather speaks of \\"mobile concurrences.\\" In fact, flashbacks would show an objective image of the past. Miller's mobile concurrences, however, rather show highly subjective memories. Furthermore, as Willy's mental state deteriorates, the boundaries between past and present are destroyed, and the two start to exist in parallel. Home media The film was released on DVD on January 28, 2003 by Image Entertainment. A Blu-ray Disc edition by Shout! Factory was released on November 15, 2016.

It is \\"[one] of the most productive of Newfoundland's few estuarine wetland sites\\", and is \\"the province's most important wetland\\". It is a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention, receiving this designation on May 27, 1987. To the south is a globally significant Important Bird Area. As a result of the provincial Order in Council named the Hunting Prohibition Order, hunting has not been permitted on the estuary since 1974. Geography The estuary consists of adjoining marine and intertidal habitats with an elevation no more than one metre. Four islands are located within the estuary, and the intertidal sandbars give way to mudflats \\"supporting rich growths of Zostera\\". The site is surrounded by cultivated grasslands. The marine area is shallow, at most two metres deep in intertidal areas, and somewhat deeper in the river channel. It is bounded by privately owned land, the Codroy Valley Provincial Park, and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Nearby are the Grand Codroy and Little Codroy rivers, which are popular fishing destinations. Fauna A gosling of the Canada goose, which stage at Grand Codroy Estuary during migration. The abundant Zostera and protective grasslands provide an ideal environment for the fall staging of various bird species. Moderate Canada goose populations, up to 3000 during migration, use the estuary annually. Other bird species include the great blue heron, American black duck, wood duck, American green-winged teal, American wigeon, blue-winged teal, common goldeneye, common merganser, greater scaup, northern pintail, northern shoveler, red-breasted merganser, and the ring-necked duck. Tourism The wetland is actively promoted as a tourist destination, especially targeting birdwatchers, photographers, and naturalists. A seasonal visitor's centre is available for information.

Education and career Hargrove was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the first son of Georgine and Raymond Hargrove. When he was six months old, the family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Saint Catherine's Academy (now Saint Pius School), and graduated from Douglass High School in 1941. After high school, he entered Morgan State College in Baltimore. His studies were interrupted by World War II when he joined the military service. He served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers from 1943 to 1946 where he attained the rank of sergeant. After the war he graduated from Howard University where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1947. Hargrove graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law with a Bachelor of Laws in 1950 and was admitted to the bar the same year. In 1957 he became the first African-American to be appointed Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, serving in that capacity for five years. In 1967, Hargrove was elected as a delegate to the Maryland Constitutional Convention in Annapolis. State judicial service In 1962, he was appointed Judge of the old People's Court, where he served for a brief time before losing an election for the position. The next year he and Joseph C.

BMDMs can differentiate into mature macrophages in the presence of growth factors and other signaling molecules. Undifferentiated bone marrow cells are cultured in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; CSF-1). M-CSF is a cytokine and growth factor that is responsible for the proliferation and commitment of myeloid progenitors into monocytes (which then mature into macrophages). Macrophages have a wide variety of functions in the body including phagocytosis of foreign invaders and other cellular debris, releasing cytokines to trigger immune responses, and antigen presentation. BMDMs provide a large homogenous population of macrophages that play an increasingly important role in making macrophage-related research possible and financially feasible.  Production  Schema of in vitro BMDM production In order to produce BMDMs, mesenchymal stem cells are removed from the tibia or femur of mice. Since BMDMs are derived from bone marrow, withdrawn cells are healthy and na√Øve (or unactivated), regardless of the condition of donor mice. After removal, stem-cells are incubated with CSF-1. Without CSF-1, the cells enter an inactive state but can reinitiate growth and differentiation if stimulated later. Mature macrophages and fibroblasts, which may carry unwanted growth factors, are removed. Next, IL-3 and IL-1, two growth factors, are often added to increase yield and promote rapid terminal differentiation. Exogenous media containing growth factors and other serums must also be added to make the cells continually viable. Full growth and differentiation take approximately 5‚Äì8 days. Millions of BMDMs can be derived from one mouse and can frozen for years. After being thawed BMDMs can respond to a variety of stimuli such as LPS, IFN-Œ≥, PAMPs, NF-Œ∫B, and IRF3. These signals induce translation of genes that produce cytokines and determine if macrophages are M1 (pro-inflammatory) or M2 (anti-inflammatory). If BMDMs are not frozen, they age and become less viable as CSF-1 and growth factors in their media decreases. Proliferation of BMDMs can also be inhibited by a number of reagents. For example, growth and differentiation is dependent on CSF-1 and a functional CSF-1 receptor, a member of the tyrosine kinase family. Without a functional CSF-1 receptors, stem cells cannot respond to CSF-1 stimuli and therefore cannot differentiate; interferons can cause a down regulation of the CSF-1 receptor. Additionally, without stimuli like LPS to induce macrophage maturation to M1 or M2, mice accumulate a large pool of monocytes, the precursor cells to macrophages, which are less helpful for macrophage-specific research  References  Category:Immunology ","title":"Bone marrow-derived macrophage"},{"id":"17687600","text":"Creative entrepreneurship is the practice of setting up a business ‚Äì or setting yourself up as self-employed - in one of the creative industries. The focus of the creative entrepreneur differs from that of the typical business entrepreneur or, indeed, the social entrepreneur in that s/he is concerned first and foremost with the creation and exploitation of creative or intellectual capital. Essentially, creative entrepreneurs are investors in talent ‚Äì their own or other people‚Äôs. The most renowned creative entrepreneurs have combined creative flair with entrepreneurial ability to build multimillion-dollar business empires. Examples include Rupert Murdoch, Madonna and Richard Branson. History Although, technically, creative entrepreneurs predate the industrial revolution ‚Äì artisan jewellery making dates back to 7000 BCE and there were professional poets (sc√¥ps) in Pre-Norman Britain ‚Äì the subject of creative entrepreneurship is a relatively new area. Since the mid 20th century, commentators have observed the move towards a knowledge economy or information society where the old rules of manufacturing-based business no longer apply, or at very least need to be reconsidered (Machlup 1962; Drucker, 1969; Lyotard, 1984). But the creative sector, an intrinsic part of the knowledge economy, has received relatively little attention. In recent years, due to significant economic growth in the sector (prior to the 2008/9 downturn), there has been a surge of interest in the creative industries, and the issue of creative entrepreneurship has been pushed to the fore. In parallel with (and no doubt partially motivated by) general enthusiasm from policy makers and support agencies, creative entrepreneurship has grown as an academic discipline, Creative entrepreneurship courses are becoming widely available, and seem increasingly popular with students. A new body of work has emerged with writers such as Richard E. Caves,Caves, Richard E, ‚ÄúCreative Industries: Contracts Between Art And Commerce‚Äù, Harvard University Press, 2001 John Howkins,Howkins, John, ‚ÄúThe Creative Economy: How People Make Money From Ideas‚Äù, Penguin, 2001 Richard FloridaFlorida, Richard, ‚ÄúThe Rise of The Creative Class‚Äù, Basic Books, 2002 and Chris BiltonBilton, Chris, ‚ÄúManagement And Creativity‚Äù, Blackwell, 2007 all championing the creative industries and addressing the specific skills needed to succeed in them. In 2001, the Harvard economist and academic, Richard E. Caves, made the following observation: ‚ÄúThe preferences or tastes of creative artists differ in substantial and systematic (if not universal) ways from their counterparts in the rest of the economy where creativity plays a lesser (if seldom negligible) role.‚ÄùCaves, Richard E., ‚ÄúCreative Industries: Contracts Between Art And Commerce‚Äù, Harvard University Press, 2001, p.2 Caves listed seven basic economic or ‚Äúbedrock‚Äù properties that he believes distinguish creative activities from other sectors of the economy:Caves, op.cit, pp.2-10 :(1) Demand is uncertain :(2) Creative workers care about their product :(3) Some creative products require diverse skills :(4) Differentiated products :(5) Vertically differentiated skills :(6) Time is of the essence :(7) Durable products and durable rents The body of Caves‚Äô work makes a division between ‚Äúartists‚Äù and ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù and focuses on the issue of contracts between the two. In his analysis, it is the ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù (art dealers, agents, managers, publishers) who ‚Äúdecide whether the prospective value of [an artist‚Äôs] creative output warrants the cost of humdrum inputs needed to place it before final buyers‚Äù.Caves, op.cit, p19 Today, with the onset of Long Tail economics, Caves‚Äô division of labour might be seen as increasingly irrelevant: the artist can take his/her product direct to market via the Internet and is no longer dependent on a third party to negotiate access; thus his/her entrepreneurial and business abilities are ever more crucial. Definition The policy consultant and author, John Howkins, observes how the French economist and journalist, Jean-Baptiste Say, coined the term ‚Äòentrepreneur‚Äô in the late Eighteenth Century to describe a person who unlocks capital tied up in land and redirects it. Howkins makes this observation on the creative entrepreneur: ‚ÄúEntrepreneurs in the creative economy‚Ä¶operate like Say‚Äôs original model entrepreneur but with an important difference‚Ä¶they use creativity to unlock the wealth that lies within themselves. Like true capitalists, they believe that this creative wealth, if managed right, will engender more wealth.‚Äù.Howkins, John, ‚ÄúThe Creative Economy: How People Make Money From Ideas‚Äù, p129 Howkins goes on to observe that, despite lack of recognition from economists and politicians, and traditional lack of support from society (although this is changing), creative entrepreneurs tend to be bright and to value their independence above all else. The freedom to manage their own time and abilities compensates for the unpredictable nature of their working environment, and irregularity of their income: ‚ÄúThese people instinctively think for themselves, instinctively network, instinctively keep several balls in the air at once. They are the shock troops not only for new ideas about our culture but for new ideas about working in it.‚Äù Howkins, op.cit, p.155 Contribution to the economy In 2007, the UK's creative sector was growing twice as fast as the rest of the economy and generally considered to be equally important to the financial sector,‚ÄùCulture And Creativity‚Äù, British Council, 2007 which, at the time, was the driving force of the UK's gross domestic product. Now, as then, the majority of people working in the creative industries tend to be self-employed ‚Äì either freelance or running their own business. These people have the potential to be a key driver of the creative economy, but few see themselves as ‚Äòcreative entrepreneurs‚Äô. Figures show that only a handful of self-employed creatives in the UK have gone on to start a company or employ other people - the US, by contrast, has a relatively high number of business start-ups. (Howkins, 2001) As Howkins and others (Caves, 2000; Davies, 2007) observe, there has generally been a lack of support for creative entrepreneurship in the UK. Specific skills Creative entrepreneurs need to master specific skills: an understanding of intellectual property is essential, combined with the ability to manage cashflow, key talent and the creative process effectively. Howkins (2001) lists 11 rules for successful creative entrepreneurs. These rules include: invent yourself, prioritise ideas over data, be nomadic, learn endlessly and, most importantly, have fun.Howkins, op.cit, pp155-158 See also *Creative industries *Entrepreneurship References Further reading * Howkins, John, The Creative Economy: How People Make Money From Ideas, Penguin, 2001 * Creative Britain: New Talents for the New Economy, DCMS, 2008 External links * ‚ÄúSeeing The Possibilities‚Äù, Davies, Robert, 2007 *‚ÄúCreative Arts: Overview‚Äù, Graduate Prospects, 2007 * British Council Young Creative Entrepreneur (YCE) programme Category:Entrepreneurship ","title":"Creative entrepreneurship"},{"id":"17687615","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Frederico Westphalen () is a diocese located in the city of Frederico Westphalen in the ecclesiastical province of Passo Fundo in Brazil.

It is centered on the Cambridge Common, which was a center of civic activity in Cambridge after its founding in 1631. It was the site of the election for governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636, and was a military barracks site during the American Revolutionary War. The common was gradually reduced in size to its present roughly triangular shape, and surrounded by buildings in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1973 a historic district encompassing the extant common and everything within of it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1987 the district was amended to rationalize the boundary, which overlapped adjacent districts and included portions of some buildings. The district now includes properties across Waterhouse Street to the west of the common, including the Christian Science Church, a Classical Revival structure, the brick apartment houses along and the 1753 Georgian Frost-Waterhouse House, the oldest building in the district. To the north, across Massachusetts Avenue, the district includes Hemenway Gymnasium, Hastings Hall, Gannet House, and the Harvard-Epworth United Methodist Church. On the south side, across Garden Street, lie the Old Burying Ground, The First Parish in Cambridge, Christ Church (a National Historic Landmark), and several houses. The 1987 amendment to the district also added a small cluster of residential properties on Farwell Street, a dead-end street that is connected to the district by a footpath adjacent to the Old Burying Ground. It represents a well-preserved collection of properties dating to the 18th and 19th centuries that harken back to the days when Harvard Square was primarily residential in character.

He was the son of Friedrich Benjamin Osiander (1759‚Äì1822). In 1808 he received his medical doctorate, and embarked on an educational journey that took him to the University of T√ºbingen and the University of Paris, where he studied with Jean-Louis Baudelocque (1745‚Äì1810). In 1810 he returned to G√∂ttingen, where in worked in the field of urology and was appointed assessor of the Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G√∂ttingen (G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences). Under the influence of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752‚Äì1840), he developed an interest in natural history and comparative anatomy, and subsequently served as an assistant at the Natural History Cabinet. In 1811 he became a privat-docent at G√∂ttingen, also working as a general practitioner and obstetrician, and in 1815 was appointed an associate professor of medicine. In 1817 he traveled to Vienna, where he met with Johann Lukas Bo√´r (1751‚Äì1835); afterwards visiting Berlin, Jena and Halle (Saale). In 1822 he became his father's representative in G√∂ttingen as director of the maternity hospital. However, following the death of his father, the government preferred Ludwig Julius Caspar Mende (1779‚Äì1832) as director of the G√∂ttingen maternity hospital. Therefore, the younger Osiander became a professor of medicine, later taking over the zoological and ethnographic department of the academic museum.

The camp was also used to detain civil populations several times between 1939 and 2007. Its darkest period was in 1942, when 2,251 Jews, including 110 children, were transferred from Rivesaltes via the Drancy internment camp to the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz, where they were murdered. History In 1935, the commune of Rivesaltes, situated on a rail route 40 km from the Spanish border, was considered a strategic position for the French army, which took over 612 hectares between Rivesaltes and Salses, 5 km from the city of Rivesaltes, to construct a camp. It was originally intended to be used as a military base. At the same time, southern France became a major haven for Jewish refugees attempting to flee to neutral countries, whether legally or illegally. Creation (1938‚Äì1940) Commemorative stele for survivors of the Spanish Civil War The military camp was built in 1938, a few miles from Perpignan. Four-fifths of the camp was situated within the commune of Rivesaltes and one- fifth within the commune of Salses. The camp was named \\"Camp Joffre\\" after General Joseph Joffre, the commander-in-chief of the French army during World War I. Following the Retirada (the exodus of about half a million refugees from Spain to France in early 1939 during the Spanish Civil War), The Guardian 9 February 2019,franco spain refugees haunted by the pastthe French government decided to use Camp Joffre to intern more than 15,000 Catalan refugees. This decision was never fully put into action, although a small influx of Catalan refugees was held there in 1939. On December 10, 1940, the Ministry of Defense set aside south of the camp to house people expelled from Germany. The military camp was then run in parallel with the civilian camps. In 1939, at the start of World War II, the camp became a military transit base, and in 1940 a refuge for Spanish refugees fleeing from Francoist Spain. After the signing of the armistice, France was split into two. The zone libre (\\"free zone\\"), in which the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales was included, came under the administration of the Vichy government. Gradually, the Joffre camp became a place of internment for families of gypsies, Jews and Spanish refugees. With a capacity of 8000, before long the camp became overcrowded, families were separated, and conditions deteriorated greatly. Accommodation center (1941‚Äì1942) French Police checking new inmates in the camp Pithiviers When the first internees arrived on January 14, 1941, the status of the camp was not yet settled. It was decided to make it an \\"accommodation center\\" for families. Initially planned for a maximum of 17,000 \\"guests\\", it included 150 large barracks with a capacity of 10,000 individuals. Families were divided between barracks: there were barracks for men, others for women and children. By May 31, 1941, the camp had 6,475 internees from 16 nationalities; Spaniards constituted more than half of them, and Jewish refugees from other countries more than a third. Transit camp (1942) France under German occupation (Nazis occupied the southern zone starting in November 1942 ‚Äî Operation Case Anton). The green zone was under Italian administration. French milice and resistants At five o'clock in the morning on August 26, 1942, the foreign Jews in the southern zone were rounded up and taken to the Centre national de rassemblement des Isra√©lites at Rivesaltes. This \\"center\\" was newly established in the camp, in blocks J (for women and children), F (for men; this block had previously been reserved for workers) and K (reception, screening and sorting). It was planned as a transit camp for a total of 10,000 internees who would be housed there for 15 days before being deported. The 1,176 Jews already in the camp prior to the round-up were included in this count. Convoys left Rivesaltes for Drancy internment camp on August 11 (400 people), August 23 (175 people), September 1 (173 people), September 4 (621 people), September 14 (594 people), September 21 (72 people), September 28 (70 people), October (101 people) and October 20 (107 people). Serge Klarsfeld called the Rivesaltes camp \\"the Drancy of the free zone\\", noting that from September 4 to October 22 it played the same role as the Drancy camp in the occupied zone: a transit camp for deportees whose ultimate destination was the Nazi extermination camps. Rivesaltes was, during that time, the camp where the Jews arrested in the so-called \\"free zone\\" were gathered, and from which many of them (about 1,700) were sent to Drancy itself. In November 1942, as Germany invaded the previously unoccupied southern zone of France, German troops moved into Camp Joffre, and it was closed as an internment camp on November 25. There were 277 staff members when it closed. During those two years, the camp of Rivesaltes housed about 21,000 internees; about 5,714 of them were interned in the \\"special camp\\" or transit camp, of whom 2,313 were sent to Drancy and 2,251 were excluded from deportation by the screening committee. A further 215 internees died in the camp, including 51 children one year old or younger. Guarded residence center (1944‚Äì1946) The German army left Rivesaltes on August 19, 1944. While the military part of Rivesaltes camp resumed its original purpose, a new \\"guarded residence center\\" was established there on September 12, 1944. Located chiefly in block Q, this center housed people interned under the Vichy regime's √©puration (\\"purification\\") policy. It had a maximum capacity of 1,080 internees. The center continued to receive people from other European countries: Spaniards interned for crossing the border illegally were put to work to secure the center, and in January and March 1945 several hundreds of Soviet prisoners of war arrived. The closing of the center was decided upon on December 10, 1945, and completed early in October 1946. Prisoner-of-war depot (1944‚Äì1948) The military authority transformed the camp into Depot No. 162 for prisoners of war. Housing mostly German and Italian soldiers, this camp held less than 10,000 prisoners in October 1944, and between 6,000 and 7,000 men in May 1945. It closed on May 1, 1948. The prisoners worked extensively on the reconstruction of the Roussillon region. Between May 1945 and 1946, 412 German prisoners of war died in the camp. Post Second World War This facility continued to be used after the events of the Second World War. The Algerian war was the next opportunity to use the facility to detain people. Algerian war (1962) Under the stiffening of the French state caused by the Algerian War, the French government planned in 1957 to create an internment camp on the site. The Prefect tried to dissuade them because, in addition to a training center populated mainly by North Africans, the site contained a Professional Military Training Center particularly for North Africans and young soldiers mobilized for war. The plan was not carried out in its entirety, but a prison was set up discreetly for people convicted of being supporters of Algerian independence, and 527 prisoners were held there between March 9 and April 18, 1962. Transit and rehabilitation camp (1962‚Äì1977) =Harkis= Harkis is the generic term for Muslim Algerians serving as auxiliaries with the French Army during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì1962). In June 1962, the 1st regiment of Algerian riflemen was repatriated to Camp Joffre. They brought with them hundreds of civilians, women and children running away from the new independent Algeria. In October 1962, about 8000 Harkis were staying at the transit and rehabilitation camp of Rivesaltes (including those from the camp of Larzac and Bourg-Lastic). In all, according to the calculations of Abderahmen Moumen, about 20,000 people passed through and accumulated in the camp from 1962 to 1964. The stay varied from a few days for some families to years for others. Families considered \\"irretrievable\\"‚Äîa term used by administrators at the time‚Äîwere sent at the end of 1964 to the Saint-Maurice-l'Ardoise military camp in the Gard until 1975. Several hundred more families who had employment but no housing were accommodated in a \\"civil village\\" in the Rivesaltes camp during the 1960s. In 1963, a forestry village was also created in Rivesaltes for about 25 families of former auxiliaries (about a hundred people). The next decade saw the bulk of this population moved to the HLM (rent-controlled housing) of Rearte, built in the city of Rivesaltes to finalize the situation of these families. The last residents left the camp in February 1977. =Colonial auxiliaries= Other French Colonial Forces and auxiliaries from Africa and French Indochina came, accompanied by civilians, with the decolonization of the French colonial empire: from 1964 to 1966 about 600 Guineans arrived, and other former soldiers and their families came from French Indochina. Immigration detention center (1986‚Äì2007) Created in 1986, the administrative detention center was set up to detain Spanish nationals who had entered French territory illegally. With more than a thousand arrested on French soil in 1994, it was one of the largest detention centers in France. It was closed in 2007. The Rivesaltes memorial museum Serge and Beate Klarsfeld A Commemorative stele for the Jewish victims of the Rivesaltes camp erected by the \\"sons and daughters of Jews deported from France\\". Unveiled on January 16, 1994. French Name: M√©morial du Camp de Rivesaltes The memorial museum project has its origins in Serge Klarsfeld's 1978 publication of the list of deported Jews and Jews who died in the camp of Rivesaltes. *In 1993, Klarsfeld published \\"The transfer of Jews from the camp of Rivesaltes and the Montpellier area towards the center of Drancy for deportation on August 10, 1942.\\" *On January 16, 1994, Klarsfeld's association \\"Sons and daughters of Jews deported from France\\" erected a monument to the memory of 2,313 Jews deported from the Rivesaltes camp to Auschwitz. *On December 2, 1995, a monument to the Harkis was installed. *In 1997, a collective petition \\"To the living memory of the camp of Rivesaltes\\" was signed by Simone Veil, Claude Simon, Edgar Morin and many citizens to protest against threats to destroy the camp. *In 1998, Christian Bourquin, the new president of the General Council of the Pyr√©n√©es- Orientales, opposed the destruction of the site and started public consultations on the project. *On October 30, 1999, a stele was erected in memory of the Republicans of the Spanish Civil War. *In 2000, the French Ministry of Culture included the site in its supplementary list of Monuments historiques. *In 2005, on the French Heritage Day, part of the camp was opened to the public for the first time. *Rudy Ricciotti won the architecture competition. *Robert Badinter agreed to sponsor the project. *In November 2005, the General Council of the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales acquired F block, about 42 hectares. *On January 21, 2009, architect Rudy Ricciotti filed the construction permit. Work was expected to start in 2010 and take two years. * In October 16, 2015, inauguration by Prime Minister Manuel Valls.

In 1989 he opened up his own practice which he closed down in 1996 to work as an advisor on stress and job satisfaction for several companies. Since 2004, he has been working as a psychiatrist in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Career as an author He has written several psychological monographs together with Christoph Andr√©. His first novel, Le voyage d'Hector ou la recherche du bonheur (\\"Hector's Voyage or the Search for Happiness\\"), was very successful in France as well as other countries such as Germany. It is a book on psychology written for ordinary readers; it tells the story of Hector, a psychiatrist, who travels around the world in search of what it is that makes people happy. The book is written in a simple, humorous style, and gives psychological advice and thought-provoking impulses without even touching dry theory. Lelord continues to publish novels dealing with similar topics which are written in a similar manner. Following its European success, Penguin Group (USA) acquired the rights to publish Lelord's debut novel in the United States. Hector and the Search for Happiness was released on 31 August 2010. This was followed by Hector and the Secrets of Love on 1 January 2011 and Hector and the Search for Lost Time on 31 July 2012. A film adaptation of \\"Hector and the Search for Happiness\\" starring Simon Pegg as the title character was released in 2014.

The platform was developed by MATLAB Programming Contest Winner, Per Rutquist in 2008. The most recent version has support for binary and integer variables as well as an automated scaling module.  Description  PROPT is a combined modeling, compilation and solver engine, built upon the TomSym modeling class, for generation of highly complex optimal control problems. PROPT uses a pseudospectral Collocation method (with Gauss or Chebyshev points) for solving optimal control problems. This means that the solution takes the form of a Polynomial, and this polynomial satisfies the DAE and the path constraints at the collocation points. In general PROPT has the following main functions: * Computation of the constant matrices used for the differentiation and integration of the polynomials used to approximate the solution to the Trajectory optimization problem. * Source transformation to turn user-supplied expressions into MATLAB code for the cost function f and constraint function c that are passed to a Nonlinear programming solver in TOMLAB. The source transformation package TomSym automatically generates first and second order derivatives. * Functionality for plotting and computing a variety of information for the solution to the problem. * Automatic detection of the following: ** Linear and quadratic objective. ** Simple bounds, linear and nonlinear constraints. ** Non-optimized expressions. * Integrated support for non-smooth (hybrid) optimal control problems. * Module for automatic scaling of difficult space related problem. * Support for binary and integer variables, controls or states.  Modeling  The PROPT system uses the TomSym symbolic source transformation engine to model optimal control problems. It is possible to define independent variables, dependent functions, scalars and constant parameters: toms tf toms t p = tomPhase('p', t, 0, tf, 30); x0 = {tf  20}; cbox = {10 <= tf <= 40}; toms z1 cbox = {cbox; 0 <= z1 <= 500}; x0 = {x0; z1  0}; ki0 = [1e3; 1e7; 10; 1e-3];  States and controls  States and controls only differ in the sense that states need be continuous between phases. tomStates x1 x0 = {icollocate({x1  0})}; tomControls u1 cbox = {-2 <= collocate(u1) <= 1}; x0 = {x0; collocate(u1  -0.01)};  Boundary, path, event and integral constraints  A variety of boundary, path, event and integral constraints are shown below: cbnd = initial(x1  1); % Starting point for x1 cbnd = final(x1  1); % End point for x1 cbnd = final(x2  2); % End point for x2 pathc = collocate(x3 >= 0.5); % Path constraint for x3 intc = {integrate(x2)  1}; % Integral constraint for x2 cbnd = final(x3 >= 0.5); % Final event constraint for x3 cbnd = initial(x1 <= 2.0); % Initial event constraint x1  Single-phase optimal control example  Van der Pol Oscillator \\"Van Der Pol Oscillator - Matlab Solution\\", PROPT Home Page June, 2008.

In 1900, he created the role of Baron Scarpia in Giacomo Puccini's Tosca. He was the son of another leading baritone, Leone Giraldoni, and the soprano and violinist Carolina Ferni. His mother gave him voice lessons and he made his opera debut in Barcelona, as Escamillo in Carmen, in 1891. Giraldoni consolidated his career by appearing at various operatic venues in Italy and, in 1898, visiting South America. Then, in 1900, he earned a place in operatic history when he created the part of Baron Scarpia in Tosca, at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. He also appeared in the first performance of Alberto Franchetti's La figlia di Jorio at Italy's foremost opera house, La Scala, Milan, in 1906. He sang in Russia and Poland from 1901 until 1907 and at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City during the 1904‚Äì05 season. In 1913, he appeared at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris, as Scarpia and Sharpless. Giraldoni had a dark, resonant voice and a strong (if unsubtle) stage presence, according to contemporary descriptions of his performances. Apart from Scarpia, his notable roles included: Don Carlo, Amonasro, Telramund, Hamlet, Berlioz's M√©phisto and Onegin. But like his direct rival, the Sicilian baritone Mario Sammarco, Giraldoni's vehement style of singing was best suited to operas by verismo composers such as Ruggero Leoncavallo, who composed Pagliacci, Umberto Giordano, who composed Andrea Ch√©nier, and Alberto Franchetti, who composed Germania and Cristoforo Colombo. After World War I, Giraldoni sang on the Italian provincial-theatre circuit. He retired from the stage in Trieste in 1921 and died three years later in Finland, where he had gone to teach. His last operatic appearance had been as the Father in Louise. Giraldoni made a number of recordings prior to World War I, some of which have been reissued on CD.

When they did not pay, he carried on with the destruction of the town, including the second courthouse. Only the walls and pillars remained after the burning.

He was an elite actor of the Royal Dramatic Theatre. He is known for leading two big strikes at the royal stage referred to as 'First Torsslow Argument' (1827) and 'Second Torsslow Argument' (1834), and for crushing the monopoly of the royal theaters in Stockholm in 1842. He was the director of the Mindre teatern.  Life  Ulrik Torsslow was born to bank official Mattias Torsslow. He was a student at Dramatens elevskola in 1816‚Äì19 and made his debut as Hamlet on the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1819, where he stayed until the great strike of 1834. In 1830 he married the actress Sara Torsslow. The Torsslow Arguments  In 1827 and 1834, two major strikes - indeed, the biggest strikes in the theatre's history - took place in the \\"Royal Theaters\\" (the Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theatre), referred to as 'First Torsslow Argument' (1827) and 'Second Torsslow Argument' (1834) after the leading figures, Ulrik Torsslow and Sara Torsslow.Nordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska sk√•despelare fr√•n Gustav III till v√•ra dagar. F√∂rra delen, 1772-1842, Bonnier, Stockholm, 1917 ['Swedish theatre and Swedish actors from Gustav III to our days. First Book 1772‚Äì1842'] In 1827, director Karl Johan Puke introduced reforms in which the benefit performances of the actors (in which the entire income from a performance was given to one of the actors) and the actors' share in the theater was to be replaced by fixed salaries. Both of these reforms was rejected by the majority of the actors, as benefit performances was normally much more lucrative for the majority of actors: further more, Puke made himself immensely disliked by a frequent use of disciplinary rules, such as the right of a director to place an actor in arrest in their dressing room. The Torsslow couple, in their position of star actors, launched a strike in which they demanded the reforms be stopped and the disciplinarian rules abolished. The strike successfully prevented the financial reforms, but the disciplinarian rules were kept with the exception of the arrest, which was abolished for women. The discontent of the disciplinarian system was voiced by Elise Fr√∂sslind who, when director Puke asked her if she was satisfied with the settlement replied: \\"Oh yes, the only thing missing is the flogging.\\" The plans to introduced the reforms was however not terminated indefinitely, and the second strike of 1834 voiced the same concerns. This time, the management was prepared for the strike and crushed the unity of the participants by raising the salaries of some and firing others. The second strike was therefore defeated, which resulting in the introduction of the reforms, while the participants of the strike was dismissed. Some of the participants, however, were only fired so that they could be hired again for a lower salary, which was illustrated in the cases of the star actors Elise Fr√∂sslind and Charlotta Eriksson, who were both fired with the formal motivation that Fr√∂sslind was claimed to be too old and of delicate health to fill her obligations, and Eriksson simply because they could no longer afford her. When they were fired, the director admitted informally that they had been so because of their participation in the strike, though he gave other official reasons. Later career Ulrik and Sara Torsslow left the Royal Dramatic Theatre after the strike of 1834, bringing with them a number of leading actors. However, the theater monopoly of 1798 was still in effect in the city of Stockholm, which reserved all professional theatrical activity inside the city borders of Stockholm for the royal theaters. This resulted in the actors being unable to find employment in the city and eventually several of them was forced to ask to return to the Royal Dramatic Theatre, which accepted them back with a lower salary than before the strike: this was for example the case with both Elise Fr√∂sslind and Charlotta Eriksson, who returned in 1836. Ulrik and Sara Torsslow initiated a struggle against the royal theater monopoly of 1798 which lasted for eight years and eventually resulted in its abolition. Initially, they were engaged at the Djurg√•rdsteatern, a theater which was not regarded as illegal because, firstly, it lay just outside of the city borders and, secondly, it had until that point only been used by during the summers. In 1835‚Äì37 he was director for Djurg√•rdsteatern, where he broke the royal theatre's monopoly in 1842 (until 1837 in companionship with Pierre Deland). The Torsslows bought the special permit of the theater from Pierre Deland and initially performed there only during the summers and toured the country in winter, but from the 1839 season, they challenged the theater monopoly by performing also in winter. Their initiative was successful and they created theater history when the theater monopoly, which was by then regarded outdated, was abolished in 1842. From 1835‚Äì39 he toured with his own troupe, and from 1843‚Äì56 he was employed at the theatre Mindre Teatern in Stockholm, where he was director from 1846 to 1850 (solo from 1850 onwards). Ulrik and Sara Torsslow enjoyed a renewed golden age of their careers at the Mindre teatern, where they were praised by critics as \\"were the spouses during the tenure of a few years united to a Twin Pair of the First Order in the Sky of Art.\\"Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon (1906) He returned to the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1856, and made his last performance in 1863.

The Scandinavian settlement in Brazil began in the mid to late 19th century and was predominant when Scandinavian peoples arrived in Brazil. Many Scandinavians came to Brazil for economic reasons and to start a new life.Nossa Feira, Nossa Terra, Nossa Gente - FEARG/FECIS 2008 In recent years, a few Norwegians and Swedes have migrated to the littoral zone of the State of Rio Grande do Norte (mainly Natal) and Cear√°, attracted by the beaches and the tropical climate.Rio Grande dos n√≥rdicos - dos espanh√≥is, portugueses, at√© islandeses: europeus compram casas com certificado de sol History In 1768, the scientist Daniel Solander, disciple of Carl von Linn√©, was the first known Swede to arrive in Brazil.Brazilian Embassy in Stockholm The relations between Brazil and Sweden were rooted in the family ties between the Brazilian and Swedish royal families, and in the Swedish emigration to Brazil at the end of the 19th century. The wife of King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway, Queen Josephine (of Leuchtenberg), was a sister to Empress Amelia (of Leuchtenberg), wife of Emperor Pedro I. Diplomatic relations between Brazil and Sweden were established in 1826. In the Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm, where many Swedish royalty are buried, there are commemorative plaques of Emperors Pedro I and Pedro II as well as of President Epit√°cio Pessoa (who were recipients of the Royal Order of the Seraphim). Diplomatic relations between Brazil and Sweden were established in 1826. The first Swedish emigrants arrived in Brazil in 1890, and in 1909 the first sea line between the two countries was initiated. Mass emigration from Norway started circa 1865‚Äì1866, after the civil war was over. Several ship-owners saw the opportunity to earn good money by transporting migrants to the New World. United States, Canada and Brazil received many Norwegians. In Curitiba, one of the first Scandinavians of note to arrive was Alfredo Andersen, an artist who arrived towards the end of the 19th century and painted well into the 1930s.

Examples of this immigration are the Karlson House (Casa Sueca) in Guarani das Miss√µes, the Svenska Kulturhuset in the district of Linha Jansen (Farroupilha, RS), the Mission of √ñrebro in Venancio Aires, RS.

Formed in 1879, it is responsible for overseeing all disciplines of ice skating: figure skating (singles, pairs and ice dance); synchronised skating; and speed skating (including short track).  History  On Saturday 1 February 1879 a number of prominent men of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire met in the Guildhall, Cambridge, to set up the National Skating Association with the aim of regulating the sport of fen skating. A Cambridge journalist, James Drake Digby, had thought that the Fen speed skaters were worthy of national recognition and he was also concerned that betting was leading to malpractice. He thought that skating needed a national organisation to control it, like the Jockey Club. The founding committee included several landowners, a vicar, a fellow of Trinity College, a magistrate, two members of parliament, the mayor of Cambridge, the Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, the president of Cambridge University Skating Club, and Neville Goodman, a graduate of Peterhouse, Cambridge.DL Bird 1979 Our Skating Heritage. London. The newly formed National Skating Association held their first one-and-a-half-mile British professional championship at Thorney in December 1879. There was a field of 32, including former champions Turkey Smart and Tom Watkinson. Fish Smart beat Knocker Carter in the final. His reward was a badge, a sash and a cash prize, given as an annual salary in instalments to encourage the champion to \\"keep himself temperate\\". The NSA also established an amateur championship, which was held for the first time at Welsh Harp, London, in January 1880, and won by Frederick Norman, a farmer‚Äôs son from Willingham. The professionals were labourers who skated for cash prizes; the amateurs were gentlemen who skated for trophies. In 1892 the NSA aided in the foundation of the International Skating Union (ISU). The NSA hosted the first international ice skating competition in Britain in Birmingham in 1899 and has hosted all events in the UK since in various locations. In 1894 the National Skating Association decided to move their headquarters from Cambridge to London, from where they concentrated on figure skaters and rinkmen. Their new base, the National Skating Palace, is now better known as the London Palladium. Until 1990, when an independent society was formed, the NSA was also the UK's governing body of roller skating. As a consequence of the segmentation, the NSA became NISA (National Ice Skating Association), the headquarters of which are now based in Nottingham. In November 2018, the National Ice Skating Association began rebranding as British Ice Skating.  Assessment  Complying to the purpose of the organisation, the BIS levels are used by instructors to grade learners of ice skating in the UK. There are various levels of student grades, as well as instructor grades. Skate UK These levels are generally taught in group classes, and are assessed by the instructors of these classes. The levels are as follows: * Level 1 # Sit down and stand up # March forwards across the ice # Forward two-foot glide # Skate and dip (little man) # Turn around on the spot * Level 2 # Backwards marching across the ice # Forward swizzles (lemons) # Forward two-foot glide on a curve (left and right) # Two- foot turn on the spot (forwards to backwards, back to forwards) # Snowplough or T-stop * Level 3 # Forward stroking (showing correct use of blade) # Moving two-foot turn (forwards to backwards, back to forwards) # Backwards swizzles (lemons) # Back two-foot glide # Forward one-foot glide (left and right) * Level 4 # Forward outside edges on a circle (left and right) # Forward inside edges on a circle (left and right ) # Basic forward slalom (basic outside/inside edges) # Backwards stroking # Forward continuous chasses around a circle (left and right) * Level 5 # Backward outside edges on a circle (left and right) # Backward inside edges on a circle (left and right) # Backward continuous chasses around a circle (clockwise and counter-clockwise) # Forward crossovers (clockwise and anti-clockwise) # Forward outside three turns (left and right) from standstill * Level 6 # Forward inside three turn (left and right) from standstill # Backward outside edges step to forward outside edge on a circle # Backward crossovers (clockwise and anti-clockwise) # Backward two-foot slalom # Two-foot spin (min 2 revs) * Level 7 # Forward inside open mohawk (left and right) # Backward crossovers to landing position glide # Continuous forward outside edges along a straight line (as per Level 1 Field Moves) # Continuous forward inside edges along a straight line (As per level 1 Field Moves) # Basic forward cross rolls * Level 8 # Continuous outside three turns around a circle (3 in a row); left and right # Continuous inside three turns around a circle (3 in a row); left and right # Step sequence: three turns, mohawk, cross rolls, twizzles, toe steps etc. # Forward inside single twizzle (left and right) (hockey skaters forward drag; left and right) # One foot spin (min 2 revs) (hockey skaters 2 foot spin; min 4 revs) Skate UK Star Levels (formerly known as Passport) These levels may be attempted once the Skate UK levels have been passed. Skate UK Star levels may be taken in any or all of singles skating (free), ice dance, speed skating or synchronised skating, although you must complete a level in a given discipline before moving onto the next level in that discipline. These levels as also assessed by the instructor, but will be expected to be of a higher standard than the same moves in the Skate UK system. The levels are as follows: = Singles Skating = * Bronze # Forwards and backwards crossovers in a figure of 8 # Forward outside spiral on a curve (left and right) # Spin on one foot (min 4 revs) optional entry and exit # Waltz jump from 4-5 back crossovers (held landing for count of 3) # Bunny hop into drag * Silver # Single salchow # Spin on one foot (min 4 revs) entry from backwards crossovers, stepping into a forward outside edge, with a landing position exit # Backward spiral on a curve (left and right) # Backwards crossovers around a circle into an extended landing position for the count of 3 (left and right) # Teapot on either foot (forwards or backwards) * Gold # Backwards outside one-foot spin (min 1 rev) # Single toe loop (with correct take-off - not a toe three jump) # Spiral sequence: forward outside spiral, forward outside three turn, two backwards crossovers, back inside spiral (spirals held for 3 seconds) clockwise and counter-clockwise # A simple step sequence: must have three turns, mohawks, chasses, crossrolls, toe steps; these can be done on any edge, forwards or backwards # Combination of skating movements: to include turns, jumps and spins in a short routine; with or without music (max 1 minute and 30 seconds) = Ice Dance = * Bronze # Forward open chasses/crossed (closed) chasses continuously on a circle (min 3) left and right # Left forward outside mohawk, cross in front onto left back inside and step forwards to right forward inside (3 times) left and right # Forward progressive runs # Two consecutive left forward outside 3 turns followed by a sustained outside edge with the free leg extended for a count of 3 (left and right) # Forward spiral inside and outside edges (either foot) * Silver # Forward progressive runs in a figure of 8 # Backward open chasses (3 on each foot) in a serpentine sequence # Backward progressive runs in a figure of 8 # A 7-step dance sequence as follows: right forward inside open mohawk, right back outside run, right back outside cross in front left back inside, step forwards to right forward inside edge and repeat twice # Forward inside single twizzles, left and right (min 4 in a row) * Gold # Forward run, forward slip chasses (3 times) in a figure of 8 # Basic backwards crossrolls # Solo Novice Foxtrot with music # Forward inside double twizzles (left and right) # A 9-step dance sequence as follows; left forward outside progressive run, left forward outside closed chasses, left forward outside progressive run, left forward outside open mohawk, step behind to a left back inside edge and repeat twice. = Synchronized Skating = * Bronze # Forward block (full length of the rink) in shoulder hold using alternating left and right chasses # Forward line (full length of the rink) in shoulder hold using alternating left and right chasses and swings # Forward circle (at least 2 revolutions in both directions) in hand hold, facing inward using continuous chasses. # Forward pin wheel (at least 2 revolutions in both directions) in shoulder hold, using consecutive chasses. 2, 3 or 4 spokes may be performed, depending on the number of skaters. * Silver # Block in shoulder hold.

Skaters must show proof that they have completed the Skate UK Star programme before being allowed to apply for the judged levels. Tests are available in each of the following disciplines ‚Äì skaters may take tests in whichever disciplines they wish. Skaters do not need to complete the tests in every discipline before moving up to the next level, but cannot skip levels in any given discipline (i.e. must do Level 1 Field Moves before doing Level 2 Field Moves, but Level 1 Elements is not required to do Level 2 field moves). * Field Moves ‚Äì assessing control of edges * Elements ‚Äì these are elements of free skating such as jumps, spins and step sequences which are done in isolation * Free Skating ‚Äì using the elements in a continuous routine or program of a given length, set to music. Music for free skating must not have vocals. * Compulsory Dances ‚Äì there are 2 dances at each level. Dances may be tested solo or with a partner, although if both partners are taking the test either two judges are required or the partners will need to repeat each dance so that one is being assessed on the first time and one the second. * Variations (up to Level 2) ‚Äì this is done as part of the pattern of one of the compulsory dances followed by a specific number of bars of a dance to the same music which is invented by the skater (more usually their coach) followed by the end of the compulsory pattern. 2 full repeats must be skated. * Original Dance (Level 3 and above) ‚Äì a full routine to a given type of music with no compulsory dance sequence at the beginning. * Free Dance ‚Äì similar to the Free Skating this is a program of a given length, to music (which may include vocals), including certain required dance elements.

The strip was syndicated in May 2008. The strip is set in the American suburbs on an old farmstead called Lubberland Farms which has a secret home for displaced, disenchanted, and disoriented outcasts. Mamet, a self-absorbed sheep, is the main character who acts recklessly and at times insults the other characters. He interacts with the mature, morally centered dog Cobb and Cobb‚Äôs immature but devoted younger sibling Rupert. The two dogs raise Tucker, a human boy with a dark and twisted disposition. History Deflocked made its debut in the La Canada Valley Sun newspaper in California in 2006. Corriveau had been writing comedy for Saturday Night Live, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and as head writer for Talk Soup. Since the paper was unable to pay for the strip, Corriveau provided it to them without charge. In May 2008, Deflocked was picked up by King Features and is now available in many newspapers.DeFlocked goes ‚Äôround DeNation Corriveau‚Äôs Deflocked has also appeared since June 16, 2007 in the PETA blog, written by Jack Shepherd.DeFlocked, by Jeff Corriveau Once the comic strip was available through King Features syndication, PETA stopped featuring the strip, although Corriveau has continued to supply the organization with cartoons and artwork on other issues such as horse racing. 10% Wool, by Jeff Corriveau Main characters Mamet Mamet is an opinionated sheep with a biting comment and point of view about everyone and everything. He is out for himself, cynical, and arrogant, and willing to share his ignorance with all. Cobb Cobb is a mature dog, older sibling and father surrogate to Rupert, and the voice of morality and reason in the group. Cobb seeks peace and balance in the world but is constantly distracted from his goal by a crazy world and obnoxious sheep. Rupert Rupert is the younger sibling of Cobb. He wanders innocently and na√Øvely around while upsetting Mamet‚Äôs theories and being led into schemes and activities by Tucker. Tucker Tucker is the only human in the group and only eight years old. He was mysteriously dropped on the doorstep of Cobb and Rupert who have raised him as their own. Tucker is young and willing to go along with anything especially his \\"Uncle\\" Mamet‚Äôs questionable adventures from which Cobb and Rupert try to protect him. Subject matter Deflocked follows the often odd and bizarre adventures of the four main characters. Corriveau frequently has his characters supporting the animals‚Äô view of issues rather than the human view. While penning the strip for PETA, Corriveau often focused on mulesing, the practice of removing flesh from the buttocks of merino sheep to avoid flystrike, a practice used almost exclusively in Australia. Family life Corriveau lives in Montrose, California with his wife Karen, their daughter Amelie, and Beemer, a cat.

Early years James was born in Ballarat in 1892. He studied piano at the Melbourne University Conservatorium of Music, graduating in 1912. On the recommendation of the visiting pianist Teresa Carre√±o, he headed overseas to study in London and Brussels with Arthur De Greef, a former pupil of Franz Liszt and Camille Saint-Sa√´ns.Music Australia website.Therese Radic, Review of David Tunley: William James and the Beginnings of Modern Musical Australia, University of Melbourne, Review: The Centre for Studies in Australian Music, Number 23, November 2008 It is around this period that James composed his Six Australian Bush Songs, which were dedicated to Dame Nellie Melba. After being rejected for military service, James worked for the British Red Cross Society during the First World War. In 1915, he made his public debut as a pianist with the Queen's Hall Orchestra. By this time he had begun to publish his compositions, and in 1916 his ballet music By Candlelight was performed in concert at the Savoy Theatre, London. ABC career In 1923 James returned to Australia, eventually taking up a teaching position at the Melbourne University Conservatorium. In the late 1920s, he joined the newly formed Australian Broadcasting Company, the forerunner of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). He became the latter's first Director of Music in 1931, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1957. It was during his tenure that the ABC established its state orchestras. From 1935, James made regular overseas trips to persuade international artists to perform in Australia with the newly formed ABC orchestras. During World War II, when such exchanges became impractical, the ABC instead organised local talent competitions, which James adjudicated. James's selection of repertoire for concert performances was conservative, possibly because he felt contemporary composers might not have a broad enough appeal for radio audiences. Compositions James wrote many pieces for voice, choir and piano, but his most enduring pieces are still his 15 Australian Christmas carols in three sets, in which traditional Christmas themes were given \\"outback\\" settings, such as The Three Drovers. ABC staff writer John Wheeler wrote the lyrics for these carols. The Australian Christmas Carols can still be found in music catalogues today. A fourth set of Australian Christmas Carols was written in the 1970s and given to the Wayside Chapel, Kings Cross. They have since disappeared.Philip O'Brien, \\"An Aussie Christmas carol\\", The Canberra Times, 18 December 1999, Panorama, p. 20 Outback themes were common in his secular songs as well, in compositions such as Bush Song at Dawn, familiar to many Australian children of the 1950s and 1960s through the school songbooks of the period. Other compositions by James have rustic English themes (A Warwickshire Wooing) or claim MƒÅori inspiration (Six Maori Dances). Personal life James was married twice. His first marriage, in 1921, was to the Russian opera singer Saffo Buchanan, n√©e Drageva (known professionally as Saffo Arnav), by whom he had a son and a daughter. Buchanan died in 1955, and in 1960 James married again, to widow Caroline Mary Dally-Watkins, n√©e Skewes. They divorced in 1967.

History A preliminary drawing of the tower entrance to the Roy G. Cullen Building by its architect in 1938 From its inception in 1927, the University of Houston did not have a dedicated campus. In 1936, when the university was still located at South Main Baptist Church, Houston philanthropists Julius Settegast and Ben Taub donated conjoining pieces of land totaling 110 acres (45 hectares) to the university. This land was to be used as a permanent campus for the University of Houston. Although land had been donated to the university, it was not until two years later that the university was able to build on the location. Hugh Roy Cullen‚Äîa wealthy businessman‚Äîand his wife Lillie Cullen donated a combined $335,000 for the first permanent building to be built at the campus. The building was named the \\"Roy Gustav Cullen Memorial Building\\" as a memorial to the Cullens' only son who had died in an oil field accident two years earlier. H.R. Cullen would later serve as Chairman of the Board of Regents for the university‚Äîand before his death in 1957‚Äîhad donated over $11 million to the University of Houston.

He belonged to the pioneer generation of the Royal Swedish Opera and was regarded as one of the leading opera singers of the Gustavian era. He was a hovs√•ngare and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.  Life  Carl Stenborg was born in Stockholm to actor Petter Stenborg (1719‚Äì1781), director of the Stenborg Troupe, and Anna Kr√ºger (1710‚Äì1803). Of his brothers, Johan Fredrik Stenborg (1743‚Äì1813) studied at Uppsala University and became an official, and Nils Stenborg (d. 1780) became an opera singer. He received a good education, debuted as a concert singer in Riddarhuset in 1766 and was appointed councillor at the Royal Court of Sweden in 1767. This was considered unusual, since his father was not of wealthy means. Carl's mother had been the housekeeper of the nobleman and statesman Adam Horn (1717-1778). Carl or one of his brothers may have been his son, which was to be the reason why the sons of a poor man had been able to receive such a good education and reach high positions so early in life. Royal Opera When the Royal Swedish Opera was founded in 1773, he played the main male role in Francesco Uttini's opera Thetis och P√©l√©e opposite the primadonna Elisabeth Olin, with whom he had a relationship.Bertil H. van Boer, 'Stenborg, Carl' in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Stanley Sadie and John Tyrell (eds), 2001 He was the leading male star for several years and in 1780 was given a life contract. Although he sang tenor roles, his voice was known for its dexterity and dark timbre and was nearer to that of a baritone. Carl Stenborg was appointed Hovs√•ngare in 1773, royal secretary in 1782 and was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1783. The Stenborg theaters He was the director of his father's theatres in 1780‚Äì99: from 1788, he was allowed to perform in them. He was engaged in 1782 and in 1793 he married the singer Betty Olin, daughter of Elisabeth Olin, and performed with her in Copenhagen and Oslo in 1794 and 1795. The engagement had been long because of the unwillingness of Elisabeth Olin to give her consent to the marriage between her daughter and her own former lover. In 1784 Stenborg's opera Gustaf Ericsson i Dalarna premiered at one of his father's theaters. After the Stenborg Theatre was closed in 1799, he toured the country (1804‚Äì09) with his own company. Later life He was given a pension in 1806. He gave his last performance at a concert on Riddarhuset 27 February 1808, \\"to the great surprise of everyone\\" opposite Elisabeth Olin, which now also gave her last performance, and Jeanette W√§sselius, with music of the royal chapel, Johann Christian Friedrich H√¶ffner, Freidrich M√ºller and his own daughter, the pianist Carolina Stenborg (1798‚Äì1869).

Beginning with the tidal lock at the Savannah River, the waterway continues through four lift locks as it traverses , before reaching another tidal lock at the Ogeechee River at Fort Stewart. Along the way, the canal passed through Savannah‚Äôs 19th century industrial corridor, former rice fields, timber tracts, and a still lush tidal river swamp and adjacent sandhill environment that is the characteristic habitat for several unique species of flora and fauna. Nowadays much of this area comprises the Savannah suburbs of Garden City and Pooler. The canal was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 11, 1997. 1825 - 1890s The Savannah - Ogeechee Canal was an important and profitable enterprise during the mid-nineteenth century. Originally chartered in 1824, the 's of canal was completed in December 1830. Numerous problems (such as decay of wooden locks and repeated erosion of embankments) plagued the canal during its early days of operation. The parent company declared bankruptcy in 1836. A new company was formed that widened and improved existing structures within the canal. From the 1840s to the 1860s, the canal generally prospered and became an important element in the south Georgia economy. The canal opened to transport in 1831 and became an important partner in the economy of south Georgia.Georgia Encyclopedia Its impact on the lumber trade was particularly important with one of the nation's largest sawmills located along the canal's basin. Cotton, rice, bricks, guano, naval stores, peaches, and other goods also traversed the canal. Later in the century, the canal suffered a gradual decline. Heavy June rains seriously damaged the canal embankments in 1876 coupled with a yellow fever epidemic which fatally inflicted over 1,000 individuals. The canal had become more a public health nuisance than an economic asset. By the early 1890s, the canal ceased to operate as a transportation corridor as the Central of Georgia Railway brought various wharves, warehouses, and canal frontage properties. Today Now a century after the canal ceased commercial operations, local citizens have started to restore and interpret the waterway and its natural environment. In cooperation with Chatham County‚Äôs Department of Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Affairs, the Savannah ‚Äì Ogeechee Canal Society http://savannahogeecheecanalsociety.org/ is working to turn the canal into a multipurpose linear park. A walk along the Heel or Tow paths provides a delightful and attractive setting to enjoy this unique waterway. Savannah-Ogeechee Canal Museum & Nature Center Currently most of the effort is expended at the Ogeechee River terminus near Lock 5 where the Savannah‚ÄìOgeechee Canal Museum & Nature Center at 681 Fort Argyle Rd, Savannah, is open. Exhibits highlight the canal's history and the natural history of the local area. The museum also offers guided history and natural history tours of the area.

He made the first of his eight appearances for Wales in 1885, and in 1887 was invited to play as an amateur for Preston North End in their FA Cup ties. He was a member of the Preston sides which were FA Cup Finalists in 1888 and FA Cup Winners in 1889. Their victory in the Cup in the 1888‚Äì89 season was achieved without conceding a single goal throughout, which was attributed to his goalkeeping skills. He also played for Barnes, Casuals, and Birmingham St George's. He retired in 1890, but was persuaded to make a last appearance for Wales in 1892. Between 1884 and 1888, he made seven appearances for the Corinthians amateur club, including playing for Corinthian three times against Preston North End. Mills-Roberts qualified as a doctor in July 1887, and the following year was appointed the house surgeon at Birmingham General Hospital. He later took a position with the hospital at the Dinorwic Slate Quarry, and served with the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War. At the end of his working career, he retired to Bournemouth, where aged 73 he died on 27 November 1935.

Early life Born in Trinidad, Colorado, on April 23, 1909, he majored in Greek civilization at Harvard University, graduating in 1930. A performance by the German dancers Harald Kreutzberg and Yvonne Georgi so impressed him that he went to Austria to study dance with the former. Later, he studied at the School of American Ballet. Career Soon he was dancing with George Balanchine's American Ballet. In 1937, he choreographed his first dance, Show Piece, which was performed by Ballet Caravan. The next year, Hawkins was the first man to dance with the company of the famous modern dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. In 1939, he officially joined her troupe, dancing male lead in a number of her works, including Appalachian Spring in 1944. They married in 1948. He left her troupe in 1951 to found his own, and they divorced in 1954. Not long afterwards, he met and began working alongside the experimental composer Lucia Dlugoszewski. They married and remained together for the rest of his life. After leaving the Graham Company, Hawkins' work developed in a quite different direction. He moved away from esthetic visions based on realistic psychology, sociopolitical themes, storylines or musical portrayals, towards one inspired by ritual and mysticism that called upon dancers' kinesthetic responses to celebrate human, animal and other natural phenonmema. Major influences included Native-American dance rituals and folklore, Japanese esthetics and Zen, and various schools of dance, theater and philosophical thought from around the world, including East Asian and Ancient Greek classics. In some ways, he took dance in a similar direction that abstract painters were taking art, though he disliked the label 'abstract'. In a personal quest for dance safety, Hawkins set out to integrate anatomic principles with dance. He developed an innovative approach to dance technique based on the movement principles of kinesiology and anatomic study, thereby also creating a bridge to later somatic practices. He advocated familiarity with ideokinesis (as well as other somatic approaches to training) and the acquisition of what he termed a 'thinkfeel' sensory awareness of the body and its movement. In contrast to the intense contractions and shaped positions typical of the Graham technique, Hawkins favored muscular release and free-flowing patterns of movement in a pursuit of effortless movement and seamless transitions. He famously stated ‚ÄúThe body is a clear place.‚Äù Overall, his dance technique may be seen to combine kinesiology, modern dance (including Graham technique) and a particular idea of beauty. Hawkins championed contemporary composers, and insisted on performing to live music. The Erick Hawkins Dance Company toured with the Hawkins Theatre Orchestra, an ensemble of seven or more instrumentalists plus conductor. In addition to his wife, Dlugoszewski, prominent composers of the time with whom he worked included Henry Cowell, David Diamond, Ross Lee Finney, Lou Harrison, Alan Hovhaness, Wallingford Riegger, Toru Takemitsu and Virgil Thomson. Collaborating visual artists include Isamu Noguchi, Ralph Dorazio, Barbara Morgan,Labrecque, B. (1971). Still Photography and Human Motion. Quest, 16(1), 26-36. Helen Frankenthaler, and Robert Motherwell. Award and death In 1988, Hawkins received the Scripps award at the American Dance Festival. On October 14, 1994, one month before he died, he was presented with the National Medal of Arts by President Bill Clinton. Hawkins died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan in November 1994. At the time of his death, he was survived by his wife, Dlugoszewski, and by a sister, Murial Wright Davis. Legacy The Erick Hawkins Dance Company has continued after the death of its founder. Dlugoszewski initially took over as artistic director until her death in 2000, during which time she choreographed four new works. Katherine Duke, who was appointed artistic director of the company in 2001, has been charged with supervising both the teaching of Hawkins' technique and the continuation of his repertory.

He was the last known Japanese holdout to surrender after the end of hostilities in 1945. Military service Nakamura was an Amis aborigine. Born on 8 October 1919, he was then enlisted into a Takasago Volunteer Unit of the Imperial Japanese Army in November 1943. He was stationed in Morotai Island in Indonesia shortly before the island was overrun by the Allies in September 1944 in the Battle of Morotai. Nakamura was allegedly declared dead on 13 November 1945 by the Imperial Japanese Army. After the capture of the island, it appears that Nakamura lived with other stragglers on the island until well into the 1950s, while going off for extended periods of time on his own. In 1956, he apparently decided to relinquish his allegiance with the other remaining holdouts on the island and set off to construct a small camp of his own, consisting of a small hut in a fenced field. Discovery Nakamura's hut was accidentally discovered by a pilot in mid-1974. In November 1974, the Japanese Embassy in Jakarta requested the assistance of the Indonesian government in organizing a search mission, which was conducted by the Indonesian Air Force on Morotai and led to his arrest by Indonesian soldiers on 18 December 1974. He was flown to Jakarta and was hospitalized there. News of his discovery reached Japan on 27 December 1974. Nakamura decided to be repatriated straight to Taiwan, bypassing Japan, and died there of lung cancer five years later on 15 June 1979. Upon his return, he was referred to by the Taiwanese press as Lee Kuang-hui (), a name he learned of only after his repatriation. The Taiwanese Kuomintang government initially did not receive him well because it considered him a Japanese loyalist. The Japanese public's perceptions of Nakamura and his repatriation at the time differed considerably from those of earlier holdouts, such as Hir≈ç Onoda, who had been discovered only a few months earlier and was both an officer and ethnically Japanese. As a private in a colonial unit, Nakamura was not entitled to a pension after a 1953 change in the law on pensions, and thus received only the minimal sum of ¬•68,000 (US $227.59 at the time, US $ in ). This caused a considerable outcry in the press, motivating the Taiwanese government and the public to donate a total of ¬•4,250,000 to Nakamura.

The main objectives are the creation of a Transnational Cooperation Network of Mediterranean Gothic architecture through travelling exhibitions, the creation of scale models and a website. In particular, the purpose of the site is to facilitate a virtual access to some monuments that are not easy to visit physically or in a very poor state of preservation. In fact, some do not exist anymore but have been rebuilt with computer-aided architectural design of remaining elements. The following institutions have also taken part in this project: Directorate of Byzantine and Postbyzantine Monuments (Greece Ministry of Culture), Arsenale di Palermo, Sicily (Italy), Hipocausto-Gabinete de Presta√ßao de Servi√ßos (Portugal), International Tourism Institute (Slovenia) and Instituto Cervantes (Spain). Numerous institutions (museums, universities, institutes) as well as individual researchers have also participated in this project. Mediterranean Gothic Model of Olocau Church (Valencia) by Carlos Mart√≠nez View of the Cloister of the Cathedral of Segorbe(Valencia) 1/50 model by Carlos Mart√≠nez Video screenshot: The building of a Gothic staircase. The Castel Maniace castle-residence in Sicily, the Bellver on Majorca, and the Castel Nuovo in Naples; in the cathedrals in Nicosia, Palma de Majorca, Girona or Albi; in the churches in Slovenia, √âvora or Palermo; in the fourteenth- century palaces in Rhodes, Dubrovnik, Malta or Valencia, certain common stylistic features emerge that link them to this period in the history of architecture that we have come to call the Gothic. In reality, parallel to the re-emergence of classical forms, a coherent Gothic period emerged in the Mediterranean from the early 13th century until well into the 16th century. Picking up the thread of a chapter of architecture whose monuments are scattered around a vast geographical area, and whose historiography is shared among different countries, is invariably a team effort. Currently, different teams of researchers are working independently in different groups. This project's goal is to create a network of research and dissemination on Mediterranean Gothic architecture that will enable this knowledge to be shared and spread. In the Mediterranean, stylistic features readily intertwine with its contemporary mediaeval architecture in central and northern Europe. However, the buildings are often quite distinct. Not surprisingly, the mediaeval architectural styles in the Mediterranean were built following traditions from the late Roman era. The ruined buildings from the ancient world scattered around the Mediterranean were the building manuals for whoever wanted to read them. The presence of an interesting Manual on Practical Geometry, or Geometria fabrorum, conveyed by guilds and workshops, characterise this episode in architectural history. The oft-repeated quote by Roman architect and treatise writer, Vitruvius, gains meaning once again. Architectura nascitur ex fabrica et ratiocinatione, that is, architecture is born (and thus must be studied) from action and reason. It is obvious that construction technique alone does not define a culture, yet it is also true that its very presence is the product of an initial, decisive choice. Applying reason to it shows the evolution of ideas about and the history of architecture. For this reason, the architectural technology in this chapter in the history of architecture is particularly insightful for us. Virtual views Gothicmed travelling exhibition in Athens Gothic kitchen's door, virtual view (Trinity Convent Valencia) Model of the Trinity convent of Valencia Study of the Gothic art and architectural landscape in the Mediterranean with travelling exhibition and conference. The action of Gothic monuments panoramic views are one of the most challenging actions of the project, since it has shown to put in practice a real exchange of experience between photographers of the different participating countries. Each of the project partners has produced panoramic pictures that are being installed in the virtual gallery of the site. A tour through a borderless, virtual museum can be made through the open halls, which correspond to each of the sponsors of the project: Valencia Region, Greece, Sicily, Alentejo, Slovenia and the initiatives promoted by the Instituto Cervantes. Images of the monuments can be accessed via each of these halls by a virtual tour (panoramic images) or a guided tour (a text written by specialists, accompanied by layouts). Other sections include a library, news and links with other related websites. Upload onto Internet novel images inserted into virtual views of the most prominent monuments in this architectural style. These virtual views have been created through panoramic photographs, pictures galleries and videos. Texts have also been written with other images and drawings by specialists in the field, and the scientific community will have access to specialised books and articles online. GOTHICmed obviously cannot replace seeing and enjoying Mediterranean Gothic architecture firsthand, but it does encourage it to be visited and allows knowledge about it to be enhanced. Moreover, all the partners have been invited to produce wooden scale models of the Gothic monuments or parts of monuments, like Gothic staircases, in order to be shown in the travelling exhibition which has been the more time consuming activity of the project, since it has been necessary to join efforts of an interdisciplinary team of professionals. All these models are at a scale of 1/50 and have been displayed on wooden pedestals. A total of 10 models travelled to each of the project's locations in the framework of the travelling exhibition in Valencia (ES), √âvora (PT), Palermo (IT), Ljubljana (SI) and Athens (GR).

He won races at the highest level both home and abroad, most notably winning the Mile Championship (twice), Yasuda Kinen, and Sprinters Stakes in Japan and the Prix Jacques Le Marois in France. Taiki Shuttle was honored as the Japanese Racing Association's (JRA) Champion Sprinter in both 1997 and 1998, and was named the Japan Horse of the Year in 1998, along with Champion Older Male Horse. In 1999, he was inducted into the JRA Hall of Fame. Background Foaled in the United Stakes, Taiki Shuttle is a flaxen chestnut horse with a large white star, bred and owned by Taiki Farm. Taiki Shuttle is a son of Devil's Bag, the 1983 American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse. His dam, Welsh Muffin, a daughter of Caerleon, was a stakes winner in Ireland. During his racing career he was trained by Kazuo Fujisawa. Racing career  1996 and 1997  Taiki Shuttle was originally slated to enter Fujisawa Stable's Miura training center in the fall of his juvenile year, but the schedule was delayed due to leg injury and hoof suppuration. He entered Fujisawa stable on February 5, 1997. Even after he entered the area, he was troubled by moyamoya disease in his legs, and the condition deteriorated with training, so his debut was again delayed. His connections' patience paid off as Taiki Shuttle broke his maiden at first asking in a maiden race at Tokyo Racecourse on April 19, 1997 going 1600 meters on dirt, and won his next two races, including the Shobu Stakes on turf. He tasted defeat in his fourth start when running second to Tenzan Storm in the Bodaiju Stakes at Hanshin Racecourse. Taiki Shuttle won his first graded stakes next in the Group 3 Unicorn Stakes. He would not be defeated again until his final race. He then won the Group 2 Swan Stakes as a prep race for the Mile Championship, a prestigious mile race in Japan, which he won. He then won the Sprinters Stakes to close out the year. He was named Best Sprinter or Miler of 1997 by the Japanese Racing Association.  1998  Taiki Shuttle opened 1998 with a win in the Group 3 Keio Hai Spring Cup in May. The next month he won the Group 1 Yasuda Kinen. After the Yasuda Kinen, Taiki Shuttle shipped out to France to run in the Group 1 Prix Jacques Le Marois. He won the race and then went on to win his second Mile Championship. In his final career race, he tried to repeat in the Sprinters Stakes, finishing third behind Meiner Love. Taiki Shuttle was named Horse of the Year, Best Sprinter or Miler, and Best Older Male of 1998 by the Japanese Racing Association. Honours Taiki Shuttle was voted Japan's Champion Sprinter/ Miler in 1997 and 1998. In the latter year he has also named Japanese Champion Older Male Horse and Japanese Horse of the Year. He has been inducted into the Japan Racing Association Hall of Fame. Retirement and stud career Taiki Shuttle stood his stallion career at stud at Arrow Stud in Shinhidaka (former Shizunai), Japan. He periodically shuttled to East Stud in Hokkaido. Taiki Shuttle was pensioned from breeding and moved to Kimura Farm in 2018, a retirement facility for racehorses connected with East Stud and Versailles Farm. He was moved to the farm along with Meisho Doto, another pensioned stallion. The two underwent successful castration in January of 2019. On September 15, 2019, the manes of Taiki Shuttle and Rose Kingdom, a fellow JRA Champion, were mysteriously cut by an unknown person. It appeared that a sharp tool had been used to cut the hair, but the horses were otherwise unharmed. The farm filed a report with the Hokkaido Police and ceased visitation to the farm for security and investigative purposes. Taiki Shuttle's notable progeny include: * Win Kluger (2000) winner of the NHK Mile Cup (Jpn-I) in 2003. * Meisho Bowler (2001) winner of the February Stakes (JPN-GI) in 2005. * Summer Wind (2005) winner of the JBC Sprint (Jpn-I) in 2010.

He is also the co-creator of the Kingdom Hearts series. He served as corporate executive of the company's 1st Production Department during its entire existence. Biography Early Work Hashimoto previously worked for the toy company Bandai. He joined Square Enix in 1995, which is where he currently works. Final Fantasy He was the promotions producer for Final Fantasy VII. When asked at E3 2008 about the possibility of a remake of Final Fantasy VII, he said that Square Enix is aware fans would like that, and that they are very busy making other titles first. As Final Fantasy X-2 and Kingdom Hearts were being completed, the learning experience the team had during the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII project spawned the Fabula Nova Crystallis series which was supposed to build on it. Kingdom Hearts When Square was sharing a building in Tokyo with the Disney corporation, Hashimoto found himself conversing in an elevator with a Disney executive, and there they conceived the crossover between Square Enix and Disney called Kingdom Hearts. Hashimoto has stated that the new features in Kingdom Hearts II were the result of the success of the first game and Disney's increased trust in Square Enix to pull off an excellent product. Other games While working on Front Mission Evolved, one of the challenges was balancing the speed of the real time battles the wanzers, or mechs, were having so that the game was realistic to the mechs size, but also still fast enough to be engaging. Priorities While discussing Final Fantasy XIII, Hashimoto mentioned that Square Enix has been attempting to make localization of their game releases close the release gap between Japan and the rest of the world.

Morocco controls and administers the rest of the disputed territory and calls these lands its Southern Provinces. The SADR government considers the Moroccan-held territory to be an occupied territory.

Saharan trade routes circa 1400, with the modern territory of Niger highlighted * Spanish Sahara - name used for the modern territory of Western Sahara when it was ruled as a colonial territory by Spain between 1884 and 1975. ** Ifni War - series of armed incursions into Spanish West Africa by Moroccan insurgents and Sahrawi rebels that began in October 1957 and culminated with the abortive siege of Sidi Ifni. ** Polisario Front emerges - formally constituted on May 10, 1973 with the express intention of militarily forcing an end to Spanish colonization. *** El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed - first Secretary General of the Polisario Front. ** Green March - strategic mass demonstration in November 1975, coordinated by the Moroccan government, to force Spain to hand over the disputed, autonomous semi-metropolitan Spanish Province of Sahara to Morocco. The demonstration of some 350,000 Moroccans advanced several miles into the Western Sahara territory, escorted by near 20,000 Moroccan troops, and meeting very little response by the Sahrawi Polisario Front. ** Madrid Accords - treaty between Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania to end the Spanish presence in the territory of Spanish Sahara, which was until the Madrid Accords' inception a Spanish province and former colony. ** Tropas N√≥madas - auxiliary regiment to the colonial army in Spanish Sahara composed of Sahrawi tribesmen, equipped with small arms and led by Spanish officers, guarding outposts and sometimes conducting patrols on camelback. Following the Spanish Government's decision to hand over the territory to Morocco and Mauritania towards the end of 1975, numbers of them deserted. Many of the Tropas N√≥madas soldiers are believed to have joined Polisario and Spanish-trained fighters formed the core of the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army set up to fight Morocco and Mauritania after the Green March. ** 1975 United Nations visiting mission to Spanish Sahara - United Nations General Assembly in 1975 dispatched a visiting mission to the territory and the surrounding countries, in accordance with its resolution 3292 (December 13, 1974), to assist in the decolonization process. * Western Sahara conflict - ongoing conflict between the Polisario Front of the Sahrawi people and the state of Morocco. The conflict is the continuation of the past insurgency by Polisario against the Spanish colonial forces in 1973-1975 and the subsequent Western Sahara War between the Polisario and Morocco (1975‚Äì1991). ** Western Sahara War - armed struggle between the Sahrawi Polisario Front and Morocco between 1975 and 1991, being the most significant phase of the Western Sahara conflict. *** Polisario declaration of independence - took place in 1976, establishing the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. *** Sahrawi refugee camps - set up in the Tindouf Province, Algeria in 1975-76 for Sahrawi refugees fleeing from Moroccan forces. With most refugees still living in the camps, the refugee situation is among the most protracted ones worldwide. *** First Battle of Amgala (1976) - Units from the Algerian Army were attacked by units from the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces on the night of 27 January. Algeria claimed their troops were providing food and medical supplies to refugees at Amgala, while Morocco said the Algerian troops were heavily armed and were aiding Polisario. *** Settlement Plan - agreement made in 1991 between the Polisario Front and Morocco on the organization of a referendum, which would constitute an expression of self-determination for the people of Western Sahara, leading either to full independence, or integration with the kingdom of Morocco. It resulted in a cease-fire which remains in effect (more or less) to this day. *** United Nations Security Council Resolution 690 - adopted unanimously on 29 April 1991, established MINURSO (see below) to implement the Settlement Plan (see above). **** United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) - UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara established in 1991 under United Nations Security Council Resolution 690 as part of the Settlement Plan, which had paved way for a cease-fire in the conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front (as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic) over the contested territory of Western Sahara (formerly Spanish Sahara). ** Independence Intifada - series of disturbances, demonstrations and riots that broke out in May 2005 in the Moroccan-occupied parts of Western Sahara and south of Morocco. *** Gdeim Izik protest camp - protest camp in Western Sahara established by a group of Sahrawis on 9 October 2010 and lasting into November, with related incidents occurring in the aftermath of its dismantlement on 8 November. It has been suggested by Noam Chomsky, that the month-long protest encampment at Gdeim Izik constituted the start of the Arab Spring, traditionally considered to be the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia on 17 December 2010. *** 2011 Western Saharan protests - began on 25 February 2011 as a reaction to the failure of police to prevent anti-Sahrawi looting in the city of Dakhla, Western Sahara, and blossomed into protests across the territory. They were related to the Gdeim Izik protest camp in Western Sahara established the previous fall, which had resulted in violence between Sahrawi activists and Moroccan security forces and supporters. * Former members of the Polisario Front  Demographics of Western Sahara  Demographics of Western Sahara  Culture of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic  Culture of Western Sahara National symbols * National symbols of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ** Coat of arms of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ** Flag of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ** National anthem of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic * Public holidays in the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic Culture * Languages of Western Sahara * National symbols of Western Sahara ** Coat of arms of Western Sahara ** Flag of Western Sahara ** National anthem of Western Sahara * Public holidays in Western Sahara * Religion in Western Sahara ** Christianity in Western Sahara ** Hinduism in Western Sahara ** Islam in Western Sahara ** Sikhism in Western Sahara * World Heritage Sites in Western Sahara: None  Art in Western Sahara  * Music of Western Sahara ** Sahrauis: The Music of the Western Sahara * Television in Western Sahara  People of Western Sahara  = Persons and personalities = *Djema'a *El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed *James Baker *Ma El Ainin *Marrack Goulding *Mohammed VI of Morocco *Mohamed Abdelaziz *Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar Sports in Western Sahara  Sports in Western Sahara * Football in Western Sahara ** Sahrawi Football Federation ** Sahrawi national football team ** Sahrawi Republic Cup  Economy and infrastructure of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic  Economy of Western Sahara * Economic rank, by nominal GDP (2007): *Currency of Western Sahara: Dirham **ISO 4217: MAD * Health in Western Sahara * Transport in Western Sahara ** Airports in Western Sahara ** Rail transport in Western Sahara ** Roads in Western Sahara Communications of SADR Communications in Western Sahara * Sahara Press Service * Internet in Western Sahara ** .eh  Education in the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic  Education in Western Sahara * Zawiya * Universities in Western Sahara ** University of Tifariti  See also  *List of international rankings *Outline of Africa *Outline of geography *Outline of Western Sahara  References   External links  ; Official SADR pages * * Sahara Press Service (SPS) * RASD TV * SADR National Radio * SADR Oil & Gas 2005 ; Overviews *BBC - Country profile: Western Sahara *CIA World Factbook - Western Sahara * ; News *allAfrica.com - Western Sahara news headline links *The Yahoo!

Career McHugh came from a theatrical family. His parents ran a stock theatre company and, as a young child, he performed on stage. His brother, Frank, who went on to become part of the Warner Bros. stock company in the 1930s and 1940s, and sister Kitty performed an act with him by the time he was fourteen years old, but the family quit the stage around 1930. His brother Ed became an agent in New York.The Unsung Joe Matt made his Broadway debut in Elmer Rice's Street Scene in 1929, along with his brother Ed, and also appeared in Swing Your Lady in 1936.

A pioneer synthesizer player (Serge, Buchla, Moog), Jackson was aboard the Greenpeace V as part of the media campaign to demonstrate whale intelligence, and to disrupt Russian whaling. Jackson played a large modular synthesizer that had been brought onboard, broadcast through underwater speakers, with the intention of communicating with whales through synthesized whale song.Weyler, Rex.

His son Viscount Hinchingbrooke, the incumbent MP for the constituency of South Dorset, was subsequently elevated to the peerage, becoming the 10th Earl of Sandwich. Following the Peerage Act 1963, the 10th Earl disclaimed his peerages in 1964, becoming Victor Montagu, but never sat in the House of Commons again. Candidates The campaign coincided with a period when the United Kingdom was negotiating to join the European Communities (\\"Common Market\\"). The application was later vetoed by Charles de Gaulle in 1963. Viscount Hinchingbrooke was staunchly against joining the Common Market, while the Conservative candidate, Angus Maude, had to back the official party pro-Common Market policy. The issue resulted in a local Conservative, Sir Piers Debenham, standing as an anti-Common Market candidate with the support of Viscount Hinchingbrooke. Independent candidates Burn, Fudge and O'Connor were all serving in the British Armed Forces. The law stated that, on standing in a Parliamentary election, they would be released from the Forces; this was, therefore, a way to receive an early honourable discharge, for the cost of a lost deposit. The practice was banned the following year.F. W. S. Craig, Minor Parties at British Parliamentary Elections, p.129 A total of seven candidates stood for election; this matched the then by-election record, which had been set at the 1920 Stockport by-election, and was not beaten until the 1976 Walsall North by-election. Result The by-election took place on 22 November 1962, and resulted in a gain for the Labour Party from the Conservatives. Guy Barnett was elected with a majority of 704, overturning a 6,693 Conservative majority at the 1959 general election, and with 33.5% of the poll, one of the lowest winning vote-shares at a by-election vote. The 5,000 votes for Piers Debenham proved decisive, although the increase in the Liberal Party vote was also important. Debenham lost his deposit, gaining 12.3% of the votes against the 12.5% required. Angus Maude was subsequently elected to Parliament in the Stratford by-election in 1963, after the resignation of John Profumo following the Profumo affair. At the 1964 general election Guy Barnett was defeated by the Conservative candidate Evelyn King by 935 votes. He returned to parliament in 1971, for Greenwich, following a by- election there. Piers Debenham died in 1964, just before the 1964 general election.

Toward the end of the decade, Mitchell began touring Europe as well as the United States, concentrating on the United Kingdom and France. He did solo percussion shows in addition to ensemble programs, and his drum solos were greeted harshly by French audiences. Nevertheless, his ensemble spent five years as the house band of the Casino de Paris. He recorded for Pathe Records in 1922 and 1923; Sidney Bechet played with him at this time, though Bechet did not appear on the recordings.

He commanded an artillery brigade at the Battle of Gettysburg while only a lieutenant. He played an important role in the defense of Culp's Hill against attacking Confederates.  Early life and career  Muhlenberg was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to the prominent Muhlenberg family. He was an 1850 graduate of Yale University. He was engaged until September 1857 as a civil engineer on various railroads and canals in Pennsylvania. In September, 1857, he sailed for Brazil in company with several other civil engineers and artisans to assist in the construction of the Dom Pedro Segundo Railroad, which ran westward from Rio de Janeiro.Plumey, Colton, & Bissell, pp. 61‚Äì62.  Civil War  Several months after outbreak of the Civil War, Muhlenberg returned to the United States and enlisted in the Union Army in Philadelphia. He became a second lieutenant in the 4th U. S. Artillery in October 1861. He was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant on October 22, 1861. Muhlenberg served with Battery F of that regiment at the First Battle of Winchester, May 24‚Äì25, 1862. He commanded the battery at the Battle of Cedar Mountain. Muhlenberg retained command at the Battle of Antietam, where he served in the artillery of XII Corps under Capt. Clermont L. Best. After the death of Lt. Franklin B. Crosby, who was senior to him, Muhlenberg resumed command of the battery while serving with XII Corps. At the Battle of Chancellorsville, he commanded batteries attached to Brig. Gen. John W. Geary's division. They were deployed near Chancellorsville itself, protecting the left of XII Corps. At one point, Muhlenberg had 20 guns to direct. Later some of these guns were redeployed from this position to Best's concentration facing Confederate batteries at Hazel Grove. When Captain Best became inspector general of the corps on the staff of Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, Muhlenberg assumed command of the artillery brigade. Although only a first lieutenant, he was senior to the commanders of the other batteries. (Lt. Sylvanus T. Rugg commanded Battery F while Muhlenberg commanded the brigade.) In the role of brigade commander, Muhlenberg served at the Battle of Gettysburg, especially in the defense of Culp's Hill. Slocum did, however, assign Claremont Best to oversee deployment of the corps‚Äô guns on the morning of July 3, 1863, when a counter attack was made on Confederate forces occupying part of the hill. Muhlenberg fought at the Battle of Missionary Ridge under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. He then became the adjutant general and quartermaster of the 4th U.S. Artillery on August 13, 1864, and stayed in the Regular Army following the end of the war in April 1865. He resigned on May 8, 1869.  Postbellum career  After his military service ended, Muhlenberg resumed his career as a civil engineer. He was employed on the Kansas and Pacific Railroad from September 1856 to September 1867. He came East and was employed in the construction of the Reading and Wilmington Railroad until January 1870. He served as the engineer of the 1871 Yellowstone survey. His appointment was blamed on Senator Simon Cameron, and he was faulted for having a drinking problem. From June 1871 until January 1872, he surveyed the Texas and Pacific Railway from Fort Phantom Hill to Fort Bliss on the Rio Grande.Plumey, Colton, & Bissell, p. 62. When he died of Brights Disease in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in March 1883, Muhlenberg was described by a newspaper report as a retired major of artillery.Tuesday, March 27, 1883, The Wellsboro Agitator, Wellsboro, Tioga County, Pennsylvania (accessed May 31, 2008). Muhlenberg never married. He was a member of the German Baptist Brethren Church.Falkenstein, p. 64.

He also served several times as minister and as President of the Senate of Chile. Y√°√±ez was born in Santiago, the son of Manuel Antonio Ya√±ez and of Mar√≠a Josefa Ponce de Le√≥n. He coursed his liberal arts studies at the Instituto Nacional, and then enrolled in the Universidad de Chile, where he pursued a career in Law. He obtained his degree as a lawyer in 1883. He soon became known as one of the most versed men around when it came to knowledge and interpretation of laws, and he also had very sound reasoning; the cases (cause) he won in court, where he was highly respected, are thanks to these qualities. His level of prestige was such that his opinions were considered decisive, and were sought out by professionals and magistrates for the resolution of complicated matters. His unquestionable calling as a jurist led him to develop, along with Ricardo Passi Garcia, a Compilation of Current Laws and Decrees (1884), which was very well received. At the same time, he published articles in several different newspapers, most of them judicial in nature (for example On electoral freedom () and the Forensics magazine (). This passion for the articles he wrote transformed him into a figure of journalism at the time. At the time he was practicing as a lawyer and working as a journalist, Eliodoro Ya√±ez was appointed as the rapporteur for the Appeals Court of Santiago (1889). He entered the Liberal party and became a board member in 1893. One year later he was elected deputy for Valdivia and La Union, position he was reelected to on several occasions until 1903. He was vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1894 and 1895. Also, he was elected a senator for Valdivia in 1912 and reelected for several terms until 1930. His parliamentary work was prolific, to such a point that it is said that while he remained in Congress, there were no bills that had not been proposed, studied or reviewed by him. Ya√±ez believed that progress in journalism was fundamental in strengthening democracy. Due to this, he was not only the editor of several printed media from that time, but he also performed a great contribution to the country by founding ‚Äìalong with senators Alfredo Escobar Campa√±a, Augusto Bruna Valenzuela and Abraham Silva- the La Naci√≥n newspaper, the first issue of which was published on January 14, 1917. The new newspaper was characterized for defending liberal ideas, having an excellent presentation and using educated language. In addition, La Nacion acquired other newspapers, like Los Tiempos (The Times) (1921) and the Correo de Valdivia (The Valdivia Post) (1924). In addition to being a member of parliament, he was a State minister on several occasions. Between 1901 and 1902, under the administration of German Riesco, he held the position of minister of Foreign Relations, Cult and Colonization and he was subrogate minister of the Treasury. Fifteen years later, he served as minister of the Interior for Juan Luis Sanfuentes‚Äô government between 1917 and 1918. During this period he signed the law that introduced reforms to the Constitution of 1833. He died in Santiago in 1932.

In 1978, CJCH got a boost to 25,000 watts around the clock, making it Halifax's second highest powered AM station after CFDR, which was at 50,000 watts.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-527 Top 40 and Classic rock Through the 1960s and 70s, CJCH was a popular Top 40 station, the first to play all contemporary hits in the Halifax area. In 1983, it began broadcasting in AM Stereo, the first in Atlantic Canada. In the 1970s, it had a rivalry with CHNS in the Top 40 format. However, in the 1980s, listening to contemporary music shifted to the FM dial. In 1986, CJCH flipped to an oldies- based adult contemporary format, as it focused on listeners who had grown up with the station but were now over 40. In August 1993, the station switched to a Classic rock format as Arrow 92 (with Arrow standing for All Rock and Roll Oldies). In January 1994, CJCH switched its moniker to All Rock and Roll Oldies 92/CJCH. In May 1995, it flipped to a hybrid talk and oldies format; by the end of that year, the talk programming took over the entire schedule, and was branded as News/Talk Radio 920/CJCH. Sports and Oldies (2001-2007) In 2001, CHUM Limited started a sports radio network known as The Team. CJCH joined this network and became The Team 920 on May 7 of that year.Team 920 Sports Network Launch May 7th, 2001 Halifax On August 27, 2002, The Team network was shut down and CJCH flipped to an oldies format, becoming AM 920/CJCH - Yesterday's Favourites. In July 2006, CHNS, an oldies station since February 1992, switched to the FM band and adopted a classic rock format (now airing classic hits). As a result, CJCH became the only oldies station in Halifax. Its oldies format was unique in that it ran a mid-morning call-in program called The Hotline with host Rick Howe (now with CJNI-FM). Moving to FM, \\"The Bounce\\" (2007-2016) In 2007, CTVglobemedia acquired CJCH and CIOO. On August 31, 2007, CTVglobemedia applied to the CRTC to move CJCH to 101.3 FM. The CRTC approval was given on November 30, 2007.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-410 The application originally indicated that CJCH would retain its oldies format. Industry Canada required a three-week test on 101.3 FM, which began on May 8, 2008. former CJCH logo as a news/talk station \\"101.3 The Bounce\\" logo (2008-2016) On May 30, 2008, at 10:00 a.m., the last oldies song finished playing on 920 CJCH as the station went silent on AM. The new station launched on 101.3 FM with a Top 40/CHR format, branded as 101.3 The Bounce. The first song aired was Kanye West's \\"Stronger\\". The station did not take advantage of its right to simulcast on both frequencies for three months as is customary in such cases. The new FM station was in direct competition with CKHZ-FM, which had a musical direction leaning to Rhythmic and Dance product, targeted towards young adults. CJCH-FM's \\"Bounce\\" logo and fonts were patterned after CHBN in Edmonton, which, until 2010, was under the same ownership as CJCH. With CKHZ adopting an Adult Top 40 direction in March 2013 (which lasted until it flipped to Country music in September 2015), CJCH moved towards a Rhythmic-leaning direction, but remained within the Mainstream CHR realm. The move was also in part to avoid overlapping with co-owned CIOO, though the two stations share some titles. On April 1, 2011, Bell Canada completed its acquisition of 100% of the shares in CTVglobemedia it didn't already own and named the new division Bell Media. \\"Virgin Radio\\" (2016-present) First Virgin Radio logo (2016-2019) On July 26, 2016, CJCH- FM began promoting a \\"major change\\" to the station to take place on July 29 at 1:00 p.m.. At that time, after playing \\"Sorry\\" by Justin Bieber, CJCH-FM rebranded as 101.3 Virgin Radio, becoming the ninth station in Canada to use the \\"Virgin\\" branding (CFCA-FM in Kitchener rebranded as \\"Virgin\\" at the same time as CJCH). The first song on \\"Virgin\\" was \\"This Is What You Came For\\" by Calvin Harris (featuring Rihanna).

The MCI was intended as a modest improvement over the earlier canned C-ration, with inclusion of additional menu items to reduce monotony and encourage adequate daily feeding and nutrition. Heavy for their content, they were eventually phased out in favor of the Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE). Although the MRE was formally adopted as the Department of Defense combat ration in 1975, the first large-scale production test of the MRE did not occur until in 1978, with the first MRE I rations packed and delivered to Army stores in 1981. MCI rations continued to be issued when the MRE was introduced until inventories were depleted. The MCI consisted of a rectangular cardboard carton containing one small flat can, one large can, and two small cans. It consisted of an \\"M\\"-unit can (meat-based entree item), a \\"B\\"-unit (bread item) composed of the Crackers & Candy Can and the flat Spread Can, and a \\"D\\"-unit can (dessert item). The M-1, M-3, B-1, B-2, D-2, and D-3 unit cans were small and the M-2, B-3, and D-1 unit cans were large. The ration cans were packed upright, with the flat Spread can over the large can on the left side and the two small cans were stacked one over the other on the right side (the lighter one over the heavier one). On top was the brown foil Accessory Pack and a white plastic spoon wrapped in clear plastic. Each carton contained a single complete meal providing approximately 5,000 kJ (1,200 kilocalories or 1,200 kcal), with a packaged weight of DCSP Philadelphia, Article and volume of . The label of the ration carton was printed across the lid of the rectangular box in three rows. The first row always read \\"MEAL, COMBAT, INDIVIDUAL\\". The second row indicated the name of the meat unit in bold capital block letters (e.g., \\"TURKEY LOAF\\") and the third row indicated the \\"B\\"-unit number (either B-1, B-2 or B-3 Unit) in bold capital block letters. Sometimes there was a smaller fourth line of type at the very bottom of the cover that either indicated the contractor who made the ration or the manufacturer that made the cardboard box itself. The ration boxes were shipped in a rectangular cardboard packing case. Each packing case contained 12 ration cartons (containing one of each meal) packed in two rows of six rations. They were grouped in three menus of four meals each, organized by their \\"B\\"-unit (B-1, B-2, and B-3). It also contained four paper-wrapped P-38 can openers to open the cans. Each packing case weighed and had a volume of . Early cases were bound with baling wire, but late Vietnam War and post-war cases were bound in plastic strapping. Menus Meat unit The \\"M\\" unit came in 12 basic varieties grouped in three menus of four different entrees (later supplemented by \\"alternative\\" variant entrees). Taking into account slight differences in preparation or meat, a total of 18 entrees were available over time: *M-1: Beefsteak, Chicken or Turkey Loaf, Chopped Ham & Eggs, or Ham Slices (Cooked in Juices or Fried). M-1A: Tuna fish. *M-2: Meat Chunks w/ Beans in Tomato Sauce, Ham & Lima Beans, Beef Slices w/ Potatoes in Gravy (Beef and Boulders), or Beans w/. Frankfurter Chunks in Tomato Sauce. M-2A: Spaghetti w/ Meatballs in Tomato Sauce. *M-3: Beef in Spiced Sauce, Boned Chicken or Turkey, Chicken w/ Noodles in Broth, or Pork Steak Cooked in Juices. M-3A: Meat Loaf. Ham and Lima Beans was irreverently known throughout the armed forces as \\"Ham and Motherfuckers\\" (or other variants such as \\"Beans and Motherfuckers\\", \\"Ham & Claymores\\", \\"Ham & Lifers\\"). Beans with Frankfurter Chunks in Tomato Sauce was called \\"Beanie Weenie\\" or \\"Beans and Baby Dicks\\". Bread unit The \\"B\\" unit came in three different varieties: *B-1: Seven crackers and two chocolate discs (Types: Solid Chocolate \\"also known as Lifer Bars\\", Chocolate Creme, or Chocolate Coconut). **Peanut Butter Spread. *B-2: Four Hardtack Biscuits (often referred to by troops as \\"John Wayne cookies\\") and a cookie sandwich or fudge disc. **Cheese Spread (Types: Processed Cheese w/ Pimentos or Processed Cheese w/ Caraway Seeds). Spread Alternative: Plain Cheddar Cheese. *B-3: Four Cookies and a packet of Cocoa powder. **Jam Spread (Types: Apple, Mixed Berry, Seedless Blackberry, Mixed Fruit, Grape, or Strawberry). It was used with the bread in the D-3 can. Dessert unit The \\"D\\" unit came in three different types: *D-1 (Fruit): Halved apricots, sliced peaches, quartered pears, or fruit cocktail. D-1A (Fruit): Applesauce. *D-2 (Cake): Pound Cake, Fruitcake, or Cinnamon Nut Roll. D-2A (Cake): Date Pudding or Orange Nut Roll. *D-3 (Bread): White bread. (There were no alternatives). Each menu was grouped by their unit number (i.e., M-1, B-1 and D-1 items were grouped together). Alternative items (designated with an \\"A\\" suffix) were introduced to provide variety and reduce the monotony. For variety, the M-1 and M-3 units (since they both used small cans) were often switched. The \\"B\\"-unit's Crackers & Candy can was lined with a piece of corrugated cardboard to protect the contents from damage. In the \\"D\\"-unit, the white bread came in one solid cylindrical piece wrapped in wax paper, while the pound cake, fruitcake, Orange Nut Roll, and Cinnamon Roll came wrapped in paper wrappers like cupcakes. The Accessory Pack came with salt, pepper, sugar, instant coffee, non-dairy creamer, two pieces of candy-coated chewing gum, a packet of toilet paper, a four-pack of commercial-grade cigarettes, and a book of 20 cardboard moisture-proof matches. Typical commercial brands issued in the cigarette ration were: Camel, Chesterfield, Kent, Kool, Lucky Strike, Marlboro, Pall Mall, Salem, or Winston. Due to health concerns, cigarettes were eliminated from the accessory packs in 1975.Westheider, James E., The Vietnam War, Greenwood Publishing Group (2007), , , p. 86 Repackaging In 1967 there were changes in packaging to help standardize the ration. The B cans were now all small sized. Postwar additions The B-1 unit added Chocolate-Toffee, Chocolate-Vanilla, and Chocolate with Peanuts discs. The B-2 unit jam spreads were expanded with the addition of Blackberry Jam, Peach Jam, and Pineapple Jam. The B-3 unit added a Vanilla Fudge disc and Hickory-Smoked Processed Cheese Spread. The D-2 units added a Cherry Nut Roll and a Chocolate Nut Roll. Field reports Although the MCI had been designed as improvement over the earlier Type C or C ration of World War II and Korea, with the inclusion of additional menu items, it was still designed for infrequent use, to be regularly supplemented with fresh Type A (Garrison) and canned Type B (Field Kitchen) rations.Alspach, Rita (Maj), Gagne, Susan D., and Meyer, Alice, NEW AND IMPROVED: T-Ration and MRE Development, Quartermaster Professional Bulletin (December 1988) This goal was rarely achieved in the field, and some Army and Marine forces in Vietnam would operate for two weeks or more while consuming only the MCI ration or other processed, canned foods. The new ration had some curious superstitions attached to it during the Vietnam War. The \\"Ham & Lima Beans\\" entree, disliked since Korea,Granfield, Linda, I Remember Korea: Veterans Tell Their Stories of the Korean War, 1950-53, Clarion Books (2003), , 9780618177400, p. 48 was detested by U.S. soldiers and Marines, who considered even pronouncing the correct name brought bad luck, instead calling it \\"Ham and Motherfuckers\\".Peavey, Robert E., Praying for Slack: A Marine Corps Tank Commander in Vietnam, Zenith Imprint Press (2004), , , p. 189Ham and Muthas: More Info on C rations, http://17thdivision.tripod.com/thepeacethatwasnt/id20.htmlGranfield, Linda, I Remember Korea: Veterans Tell Their Stories of the Korean War, 1950-53, Clarion Books (2003), , 9780618177400, p. 48: In Korea and in Vietnam, U.S. and allied troops often attempted to give away the hated Ham & Lima Bean cans to civilians, who frequently refused them or even threw them back at the troops. US Marines, paratroops, infantrymen, and armored vehicle crewmen, particularly AMTRAC (Amphibious Tractor) personnel, believed that halved apricots were bad luck to eat during combat operations.Donner, Bob (S.Sgt), Taste For Apricots Canned At Cua Viet, Stars and Stripes (1968), http://www.amtrac.org/1atbn/Interest/Apricots.asp The peanut butter issued in the B-1 unit was unappetizing to some and was often discarded, but was consumed by those with diarrhea, as it was certain to stop a case of \\"the runs\\".Peavey, Robert E., Praying for Slack: A Marine Corps Tank Commander in Vietnam, Zenith Imprint Press (2004), , , p. 190 Soldiers in Special Operations units hoarded B-1 peanut butter in empty ration cans to make improvised smoke candles while on long patrols.Vortisch, Hans-Christian. \\"GURPS SEALs in Vietnam\\", Steve Jackson Games (2007), SJG37-0603. Being extremely oily, the peanut butter burned with ease, and could be used to boil water for coffee, although it left a greasy black stain on the bottom of the canteen cup. Other menu items were more popular, such as the pound cake, canned pears, and the spaghetti & meatballs.Ehrhart, W.D., Vietnam-Perkasie: A Combat Marine Memoir, with contrib. H. Bruce Franklin, University of Massachusetts Press (1995), , , p. 200Westheider, James E., The Vietnam War, Greenwood Publishing Group (2007), , , pp. 85-86 In 1973, Army Colonel Henry Moak was issued a MCI ration during his stay in Vietnam. Included in the MCI ration was a can of pound cake, manufactured in 1969. He kept the unopened can and vowed to eat the pound cake when he retired from the Army. On July 24, 2009, with news media and dignitaries in attendance, Moak opened the forty- year-old can and ate the contents. He noted that the pound cake still looked and smelled like fresh pound cake. Throughout the Marine Corps 'Beef Slices w/ Potatoes' were known as \\"Beef and Rocks\\" due to their half-cooked texture caused by the chemically maintained integrity of the potato slices to prevent disintegration during storage and \\"Beans with Frankfurter Chunks in Tomato Sauce\\" were more commonly referred to as \\"Beans and Baby Dicks\\". While Marines in general praised pound cake, particularly with fruit cocktail, most detested fruitcake and generally handed it off to less discriminating unit members. Within the Army during the Vietnam War, 'Beef Slices w/ Potatoes' were often referred to as \\"Beef and Shrapnel\\". \\"C-Rat\\" Boonie Stove The small \\"B\\"-unit can was often made into an improvised field stove that could be carried in the cargo pockets of a set of combat fatigues. This was done by making a series of diagonal cuts around the top and bottom edges of the can with a P-38 can opener or a standard can opener to allow the trioxane fuel tablet to burn evenly and warm the entr√©e. Small balls of C-4 plastic explosive were often substituted for the fuel tablet, as it produced a hotter flame. The ball was smaller than an inch in diameter with a small tit pinch on it to light it by. Heating of canned meat items was often accomplished by inserting the can into the exhaust of a running truck where it would jam into the curved exhaust pipe end, warming it to a palatable temperature and de- congealing the grease. A second variation that was used by those with ready access to diesel fuel was to take a \\"church key\\" (also a needed item to open beer or soda cans) and make the same series of holes around the top sides of the can. Then, cardboard from the packaging box would be rolled them up and placed into the can so that it just came to the top of the can. The can is dipped into the fuel tank of a source of diesel fuel, then lighted. The cardboard acted as a wick for the fuel and the can can be used to heat the rations as well as make tea or coffee. One \\"stove\\" was good for at least three or more men to heat their meal and make their coffee with one fueling.Richard L Hurd, 534th Trans, 4th Trans, USAVN, 1970-1971 End of the MCI ration Though it had been given a new name, the MCI was in essence still the canned C ration of prior years. Selecting the MCI ration for all field issue resulted in limiting troops in the field to a single class of heavy wet packaged ration that despite meal variances, was simply not suitable for extended consumption. As they had in World War II and Korea, soldiers and Marines regularly complained of the monotony of a single class of field ration, especially where field mess A and B rations were not available for extended periods of time. Despite the inclusion of additional menu items, the MCI was still designed only for \\"infrequent use\\" (unlike later individual rations, which would be required to pass a new field test of seven consecutive days of consumption as the sole diet without complaints of monotony).Alspach, Rita (Maj), Gagne, Susan D., and Meyer, Alice, NEW AND IMPROVED: T-Ration and MRE Development, Quartermaster Professional Bulletin (December 1988) The overuse of the canned ration culminated during the Vietnam War, where American troops frequently resorted to the extreme of placing stacked ration cans inside empty G.I. socks to save bulk and reduce noise on patrol, while enemy forces improved mobility by carrying lightweight rations of dry rice in scarves.Kearny, Cresson H., Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 286-288 Primarily implemented due to cost concerns, the decision to standardize on a single canned wet individual ration resulted in a severe weight penalty for troops marching on foot through the jungles of Vietnam while carrying a multi-day supply of MCI cans, adversely affecting combat readiness and increasing soldier fatigueWhite, Terry, The SAS Fighting Techniques Handbook, Globe Pequot Press (2007), , , p. 28: \\"A [special operations] team could become virtually immobile due to the weight of needed supplies...Mobility and stealth are decreased when loads become too heavy, and the soldier is too often worn down by midday. Fatigue affects alertness, making him more vulnerable to detection and error.\\" (a typical complete individual ration of cans for one day weighed five and a half pounds).Westheider, James E., The Vietnam War, Greenwood Publishing Group (2007), , , p. 86White, Terry, The SAS Fighting Techniques Handbook, Globe Pequot Press (2007), , , pp. 27-28: In contrast, fast-moving NVA forces operating in jungle were supplied daily rations weighing a total of approximately 2.7 pounds. Many combat soldiers and Marines, already overburdened, carried the minimum amount to save weight on operations until the next resupply drop; when the drop was delayed, they went hungry. The failure of the Quartermaster Corps and its Subsistence Branch to develop a suitable lightweight general-purpose ration after World War II, combined with the absence of a dehydrated, very lightweight dry ration for jungle environments led directly to the hurried development of the Long Range Patrol, or LRP ration in 1966.

His Villa Henny, designed in 1914, was one of the earliest modernist houses and one of the first to be built out of reinforced concrete. From 1917 he was an influential member of the De Stijl movement. Although he was born to a comfortable middle-class background, married a wealthy heiress, and for a while was able to subsidise the publication of the De Stijl journal, van 't Hoff was a member of the Communist Party of the Netherlands in the years following World War I. Following the failure of Pieter Jelles Troelstra's call for a socialist revolution in the Netherlands in 1919, van 't Hoff split from De Stijl's founder Theo van Doesburg and withdrew from artistic activity, declaring himself an \\"ex-architect\\" in 1922, and spending much of the rest of his life promoting experimental anarchist communities. Life Early life and education Van 't Hoff was born in Rotterdam, the son of an eminent bacteriologist, and grew up in comfortable and cultured middle class circumstances. His mother had an interest in the visual arts and was a friend of the painter Willem Witsen (Willem Arnoldus Witsen), while his father was a friend of the psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden. From 1898 Robert accompanied his parents on visits to van Eeden's utopian Walden commune near Bussum. The family moved to Bilthoven in 1904. The following year Robert assisted with the building of a house for one of his aunts and decided to train as an architect. In 1906, on the advice of an architect friend of his father's, van 't Hoff travelled to England to study architecture at the Birmingham School of Art, which had been a major centre of the Arts and Crafts Movement since its reorganisation by Edward R. Taylor in the 1880s. Studying under William Bidlake, he came under the influence of the theories of William Lethaby and the work of the Glasgow School, and worked in the progressive architectural practice of Herbert Tudor Buckland. From 1911 to 1914 van 't Hoff studied at the Architectural Association in London, where he became a friend of the cubist and futurist painter David Bomberg and through him became acquainted with the work of the avant-garde Omega Workshops. Early career Villa Verloop, Huis ter Heide. 1915‚Äì1916. Huis ter Heide, Utrecht. 1915‚Äì1919. Van 't Hoff's first built works were designed while he was still based in England. L√∏vdalla ‚Äì a house built for his parents in Huis ter Heide near Utrecht and completed in 1911 ‚Äì featured an informal cluster of gables reminiscent of some of Buckland's work in Edgbaston, while De Zaaier was a model farmhouse built in Lunteren and completed in 1912, with a more distinctively Dutch design. Van 't Hoff's third house, built for the artist Augustus John at 28 Mallord Street, Chelsea, London, after the two met by chance in the pub, was both designed and built in 1913. In 1913 van 't Hoff was given a copy of a German translation of Frank Lloyd Wright's Wasmuth Portfolio by his father. This made a profound impression and in June 1914 he travelled to the United States to see Wright's work in person, visiting the Unity Temple, Taliesin, Midway Gardens, the Larkin Administration Building and Wright's suburban houses in Oak Park, Illinois. Van 't Hoff and Wright discussed collaborating on a project for an art gallery on Long Island, New York that van 't Hoff had become involved with through his relationship with Augustus John, but the project did not progress and van 't Hoff returned to Europe. Van 't Hoff's first work on returning from the United States was the Villa Verloop ‚Äì a summer house in Huis ter Heide whose design bore the unmistakable influence of Wright's Prairie Houses. More remarkable however was his next work ‚Äì the Villa Henny ‚Äì which was a highly idealistic and experimental house in both design and execution. One of the earliest houses to be built entirely out of reinforced concrete, the Villa Henny made full use of the aesthetic freedom this presented with a flat roof, overhangs, receding walls and a highly geometrical outline that presented an unambiguously modern profile compared to the rustic naturalism of his earlier designs. The Villa Henny established van 't Hoff with the international avant-garde as a major figure in the emerging modern movement, gaining an influential and appreciative review from the architect Huib Hoste in De Telegraaf and attracting the attention of the emerging De Stijl group. De Stijl Banister post, c. 1919.Van 't Hoff probably met De Stijl founder Theo van Doesburg some time in mid-1917. Their radical views on art and society had a natural affinity and by the end of the year van 't Hoff was in regular correspondence with van Doesburg and other members of the movement including Vilmos Husz√°r and J. J. P. Oud. Over the next two years he was to write five articles for the De Stijl journal ‚Äì three radical essays on the future of architecture and two critical pieces on buildings by Jan Wils and Antonio Sant' Elia. Van 't Hoff went on to support the journal financially after van Doesburg split from its original publisher over his insistence on installing a separate architecture editor. The range of van 't Hoff's design work also broadened around this time: he published designs for banister posts and chairs, and in 1918 designed a houseboat, which he christened De Stijl and in which he and his wife lived shortly after their marriage in July. This was conceived as an attempt to \\"further the new direction\\" and he was involved in every aspect of the interior and exterior design including the furniture and fittings. Van 't Hoff's preference for Bart van der Leck over van Doesburg for the painting of the interior was the first sign of tension between the two, but a commission for van Doesburg from van 't Hoff for a colour scheme for the interior of a house he was designing for the pacifist and anarchist Bartholomeus (Bart) de Ligt in Lage Vuursche suggested that there was no serious split. During 1918 and 1919 van 't Hoff's ideological stance hardened in the light of the recent Russian Revolution. His design work at this time moved away from private houses and consisted largely of unrealised designs for prefabricated mass housing in association with the Utrecht architect P. J. C. Klaarhamer. In 1919 he joined the Communist Party of the Netherlands and was active in arranging an exchange programme with artists in the Soviet Union, making his political stance clear in a letter to fellow communist Chris Beekman: \\"I myself am convinced we will get a Soviet government, albeit that the transition will take a toll of some of our lives\\". Van 't Hoff's attempts to influence the De Stijl group in a more avowedly political direction met with frustration, however. The first De Stijl manifesto, published in November 1918, was interpreted by most of the group's members as a largely artistic statement, rather than the revolutionary document van 't Hoff sought. Van't Hoff criticised Van Doesburg in the summer of 1919 for exhibiting individually rather than maintaining an exclusive commitment to the De Stijl collective. In October 1919 Van Doesburg failed to circulate a petition demanding free postal interchange with the Soviet Union that had been signed by leading Dutch artists and designers and this prompted van 't Hoff to make a final and decisively split from both De Stijl and van Doesburg, remarking that \\"In Russia they execute such people\\". Later life Disillusioned with the revolutionary potential of the artistic avant- garde, van 't Hoff sold his houseboat and moved to Laren in North Holland in 1920, where he built two small houses for himself and his parents that were largely devoid of the abstract aesthetic ambitions of his earlier works ‚Äì one even had a thatched roof. Although these featured some furniture and interior design work by Beekman and Rietveld, van 't Hoff had distanced himself from his earlier artistic lifestyle. The tenth anniversary issue of De Stijl featured an open letter signed \\"Robert Van. ('t Hoff)., ex-architect.\\" In 1922 van 't Hoff moved to London with his family, spending most of the following five years promoting his communist and anarchist ideas in England and frequenting the British Museum Reading Room. In 1926 he published an anonymously authored social and political manifesto called Abolition, in which he called for a mass uprising.Broekhuizen, D., \\"Abolition (1926). Robert van 't Hoffs visioen van een revolutie\\", in: Jong Holland 1996, nr 3, pp. 38‚Äì46 In 1928 he was invited by the American radical philanthropist Charles Garland to redesign the buildings on his utopian commune in Coopersburg, Pennsylvania. The two disagreed over the proposed designs, however, and within nine months the van 't Hoff family had returned to Laren. Van 't Hoff retained some links with De Stijl during this period ‚Äì continuing his correspondence with J. J. P. Oud, meeting Piet Mondrian in Paris in 1931 and financing the final issue of the De Stijl journal in 1932. The ill health of their daughter led the van 't Hoffs to move to Davos in Switzerland in 1931, but in 1937 they returned to England to settle permanently in Hampshire. The bombing of Coventry in 1940 profoundly touched van 't Hoff, who knew the city from his days studying in Birmingham and designed a large communal housing association building in the hope that the city could be rebuilt in accordance with his progressive ideals. In general, however, his last years in England were marked by increasing reclusiveness. The architect realised his last work in New Milton, (Hampshire, U.K.). He designed an interior for his study in his own house in 1960. The atmosphere in the study was very similar to the interior of the houseboat De Stijl (1917). When the house was demolished in 2006, this interior was donated to the Kroller-Muller Museum in Otterlo (The Netherlands) by Van 't Hoff's daughter Megan.Broekhuizen, D. (ed.), Robert van 't Hoff.

In 1936 construction of an air field for the Luftwaffe was completed. However, no permanent buildings and structures were erected, indicating that there were no plans for a permanent air field. The base was used during World War II by several Luftwaffe units including night fighters. After the end of World War II the air field was abandoned. Beginning in 1957 works started to convert the former air force base into an air base to house units of the recently formed German Army's Aviation Corps, utilising the facilities of the previous occupant. These final works were completed in 1962 after which numerous units were stationed at Niederstetten Air Base. Currently, the air base is home of Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 of the German Army. The regiment, which was relocated to Niederstetten in 1980, is part of German Army's Airmobile Operations Division, the division's headquarters being in Veitsh√∂chheim. Approximately 750 members of the armed forces are at present employed at the air base. However, due to further restructuring within the German Army Aviation Corps this number was increased by 600 in 2011. Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 is equipped with helicopters of the type Bell UH-1D. These helicopters are being replaced by medium-sized NH90s, 32 of which will be stationed at Niederstetten Air Base. To accommodate the new aircraft an extensive building program started in 2007, the first result of which was the completion of a hangar to house 8 helicopters of the type NH90 in February 2008. The air base is also used for civilian purposes, particularly for business flights and recreational purposes. In order to comply with EU regulations and to retain permission for civilian use, the runway was extended by 200 metres in 2011.

Landays (or landai) often criticize traditions and gender roles.  History  Afghan culture values literature very highly, particularly classical Persian literature and Pashto literature and poetry. Landays were likely brought into Afghanistan by Indo-Aryans around 1700 CE. The short songs became popular among farmers and nomads. Landai are traditionally performed by women. Form There are few formal properties. Each landay consists of a single, twenty-two syllable couplet. There are nine syllables in the first lines, and thirteen syllables in the second. In Pashto, the poem ends on a \\"ma\\" or \\"na\\" sound. The lines do not generally rhyme. They are thought to be related to shloka.

It is most associated with (but not restricted to) the operatic coloratura vocal style. It consists of a single phrase, or could even be part of a longer phrase. It is more extended than ornaments such as a trill, mordent or turn, but not to the extent that it could be called a cadenza (which is usually more than one phrase and is extended enough to be considered a musical section in itself).

Gl√ºcksburg Castle, on the site of the former Ryd Abbey  History  Ryd Abbey was settled by the Cistercians of Esrum Abbey in 1210. The monastic community originated however in St. Michael's Abbey in Schleswig, a Benedictine double monastery which had become disorderly, with a reputation for immorality and drunkenness. In 1192 Nicholas I, the de facto officiating Bishop of Schleswig, therefore moved the monks to a remote site, where they established Guldholm Abbey. This was not a success, and the monks were moved again to the site at Munkbrarup. This coincided with the arrival in Denmark of the then new and severe Cistercian order, to whom the bishop entrusted the new foundation, with a substantial endowment. The monastery was thus at last placed on a stable footing and prospered under the more rigorous discipline of the Cistercians. Later in the century however the abbey acquired unwelcome notoriety because of the abbot Arnfast, who was accused of murdering King Christopher I of Denmark by giving him poisoned communion wine on 29 May 1259 in Ribe Cathedral, in retaliation for the king's imprisonment and mistreatment of the Archbishop of Lund, Jacob Erlandsen. In the following year Archbishop Jacob named Arnfast bishop of Aarhus, but the pope made another appointment and Arnfast never assumed office.Arnfast. Nordisk Familjebok. 1904 Arnfast was declared an enemy of the new king, Erik V, and fled to √òm Abbey. When the king came to hear of it, he accused the monks at √òm of harboring a criminal, but despite a search throughout Denmark's monastic houses, Arnfast could not be located.McGuire, Brian P.: Conflict and Continuity In 1433 the abbey was granted the lucrative right to the income from the pilgrimage chapel at a miraculous hermitage nearby, the Klues. At its greatest extent the monastery precinct measured 350 meters long and 200 meters wide. It consisted of a church and cemetery, hospital, guest house, farm and a wing for lay brothers, with kitchen and refectory. Annales Ryenses The abbey is perhaps best known as the place of origin of the Annales Ryenses, or the Annals of Ryd (), which chronicles the history of Denmark from the legendary King Dan to King Erik VI (Erik Menved). The chronicle was started not long after the Cistercians took over Ryd Abbey and ends in 1288. It is clear from the writing that the writers were southern Jutlanders and thus have a slightly different perspective from that of other contemporary chroniclers. The tone is distinctly anti-German. Along with Saxo's Gesta Danorum, the Annales Ryenses constitutes one of the main Danish sources for the history of the Middle Ages. Dissolution The monastery was suppressed in 1538 after Denmark had become officially Lutheran on 30 October 1536. The monks were turned out of the monastery and scattered: some simply went to work on farms; others travelled south to seek shelter in other Cistercian monasteries in Germany. Gl√ºcksburg Castle The abandoned buildings fell quickly into disrepair. In 1582 Duke John the Younger of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg ordered the remains to be demolished, and had the stone reused for the construction of Gl√ºcksburg Castle, which still occupies the site. Archaeology The site has been investigated archaeologically a number of times, most recently in 2005, when excavations under the drained castle lake found numerous artefacts, the foundations of the monastic buildings and church and the monastic cemetery.

Career Elizabeth Stafford's parents were staunch Protestants, and on 29 March 1555, during the reign of the Catholic Mary I, they took their two children, Elizabeth and Edward, in the company of a cousin, Elizabeth Sandys, into exile. In 1556 they were in Geneva, where on 4 January 1556 the Protestant reformer, John Calvin, stood as godfather to their youngest son, John Stafford, and where Sir William Stafford died, and was buried on 5 May of that year. After Sir William Stafford's death a dispute ensued with Calvin over the custody of his godson, John Stafford, and Dorothy Stafford 'managed to escape' with her children, in the company of Elizabeth Sandys, to Basel, where the Stafford family were neighbours of the Protestant reformer John Knox. In November 1558 Queen Mary died and Elizabeth I acceded to the throne, and on 14 January 1559 Dorothy Stafford and her children left Basel for England. The family took up residence for a time at Waltham, Essex. Elizabeth Stafford joined her mother, Dorothy, in Queen Elizabeth's privy chamber on 28 November 1568. In 1578, during a progress through East Anglia, the Queen stayed at the manor house Hawstead Place at Hawstead which Elizabeth Stafford's husband, Sir Sir William Drury, had recently rebuilt. According to Thomas Churchyard, ‚Äòa costly and delicat dinner‚Äô was put on for the occasion, and tradition has it that during the visit the Queen dropped a silver-handled fan into the moat.. Both Lady Drury and her husband exchanged New Year's gifts with the Queen in 1579, Sir William's gift being a pair of black velvet mittens, while Lady Drury's gift was an embroidered forepart of cloth of silver..

By 1588, through the influence of Lord Willoughby, then in command of English forces in the Low Countries, Drury was appointed Governor of Bergen-op-Zoom in the Netherlands, but was replaced by Thomas Morgan. Drury was then sent as colonel over 1000 men under Lord Willoughby to the assistance of Henry IV of France. En route he quarrelled with Sir John Borough over precedence, and a duel ensued in which Drury sustained an injury to his arm, and first lost his hand to gangrene and then his arm by amputation. He died soon afterwards. Drury, Sir William (1550‚Äì90), of Hawstead, Suffolk Retrieved 10 March 2013. Drury's body was brought back to England, and he was buried in the chancel of Hawstead church.

It is named after a former underground quarry which was part of a network of tunnels used by forces of the British Empire and Commonwealth during the First World War. Opened in March 2008, the museum commemorates the soldiers who built the tunnels and fought in the Battle of Arras in 1917. History Frontline at Arras immediately prior to the assault. From the Middle Ages through to the 19th century, the chalk beds underneath Arras were extensively quarried to supply stone for the town's buildings. The quarries fell into disuse by the start of the 20th century. In 1916, during the First World War, the British forces controlling Arras decided to re-use the underground quarries to aid a planned offensive against the Germans, whose trenches ran through what are now the eastern suburbs of the town. The quarries were to be linked up so that they could be used both as shelters from the incessant German shelling and as a means of conveying troops to the front in secrecy and safety. 500 miners from the New Zealand Tunnelling Company, including MƒÅori and Pacific Islanders, recruited from the gold and coal mining districts of the country, were brought in to dig of tunnels. They worked alongside Royal Engineer tunnelling companies, made up by now of British coal miners and expert tunnellers who had built the London Underground. Many of them were \\"Bantams\\", soldiers of below average height who had been rejected from regular units because they did not meet the height requirements; others had been initially rejected as too old, but their specialist mining experience made them essential for the tunnelling operation. The work was difficult and dangerous. In the New Zealand units alone, 41 tunnellers died and another 151 were injured during countermining operations against the Germans, whose own tunnellers sought to disrupt the Allied tunneling operations. The Arras tunnels linked the quarries to form a network that ran from the town centre, under no man's land, to a number of points just in front of the German front lines. The tunnel system could accommodate 20,000 men and were outfitted with running water, electric lights, kitchens, latrines, a light rail system and a fully equipped hospital. The tunnellers named the individual quarries after their home towns - Auckland, Wellington, Nelson, Blenheim, Christchurch and Dunedin for the New Zealanders, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Crewe and London for the Britons. (For a map of the Arras underground system, see here.) Thousands of soldiers were billeted in the tunnels for eight days prior to the start of the Arras offensive on 9 April 1917. At 05:30 that morning, exits were dynamited to enable the troops to storm the German trenches. The Germans were taken by surprise and were pushed back . This counted as an extraordinary success by the standards of the time. However, the offensive soon bogged down and it was eventually called off after casualties reached 4,000 a day. During World War II, the tunnels were re-opened to serve as air raid shelters. They were sealed again in 1945 and were largely forgotten until their rediscovery in 1990. Much of the network has now collapsed and most of the rest is extremely unsafe. With the sponsorship of the Arras town council, the regional council and the French state, one section around the Carri√®re Wellington was restored and converted into a museum at a cost of ‚Ç¨4 million. Museum The Carri√®re Wellington museum consists of a visitor centre displaying historic artifacts and presenting the historical context of the Battle of Arras, including the work of the tunnellers and the military strategy that underlay the tunnels' construction. It was opened to the public on 1 March 2008. The tunnels are accessed via a lift shaft that takes visitors approximately 22 m (70 ft) under the ground inside the galleries of the underground quarry. The tour consists of both guided and audioguided tours on a planned path accessible for wheelchairs. The visitors discover the development of the strategy of the Battle of Arras, and also the daily life of the tunnelers of New-Zealand and the soldiers of the British Expeditionnary Forces sent in these tunnels to prepare this battle. The site is also a memorial dedicated to the battle of Arras, with a memorial wall remembering all the regiments involved in the battle of Arras. Since the Hundred Years of the battle in 2017, a second memorial wall is dedicated to portraits of NZ Tunnellers, and a statue was installed in the park for the remembrance of these tunnellers. Each year, a ceremony is organised at 6.30 am on April 9th. The museum opened in 2008. Between 2008 and 2013, it has welcomed 45 000 visitors per year. Since 2014, the affluence increased to 70 000 visitors each year.

Also shown are the insular cortex (purple), the brain stem (black), and the cerebellum (blue). The frontal lobe of the human brain is both relatively large in mass and less restricted in movement than the posterior portion of the brain. It is a component of the cerebral system, which supports goal directed behavior. This lobe is often cited as the part of the brain responsible for the ability to decide between good and bad choices, as well as recognize the consequences of different actions. Because of its location in the anterior part of the head, the frontal lobe is arguably more susceptible to injuries. Following a frontal lobe injury, an individual‚Äôs abilities to make good choices and recognize consequences are often impaired. Memory impairment is another common effect associated with frontal lobe injuries, but this effect is less documented and may or may not be the result of flawed testing. Damage to the frontal lobe can cause increased irritability, which may include a change in mood and an inability to regulate behavior. Particularly, an injury of the frontal lobe could lead to deficits in executive function, such as anticipation, goal selection, planning, initiation, sequencing, monitoring (detecting errors), and self-correction (initiating novel responses).Lezak M.D. (1989). Assessment of psychosocial dysfunction resulting from head trauma. In: Lezak MD, editor. Assessment of the behavioral consequences of head trauma. New York (NY): A. R. Liss; 113‚Äì43. A widely reported case of frontal lobe injury was that of Phineas Gage, a railroad worker whose left frontal lobe was damaged by a large iron rod in 1848 (though Gage's subsequent personality changes are almost always grossly exaggerated). Neuropsychological effects Midsagittal cross-section of a human brain. The portion in color is the left frontal lobe, damaged in Phineas Gage's accident. Memory and attention Patients with damaged frontal lobes often complain of minimal to substantial memory loss. Because of this, frontal lobe injuries have long been associated with memory problems, despite little evidence actually showing this relation to be true. In fact, when patients with such injuries are tested using standard memory tests, they often score within normal. Close relatives of these same patients, however, may describe substantial memory problems. The disparity occurs because it is not the memory system itself that is affected, but the functions of the frontal lobe that facilitate working memory. Working memory is closely involved with the ability to hold attention.Broadway, J.M., Redick, T.S., & Engle, R.W. (2010). \\"Working memory capacity: Self-control is (in) the goal.\\" In R. Hassin, K. N. Ochsner, & Y. Trope (Eds.), Oxford University Press: New York, NY. Self-control in society, mind, and brain; 163-173. Retrieved from http://psychology.gatech.edu/renglelab/Publications/2010/Broadway%20Redick%20Engle%202010.pdf Working memory is not simply how much information you can maintain in a brief period of time; this describes primary memory, and a small part of working memory relates to it. The important part of working memory is secondary memory, in which an individual retrieves information. Those with high working memory are able to perform this retrieval even when distracted by another task. Patients with damaged frontal lobes show lower working memory and, therefore, a lessened ability to retrieve information from their secondary memory.Kane, M.J. & Engle, R.W. (2002). \\"The role of prefrontal cortex in working memory capacity, executive attention, and general fluid intelligence: An individual-differences perspective.\\" Psychonomic Bulletin & Review 9(4), 637-671. Retrieved from Risk taking An increase in impulsivity, risk taking or both is often seen in individuals following frontal lobe damage. The two related terms differ in that impulsivity is a response disinhibition, while risk taking is related to the reward-based aspects of decision- making.Floden, D., Alexander, M.P., Kubu, C.S., Katz, D., & Stuss, D.T. (2008). \\"Impulsivity and risk-taking behavior in focal frontal lobe lesions.\\" Neuropsychologia 46, 213-223. Retrieved from http://www.psych.yorku.ca/joelab/jc/journalclub/gambling/2008Floden%20et%20al_RaymondMar_GamblingTask%202008.pdf Put more simply, an impulsive person will make a decision quickly, without considering the consequences, leading ultimately to a lack of self-control. Contrarily, risk takers will look at the consequences but not weigh them; they will jump at the opportunity of a reward even if the likelihood of receiving that reward is slim. The increase of risk taking amongst damaged frontal lobe patients can be directly observed during gambling, and gambling tasks have been developed to measure such behavior. Diagnosis A screenshot from a computerized version of the Iowa gambling task A screenshot from a computerized version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. In both forms of the saccade test, every eye movement is tracked, even small movements like the ones shown in this animation. Types of tests Before more advanced technology came about, scientists tested individual behavior using more low- tech means. As technology progressed, so did the tests scientists administer to evaluate a person's cognitive function.Purves, D. (2008). ‚Äò‚ÄôNeuroscience‚Äô‚Äô (4th ed.). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, Inc. In testing the behavioral effects of a frontal lobe injury, many of the tests are still very simple and do not involve greatly advanced technology. =Gambling task= This test has an inverse relationship between the probability of obtaining a reward and the value of the reward itself; that is to say, a low probability but a high reward or a high probability but a low reward. Thus, actual gambling skills are not being tested, but simply the preference for high reward despite the risks. In one of the ways to carry this out, a set of cards will be presented face down to the individual being tested; one of the cards would be the winning card, and all the others, losers. Cards will then be continuously removed from the pile and added back in randomly, during which time the winning card could be anywhere. Subjects being tested are told they can stop the process at any time and have the cards flipped over; if the winning card is present within the pile they win points. The catch, however, is that more points are awarded when less cards are present; but when less cards are present, the probability of the winning card being within the pile is less. Risk takers are those that go for the higher reward (more points), even though they are less likely to actually receive that reward. They choose a higher, less likely award, over a lower, more probable reward. Subjects that have experienced a frontal lobe injury show just such behavior when tested. =Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)= The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) can be used in conjunction with other tests to speculate to possible dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, the front-most area of the frontal lobe, that plays an important role in executive functioning. However, since the age of modern medicine and brain imaging, the WCST has been purported to be inaccurate and inconclusive in diagnosing frontal lobe damage. The WCST test is supposed to specifically measure an individual's competence in abstract reasoning, and the ability to change problem-solving strategies when needed. =Saccade= A saccade is a fast movement of the eyes in a certain direction. In the most simplistic form, there are two types of saccade tests administered in which the only requirement is movement of the eye: the prosaccade and the antisaccade.Unsworth, N., Engle, R.W., & Schrock, J.C. (2004). \\"Working Memory Capacity and the Antisaccade Task: Individual Differences in Voluntary Saccade Control.\\" Journal of Experimental Psychology 30(6), 1302-1321. Retrieved from http://www.interactivemetronome.com/impublic/Research/Temporal%20Processing/MemoryWorkingMemory/Research_Working%20Memory_Unsworth2004.pdf In the prosaccade, participants are required to quickly look toward a point in response to some attention-catching cue, such as a flashing light. Because there are very powerful evolutionary forces that work to automatically focus attention toward prepotent (greater in power) stimuli, this type of test does not call upon an individual‚Äôs executive control; therefore, the prosaccade is not relevant when testing the effects of frontal lobe damage on executive cognitive control and working memory. Conversely, the antisaccade test requires not only ignoring the flashing cue, but looking in the opposite direction. This task calls for inhibition of a prepotent response as well as planning and executing an eye movement that contradicts instinct. In the anti- saccade test, an individual has to set the goal of ignoring these instincts and continue to ‚Äò‚Äômaintain‚Äô‚Äô this goal. Those with frontal lobe injuries show lower working memory, and therefore typically do not test well in the antisaccade test. Flaws in Testing While impulsivity and risk-taking behavior are both commonly observed following a frontal lobe injury, such traits are hard to evaluate and quantify without some degree of subjectivity. The definitions of these traits are themselves not completely straightforward, nor are they always agreed upon. As a result, the methods to measure such behaviors often differ, and this should be taken into consideration when comparing data/results from different sources. Because of this, caution should be taken in how to interpret different results. It is also important to remember that a single test, such as the WCST, cannot be used to measure the effects of a frontal lobe injury, or the aspects of cognitive function it may affect, such as working memory; variety of tests must be used. A subject may be good at one task but show dysfunction in executive function overall. Similarly, test results can be made misleading after testing the same individual over a long period of time. The subject may get better at a task, but not because of an improvement in executive cognitive function. He/she may have simply learned some strategies for doing this particular task that made it no longer a good measurement tool. Patients with damaged frontal lobes often complain of minimal to substantial memory loss, even though when such patients are tested using standard memory tests, they often score within normal. The disparity could be the result of the limits of these standardized tests. Just as likely, the scientific community may not be comparing the right groups of people. Little is understood about frontal lobe functions facilitating memory, but what is clear is that more in-depth research of brain injury patients is needed. Because most research compares those with brain injuries (whether frontal lobe or not) and those without, the scientific community is unsure whether certain memory impairment is specific to frontal lobe injuries, or just traumatic brain injuries in general. There are many factors to consider when examining the effects of a traumatic brain injury, such as the nature of the injury as well as its cause; but the severity of the injury seems to be most important in affecting memory impairment specific to frontal lobe damage. Those patients suffering a mild traumatic brain injury with frontal lobe damage seem to be only slightly affected, if affected at all. Frontal lobe injuries have been shown to cause decreased ability in combining events that are temporally separated (separated by time), as well as recalling information in its correct context. However, standardized testing may mask or exaggerate a possible impairment because the patients are strictly regulated, as are their discretionary behaviors. Many times, these are behaviors thought to be directly related to disorders of the frontal lobe, when in fact, these patients are suffering from a different problem entirely, such as paying attention, anxiety, sleep disorder, etc. The main conclusion that can be agreed upon is that tests should continuously be scrutinized; as society progresses, better tests should be designed. Without the proper tests to assess traumatic brain injury patients with frontal lobe damage in particular, we may be misrepresenting the functions of the frontal lobe, specifically the role it plays in memory.

IGI are commonly performed manually by physicians operating instruments, such as needles, based on medical images and are used in most medical fields, particularly in the specialty area of interventional radiology. IGI robots assist in manipulating the instrument or provide guidance for image-navigation. These robots have the potential to improve the performance of IGI because unlike humans, robots are digital devices that may directly communicate with the digital imagers. MRI compatibility To be MRI compatible, a robot needs to safely operate and perform its functions within the magnetic field of the MRI without deteriorating the image quality. Thus, the development of MRI robots is a very challenging engineering task because MRI scanners use magnetic fields of very high density (3 teslas is now common), and most of the components commonly used in robotics may not be used in close proximity of the magnet. Researchers have attempted to overcome the difficulties of robotic components in MRI in a variety of ways; some have placed controls and other magnetic sensitive units outside the shielded room of the MRI. These controls will be connected to the robot by either hydraulic or pneumatic transmission lines. Aside from the difficulties of robotics use in the large magnetic fields found with MRI, the small gap between the MRI and the patient limits the physical size of robots used as the inner radius of an MRI is typically 55 cm. In addition to the robot itself, there must be a way to track the position, orientation and force being applied to the instrument. Though this may potentially be done with continuous MRI, some uses of MRI robots may make continuous MRI undesirable due to potential interference between the MRI robot and the changing magnetic fields used in MRI. Many times this tracking is done using some sort of optical system which may include fiber optics.  Testing  Before an MRI robot can be used in a clinical setting, various tests must be performed and at various stages. Testing must be performed both during the engineering stages and through clinical trials. The tests performed will change dependent on the usage of the MRI robot. Some robots will be used under continuous imaging while others may only be imaged in intervals. Some of the tests performed while engineering an MRI robot would include material tests and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In a material test, the materials used for the robot are tested in magnetic fields to insure no interference exists between the material and magnetic field. One form of interference would be inducing a current in the robot's wires. This current could inhibit robot control- ability. Additionally, certain materials could cause an artifact or distortion on MR images. Some metals that have been shown to not produce artifacts on MR images include titanium and brass. After an MRI robot has been constructed, tests must be done while imaging. One measurement to be made is SNR. SNR is a very important measurement in imaging. If the noise is too high compared to the signal, the image quality will suffer. SNR will be measured both when the MRI robot is moving and while stationary. There can be a noticeable difference in SNR between a stationary and moving robot. Before testing on human patients, MRI robots are typically tested using an imaging phantom, a typical test \\"subject\\" used in imaging. These tests can be used to assure instrument placement accuracy. Advantages Though engineering MRI robots can be challenging, MRI robots have many advantages. One large advantage of using MRI as the imaging modality is the patient isn't exposed to radiation as they would be from computed tomography (CT scan) and x-ray imaging. MRI also has better image quality than other imaging modalities and is better able to distinguish between cancerous and health cells then ultrasound imaging. MRI compatible robots could greatly change IGI. Currently, most IGIs are a multi- step process. Initially the patient must be imaged in order to decide the best location to begin the procedure. After this scan, the patient is moved to make any necessary incisions and prepare for their operation. The patient is then scanned again to ensure proper alignment of the instruments. If the instruments aren't properly aligned, the instrument must be moved, followed by another scan. This process of moving and scanning continues until the correct location and alignment of instruments is obtained. During each scan, the images must be registered again. While using an MRI robot, the instrument could be implemented under continual imaging. As a result, real-time changes in instrument path could be made. Making real-time changes in path would be helpful in correcting needle bending. Needle bending can occur from patient movement and breathing and even from the needle moving through tissue. By not moving the patient, potential sources of needle bending and need for image registration would be minimized. Disadvantages One issue with MRI robots is the potential use of transmission lines. Hydraulic transmission lines can leak and potentially ruin sensitive equipment. Pneumatic transmission lines can have issues with maintaining the necessary pressure to insure adequate response times due to long transmission lines. Aside from the transmission method used, potential differences in the size and shape of MRI rooms could limit the universality of MRI robots, even within multiple MRI rooms in one hospital. Additionally, the length of transmission lines would make setup and removal of MRI robots time consuming. Potential uses MRI robots have many potential uses. These include brachytherapy, biopsy, neuroscience research and tumor removal. One type of tumor removal that would greatly benefit from MRI robots is brain tumor removal. Brain tumors are extremely difficult to remove. There is also the potential to not completely remove the tumor. By using real- time imaging, the whole brain tumor would have a greater chance of being removed. Within neuroscience, MRI robots could be used to help better understand if a stroke victim will be responsive to robot-aided rehabilitation and other rehabilitation methodologies. Using functional MRI (fMRI) or other forms of functional neuroimaging methods, researchers can monitor and notice changes in functional connectivity within the brain. When using fMRI, an MRI robot would be used to help mimic everyday tasks such as shoulder and elbow movement. Another area where MRI robots could be extremely helpful is in prostate biopsies. Currently, most prostate biopsies are performed using transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). However, approximately 20% of people with prostate cancer who have a biopsy done with TRUS will be told they do not have cancer. One issue with TRUS is that it is unable to differentiate between healthy and cancerous cells. Differentiating between cell types is one of the advantages of MRI. Thus, an MRI robot used for prostate biopsies would assist in correctly diagnosing prostate cancer. Examples The URobotics research group at Johns Hopkins University has developed an electricity-free, non- magnetic, and dielectric robot known as MrBot. This operates with air for the motors and light for its sensors ( YouTube movie). This achievement was possible through the invention of a new type of pneumatic motor, the PneuStep, which allows for simple, fail-safe precision controlled motion. The Automation and Interventional Medicine Robotics Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) has been developing enabling technologies for MRI-guided interventions. This work includes MR-compatible sensors, actuators, software, and controllers. The group has also developed various types of fully MRI- compatible robots for percutaneous prostate interventions and another one for guiding deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode placement under real-time MR image guidance for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease.

The illustration of the plant which accompanied its first description was based on a drawing by Lady Ackland. The genus was named in honour of William Cattley, a prominent British merchant and horticulturist. Cattleya aclandiae is found growing on tree limbs and trunks in the Brazilian state of Bahia. It has a very small natural range and is found growing in the wind southwest of Salvador on elevated plateaus that border the drainage of the Paraguaca River. Its native habitat is seasonally dry forests between 100 and 400 meters in elevation near permanent bodies of water. Cattleya aclandiae is compact and only grows tall. The upright, short, cylindrical pseudobulbs have two fleshy leaves at the apex. Sometimes, purple blotches are found on the leaves when the plants are exposed to intense sunlight. Each growth produces between one and three and the flowers are large for the size of the plant. Flowers are substantial, waxy, and long-lived. Flower color is white or near-white with purple blotches and spots. The lip has a dark purple blotch and the anther cap is yellow. Flowers bloom in the spring and summer on new growths. C. aclandiae has been widely used by orchid breeders to produce compact hybrids. When crossed with other bifoliate cattleyas, the spotted pattern is present in the offspring. Hybrids of this species generally produce plants that flower two or more times per year. Several color varieties of C. aclandiae are known. A coerulea form is available in the orchid trade. The 'Rubra' varieties exhibit intensely deep rose lips with very large dark spots on petals and sepals, these spots often coalescing to appear almost solid deep chocolate brown. The 'alba' varieties have petals and sepals of clear lime green with snow white lips. 'Albescen' varieties have sepals and petals of light green with very pastel spots and white lips with little or no color. The more common forms of c. aclandiae have sepal and petal background colors that range from clear green with dark spots to quite yellow with dark spots. The spotting pattern may be bold, almost solid in some clones to more 'peppered', with lips ranging from light rose to deep rose-purple. In cultivation, C. aclandiae prefers intermediate to warm orchid growing temperatures. Ample water is needed during periods of active growth; less water during the winter. High humidity is appreciated as long as adequate air circulation is present. Grow on cork bark or tree fern mounts or in pots with a coarse, free-draining growing media (fir bark or equivalent).

His research into rare autoimmune brain diseases led to the invention of the HITS-CLIP method to study RNA regulation, and he is developing ways to explore the regulatory portions‚Äîknown as the \\"dark matter\\"‚Äîof the human genome. At The Rockefeller University Darnell is head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology, and Senior Physician at the Rockefeller University Hospital, has been an HHMI Investigator since 1992, and an Adjunct Attending Neuro-Oncologist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was named to the New York Genome Center position on November 28, 2012 a position he held through 2016. His publications can be found via Google Scholar and his ORCID ID 0000-0002-5134-8088.  Career  Darnell's early research was concentrated on paraneoplastic syndromes (PNDs, the paraneoplastic neurologic disorders), disorders touching on various clinical and basic aspects of biology including cancer immunology and neuroimmunology. He was the first to definitively demonstrate that naturally occurring tumor immunity in humans was caused by antigen-specific cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells, helping to generate the foundation for the field of immuno-oncology. His lab was the first to use PND patient antisera to screen expression cDNA libraries to identify the genes encoding the PND antigens. This opened the door to the cloning of the Nova, cdr2 and Elavl (Hu) antigens, and led Darnell to hypothesize, based on the intracellular nature of the antigens, that tumor immunity was mediated by CD8+ T cells. His laboratory went on to prove this hypothesis, demonstrating cdr2-specific CD8+ T cells were present in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with tumor immunity to breast or ovarian cancers. The discovery of that the Nova PND antigen (associated with paraneoplastic opsoclonus-opsoclonus) was the first of a class of neuron- specific RNA-binding proteins led his laboratory to question the nature of RNA regulation in the brain and why it might be co-opted in cancer cells. His laboratory developed the HITS-CLIP technique that is used to map the sites of regulatory interactions between RNA-binding proteins and their target RNA sequences, originally using it to study the Nova proteins and subsequently a large number of other RNA binding proteins that are implicated in brain disease, including FMRP (associated with intellectual disability and autism), RbFox (associated with autism), Mbnl (associated with myotonic dystrophy), Elavl (the Hu PND antigen) and cancer (including RBM47 and Argonaute-miRNA interactions, both implicated in breast cancer). In 2012, Darnell became the founding director and CEO of the New York Genome Center, a not-for-profit multi-institutional academic collaborative founded to harness big data, molecular genetics to improve clinical care in an ethical and equitable manner. The center opened in September 2013 with support and participation from James Watson, Harold Varmus, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Marc Tessier-Lavigne and many others, growing within 2 years to bring a world-class genomic center to New York. In 2016 NYGC was one of four Genome Centers in the United States to be awarded a large grant from the NIH to use genomic sequencing to study common diseases. After securing a $100M philanthropic grant for NYGC and a seven-year Research Program Award from NINDS, Darnell returned to pursue his work on genomic medicine and neuroscience at the Rockefeller University and HHMI in 2017. Darnell received his undergraduate degrees in biology and chemistry in 1979 from Columbia University, and his MD/PhD in Molecular Biology in 1985 from Washington University in St. Louis. He was trained in Internal Medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and in Neurology at Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he was chief resident in 1990 with Fred Plum. He has worked and published extensively with Jerome B. Posner, one of the founders of the study of PNDs, co-authoring a definitive text on the subject. In 2010 he was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, and a Fellow of the AAAS (the American Association for the Advancement of Science), in 2014 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and in 2019 he was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Personal life  Darnell comes from a family of scientists; he is the son of American scientist James E. Darnell, another pioneer in RNA research, the father of Alicia Darnell, a postdoctoral fellow at MIT and second-place winner in the 2007 Siemens Competition in Math, Science & Technology,Following in family‚Äôs footsteps, Alicia Darnell wins national science prize as well as the father of Andrew J. Darnell, MBA, who completed a master's in Bioethics and Science Policy at Duke and graduated from Duke Law School in 2019. Darnell is a passionate amateur cellist; he studied with Gilda Barston, herself a student of Leonard Rose, and Ardith Alton at Juilliard. In 2000, after his mother died of breast cancer, Darnell founded the Chamber Orchestra of Science and Music at Rockefeller University in her honor, saying in an interview with the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Clinical Scientist Award for Translational Research: \\"I love to breathe in music and art...seeing the intensity others put into life is a source of inspiration\\". Darnell is also a triathlete, and has completed the New York City Triathlon every year since 2012 except 2019 when the event was cancelled, and Darnell completed the Atlantic City Ironman.

ZrB2 is an ultra high temperature ceramic (UHTC) with a melting point of 3246 ¬∞C. This along with its relatively low density of ~6.09 g/cm3 (measured density may be higher due to hafnium impurities) and good high temperature strength makes it a candidate for high temperature aerospace applications such as hypersonic flight or rocket propulsion systems. It is an unusual ceramic, having relatively high thermal and electrical conductivities, properties it shares with isostructural titanium diboride and hafnium diboride. ZrB2 parts are usually hot pressed (pressure applied to the heated powder) and then machined to shape. Sintering of ZrB2 is hindered by the material's covalent nature and presence of surface oxides which increase grain coarsening before densification during sintering. Pressureless sintering of ZrB2 is possible with sintering additives such as boron carbide and carbon which react with the surface oxides to increase the driving force for sintering but mechanical properties are degraded compared to hot pressed ZrB2. Additions of ~30 vol% SiC to ZrB2 is often added to ZrB2 to improve oxidation resistance through SiC creating a protective oxide layer - similar to aluminum's protective alumina layer. ZrB2 is used in ultra-high temperature ceramic matrix composites (UHTCMCs). Carbon fiber reinforced zirconium diboride composites show high toughness while silicon carbide fiber reinforced zirconium diboride composites are brittle and show a catastrophic failure. Preparation ZrB2 can be synthesized by stoichiometric reaction between constituent elements, in this case Zr and B. This reaction provides for precise stoichiometric control of the materials. At 2000 K, the formation of ZrB2 via stoichiometric reaction is thermodynamically favorable (ŒîG=‚àí279.6 kJ mol‚àí1) and therefore, this route can be used to produce ZrB2 by self- propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS). This technique takes advantage of the high exothermic energy of the reaction to cause high temperature, fast combustion reactions. Advantages of SHS include higher purity of ceramic products, increased sinterability, and shorter processing times. However, the extremely rapid heating rates can result in incomplete reactions between Zr and B, the formation of stable oxides of Zr, and the retention of porosity. Stoichiometric reactions have also been carried out by reaction of attrition milled (wearing materials by grinding) Zr and B powder (and then hot pressing at 600 ¬∞C for 6 h), and nanoscale particles have been obtained by reacting attrition milled Zr and B precursor crystallites (10 nm in size). Reduction of ZrO2 and HfO2 to their respective diborides can also be achieved via metallothermic reduction. Inexpensive precursor materials are used and reacted according to the reaction below: ZrO2 \\\\+ B2O3 \\\\+ 5Mg ‚Üí ZrB2 \\\\+ 5MgO Mg is used as a reactant in order to allow for acid leaching of unwanted oxide products. Stoichiometric excesses of Mg and B2O3 are often required during metallothermic reductions in order to consume all available ZrO2. These reactions are exothermic and can be used to produce the diborides by SHS. Production of ZrB2 from ZrO2 via SHS often leads to incomplete conversion of reactants, and therefore double SHS (DSHS) has been employed by some researchers. A second SHS reaction with Mg and H3BO3 as reactants along with the ZrB2/ZrO2 mixture yields increased conversion to the diboride, and particle sizes of 25‚Äì40 nm at 800 ¬∞C. After metallothermic reduction and DSHS reactions, MgO can be separated from ZrB2 by mild acid leaching. Synthesis of UHTCs by boron carbide reduction is one of the most popular methods for UHTC synthesis. The precursor materials for this reaction (ZrO2/TiO2/HfO2 and B4C) are less expensive than those required by the stoichiometric and borothermic reactions. ZrB2 is prepared at greater than 1600 ¬∞C for at least 1 hour by the following reaction: 2ZrO2 \\\\+ B4C + 3C ‚Üí 2ZrB2 \\\\+ 4CO This method requires a slight excess of boron, as some boron is oxidized during boron carbide reduction. ZrC has also been observed as a product from the reaction, but if the reaction is carried out with 20‚Äì25% excess B4C, the ZrC phase disappears, and only ZrB2 remains. Lower synthesis temperatures (~1600 ¬∞C) produce UHTCs that exhibit finer grain sizes and better sinterability. Boron carbide must be subjected to grinding prior to the boron carbide reduction in order to promote oxide reduction and diffusion processes. Boron carbide reductions can also be carried out via reactive plasma spraying if a UHTC coating is desired. Precursor or powder particles react with plasma at high temperatures (6000‚Äì15000 ¬∞C) which greatly reduces the reaction time. ZrB2 and ZrO2 phases have been formed using a plasma voltage and current of 50 V and 500 A, respectively. These coating materials exhibit uniform distribution of fine particles and porous microstructures, which increased hydrogen flow rates. Another method for the synthesis of UHTCs is the borothermic reduction of ZrO2, TiO2, or HfO2 with B. At temperatures higher than 1600 ¬∞C, pure diborides can be obtained from this method. Due to the loss of some boron as boron oxide, excess boron is needed during borothermic reduction. Mechanical milling can lower the reaction temperature required during borothermic reduction. This is due to the increased particle mixing and lattice defects that result from decreased particle sizes of ZnO2 and B after milling. This method is also not very useful for industrial applications due to the loss of expensive boron as boron oxide during the reaction. Nanocrystals of ZrB2were successfully synthesized by Zoli's reaction, a reduction of ZrO2 with NaBH4 using a molar ratio M:B of 1:4 at 700 ¬∞C for 30 min under argon flow. ZrO2 \\\\+ 3NaBH4 ‚Üí ZrB2 \\\\+ 2Na(g,l) + NaBO2 \\\\+ 6H2(g) ZrB2 can be prepared from solution-based synthesis methods as well, although few substantial studies have been conducted. Solution-based methods allow for low temperature synthesis of ultrafine UHTC powders. Yan et al. have synthesized ZrB2 powders using the inorganic-organic precursors ZrOCl2‚Ä¢8H2O, boric acid and phenolic resin at 1500 ¬∞C. The synthesized powders exhibit 200 nm crystallite size and low oxygen content (~ 1.0 wt%). ZrB2 preparation from polymeric precursors has also been recently investigated. ZrO2 and HfO2 can be dispersed in boron carbide polymeric precursors prior to reaction. Heating the reaction mixture to 1500 ¬∞C results in the in situ generation of boron carbide and carbon, and the reduction of ZrO2 to ZrB2 soon follows. The polymer must be stable, processable, and contain boron and carbon in order to be useful for the reaction. Dinitrile polymers formed from the condensation of dinitrile with decaborane satisfy these criteria. Chemical vapor deposition can be used to prepare zirconium diboride. Hydrogen gas is used to reduce vapors of zirconium tetrachloride and boron trichloride at substrate temperatures greater than 800 ¬∞C. Recently, high-quality thin films of ZrB2 can also be prepared by physical vapor deposition.  Defects and secondary phases in zirconium diboride  Zirconium diboride gains its high-temperature mechanical stability from the high atomic defect energies (i.e. the atoms do not deviate easily from their lattice sites). This means that the concentration of defects will remain low, even at high temperatures, preventing failure of the material. The layered bonding between each layer is also very strong but means that the ceramic is highly anisotropic, having different thermal expansions in the 'z' <001> direction. Although the material has excellent high temperature properties, the ceramic has to be produced extremely carefully as any excess of either zirconium or boron will not be accommodated in the ZrB2 lattice (i.e. the material does not deviate from stoichiometry). Instead it will form extra lower melting point phases which may initiate failure under extreme conditions.  Diffusion and transmutation in zirconium diboride  Zirconium diboride is also investigated as a possible material for nuclear reactor control rods due to the presence of boron and hafnium. :10B + nth ‚Üí [11B] ‚Üí Œ± + 7Li + 2.31 MeV. The layered structure provides a plane for helium diffusion to occur. He is formed as a transmutation product of boron-10‚Äîit is the alpha particle in the above reaction‚Äîand will rapidly migrate through the lattice between the layers of zirconium and boron, however not in the 'z' direction. Of interest, the other transmutation product, lithium, is likely to be trapped in the boron vacancies that are produced by the boron-10 transmutation and not be released from the lattice.

It was originally published in 1950 by Random House, and later published in paperback by Sterling Point Books. Plot Lee and Grant at Appomattox depicts the surrender of the Confederate States of America to Union soldiers. In specific, it portrays the surrender of General Robert E. Lee to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, helping to bring about the end of the American Civil War. Kantor mainly discusses the feelings of each army, both victorious and shellacked, and pays special attention to the history and interaction between Grant and Lee. The story also addresses the lasting bitterness between the North and South for years following the Civil War. Characters *General Ulysses S. Grant ‚Äì Grant is displayed disingenuously, as a \\"'silent, shabby, stubborn' man who liked animals more than people\\".Gallagher (2004), 216. Grant was further portrayed as a man who needlessly squandered the lives of hundreds of men in bloody battle. Ultimately, though, Grant is portrayed as a fair man, who lets the Confederates keep the items pertinent to their livelihood.eNotes (2008). *General Robert E. Lee ‚Äì General Lee is portrayed as stately, and, as essayist Gallager said, knightly and religiously. In fact, Kantor speaks very highly of Lee in a number of passages, for example: \\"You could imagine him [Lee] in the wars of long ago, in polished armor. You could imagine him in the wars of Biblical times, proud of his chariot, fascinating the Philistines\\".Kantor (1950), 33. Literary significance and reception Historian William Marvel has cited the book as piquing his interest in studying the subject of Appomattox as a child.Marvel (2000), 385. Some have accused the book of displaying a bias towards General Lee and presenting an inaccurate portrayal of General Grant. References to history The Appomattox Court House was the site of the actual surrender of General Lee to General Grant in 1865. The story makes reference to many actual battles of the Civil War. References in other works Gary Gallagher mentions the book in his collection of essays Lee and His Generals in War and Memory as an example of southern hypocrisy dictating how the memories of Lee and Grant are recalled.

He worked extensively with the United Nations to preserve the cultural heritage of Morocco. Biography Born in Nancy, France, in 1924, Michon was in college at the advent of WWII. There he began studying religion with a group of fellow students. Already having two diplomas, (one in law, one in English literature), he moved to Paris and enrolled in a program for political science. This something appeared in the guise of the works of French Traditionalist Ren√© Gu√©non. Greatly moved by Gu√©non‚Äôs writings, Michon felt the need to enter an initiatic tradition. Michon had a great personal affinity with Hinduism and Buddhism; particularly Zen Buddhism after reading the essays of D.T. Suzuki. He longed to travel to Japan to find a Zen master, but Japan was currently at war with his country. After four months of training, and a few days before the date set for departure to Japan, the atomic bomb was dropped and Japan capitulated. He returned to school to take his final exams and it there in the school library that he read in La Revue Africaine an article on the late Sufi master Sheikh Ahmad al-Alawi (who had died over a decade before). The article, entitled Mystic Modernist, mentioned that the late Sheikh had initiated several European disciples into the Sufi tradition. The next day Michon began attending prayers at the mosques, and, with the help of Michel Valsan, he converted to Islam (with the name Ali Abd al-Khaliq). In 1946 he was offered a position in Damascus as an English teacher, which he took with an idea of furthering his studies in Islam. In 1949 he apprenticed to an architect draftsman and moved to Lausanne. There he lived for many years next door to Frithjof Schuon and his wife. In 1953 he married the ex-wife of Leo Schaya. The Crow medicine man Thomas Yellowtail later adopted both Michon and his wife into the Crow tribe. After marriage and the birth of a daughter, Solange, he began a career with a variety of United Nations agencies, first as a freelance editor and translator and finally, over a period of fifteen years (1957‚Äì1972), as a permanent senior translator for the World Health Organization in Geneva. It was also during this period that Michon obtained a PhD in Islamic studies at Paris University (Sorbonne). His thesis was on the life and works of a scholar and spiritual guide of great renown from the north of Morocco, Shaykh Ahmad Ibn ‚ÄòAjƒ´bah al-Hasanƒ´ (1747‚Äì1809), whose Autobiography (Fahrasa) and Glossary of Technical Terms of Sufism (Mi‚Äòraj al- tashawwuf ilƒÅ haqƒÅ‚Äôiq al-tasawwuf) Michon translated from Arabic into French (1982; 1974 and 1990). Michon‚Äôs French translation of the Fahrasa of Ibn ‚ÄòAjƒ´bah has been translated into English by David Streight (1999). Between 1970 and 1973 he participated to the Istituto Ticinese di Alti Studi in Lugano (Switzerland).Hans Thomas Hakl, Eranos, An Alternative Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century, Sheffield, Equinox, 2013, 440 p. (pp. 274-275) In 2010 his edition of two treatises of Ibn Ajiba was published by Archetype, Cambridge, in a bi-lingual volume in English (translated by David Streight) and Arabic (). Traditionalism In July 1946 Michon traveled to Lausanne to be initiated by the disciple of Sheikh al-Alawi, Frithjof Schuon. In attendance was Martin Lings (with whom he became particularly close). During Michon‚Äôs first trip to Switzerland he traveled to Basel where he met two of Schuon‚Äôs closest disciples (and prominent members of the Traditionalist School); Titus Burckhardt and Leo Schaya. Over Easter in 1947 he visited Gu√©non at his home, meeting his wife Fatima and children. When asked what message he would give the next generation, he replied: Work with the United Nations From 1972 to 1980 Michon was the Chief Technical Advisor to the Moroccan government on UNESCO projects for the preservation of the cultural heritage. He was part of an effort to coordinate the rehabilitation of traditional handicrafts that were endangered by industrialization. He was also greatly involved in the preservation and restoration of the casbahs of Morocco as part of a project designed to protect the city of Fez.Jean-Louis Michon: Life and Work Works *Ibn Ajiba: Two Treatises on the Oneness of Existence (Archetype, 2010) *Introduction to Traditional Islam (World Wisdom, 2008) *Sufism: Love and Wisdom (World Wisdom, 2006) *Every Branch in Me: Essays on the Meaning of Man.

The 162d is equipped with the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator UAV. History World War II The 362d Fighter Squadron was established at Hamilton Field, California in December 1942. Became part of the United States Air Forces in Europe army of occupation in Germany during 1945. Inactivated in Germany during August 1946. Ohio Air National Guard The wartime 362d Fighter Squadron was re- designated as the 162d Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the Ohio Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Cox-Dayton Municipal Airport, Ohio, and was extended federal recognition on 22 November 1947 by the National Guard Bureau. The 162d Fighter Squadron was bestowed the lineage, history, honors, and colors of the 362d Fighter Squadron. The squadron was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and was assigned initially to the Illinois ANG 66th Fighter Wing, operationally gained by Continental Air Command. On 7 December 1947 the Ohio ANG 55th Fighter Wing, was federally recognized and the squadron was transferred. =Air Defense= F-51D Mustang (post-war) With the formation and federal recognition of the Ohio ANG 121st Fighter Group at Lockbourne Field, near Columbus, the squadron was reassigned. The mission of the 162d Fighter Squadron was the air defense of Ohio. Parts were no problem and many of the maintenance personnel were World War II veterans so readiness was quite high and the planes were often much better maintained than their USAF counterparts. In some ways, the postwar Air National Guard was almost like a flying country club and a pilot could often show up at the field, check out an aircraft and go flying. However, the unit also had regular military exercises that kept up proficiency and in gunnery and bombing contests they would often score at least as well or better than active-duty USAF units, given the fact that most ANG pilots were World War II combat veterans. In 1950 the squadron exchanged its F-51Ds for F-51H Mustang very long range escort fighters that were suitable for long-range interception of unknown aircraft identified by Ground Control Interceptor radar stations. With the surprise invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950, and the regular military's complete lack of readiness, most of the Air National Guard was federalized placed on active duty. However, the 162d was not federalized and remained at Cox-Dayton Municipal Airport and continued its air defense mission. In September 1955 Air Defense Command wanted to re-equip the squadron from F-51Hs to jet-powered F-84E Thunderjets in accordance with the USAF directive to phase out propeller-driven fighter-interceptor aircraft from the inventory. However, because the runways at the Cox-Dayton Municipal Airport were too short at that time to support jet fighter operations, the National Guard Bureau approved the relocation request by the Ohio ANG to move the squadron to Springfield Municipal Airport, just east of Dayton. With new facilities under construction at Springfield, the 162d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron conducted their transition training from temporary facilities at Wright-Patterson AFB. The F-84E Thunderjets were Korean War veteran aircraft and the squadron received training in the equipment from the Ohio ANG 164th and 166th Tactical Fighter Squadrons. =Tactical Air Command= F-84E Thunderjet from 1955‚Äì1957 In November 1957 the squadron received new F-84F Thunderstreak jet interceptors and the squadron was re-designated as the 162nd Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (Day) (Special Delivery). This designation reflected a dual mission which the squadron was tasked. The day interceptor mission of Air Defense Command, and a tactical nuclear weapon delivery mission by Tactical Air Command. Although the 162d trained for the delivery of tactical nuclear weapons, it never had any actual nuclear weapons on hand, nor did the base at Springfield ever had nuclear weapon storage facilities. On 10 November 1958, the squadron was re- designated as the 162nd Tactical Fighter Squadron and the squadron ended its attachment to Air Defense Command, returning to Tactical Air Command control. In 1959 and 1960 the squadron participated in exercises Dark Cloud and Pine Cone III, the latter taking place at Congaree AFB, South Carolina. In the exercises, the squadron practiced delivery of tactical nuclear weapons in the fictitious country of \\"North Saladia\\". F-84F-25-RE Thunderstreak (s/n 51-1747) of the 162nd Tactical Fighter Squadron, 178th Tactical Fighter Group, Ohio Air National Guard, during Operation \\"Punchcard IV\\", November 1968 During the 1961 Berlin Crisis, the 162nd was federalized as part of the 121st Tactical Fighter Wing and Group for a period of twelve months beginning on 1 October. When activated, the 121st TFW consisted of three operational units, the 164th Tactical Fighter Squadron, based at Mansfield Lahm Regional Airport, Mansfield, Ohio; the 166th Tactical Fighter Squadron based at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, and the 162d TFS at Springfield. However, due to funding shortages, only 26 F-84F's of 166th TFS were deployed to √âtain-Rouvres Air Base, France, although several ground support units from the 162d and 164th were also deployed. The squadron, however, remained under Federal USAF control until the crisis ended and it was returned to Ohio state control on 31 August 1962. After the Berlin Federalization ended, 15 October 1962, the 162d was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 178th Tactical Fighter Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 162d TFS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 178th Headquarters, 178th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 178th Combat Support Squadron, and the 178th USAF Dispensary. In 1967, the 162d TFS deployed to Hickam AFB, Hawaii for Tropic Lighting III, an exercise designed to assist in the training of Army ground units prior to their deployment to South Vietnam. This deployment required two over-water air refuelings in either direction. 1968 was the first time the 162d participated in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercise. It deployed to Greece, participating in Operation Deep Furrow 68 at Larrossa Air Base. On this exercise fourteen F-84Fs were deployed, staging though Lajes Field, Azores and Torrejon Air Base, Spain. During Deep Furrow, they performed air-to-ground maneuvers with the United States Navy's Sixth Fleet. Upon their return, the 162d TFS deployed eight aircraft to Alaska in November for Operation Punch Card IV. F-100 Super Sabre 162d Tactical Fighter Squadron ‚Äì North American F-100F Super Sabre 56-3859 about 1975 In the spring of 1970, the F-84F Thunderstreaks were sent to Davis-Monthan AFB for storage, the squadron receiving Vietnam War Veteran F-100D/F Super Sabres. Concentration on the qualifications of aircrews, munitions load crews and the attainment of a C-3 combat readiness rating were the primary objectives for 1971. The squadron achieved C-3 on 30 August, a \\"first\\" for F-100D-equipped Air Guard units. January 1972 saw the squadron in extensive practice for their pending 9th Air Force Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI). The ORI was conducted in March and the 9th Air Force did not agree with the unit's C-3 rating. A retake was scheduled in June, with the 162d coming away with the TAC-confirmed rating of C-1, the first F-100D squadron to achieve this feat. During April 1973, the squadron participated in \\"Gallant Hand '73,\\" a large-scale U.S. Readiness Command Joint Forces Training exercise at Fort Hood, Texas. Flying a 98 percent sortie rate. In August, the 162d took part in another joint training exercise called Operation Ember Dawn/Punch Card XIX at Eielson AFB, Alaska. In October, the TAC Unit Achievement Award was received for the fourth consecutive time, and the General Frank P. Lahm Air Safety Trophy was awarded for the second consecutive year. 31 May 1974 saw the 162d's accident-free flying streak end at 69 months when a pilot was forced to eject from his out- of-control F-100D. The unit participated in \\"Sentry Guard Strike V\\" at Volk Field, Wisconsin during 13‚Äì27 July the same year. In September 1975, the 162d was selected as a replacement for another unit to participate in NATO's \\"Reforger '75\\" Cornet Razor exercise at Ramstein AB, West Germany as part of a series of NATO exercises called \\"Autumn Forge.\\" Deploying thirteen F-100D aircraft, 162d pilots provided close air support as the aggressor in exercise \\"Captain Trek,\\" flying 121 sorties with 198 hours of flying time. January 1976 saw the unit preparing for Operation Snowbird and the pending April ORI. \\"Snowbird\\" was conducted at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. and was designed to give pilots favorable weather locations for clear weather flying opportunities. To provide its pilots with proficiency for real combat conditions, the 162d took part in \\"Red Flag 77-9.\\" Captain Edward J. Mechenbier, a former Vietnam War POW, was selected as the outstanding fighter pilot for 1977. A-7D Corsair II 62d Tactical Fighter Squadron A-7D-5-CV Corsair II 69‚Äì6233 in 1978 January 1978 initiated the conversion to the Vought Corporation's A-7D Corsair II attack aircraft. The conversion from the F-100 to the A-7 was accomplished in less than three months, the fastest ever for an Air Force or Air National Guard unit. The first major deployment with the A-7 was to Patrick AFB, Florida, on 12 August in support of Forward Air Controller training. Also in 1978, the 162d participated in \\"Red Flag 78-9\\" on 23 September, and \\"Tequilla Shooter\\" at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona, from 14 to 20 November. The first deployment in 1979 was \\"Operation Snowbird\\" again as 118 enlisted and 30 officers deployed to Davis- Monthan AFB, Arizona. in support of the exercise. \\"Sabre Sluff 79-2,\\" a locally generated version of \\"Red Flag\\" was conducted at Springfield during 26‚Äì28 April, providing realistic training for the 162d's flying, communications, and radar control units. 13‚Äì15 September saw a second \\"Sabre Sluff\\" exercise, now known as \\"Buckeye Flag,\\" carried out. The 1980 exercise year started with \\"Empire Glacier\\" at Fort Drum, New York. The 162d was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for its meritorious service from 1 March 1978 to 28 February 1979. In April, the 162d was teamed with the Ohio ANG 166th Tactical Fighter Squadron in support of exercise \\"Cope Elite.\\" The exercise which was carried out at NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii, involved combat training for U.S. Army and Air Force units based in Hawaii. In February 1981, Major John Smith commanded a six-aircraft deployment to the 49th TFW at Holloman AFB, New Mexico for Dissimilar air combat training (DACT). In March, the squadron flew close air support (CAS) missions for opposing forces during \\"Eagle Strike I,\\" an exercise involving two brigades for the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. During the May exercise \\"Maple Flag 7,\\" support was given to the Ohio ANG 112th Tactical Fighter Squadron for a 30-day rotation TDY to Howard AFB, Panama. This deployment provided the only operational fighters in the Southern Command. In July, the 162d participated in the Michigan-based combat readiness exercise \\"Sentry Buckeye XI,\\" the first \\"Sentry Buckeye\\" to be flown from the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center. 1982 was a busy year with the unit taking part in eight individual exercises, including \\"Red Flag 82-4\\" at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The 162d won the annual Ohio ANG \\"Turkey Shoot\\" competition in October at the Jefferson Proving Ground air- to-ground range. The squadron also celebrated its 35th anniversary with an open house and a military ball. More deployments were in store for 1983, starting with \\"Coronet Castle\\" in April. In June, the 162d completed five and one-half years of accident-free flying and earned the Tactical Air Command Flight Safety Award. Four Ohio Air National Guard LTV A-7D Corsair II fighters from the 162d Tactical Fighter Squadron, 178th Tactical Fighter Group in flight during 1984.

A \\"Red Flag\\" exercise at Nellis AFB, Nevada was the first deployment for 1985. \\"Solid Shield,\\" a joint exercise with the 166th TFS was conducted in May at the Naval Air Station, Key West, Florida. In June, it was off to the Panama Canal Zone for a deployment involving 50 personnel and four aircraft. In 1986, DACT missions were conducted from January to April at various locations. Also in April, CAS sorties were flown for the Canadian Forces Operation School. \\"Coronet Miami,\\" a six-week NATO exercise, was begun at RAF Sculthorpe, England. There the 162d trained with military elements of NATO and the U.S. Air Forces in Europe. In November, 14 aircraft and 149 personnel supported \\"Operation Snowbird.\\" The final 162d deployment for 1986 was at CFB Chatham, New Brunswick. There, CAS missions were provided for the school that trains forward controller for the Canadian Armed Forces. With all of the flying, the 162d ended the year with the prestigious Tappan Memorial Trophy, awarded to Ohio's outstanding Air National Guard Unit. On 28 February 1987, the 162d deployed five A-7D aircraft and 41 personnel to MacDill AFB, Florida in support of the 9th Air Force FAC (Forward Air Controller Training). In March 1987, the 162d rotated to support CORNET COVE XII, a 30-day mission to Howard AFB, Panama in which the 162d maintained the only operational fighter in the Southern Air Command. Nine officers and 43 members deployed four A-7D aircraft to provide the 24th Composite Wing the support they needed. In 1988, the 162d took twelve aircraft to participate in SNOWBIRD for the December deployment that allowed the jets to schedule heavy air operations in Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. 1989 saw the 162d participate in Panama for the 11th time in 19 years to support CORONET COVE. Nine officers and 46 enlisted provided five aircraft to support the 24th Composite Wing operations. In May 1989, the 162d deployed in support of CORONET PINE I and II at RAF Sculthorpe, England. After a series of groundings, the 162d deployed five aircraft and 295 personnel to participate in a major NATO exercise called CENTRAL ENTERPRISE at RAF Boscombe Down, England. In 1990, Operation Desert Storm saw 93 unit members deploy to the Middle East, but the A-7D aircraft remained in Ohio as by then, they were considered second-line aircraft, being replaced by the A-10 Thunderbolt II in front-line combat service. In September 1990, the 162d deployed to the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Michigan for field training. The 162d ended 1990 at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, in support of the December exercise SNOWBIRD. In March 1991, the 162d deployed to the Gulfport Combat Readiness Training Center, Mississippi and flew a total of 219 sorties during the deployment exercise. In September 1991, the 162d deployed seven aircraft to Nellis AFB, Nevada, to participate in AIR WARRIOR exercise. The 162d deployed again to support SNOWBIRD at Davis-Monthan AFB in November 1991. In 1992 the 162d deployed to Savannah Air National Guard Base, Georgia to support practicing units for the William Tell Competition and then traveled to Otis Air National Guard Base, Massachusetts for DACT training soon after. In May 1993 the 162d hosted a farewell to the A-7D Corsair II. The SLUF Salute was an Air Force sanctioned event to say farewell to this great aircraft that the 162d flew from 1978 to 1993. The 162d flew the last public demonstration of the A-7D Corsair II in the United States. While assigned to the unit, the aircraft flew a total of 55,357.4 hours. =Air Combat Command= In March 1992, the unit adopted the USAF Objective Wing organization and the 178th Tactical Fighter Group became simply the 178th Fighter Group; the 162d as a Fighter Squadron. On 1 June of that year, Tactical Air Command was inactivated as part of the Air Force re-organizing after the end of the Cold War. Air Combat Command (ACC) became the gaining major command for the 178th. During May 1993 the squadron marked the end of 15 years of A-7D operations with the 162d Fighter Squadron. Later in the year the conversion to the Block 30 F-16C Fighting Falcon. The 162d took twelve F-16's, 20 pilots and over 600 personnel to Operation WINTERBASE at the Gulfport Combat Readiness Training Center, Mississippi, to perform flight training for the first big deployment with the new F-16Cs. During the month long deployment, 30 aircrew certifications were attained and the sortie generation was the largest ever by the 178th Fighter Group. For LONGSHOT 94, the 162d launched four F-16's in support of the competition. The mission was for the aircraft to rendezvous with the various units fly to Nellis AFB, Nevada to drop ordnance on target and on time. Opposing Red Air Enemy attempted to thwart the attack. The 162d was part of the outstanding 3rd place team. In 1995, Operation SNOWBIRD occurred in February, with the 162d flying 223 sorties for live weapons and desert combat simulations. Later in April 1995, the 162d provided RED AIR for Tyndall AFB, Florida air training in Dissimilar air combat training (DACT) called LONGSHOT 95. In June 1995, the 162d deployed to Karup Air Base, Denmark to participate in NATO exercises BALTOP 95 and CENTRAL ENTERPRISE. The 162d provided RED AIR for the BALTOP exercise and flew 225 sorties in CENTRAL ENTERPRISE with eight of the F-16 aircraft from the 162d. On 11 October 1995, in accordance with the Air Force One Base-One Wing directive, the 178th Fighter Group was expanded and changed in status to the 178th Fighter Wing. Under the Objective Wing organization, the 162d Fighter Squadron was assigned to the 178th Operations Group. Support groups to the wing were the 178th Maintenance Group, 178th Mission Support Group and the 178th Medical Group. In December 1995, DACT training occurred again for the 162d at the Gulfport CRTC, Mississippi. During the period of 1995 to 1998, the 162d took first place in the \\"Turkey Shoot\\" Competition in Indiana, taking on units from the Ohio ANG and other participating states showing the 162d skill and accuracy in air-to-ground employment. F-16C block 30 #86-0364 from the 162nd FS is on a training mission, armed with AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles, over Savannah, Georgia on 14 January 2003. In mid-1996, the Air Force, in response to budget cuts, and changing world situations, began experimenting with Air Expeditionary organizations. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard elements into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying as \\"Provisional\\" as in the 1991 Gulf War, Expeditionary units are composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation. In August 1996, the 162d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron (162d EFS) was first formed from 178th personnel and aircraft and deployed to Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait to support Operation Southern Watch and Operation Desert Strike with the mission to enforce the southern no-fly zone imposed by the United Nations over Iraq. In 1997, the 162d Fighter Squadron deployed to Tyndall AFB, Florida for a COMBAT ARCHER exercise to perform supersonic air-to-air combat with drones. In May 1997, the 162d EFS was again formed, deploying to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey to support Operation Northern Watch. Later in 1997, the 162d Fighter Squadron invited past members to attend the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the squadron at Springfield. In 1998 the 162d deployed to Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska for Exercise Cope Thunder arctic training. =Air Education and Training Command= In 1998 the mission of the 178th Fighter Wing was changed to become a flying training unit under Air Education and Training Command (AETC). Its new mission was to skillfully train and support Active Duty, Guard and Reserve F-16 pilots as an Advanced Flight Training Unit. Its gaining command was officially changed from Air Combat Command to AETC on 17 March 1999. As part of the new mission, the 162d received Block 30 F-16D twin-seat trainers which provided the aircraft required for training. Courses included the Basic Course, or also known as the B-course, which was for students who have never flown a fighter aircraft, but are graduates of Air Force Undergraduate Pilot Training. Students were put through an 8.5-month training module. This included in class time, simulator training and in-flight training. In 2000 the 162d took their F-16's to Savannah Air National Guard Base, Georgia for Annual Training. In 2001, the 162d went back to Hickam AFB, Hawaii for the first time in 20 years to participate in exercise SENTRY ALOHA 01. In September 2001, while on Annual Training at the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Michigan, 11 September 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon occurred. The 162d flew numerous missions in support of homeland defense and for Operation Noble Eagle. =BRAC 2005 and closeout of F-16 operations= Pilots from the 178th FW gather in front of F-16C block 30 #86-0364 from the 162nd FS on 30 July 2010 in Springfield, Ohio. It is the last time these pilots would fly together here at Springfield. Under the 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC), a decision came down that the parent 178th Fighter Wing would lose its sixteen F-16s and ultimately convert to a drone squadron. The Springfield aircraft would be distributed to the 132d Fighter Wing, Des Moines IAP AGS, IA (nine aircraft); the 140th Wing (ANG), Buckley AFB, CO (three aircraft) and 149th Fighter Wing (ANG), Lackland AFB, TX (four aircraft). It was later revealed that the decision may have been a mistake as the 2005 BRAC decision did not take into account that the 162d FS was indeed a training squadron, however the decision stood. In the interim, through the Foreign Military Sales program, the 178th was able to obtain another training mission with the Royal Netherlands Air Force. In April 2007 the Dutch 306 Detachment from Tucson Air National Guard Base, Arizona moved to Springfield to provide a different training environment. The detachment was not associated directly to the 162d FS. However the Springfield facilities were F-16 ready so as a result, when the 162d FS shut down their F-16 operations, the Dutch detachment would leave shortly after. The current RNlAF training mission at Springfield ANGB ended in 2010 when the unit returned for Arizona. About 6 classes graduated out of the Dutch detachment while at Springfield. The 162d FS graduated its final American F-16 Basic Course class on 12 December 2009. The class had started on 30 March 2009. In the squadron's tenure, as a training squadron, a total 77 pilots went through the B-course. Another 273 people went for pilots upgrading to operational or formal training instructor pilot. This made a total of 350 pilots that received any pilot training at Springfield. Knowing the American training mission would be ending soon, the 178th pursued another foreign military training mission with the Singapore Air Force. However, in 2009 it became apparent that mission would not be coming to Springfield due to economic limitations. 162d FS and Hungarian Air Force MiG-29 and SAAB Gripen Just prior to the squadron closing out Viper operations, on 22 April 2010 the squadron had a more well received deployment in Hungary. The fifteen-day deployment allowed USAF F-16s to fly with Hungarian Air Force Saab JAS 39 Gripens, MiG-29s and the Mi-24s. The American pilots and Hungarian AF pilots had the opportunity to engage in various air- to-air scenarios. For the 162d FS the final sortie was on 30 July 2010. To celebrate the squadron's history, F-16C #86-0364 was painted up in special markings and incorporated some markings from the famous Second World War P-51 Mustang 'Old Crow'. On the last flight four of the most senior pilots in the squadron with the most hours in the F-16 flew. The four pilots had a combined 100 years in fighters and topped out at 15,920 hours in fighters with 12,380 of those hours in the Viper. Although the last sortie had been a few months earlier, the last American aircraft departed Springfield on 20 September 2010. This ended the manned flying mission of the 162d FS. The Dutch detachment was scheduled to return to Tucson AGB, Arizona by January 2011. Instead they pulled out early and were gone from Springfield by 15 November 2010 when the last Dutch F-16 departed. =Reconnaissance mission= On 7 May 2010 the DoD and the Air Force decided to assign the 178th a new mission as a ground control station for the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator and an extension of the intelligence analysis mission from the National Air and Space Intelligence Center. Conversion to the MQ-1 began in 2010. The mission is under the control of the Air Combat Command. Pilots based in Springfield can fly MQ-1s on the other side of the world in Iraq or Afghanistan. A second component works under the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC). The 178th Operations Group was re-designated as the 178th Reconnaissance Group and consists of the 162d Reconnaissance Squadron and the 178th Operational Support Squadron with 131 traditional and 81 full-time personnel.

Stern (born 1947) is an author from Memphis, Tennessee. Much of his work draws inspiration from Yiddish folklore.  Biography  Stern was born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1947, the son of a grocer. He left Memphis in the 1960s to attend college, then to travel the US and Europe ‚Äî living, as he told one interviewer, \\"the wayward life of my generation for about a decade,\\" and ending on a hippie commune in the Ozarks. He went on to study writing in the graduate program at the University of Arkansas, at a time when it included several notable writers who've since become prominent, including poet C.D. Wright and fiction writers Ellen Gilchrist, Lewis Nordan, Lee K. Abbott and Jack Butler.Stern bio , The Arkansas Programs in Creative Writing and Translation: Alumni. Stern subsequently moved to London, England, before returning to Memphis in his thirties to accept a job at a local folklore center. There he learned about the city's old Jewish ghetto, The Pinch, and began to steep himself in Yiddish folklore. He published his first book, the story collection Isaac and the Undertaker's Daughter, which was based in The Pinch, in 1983. It won the Pushcart Writers' Choice Award and acclaim from some notable critics, including Susan Sontag, who praised the book's \\"brio ... whiplash sentences ... energy and charm,\\" and observed that \\"Steve Stern may be a late practitioner of the genre\\" of Yiddish folklore, \\"but he is an expert one.\\" By decade's end Stern had won the O. Henry Award, two Pushcart Prize awards, published more collections, including Lazar Malkin Enters Heaven (which won the Edward Lewis Wallant Award for Jewish American Fiction) and the novel Harry Kaplan's Adventures Underground, and was being hailed by critics, such as Cynthia Ozick, as the successor to Isaac Bashevis Singer. Stern's 2000 collection The Wedding Jester won the National Jewish Book Award in 1999, and his novel The Angel of Forgetfulness was named one of the best books of 2005 by The Washington Post.\\"Book World Raves: The best books of 2005, brought to you by our extraordinarily diverse band of reviewers,\\" Washington Post (December 4, 2005). Stern, who teaches at Skidmore College, has also won some notable scholarly awards, including a Fulbright fellowships and the Guggenheim foundations Fellowship.

The litany includes a gold- lettered triple invocation of St Benedict of Nursia, and at the time of writing, probably before Oswald's death in 992, Ramsey was the only English monastery dedicated to this saint. A \\"Psalter of St Oswald\\" was listed in a 14th-century catalogue of the library at Ramsey.BL This manuscript is not to be confused with another Ramsey Psalter in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York (MS M. 302), made between 1286 and 1316. The text is a Latin psalter using the Gallican version. The \\"elegant English caroline minuscule\\" of the script inspired the influential \\"foundational hand\\" developed by the 20th- century calligrapher Edward Johnston.Brown, 120 The two most famous illuminated pages are at the start of the manuscript and are illustrated here and discussed below. Apart from another very large illuminated initial at the start of Psalm 101, the rest of the illumination consists of smaller decorated initials with colour at the start of each psalm, and gold initials for each verse.BL Illumination Unsurprisingly for a manuscript with such strong connections to Oswald, a leader of the English Benedictine Reform, the decoration shows the \\"Winchester style\\" associated with the reform, including continental influences. The famous tinted line drawing of the Crucifixion is in the version of the English form of the coloured outline drawing that draws on the style of the Utrecht Psalter, and the painted miniatures use sprawling acanthus leaves, the Winchester version of decoration derived from Carolingian and Ottonian art.Backhouse, Turner and Webster, 60 Equally, however, there is use of Insular interlace, restricted to the ends of the vertical element of the Beatus initial of Psalm 1 and the \\"D\\" at Psalm 101.P√§cht, 86 The artist of the Crucifixion miniature seems also to have worked at Fleury Abbey, where both Oswald and his uncle, Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, had trained,Backhouse, Turner and Webster, 60 as well as the Abbey of Saint Bertin, Saint-Omer, both of these in France. At St Bertin he worked on the Boulogne Gospels (municipal library there, MS 11) and at Fleury on the Harley Aratea (BL, Harley MS 2506).Brown, 118-123. Further manuscripts he worked on are given in Dodwell, C.R.; The Pictorial arts of the West, 800‚Äì1200, 1993, Yale UP, The figure of Christ is very similar to that on an Anglo-Saxon reliquary cross in the Victoria and Albert Museum, which was set on a small reliquary in Germany around 1000.Wilson, David M.; Anglo-Saxon Art: From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest, pp. 194-195, Thames and Hudson (US edn.

The Beatus initial appears to be the first to use the \\"lion-mask\\" in the bridge,Webster, Leslie, Anglo-Saxon Art, p. 177, 2012, British Museum Press, ; Brown, 119; for example there is a mask in the very similar drawn Beatus initial in the Winchcombe Psalter, Cambridge University Library, MS Ff.1.23, f. 5, dated 2nd quarter of the 11th century, see: Backhouse, Turner and Webster, 78 and illustrated at 80. which was to be widely copied in England and abroad.P√§cht, 86-89 Notes References *J.

Early life He was born in Simla, India, the second son of Lt-Gen George Jackson of the Bengal Staff Corps, and Phillis Sophia Strode. He was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (later to be Hertford College). Athlete Jackson was a gifted hurdler, winning the high hurdles at the fourth Varsity Sports of 1867, with a time of 17.8s. He later improved this to 16.0s, a British record (that stood for many years) and probably a World record, although at that time there was no international body to such records. He had to retire from competition after badly cutting his foot on an oyster shell while running against W G Grace. Academic career In 1869, he was elected as a don at Hertford College. He was known as \\"The Jacker\\". In the first Oxford Telephone Directory of 1895, he was one of only 96 subscribers. By this time he was Bursar of Hertford, and would later be Senior Proctor for the University. Athletics administrator In 1868, he was appointed Club Auditor of the Oxford University Athletic Club (OUAC), and in 1869, Senior Treasurer, a position he held for some sixty years. He guided the club towards a position of international prominence and Jackson became renowned as an authority figure within athletics. He also acted as mentor and coach to the club's members. As a trusted official, Jackson was called upon to determine who had won in a close finish at the Varsity Sports. Together with two other Oxford men, Montague Shearman and Bernhard Wise, he was the guiding force in the founding of the Amateur Athletic Association on 24 April 1880. The first AAA Championships were held on 3 July 1880 at Lillie Bridge. Personal life He married Ada Louisa Martin. His brother, Morton Strode Jackson married her sister, Edith Rosine Martin. Morton's son Arnold Jackson won the gold medal in the 1500m at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, coached by his uncle, Clement Jackson. Legacy In 1926, Sir Montague Shearman and other members of the Achilles Club presented a Trophy in memory of Jackson, to be awarded annually to the winning team in the Oxford vs Cambridge Varsity Sports. In recent years it has been noted that the trophy was inscribed as the \\"ARNOLD Jackson Memorial Trophy\\". Apparently, during the 1970s the original had been stolen, and a mistake was made when ordering the replacement. A further inscription, correcting the error, has been added to the trophy. The CN Jackson Memorial Cup is awarded annually by the AAA to the English male athlete who is adjudged to be the outstanding athlete of that year.

Topolansky, who is the wife of former President Jos√© Mujica, was the First Lady of Uruguay from 2010 to 2015. She served as Vice President of Uruguay starting from September 2017 to March 2020, after Ra√∫l Fernando Sendic's resignation.  Background  During her childhood she studied in the College Sacr√© C≈ìur de las Hermanas Dominicas in Montevideo with her twin sister. She then entered the Instituto Alfredo V√°squez Acevedo where she was part of the guild of students. She has been associated with the Movement of Popular Participation (MPP) for many years,'Luc√≠a Topolansky', wikipedia (in Spanish), :es:Luc√≠a Topolansky, linked with the former guerilla movement the Tupamaros. She is of Polish noble ancestry on her father's side (Luis Topolansky). She is married to Jos√© Mujica, who was the President of Uruguay from 2010 to 2015.  Political offices  She served as a Representative for Montevideo from 2000 to 2005 and she subsequently became a Senator. In the 2009 election she received the highest number of votes for Senator as the leader of the 609 electoral list. She was considered as a possible running mate for Tabar√© V√°zquez, the presidential candidate of the ruling coalition, in the 2014 elections.  Acting President of Uruguay  On 26 November 2010, due to the absence of both President Mujica and Vice-President Danilo Astori, she became Acting President, making her the first female to assume the Uruguay presidential powers and duties. This brief tenure as acting president lasted until 28 November 2010, when Vice President Astori returned to Uruguay. This state of affairs came about because of a clause in the Uruguayan Constitution, which stipulates that the Presidential powers & duties passes temporarily to the leader of the largest elected grouping in the Upper House, if both the President and the Vice President are absent from the territory of the Republic.  Vice President of Uruguay  Following the resignation of Ra√∫l Fernando Sendic, after protracted series of controversies, she was appointed Vice President of Uruguay in Sendic's place on 13 September 2017.

This gene that has been associated with Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness that involves the inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body. The majority of cases that have been diagnosed involve children under the age of 5. In untreated cases involving children, 15 to 25 percent of these cases developed coronary artery aneurysms. The overproduction of T cells may be correlated with the immune hyperactivity in Kawasaki disease. This gene is located at chromosome 19q13.1, it codes for one of three isoenzymes. The other two enzymes being ITPKA and ITPKB. ITPKC is involved in the Ca(2+)/NFAT pathway, negatively regulating T cell activation. A mutation in this gene occurs through a single-nucleotide polymorphism. When a mutation occurs the gene does not produce a functioning enzyme, meaning it will no longer be effective in negatively regulating T cells. When there is this reduced expression of the enzyme, ITPKC, there is a higher amount of IP3 which leads to the calcium channels being opened, and a higher amount of calcium being released. Leading to overly active T cells, and having this mutation in ITPKC is correlated to the increased risk of developing symptoms.

However, the reaction of his contemporaries was not positive; his subsequent mental disintegration led to him being confined to an insane asylum, where he died in 1865. Semmelweis's critics claimed his findings lacked scientific reasoning. The failure of the nineteenth-century scientific community to recognize Semmelweis's findings, and the nature of the flawed critiques outlined below, helped advance a positivist epistemology, leading to the emergence of evidence-based medicine. Epistemological relevance (see rates). To a modern reader, Semmelweis's experimental findings--that chlorine washings reduced childbed fever--seem obvious, and it may seem absurd that his claims were rejected on the grounds of purported lack of \\"scientific reasoning\\". His unpalatable observational evidence was only accepted when seemingly unrelated work by Louis Pasteur in Paris some two decades later offered a theoretical explanation for Semmelweis's observations: the germ theory of disease. As such, the Semmelweis story is often used in university courses with epistemology content, e.g. philosophy of science courses‚Äîdemonstrating the virtues of empiricism or positivism and providing a historical account of which types of knowledge count as scientific (and thus accepted) knowledge, and which do not. It is an irony that Semmelweis's critics considered themselves positivists. They could not accept his ideas of \\"minuscule and largely invisible amounts of decaying organic matter\\" as a cause of every case of childbed fever. To them, \\"Semmelweis seemed to be reverting to the speculative theories of earlier decades that were so repugnant to his positivist contemporaries\\".Semmelweis 1861:45 The positivistic contempt for theoretical deliberations is evident in these two quotations. The first from the highly celebrated anatomist Rudolf Virchow who said, \\"Explorers of nature recognize no bugbears other than individuals who speculate\\" From his Collected Papers on Scientific Medicine quoted in Semmelweis (1861):228 (translator Carter's note 75) , and Johann Lucas Bo√´r said: \\"If every century could produce one physician as observant (as Hippocrates) rather than so many who are educated in theoretical systems, how much more would have been achieved for humanity and for animal life generally\\". quoted in Semmelweis (1861):228 (translator Carter's note 76) (For an example of an earlier dead-end speculative theory that had halted scientific development, see phlogiston). Absorption of cadaveric material Streptococcus pyogenes (red-stained spheres) is responsible for most cases of severe puerperal fever. It is commonly found in the throat and nasopharynx of otherwise healthy carriers. Semmelweis's key claim was that physicians contaminated their hands with \\"cadaveric particles\\" in the morgue while conducting autopsies. He pointed out that ordinary washings with soap did not remove these particles, because the hands could retain a stench for several days in spite of such washings. When physicians later carried out gynaecological examinations, the cadaveric particles were absorbed by the patient, in particular if they came into contact with the freshly exposed uterus, or with genital tract lesions caused by the birth process. Semmelweis was convinced that every case of childbed fever was caused by resorption of cadaveric particles. With this etiology, Semmelweis identified childbed fever as purely an iatrogenic disease--that is, one caused by doctors. (Friedrich Wilhelm Scanzoni von Lichtenfels took personal offense at this, and never forgave Semmelweis for it‚ÄîScanzoni remained one of the most ardent critics of Semmelweis.) A few childbed fever case stories, described below, did not fit well into Semmelweis's theory and led him to expand it, also to comprise other types of decaying organic matter, for instance secretions from an infected knee or from a cancer tumor. In a case of discharging cancer of the innermost part of the uterus, Semmelweis wrote: > In October 1847, a patient was admitted with discharging medullary carcinoma > [cancer of the innermost part] of the uterus. She was assigned the bed at > which the rounds were always initiated. After examining this patient, those > conducting the examination washed their hands with soap only. The > consequence was that of twelve patients then delivering, eleven died. The > ichor from the discharging medullary carcinoma was not destroyed by soap and > water. ‚Ä¶ Thus, childbed fever is caused not only by cadaverous particles > adhering to hands but also by ichor from living organisms.Semmelweis > (1861):93 And in a case of a discharging carious knee, he wrote: > A new tragic experience persuaded me that air could also carry decaying > organic matter. In November of the same year, an individual was admitted > with a discharging carious left knee. [‚Ä¶] the ichorous exhalations of the > carious knee completely saturated the air of her ward. In this way the other > patients were exposed and nearly all the patients in that room died. [‚Ä¶] The > ichorous particles that saturated the air of the maternity ward penetrated > the uteruses already lacerated in the birth process. The particles were > resorbed, and childbed fever resulted. Even with the most meticulous chlorine-washings there seemed to be an unavoidable mortality rate of about 1 percent. He therefore suggested that self-infection took place - that internally generated cadaveric particles were responsible, for instance tissue crushed in the birth process and eventually turning gangrenous. Most of the objections from Semmelweis's critics stemmed from his claim that every case of childbed fever was caused by resorption of cadaveric particles. Some of Semmelweis's first critics even responded that he had said nothing new - it had long been known that cadaveric contamination could cause childbed fever. But this was only one of many possible causes for childbed fever. The findings from autopsies of deceased women also showed a confusing multitude of various symptoms, which emphasised the belief that puerperal fever was not one disease, but rather many different diseases, which remained unidentified. Semmelweis's critics were also quick to point out that he had virtually no evidence for his self-infection theory. Rejected as unscientific Professor Levy dismissed Semmelweis' findings as improbable and unscientific The quotes below are so selected to demonstrate the speculative theoretical nature of the objections to Semmelweis's theory. The quotes are from a publication (Alternative spelling Carl Edvard Marius Levy.) A scan of the 1848 document is available (in Danish) in Wikimedia commons. A plain text version is available in the Danish Wikisource. by Carl Edvard Marius Levy, a Danish obstetrician, who attacked Semmelweis's findings on such grounds. The first quote shows the improbable, shabbily researched and poorly argued nature of Semmelweis's claim, that there is only one universal cause for the disease. > ...Above all it is to be regretted that neither the observations nor the > opinions grounded on them are presented with the clarity and precision that > would be desirable in such an important matter of etiology. To presume that > corpses can and do infect, without considering whether the infection is > derived from puerperae or from other corpses, is as much a consequence of > unrecognized a priori assumptions as of the cited facts. A strict > examination would absolutely require that different sources of infection be > taken into account and provide the basis for a classification of the > observations. From a scientific point of view, particularly regarding the > question of the contagiousness of puerperal fever, it is important to know > whether the presumed cadaveric infection is to be ascribed only to puerperal > cadaverous matter or rather to all cadaverous effluvium in general. > ..[...]... It would be enlightening, insofar as the discussion concerns only > puerperal corpses, to consider whether the contagium is present in the > superficial parts, since we are concerned with the products of a disease > assumed to be transferable to nearby predisposed persons. On the other hand, > if the infective matter can originate from all corpses, one must give up > every notion of a specific contagium and look instead for an infection of > the blood mass.Semmelweis (1861):182 > ... if Dr. Semmelweis had limited his opinion regarding infections from > corpses to puerperal corpses, I would have been less disposed to denial than > I am. ...[...]... the specific contagium seems to be of little importance to > Dr. Semmelweis. Indeed it is so little considered that he does not even > discuss the direct transmission of the disease from those who are ill to > healthy persons lying nearby. He is concerned only with general infection > from corpses without respect to the disease that led to death. In this > respect his opinion seems improbable. washing hands with soap (B) and after disinfection with alcohol (C) Doctors and students did wash hands with soap and water and the hands were visibly clean before examinations. How could contaminants in such infinitesimal amounts possibly cause such damage? > ...a rapidly fatal putrid infection, even if the putrid matter is introduced > directly into the blood, requires more than homeopathic doses of the poison. > And, with due respect for the cleanliness of the Viennese students, it seems > improbable that enough infective matter or vapor could be secluded around > the fingernails to kill a patient.Semmelweis (1861):182‚Äì183 Why were simpler and more reliable experiments not considered? > To prove his opinion, Dr. Semmelweis ordered chlorine washings to destroy > every trace of cadaverous residue on the fingers. Would not the experiment > have been simpler and more reliable if it had been arranged, at least during > the experiment, that all anatomical work would be avoided?Semmelweis > (1861):183 Levy suggests that the decrease in deaths could be due to random variation: > In spite of these reservations, one must admit that the results of the > experiment appear to support Dr. Semmelweis's opinion, but certainly one > must admit no more. Everyone who has had the opportunity to observe the > periodic variations in the mortality rate of maternity clinics will agree > that his findings lack certain important confirmation. ...[...]... In the > absence of more precise statistical information, it is conceivable that the > results of the last seven months depend partially on periodic accidental > factors ‚Ä¶Semmelweis (1861):184 Semmelweis's critics were also quick to point out that he had virtually no evidence for his self-infection theory. In particular, it seemed unlikely that the two women could have infected other patients without becoming infected themselves: > ... the first case [the woman with a carious knee] is clearly inconsistent > with the possibility of infection [since presumably she must have infected > herself], while the second case [the woman with the cancer in her uterus] > remains strikingly unclear. Could ichor from this patient have been more > damaging when conveyed in vaginal examinations to other patients than it > would have been as a result of similar examinations carried out on this > patient herself? In our hospital we have frequently recorded ichorous sores > on the feet of delivering patients without having noticed any subsequent > infections, either of those patients themselves or of other patients. Dr. > Semmelweis places great emphasis on the better health of institutions > exclusively for the education of midwives; he should consider that ichorous > secretions occur equally in both institutions. Moreover, in an institution > as large as the midwife clinic in Vienna, one or another of the patients > must always be ill and so provide a source of infection. If the infection > occurs as easily as he believes, this would reduce the inequality in > mortality rates between the clinics.Semmelweis (1861):185 In conclusion Professor Levy writes: > These are my impressions of Dr. Semmelweis's experiences; for these reasons > I must judge provisionally that his opinions are not clear enough and his > findings not exact enough to qualify as scientifically founded.Semmelweis > (1861):186 These were not the only objections to Semmelweis' theory. Critics also blamed his theory of infectious particulates on his Catholic faith. They said his idea that invisible particles could cause disease and death was simply a product of his Catholic superstition. Many of his critics argued that the presence of Catholic priests bearing the Eucharist to dying patients was deeply frightening, and this fright induced child-bed fever. Semmelweis tested this theory by keeping priests out of one ward while admitting them to a second: no difference in illness or mortality was observed. Despite this, the critics continued to hold that Semmelweis' religion was the actual cause of the deadly disease. Impact of Professor Levy's criticism The Levy paper was first published in 1848, in a Danish journal. A translation was published in Germany by Gustav Adolf Michaelis in 1850. Semmelweis (1861):137, translator Carter's footnote 18 p. 137 The actual impact on the medical community of the criticism is unclear. Semmelweis only learned of the essay in 1858 but evidently found it significant enough to address it thoroughly in his 1861 publication. The purpose of quoting the Levy paper was that it demonstrated the nature of the criticism, in particular the intricate theoretical reasoning that completely overshadowed Semmelweis' experimental results. Semmelweis's misconception of childbed fever Today it is well known that Semmelweis was wrong about the theory of cadaveric contamination. What Semmelweis did not know is that chlorinated lime not only destroys the stench on contaminated hands, but also the bacteria there--the germ theory of disease had yet to be discovered. Many of the epidemics of childbed fever were probably caused by streptococcus infections--either type A, which is commonly found in the throat and nasopharynx of otherwise healthy carriers, or type B, which lives on the skin. Type B is also found in the genitals of about 5‚Äì30% of pregnant women.Carter (2005):104‚Äì108 It is therefore necessary for the physician to disinfect their hands before every examination and not, as Semmelweis thought, only after visits to the morgue.

The organisation is headed by a Chairman (currently Sir Nicholas Green, a judge of the Court of Appeal) and four Law Commissioners. It proposes changes to the law that will make the law simpler, more accessible, fairer, modern and more cost-effective. It consults widely on its proposals and in the light of the responses to public consultation, it presents recommendations to the UK Parliament that, if legislated upon, would implement its law reform recommendations. The commission is part of the Commonwealth Association of Law Reform Agencies. Activities The Law Commissions Act 1965 requires the Law Commission to submit \\"programmes for the examination of different branches of the law\\" to the Lord Chancellor for his approval before undertaking new work. Every three or four years the Law Commission consults widely, asking for suggestions for projects to include in these programmes. Decisions about whether to include a project are based on: * the strength of the need for law reform * the importance of the issues it will cover * the availability of resources in terms of both expertise and funding * whether the project is suitable to be dealt with by the independent Commission. The Law Commission can also take on additional projects that are referred directly by Government departments. At any one time, around 15 to 20 areas of law will be under review. Law Commission projects cover a wide range of subjects that belong to the criminal law, property law, family and trust law, public law, commercial law. The Law Commission has a rolling programme of law reform projects, and every three years or so it consults on any new projects that should be added to the list of those that it already has under way.

It marked the end of the Goths' brief bid to deny the seas to the Romans, and the beginning of the Byzantine resurgence in the war under the leadership of Narses. It was also the last major sea battle fought in the Mediterranean for more than a century, until the Battle of the Masts in 654.Gardiner (2004), p. 90  Background  In 550, the Gothic War was in its fifteenth year. The first years of the war had seen a series of successes for the relatively small Byzantine invasion force under Belisarius, which had led to the fall of Ravenna and the apparent restoration of Imperial rule over Italy by 540. Subsequently, Emperor Justinian I recalled Belisarius. The commanders left behind soon started squabbling with each other, while the Goths rallied their forces. Under the leadership of their charismatic new king, Totila, they soon reversed the situation, overrunning the Imperial forces. Not even the return of Belisarius could stem the Ostrogothic tide: by 550, the East Romans were left with a handful of coastal strongholds in the mainland, and in the spring of that year, Totila even invaded Sicily, the Romans' strategic base.Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 168‚Äì258 Wishing to deny the Imperials easy access to Italy and the ability to land fresh troops or reinforce their outposts, Totila had also created a navy of 400 warships to contest the seas with the Empire. At the same time, Justinian prepared one last major effort to reclaim Italy, under the eunuch Narses.Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 252, 256 Totila, aware of the looming threat, was determined to deny his enemies their last important bases on Italian soil, most prominently Croton and Ancona.Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 258‚Äì259 After withdrawing from Sicily laden with spoils,Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 256 Totila sent his troops to besiege Ancona. 47 ships blockaded it from the sea, and the rest of the Gothic fleet, 300 ships strong, was sent to raid the coast of Epirus and the Ionian Islands. Ancona was likely to fall soon, and therefore the Roman general Valerian, commander of Ravenna, called upon John, a very experienced general who was stationed at Salona in Dalmatia awaiting the arrival of Narses and his army, to send a relief force. John immediately manned 38 ships with his veterans, and was soon joined by 12 more ships from Ravenna under Valerian himself. The joint fleet set sail for Sena Gallica, some north of Ancona.Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 259 Battle and aftermath As the two fleets were almost equal, the two Gothic commanders, Indulf and Gibal (the former a renegade retainer of Belisarius), resolved to meet the Romans in battle immediately, and sailed to meet them. Unlike in classical Antiquity, the warships of the 6th century did not feature rams; naval combat was therefore dominated by missile exchanges and boarding actions.Gardiner (2004), p. 99 In this form of combat, experience and the ability to maintain a formation of ships was essential, and the Byzantine crews held the advantage over the inexperienced Goths. Soon, in the heat of battle, some Gothic ships drifted off the main body and were easily destroyed, while others sailed too close together and were unable to maneuver. In the end, the weary Gothic fleet disintegrated and their ships fled as best as they could. They lost 36 ships, and Gibal was captured, while Indulf with the remainder fled towards Ancona. As soon as he came close to the Gothic army's camp, he beached his ships and set them on fire. This staggering defeat disheartened the Gothic force, which immediately abandoned the siege of Ancona and withdrew.Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 259‚Äì260 Followed soon after by a series of Roman successes, the battle of Sena Gallica marked the beginning of the turn of the tide of the Gothic War in the Empire's favour.Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 260ff.

The characters are mostly drawn from the first book, while the plot revolves around another encounter with the villain Selznak. As before, the world has magic well as pseudo-science, and scientific explanation depends on tongue-in-cheek scientific concepts. The story is set in a world in which human beings live alongside elves, dwarves, goblins, and other fanciful beings including linkmen, a kind of gnome. Plot summary Professor Wurzle, a know-it-all scientist, inveigles Jonathan, the master cheeseman of the High Valley, into accompanying him on a trip downriver. Wurzle's real plan is to revisit Hightower Castle, from which the heroes routed Selznak in the previous novel. There the pair discover a treasure map and encounter Miles the Magician, a travelling wizard, in a nearby inn. Miles alerts them that the Squire, a linkman they befriended in the previous novel, has disappeared. Learning that Selznak was seen nearby at the time they fear the worst. The trio travel to the Territory, ruled by the Squire's father. There they once again encounter linkmen poets Bufo and Gump, as well as Twickenham the elf, who flies the mysterious elfin airship. Twickenham and Miles determine that the Squire has accidentally activated the Lumbog Globe, a magical paperweight allowing travel into the land of Balumnia. Balumnia can also be reached through magical doors, using one Jonathan, Ahab, the Professor, Miles, Bufo, and Gump enter Balumnia. The group has adventures as they make their way to Landsend, a major port and subject of the treasure map. The dark presence of Selznak and an omnipresent, sinister witch is mitigated by light encounters with an inept stage magician, and an extraordinarily extended panegyric to the virtues of coffee. In Landsend the adventurers encounter the natural fool Dooly with his grandfather Theophile Escargot, who trades in Balumnia using his marvellous submarine. After searching for the treasure, the group splits and Jonathan, Ahab, and the Professor find themselves once again menaced by the evil Selznak, who is plotting to use the Lumbog Globe to terrorize the High Valley. As in the previous novel, however, unexpected allies such as the Strawberry Baron and Cap'n Binky of the magical blend prove crucial in resolving the plot.James Blaylock, The Disappearing Dwarf, Ballantine, 1984.

He pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks, Boston Red Sox, and Miami Marlins. Ziegler was one of the few Major League pitchers to throw with a submarine delivery. Early life and career Ziegler was born in Pratt, Kansas, but his family moved to Springfield, Illinois, when he was six months old. Ziegler attended Odessa High School in Odessa, Missouri. He then enrolled at Southwest Missouri State University, where he played college baseball for the Southwest Missouri State Bears. In 2001, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and returned in 2002 to play with the league's Harwich Mariners. In 2003, Ziegler helped lead the Bears to the College World Series. Professional career Minor leagues The Oakland Athletics selected Ziegler in the 31st round, with the 938th overall selection, of the 2002 MLB draft, but he returned to Missouri State for his senior year. Upon graduating, the Philadelphia Phillies selected him in the 20th round, with the 595th overall selection, of the 2003 MLB draft. He only threw six innings for the short season Batavia Muckdogs due to shoulder tendinitis. The Phillies released him a week before the start of the 2004 season because they felt he was not good enough to pitch in Low-A and too old to return to short season ball. Ziegler signed with the Schaumburg Flyers of the independent Northern League. After making four starts for Schaumburg, the Athletics purchased his contract. They assigned him to the Modesto Athletics of the Class A-Advanced California League, pitching in their starting rotation. After a solid season helping Modesto to the league playoffs, while pitching in his first game in the playoffs, Ziegler was hit in the head by a line drive off the bat of Fred Lewis, playing for the San Jose Giants at the time. Ziegler suffered a fracture of the skull, but recovered in time to pitch again in 2005, earning a promotion to the Double-A Midland RockHounds of the Texas League. Continuing to start through the 2006 season, Ziegler moved further up the organizational ladder and pitched in a few games for the Sacramento River Cats of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, though he struggled in his brief time there. Before the start of the 2007 season, Ziegler was approached by Ron Romanick, the minor league pitching coordinator for the Athletics, about converting to a sidearm/submarine style of pitching. He agreed to the change and spent the 2007 season in both Midland and Sacramento as a relief pitcher, improving the more he became accustomed to the change. This led to a strong start to the 2008 season in Sacramento prior to joining the major league club, though he suffered a second fracture of the skull in January during a workout following a youth camp he was assisting with. A thrown baseball deflected off another glove, hitting him in the forehead. Again, Ziegler recovered with no negative long-term effects. Oakland Athletics Ziegler received his first call-up to the MLB on May 30, 2008, when the Athletics purchased his contract from the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats. In 19 relief appearances with the River Cats before his promotion, Ziegler was 2-0 with a 0.37 earned run average (ERA). He had allowed just one earned run on 15 hits in 24.1 innings, while striking out 20. He earned his first MLB win on June 8 against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Oakland Athletics in 2008 On July 22, Ziegler set an American League record for consecutive scoreless innings to start an MLB career (23) after pitching two innings against the Tampa Bay Rays.Sports Illustrated, August 4, 2008, p.22 The previous American League mark was 22 innings, set by Dave Ferriss of the Boston Red Sox in 1945. After pitching two further scoreless innings against the Texas Rangers, Ziegler then broke the Major League record of 25 innings on July 27, which had been held by George McQuillan of the Philadelphia Phillies since 1907. Ziegler picked up his first MLB career save in the MLB and became the Athletics new closer on August 8 against the Detroit Tigers. In earning his second on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays, he established a new Oakland record for consecutive scoreless innings at any point in a career with 38, passing starting pitcher Mike Torrez, who reached 37 in 1976. Ziegler's streak came to an end at 39 innings when the Tampa Bay Rays scored a run against him in the ninth inning on August 14. Akinori Iwamura scored on a double by B.J. Upton, which was also the first extra base hit Ziegler had allowed in the Majors. He had tied Al Benton after a scoreless eighth inning, finishing at 39. Benton did it in 1949 with the Cleveland Indians, though he allowed runs during that stretch as a starter. Ziegler also tied Christy Mathewson for second place for scoreless innings by a rookie. Mathewson's streak came in 1901 as a member of the New York Giants. Grover Cleveland Alexander holds the record for a rookie, throwing 41 consecutive scoreless innings in 1911 with the Philadelphia Phillies. Arizona Diamondbacks On July 31, 2011, the Athletics traded Ziegler to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Brandon Allen and Jordan Norberto. On December 20, 2013, the Diamondbacks reported they had reached an agreement for a two-year contract with Ziegler, worth $10.5 million. He earned $4.5 million for the 2014 season and $5 million for the 2015 season, with a $5.5 million option for 2016, or $1 million buyout. On November 3, 2015, the Diamondbacks exercised Ziegler's 2016 option. Boston Red Sox On July 9, 2016, the Diamondbacks traded Ziegler to the Boston Red Sox for Luis Alejandro Basabe and Jos√© Almonte. In 33 appearances for Boston, Ziegler posted a 1.52 ERA, 31 strikeouts, 11 walks and a career-best 9.4 strikeouts per nine innings. Miami Marlins On December 23, 2016, Ziegler signed a two-year, $16 million contract with the Miami Marlins. Arizona Diamondbacks (second stint) On July 31, 2018, Ziegler was traded back to the Diamondbacks in exchange for Tommy Eveld. After the season ended, on October 10, 2018, Ziegler announced his retirement from baseball. Personal life Ziegler and his wife, Kristen, have two children, and live in Springfield, Missouri. Ziegler is an avid collector of baseball cards. He uses his Twitter account to voice his personal opinions about subjects like the league's drug testing policy.

It is a Latin psalter on vellum, measures 380 x 310 mm and was probably produced at Christ Church, Canterbury. The most likely patron of such a costly work would have been the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time, possibly √Üthelnoth, who was consecrated in 1020 and remained at Canterbury until 1038. Description The Harley Psalter is the earliest of three surviving medieval copies of the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter of c. 820, then at Canterbury; the later ones were the 12th-century Eadwine Psalter and the Anglo-Catalan Psalter. It contains more than 100 11th-century coloured pen and wash drawings in the Utrecht Style, ending abruptly at Psalm 143:12, probably due to loss of pages rather than interruption of the original work. The Psalter is particularly interesting for having been written in three phases. The first phase seems to have been begun with the intention to produce a reasonably exact copy of the illustrations and layout of the Utrecht Psalter, although the Gallic form of the psalms in this work was substituted for the Roman form. This phase encompasses the first (ff.1-27) and third (ff.50-7) phases of the manuscript and is written by a single scribe.Backhouse, p. 75 The second phase of production is represented by the fourth section (ff.58-73), where the same scribe from the first phase continued to write out the psalms, but rather than imitating the layout of the Utrecht Psalter, he simply left gaps for illustrations at the beginning of each psalm. The artist who filled these gaps strayed further from the Utrecht Psalter as well, using much simpler compositions. Phase three of the manuscript is encompassed in the second section of the Psalter (ff.28-49) which seems to have been written later by the scribe Eadui Basan, although his hand seems either elderly or infirm when compared to the work he produced 1018. Only two 11th-century drawings are found in this part of the manuscript; it has been suggested that this was written to replace a portion of the Psalter which had been lost or damaged, as it fills a gap between two sections of seemingly earlier work. Janet Backhouse described the Harley Psalter as \\"one of the most important of all pre-Conquest English illuminated manuscripts\\".Backhouse, p. 74 Notes References * Janet Backhouse, 'The Harley Psalter', in The Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Art, 966-1066, ed.

Formed in 1993, Throw Rag has been fronted by Sean Wheeler (a.k.a. Captain Sean Doe, a.k.a. Diamond Boss, a.k.a. Sun Trash) since the inception of the band. Other current members of the band are Patrick Bostrom (a.k.a. Dino, a.k.a. Dean McQueen) on lead guitar, Frank Cronin (a.k.a. Franco Fontana, a.k.a. New Rome Emperor) on bass, and Daniel Lapham (a.k.a. Scorcho) on sampler. In its various incarnations, Throw Rag has been categorized as rockabilly, punk rock, psychobilly, and sailor rock. They have blended sounds of traditional rock and roll, country, and surf.  History  Throw Rag started up in October 1993 with founding members Sean Doe (vocals), Roger \\"Chino\\" Smith (drums), and Dan \\"Scorcho\\" Lapham (rhythm guitar). Also in the original lineup were bassist Danny \\"Talmadge\\" Black (who wrote Table 4 3) and guitarist Michael \\"The Outlaw\\" McCartney. Throw Rag played primarily at the Indio, California venue Rhythm and Brews (operated by renowned desert musician Mario Lalli, whose song \\"King Baby\\" was also performed by the band) throughout 1994 with other shows in Orange County, CA. Other members of the early Throw Rag were Scott \\"Barfly\\" Brooks (bass) and Tom \\"Colonel Riptide Tenmen\\" Lynn (banjo and vibes). By the end of 1994, Francis \\"Franco\\" Cronin (bass fiddle), Patrick \\"Dino\\" Bostrom (lead guitar), and Craig \\"Jacko\\" Jackman (lord of scum) had joined the band. From late 1996 through mid-1997, the band saw more lineup changes as Jacko left temporarily to be replaced on occasion by John Summers a.k.a. Johnny Bloodstreak on washboard and vocals. Also on board during this period were Louis Bluefeather (harmonica and didgeridoo) and Dr. Brittle Bones (tambourine and onstage medical assistance). From 1995, many of the songs that would eventually make it onto the debut album (Tee-Tot) were featured on compilations. Tee-Tot saw its first release on Hellnote Records in 1999. The album featured musical contributions from Sean Doe, Scorcho, Dino, Franco, Jacko, Chino, and Tony \\"Gusto\\" Portillo (drums). Supported by Tee-Tot, and bolstered by new rhythm guitarist A.J. \\"King Taco Pearl\\" Nesselrod, Throw Rag started building a wider fan base with their intense, maniacal live shows. Usually wearing a sea captain's hat and 70s double-knit suit, Sean Doe and Jacko (with nothing more than a wife beater and double knit pants) became notorious for stripping on stage. The band eventually started opening for acts such as Supersuckers, Green Day, Wesley Willis and Willie Nelson. In 2001, the band released a CD split with Supersuckers which featured a song that would later appear a Warped Tour 2002 Tour Compilation and their follow up album Desert Shores. Tee-Tot was only released in smaller record stores, and was available at live shows. Now out of print, Acetate plans to re-release the album in 2008. Desert Shores was released June 3, 2003, on BYO Records. Critics referred to the album as \\"fun\\" record, and compared highly to The Damned. > \\"Throw Rag's approach to punk rock is refreshing and yet still time-honored. > \\"Space Hump Me\\" has a lot of early-'70s punk in it, particularly with the > sneering vocals and simple arrangement such as the Damned.\\" > Throw Rag takes the anything-goes attitude of early Damned and grafts it to > the purposefully sloppy riffs of boozy bar punk to get a record that > celebrates punk's cut-loose mentality that's frequently lost in the dead- > serious world of rock'n‚Äôroll rebellion.

On November 2, 2004, the DVD was released. This featured all six members of Throw Rag. Shortly thereafter, King Taco Pearl left the band to sustain a family life. After 25 months of relentless touring, 2005 saw the release of 13 Feet and Rising, which featured guest vocals by Keith Morris, Jello Biafra, and a cover of Merle Haggard \\"Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down\\" ft. guest vocalist Lemmy. Throw Rag's fourth full-length album entitled 2nd Place was released on June 10, 2008. This album features a mix of both new and older songs.

Life  Born Mu·∏•ammad ibn Pƒ´r  øAlƒ´, in Balikesir, Ottoman Empire, in 1522, Mu·∏•ammad was sent to the capital Istanbul to study theology as a young man. Later, he studied law under the chief military judge (kazasker) of the Ottoman Empire. He became a dervish and attached himself to a Sufi master of the Bayramiyyah order.Birgivi, Imam. Path of Muhammad (World Wisdom, 2005) page 349 After working as a judge for a short period in Edirne, Birgivi became an ascetic, resigning from his government post and returning his salary. However, he was instructed by  øA·π≠ƒÅ æ AllƒÅh Efendi to become a teacher of religion and morals instead. Through the gift of a patron, a medrese was founded in the town of Birgi near Izmir and Mu·∏•ammad was appointed as its head teacher (m√ºderris). Now known as Imam Birgivi, his fame quickly spread as a result of his teaching and his books. Birgivi and his disciples were vocal critics of corruption within the Empire and without, particularly decrying the twisting of Islamic teachings for the benefit of the rich. At one point Birgivi traveled to the capital of the Empire and personally took the prime minister to task. This reprimand was taken well by the minister, who consulted him on how to cure the degeneration of the Islamic virtues.Birgivi, Imam.

Life He was the eldest son of Sir Edward Denny, 3rd Baronet and Elizabeth Day, daughter of the Hon. Robert Day, judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland) and his first wife Mary Potts. In 1827, Denny became High Sheriff of Kerry. In 1831, he succeeded his father as baronet and inherited a substantial portion of Tralee. Denny remained unmarried throughout his life. His family motto was \\"Act Mea Messis Erit\\" ‚Äî \\"in age my harvest shall be\\". The following obituary appeared in the 19 June 1889 Leeds Mercury edited by Thomas Blackburn Baines: Denny lived in later years at Bolton Gardens, Kensington and at another time at Islington, being then connected with the Brethren's Priory Meeting Room. He was associated numerous principal men of the Plymouth Brethren movement including William Kelly, J.G. Bellett, John Nelson Darby, George Wigram. He also participated in the conferences held at Powerscourt House. Denny studied the subject of biblical prophecy and assisted by John Jewell Penstone (1817‚Äì1902) prepared valuable charts to illustrate dispensational teaching. The best known publication was \\"A Prophetical Stream of Time\\". Hymn writer Denny published his own hymns, in 1839 \\"A Selection of Hymns\\" and in 1848, \\"Hymns and Poems\\", with new editions in 1870 and 1889.

Death Denny died aged 93. He was buried at the Paddington Cemetery by the side of George Wigram who had died ten years before. His sister Dianna Denny survived her brother by six months, attaining the age of 85, and was buried with him.

The 112th is equipped with the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon. The squadron is a descendant organization of the World War I, 112th Aero Squadron, established on 18 August 1917. It was reformed on 20 June 1927, as the 112th Observation Squadron, and is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II.  History  World War I The 112th Fighter Squadron dates its origins to the organization of the 112th Aero Squadron on 18 August 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas. The squadron served as a supply squadron at Kelly Field, being re-designated as the 633d Aero Supply Squadron (Supply) on 1 February 1918. It remained at Kelly Field, being demobilized on 19 August 1919.Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War, Volume 3, Part 3, Center of Military History, United States Army, 1949 (1988 Reprint) Ohio National Guard Although authorized in 1921, the 112th Observation Squadron was not organized and federally recognized until 20 June 1927 at Cleveland Hopkins Airport. The squadron, or elements thereof, called up to perform the following state duties: support to civil authorities during a mine worker‚Äôs strike at Cadiz, OH, 16 April‚Äì17 August 1932; Electric Auto Lite strike at Toledo, OH, in 1934; flood relief efforts along the Ohio River in southern Ohio during January‚ÄìFebruary 1937; riot control during a labor strike at the Mahoning Valley steel plants 22 June‚Äì15 July 1937. Conducted summer training at Camp Perry, OH The unit flew a wide range of aircraft throughout the late 1920s and 1930s including the PT-1, BT-1, the O-2 and the O-11. World Wars On 25 November 1940 the 112th was federalized and ordered to active service as part of the buildup of the Army Air Corps after the Fall of France. The unit was ordered to Pope Field, North Carolina where it was equipped with North American O-47 observation aircraft. It performed antisubmarine patrols over the North and South Carolina coasts, with a flight operating from Myrtle Beach Airport. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the 112th was moved to Dover Field, Delaware and equipped with O-49s and O-57s, performing coastal patrols over the Atlantic for German U-Boats over Delaware Bay and the approaches to Philadelphia. In the spring of 1942, was returned to South Carolina where it continued patrolling the mid-Atlantic coastline shipping routes. = Addison Baker = Lt. Col. Addison Earl Baker In October 1942, the unit was moved to Birmingham Airport, Alabama where it was inactivated. Its personnel were reassigned to other Army Air Force Units. One of its members, Lt. Col. Addison Earl Baker attended 4-engine transition school and was eventually assigned to the 93d Bombardment Group as a B-24 Liberator bomber pilot. Eventually being assigned to VIII Bomber Command at RAF Hardwick (USAAF Station 104), England, on 1 August 1943, Col. Baker piloted his aircraft on the low-altitude Allied bombing mission of oil refineries at Ploie≈üti, Romania, Operation Tidal Wave. Piloting Hell's Wench, a B-24 Liberator (Serial 42-40994), Baker led the 93d as the second formation in the five-group mission of 177 aircraft. Co-piloting the aircraft was a volunteer and former member of the 93rd, Major John L. Jerstad. En route the aircraft carrying the mission navigator crashed at sea. As a result, when the force reached the target area, the lead group turned at the wrong point and flew towards Bucharest. Baker attempted to warn the mission commander of this error, but when that failed, led the remainder of the force to the correct turning point. Although Hell's Wench was in flames and had been seriously damaged by German anti-aircraft guns, Baker maintained formation and bombed his target. Subsequently, Baker broke formation to avoid a mid-air collision with bombers from the lead group, now arriving in the target area from the opposite direction. He attempted to gain altitude so that his crew could escape by parachute, but despite his efforts, Hell's Wench crashed and exploded, killing Baker and the other nine airmen aboard. On 11 March 1944, Colonel Baker was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Although his body was never recovered he was given a memorial site in Florence American Cemetery and Memorial Florence, Italy. Major Jerstad also received the Medal of Honor on 28 October 1943, for his role on the mission. =112th Liaison Squadron= In April 1943, the unit was reactivated as the 112th Liaison Squadron at Salinas Army Air Base, California. The squadron was equipped with a series of light courier aircraft and for the next year was a courier unit for Fourth Air Force between airfields primarily in the Pacific Northwest. The unit was reassigned to Ninth Air Force in England in June 1944 where it operated Cessna UC-78 light transport aircraft in England and in liberated areas of France. It was assigned to HQ SHAFE, and provided VIP transportation until the end of the war, eventually serving as part of the Army of Occupation in Germany during 1945. It was inactivated in November 1945 at Drew Field, Florida. Ohio Air National Guard The wartime 112th Liaison Squadron was re-designated as the 112th Bombardment Squadron (Light), and was allotted to the Ohio Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Cleveland Municipal Airport, Ohio and was extended federal recognition on 2 December 1946 the National Guard Bureau. The 112th Bombardment Squadron was bestowed the lineage, history, honors, and colors of the 112th Liaison Squadron and all predecessor units. The squadron was equipped 20 R-26B/C Invader reconnaissance aircraft, a C-47, and two T-6s for training. The Invaders practiced night reconnaissance operations. Parts were no problem and many of the maintenance personnel were World War II veterans so readiness was quite high and the planes were often much better maintained than their USAF counterparts. In some ways, the postwar Air National Guard was almost like a flying country club and a pilot could often show up at the field, check out an aircraft and go flying. However, the unit also had regular military exercises that kept up proficiency and in gunnery and bombing contests they would often score at least as well or better than active-duty USAF units, given the fact that most ANG pilots were World War II combat veterans. =Korean War activation= Douglas RB-26C-40-DT Invader serial 44-35599 of the 112th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in a temporary wooden nose \\"hangar\\", January 1953. Notice the temporary Pierced Steel Planking used for the parking apron with the snow and ice. The 112th Bombardment Squadron was federalized due to the Korean War on 10 October 1950. It was re-designated as the 112th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron and assigned to the federalized Alabama ANG 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Group. Moved to Lawson AFB, Georgia, the 117th TRG consisted of the Alabama ANG 160th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron; South Carolina ANG 157th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, and the Ohio 112th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. The 160th and 157th TRS were equipped with RF-80A Shooting Star reconnaissance jets and began training in daylight photo- reconnaissance, while the 112th TRS continued training with its RB-26C Invaders in the night reconnaissance role. The 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was assigned to Ninth Air Force, Tactical Air Command. The wing then began what was then believed to be a short transition training period. The original plan was to deploy the 117th to France and reinforce the United States Air Forces in Europe at a new base in France, Toul-Rosi√®res Air Base. However Toul Air Base was still under construction, and delays in France for several reasons forced the 117th to remain at Lawson AFB for over a year until finally receiving deployment orders in January 1952. The 117th arrived at Toul Air Base on 27 January 1952. However at the time of the Wing's arrival, Toul AB consisted of a sea of mud, and the new jet runway was breaking up and could not support safe flying. The commander of the 117th deemed it uninhabitable and its flying squadrons of the wing were ordered dispersed to West Germany. The 112th TRS was transferred to Wiesbaden AB, the 157th TRS deployed to F√ºrstenfeldbruck AB, and the 160th deployed to Neubiberg AB. The non-flying Headquarters and Support organizations were assigned to Toul. The mission of the 117 TRW was to provide tactical, visual, photographic and electronic reconnaissance by both day and night, as was required by the military forces within the European command. The RF-80's were responsible for the daylight operations; the RB-26s for night photography. In June 1952, the 117th was involved in Exercise 'June Primer'. This exercise took place in an area bordered by a line drawn from Cherbourg to Geneva in the east and in the west by this Swiss, Austrian and Russian occupation zone borders. By July 1952 the facilities at Wiesbaden AB were becoming very crowded, and it was felt that the B-26's could fly from the primitive conditions at Toul. The 112 TRS returned to Toul, however the jet-engined RF-80's remained in West Germany until a new runway was constructed. On 9 July 1952 the activated Air National Guard 117 TRW was released from active duty and inactivated in place and its mission was taken over by the newly activated 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. All of the aircraft and support equipment remained at Toul and was transferred to the 10th TRW. =Cold War= 112th Tactical Fighter Squadron ‚Äì North American F-100F-15-NA Super Sabre 56-3990 about 1975 With the return from France, the squadron was reformed at Akron-Canton Airport and re- designated as the 112th Fighter-Bomber Squadron. It was re-equipped with F-51H Mustangs, and were one of the last two Air National Guard squadrons to fly this version of the Mustang. In October 1955, the 112th FBS were informed that they were to receive F-84E Thunderjets, but since the runways at Akron-Canton Municipal Airport were deemed inadequate for jet operations, it was decided to construct an entirely new facility for them at the new Toledo Express Airport at Toledo. The 112th FBS left Akron-Canton for the Toledo Municipal Airport on 1 April 1956 and retired their Mustangs for T-28A Trojans, and operated F-84Es until the summer of 1958. In January 1959, the 112th's facility at the Toledo Express Airport and moved to the new facility. The T-28s were replaced with new F-84F Thunderstreaks and the squadron was designated as a Tactical Fighter Squadron. On 15 October 1962, the 112th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 180th Tactical Fighter Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 112th TFS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 180th Headquarters, 180th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 180th Combat Support Squadron, and the 180th USAF Dispensary. 112th Fighter Squadron ‚Äì Ling-Temco-Vought A-7D-11-CV Corsair II 71-0367 about 1979 The squadron continued normal peacetime training throughout the 1960s. Individual squadron members volunteered for duty during the Vietnam War, however the 112th was not federalized in 1968 as the F-84Fs were not considered front line combat aircraft. In 1971, the squadron retired its Thunderstreaks and converted to the F-100 Super Sabre as a result of the American draw-down from the Vietnam War. In 1975, the 112th began a NATO commitment, deploying five F-100s to Ramstein Air Base, West Germany 9‚Äì25 October 1975 for Operation Cornet Razor. In the summer of 1979, the F-100s were retired, being replaced with A-7D Corsair II subsonic tactical close air support aircraft from Tactical Air Command units that were converting to the new A-10 Thunderbolt II. The aircraft had excellent accuracy with the aid of an automatic electronic navigation and weapons delivery system. Although designed primarily as a ground attack aircraft, it also had limited air-to-air combat capability. It continued its NATO commitment, deploying six A-7D aircraft to RAF Sculthorpe, England in April 1983 for Operation Cornet Miami; eight A-7Ds in June‚ÄìJuly 1986 for Cornet Pine, and thirteen A-7Ds in May‚ÄìJune 1989 for Cornet Pine. The 180th Tactical Fighter Group received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 1985 and again in 1990. In 1989, while deployed at Panama for a Coronet Cove deployment, 180th A-7s were employed during Operation Just Cause. =Air Combat Command= Gassed up with a biofuel, a U.S. Air Force F-16 Falcon from the 180th Fighter Wing ANG goes through prefight checks before taxiing down the runway for take off on 12 February 2012 The 112th TFS did not deploy to Saudi Arabia in 1990 during Operation Desert Shield or Operation Desert Storm as the A-7Ds were considered a second- line aircraft. Squadron volunteers, however were deployed to CENTAF during the crisis and subsequent combat operations. In March 1992, the 180th adopted the USAF Objective Wing organization and became simply the 180th Fighter Group; the 112th as a Fighter Squadron. On 1 June of that year, Tactical Air Command was inactivated as part of the Air Force restructuring after the end of the Cold War. Air Combat Command (ACC) became the gaining major command for the 180th. Another event in 1992 was the retirement of the A-7Ds, being replaced by Block 25 F-16C/D Fighting Falcons. The first F-16 to arrive with the 112th FS was a two-seat model, F-16D #83-1175, which was the first F-16D to come off the production line at Fort Worth. It came from the 312th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron at Luke AFB, Arizona on the rare leap year date 29 February 1992. F-16s continued to arrive and the last A-7D departed on 18 May 1992. Many of the block 25s that came from the 363d Tactical Fighter Wing at Shaw AFB, South Carolina were Desert Storm veterans. The squadron didn't operate the block 25 for very long. Starting in very early 1994 the squadron gave up its block 25s, which it had only flown for a year, for the much more modern block 42s. The block 25s were sent to various units but mostly to Luke AFB, Arizona. A large amount of the block 42s came from Shaw AFB, South Carolina where that base was converting to the block 50. On 1 October 1995, in accordance with the Air Force One Base-One Wing directive, the 180th Fighter Group was expanded and changed in status to the 180th Fighter Wing. Under the Objective Wing organization, the 112th Fighter Squadron was assigned to the 180th Operations Group. Support groups to the wing were the 180th Maintenance Group, 180th Mission Support Group and the 180th Medical Group. In mid-1996, the Air Force, in response to budget cuts, and changing world situations, began experimenting with Air Expeditionary organizations. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard elements into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying as \\"Provisional\\" as in the 1991 Gulf War, Expeditionary units are composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation. 112th Fighter Squadron ‚Äì General Dynamics F-16C Block 42G Fighting Falcon 89-2129 In October 1996, the 112th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron (112 EFS) was first formed from 162d FW personnel and eight aircraft and deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. The 112th EFS joined with the 124th EFS (Iowa ANG) and the 125th EFS (Oklahoma ANG) as part of a \\"rainbow\\" deployment to support Operation Provide Comfort. In January 1997, this changed to Operation Northern Watch just prior to the unit's return to Toledo to enforce the No- Fly-Zones over Iraq. More Operation Northern Watch deployments were made to Incirlik AB by the 112th EFS in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2002 respectively. The 112th EFS deployed to Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, for Operation Southern Watch in 2001. After the events of 11 September 2001 unit members have volunteered to support both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in 2005 and again for Operation Iraqi Freedom again in 2007. =NORAD Air Defense= In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Des Moines Air National Guard Base, Iowa. The F-16 aircraft currently assigned to the 132d Fighter Wing at Des Moines would be redistributed to the 180th Fighter Wing (nine aircraft) Des Moines' F-16s would be distributed to Toledo to support the Homeland Defense Air Sovereignty Alert (ADS) mission and to consolidate the precision-guided weapon employment capability that exists in the Air National Guard.

Named for the famous mine in Australia, the Burra Burra Mine is located in the Copper Basin geological region, and extracted over 15 million tons (14 million metric tons) of copper ore during its 60 years of operation between 1899 and 1959. The mine's remaining structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Burra Burra Mine Historic District. The site is also home to the Ducktown Basin Museum, and the museum and mine are a Tennessee State Historic Site operated in partnership with the Tennessee Historical Commission. The Burra Burra Mine was one of a number of mining operations in the Copper Basin from 1850 to 1987 that produced substantial amounts of copper ore that contained sulfur. Trees were cut to smelt the ore and burn off the sulfur. Both the tree-harvesting and the sulfuric acid pollution left more than ‚Äî(‚Äî of the basin eroded and virtually devoid of life, though the area has begun to recover after decades of re-greening efforts. Geographical setting The Burra Burra Mine is located near the center of the Copper Basin also known as the Ducktown Basin, a broad valley in the southern Appalachian Mountains near the common borders of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia. Ducktown, the location of the Burra Burra Mine, is in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of Tennessee State Route 68 and U.S. Route 64. The mine is also located about north of Copperhill, near the Tennessee-Georgia border, The mine is at , at an altitude of above mean sea level. History The Copper Basin was part of Cherokee lands until 1836, when the Cherokee relinquished control of the basin to the U.S. government. The basin became part of the Ocoee District, which mostly consisted of what is now Polk County. While most Cherokees in the area were forced out as part of the Indian Removal of 1838, some managed to avoid detection and would later aide in road construction and mining operations.R.E. Barclay, Ducktown Back in Raht's Time (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1946), 8-11. Copper was first discovered in the Copper Basin in 1843 on a hill immediately southwest of what would eventually become the Burra Burra Mine (a reconstructed boiler chimney and Tennessee Historical Commission marker now mark the site along TN-68). In 1860, several small-scale mining operations in the basin were consolidated to form the Burra Burra Copper Company, which was placed under the direction of mining engineer Julius Raht (1826‚Äì1879). In 1899, the Tennessee Copper Company, which had bought most of the mining operations in the Copper Basin, constructed a smelter at Copperhill and began work on the Burra Burra Mine at Ducktown. The company's open roast smelting method released large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the air, killing off all vegetation in the central basin.Kim Cochran, \\"Minerals and Mining of the Copper Basin.\\" Retrieved: 30 May 2008.

As part of re-greening efforts, 16 million trees have been planted and the basin has been seeded with acid-tolerant grass. The Burra Burra Mine was part of a stretch of land near the center of the basin selected to be exempted from the reclamation efforts to serve as a reminder of how the entire central basin once appeared.\\"Ducktown Basin Museum and Burra Burra Mine Site .\\" Retrieved: 30 May 2008.

Ten of the mine's structures remain, including its hoist house, boiler building, powder house, and machine shops. The old engineers' office building now houses the Ducktown Basin Museum.

Saint Theonistus (Theonist, Teonesto, Thaumastus, Thaumastos, Theonestus, Thonistus, Onistus, Teonisto, Tonisto) is a saint venerated by the Catholic Church. Theonistus is venerated with two companions, Tabra and Tabratha (also Tabraham and Tubraham). Medieval documents give accounts of his life, which are contradictory and confused. His legend is very confused and complex. He may have been a martyr of the end of the 4th or end of the 5th century. His legend is presented in a shorter, older version of the 10th century, which calls him a bishop of an island called Namsia or Namsis, and a longer version of the 11th century, which calls him a bishop of Philippi. According to the 11th- century account, Theonistus, along with Alban of Mainz, Tabra, Tabratha, and Ursus, attended a council in Carthage (the Council of Carthage of 670, but the chronology is confusedSan Teonesto (o Teonisto o Tonisto)), and then went on a pilgrimage to Rome. They then met Saint Ambrose at Milan, and were sent to serve as missionaries to Gallia. Ursus was killed either at Aosta (according to the older account) or Augsburg (according to the 11th-century account). Albinus was beheaded by the Arians at Mainz and was a cephalophore. A miracle allowed Theonistus, Tabra, and Tabratha to escape from Mainz, and they managed to reach either Gothia (10th century version) or Gallia (11th century version), and then reached Otranto (10th century version) or Sicily (11th century version). Finally, they were martyred at Roncade or Altino by beheading, and were also said to have been cephalophores. The chronological information in the sources is contradictory. Bede dates their martyrdom to the time of Diocletian (ca. 303), while Rabanus and Notker the Stammerer date their martyrdom to the time of Theodosius II. However, their martyrdom may also date to the time of Hunneric (477-484). As evidenced by their African names, Tabra and Tabratha may have been African martyrs whose relics arrived at Altino or Treviso during the persecutions of the Arian Vandals. Theonistus' cultus in Italy is attested by the foundation of a monastery dedicated to him in 710 (San Teonesto); the monastery's privileges were confirmed by Conrad II. At Treviso, Theonistus and his companions are first mentioned in a local calendar of 1184; Theonistus is venerated and depicted in local towns such as Possagno and Trevignano. Their association with Saint Alban may have come from confusion with Theonistus (or Theomastus, Thaumaustus), an early fifth century bishop of Mainz (feast day: January 1).Gregory of Tours, Glory of the Confessors. Translated by Raymond Van Dam (Liverpool University Press, 1988), 40n. This figure is mentioned by Gregory of Tours: \\"Theomastus was noted for his holiness in accordance with the meaning of his name, and he is said to have been bishop of Mainz. For some unknown reason, he was expelled from Mainz and went to Poitiers. There he ended his present life by remaining in a pure confession.‚ÄùGregory of Tours, Glory of the Confessors. Translated by Raymond Van Dam (Liverpool University Press, 1988), 39. The grave of this Theonistus was attested to in 791 AD. According to one scholar, ‚ÄúAlbanus of Mentz, martyred at Mentz no one knows when, according to Baeda under Diocletian also, according to Sigebert (in Chron.), who says he had been driven from Philippi with Theonistus its bishop, in 425.‚ÄùWilliam George Smith; Henry Wace, A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines (J. Murray, 1877), 70. This scholar goes on to write that Rabanus Maurus ‚Äúgoes so far abroad as to call [Alban] an African bishop flying from Hunneric...‚Äù There is another martyr by this name, Theonistus of Vercelli (feast day: November 20) (Vercelli has a church named Santi Tommaso e Teonesto in S. Paolo).San Teonesto All three figures‚Äô histories may have been confused. The relics of Theonistus and his two companions may also have been enshrined with those associated with Liberalis of Treviso at the cathedral of Torcello after 639 AD.San Liberale Theonistus' cultus remained strong. In the early 19th century, inhabitants of Trevignano hung a picture depicting St. Jerome at the feet of St. Theonistus.

L'Huile d'Olive Miraval is packaged in black stoneware bottles and contains blended extra virgin olive oil produced from olives grown on the Miraval estate and locally-sourced Verdale, Pichouline, Tanche, Lucques, Aglandau, Cayon and Arboussane organic olives. History Miraval estate is located on a site first inhabited in pre-Roman times. The ch√¢teau, in a modest vernacular style, has thirty-five rooms. It is surrounded by gardens with a moat, fountains, ancient aqueducts, a pond and a chapel, and by its vineyard, recently planted olive grove and by the surrounding garrigue and woodlands of evergreen and white oak, and Stone Pine, Aleppo Pine and Maritime Pine. A previous owner, the French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier, installed a recording studio in the ch√¢teau: Sting recorded there, as did the Cranberries,AP: Brangelina buzz and Pink Floyd laid down tracks for The Wall album, released in 1979. Its more recent American owner, Tom Bove, who bought the domaine in 1993 and modernised its viticulture, which had been producing simple vin de pays, has added a spa, Jacuzzi, twin gyms and an indoor pool. The ch√¢teau is known for its wines, white wines under the Coteaux Varois appellation and red, white and ros√© wine under the C√¥tes de Provence appellation:Travel-Watch the Guide Hachette des Vins called it one of France's top 500 wine producers. The domaine consists of 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of which 30 hectares on the valley floor are devoted to vines. A series of winding stone terraces following the profiles of the slopes are planted with thirteen varieties of olives. The immense wine cellar of Miraval was built in 1850 by Joseph-Louis Lambot, the inventor of reinforced concrete, who owned the nearby domaine of La Celle. The C√¥tes de Provence Ros√© Miraval has won plaudits from Wine Spectator Magazine. In January 2020, co-owner and winemaker Marc Perrin confirmed that Miraval is set to release a Ros√© Champagne in collaboration with Champagne grower-producer Rodolphe P√©ters.

BB and DT merged into one company in 1897 after DT was bought by the owner of BB, Axel Lyche. In 1901 Axel Raknerud, the editor of BB since 1884, also became the editor of Drammens Tidende. However, the newspapers remained separate publications, although with the same staff. Not until 1 February 1961 were they united in a common publication and company. The newspaper was known as Drammens Tidende og Buskerud Blad from 1961 to 2000, after a merger between the old Drammens Tidende and Buskerud Blad. The newspaper covers central parts of Buskerud as well as Drammen with seven weekly issues. The first acquisition of another newspaper occurred 1 December 1972, and in 1975 the offices in Oslo and H√∏nefoss were closed, followed the year after with a separate newspaper Sm√•nytt fra R√∏yken og Hurum. In 1978 an offset press was bought, and in 1980 the Notodden-based newspaper Telen. In 1993-94 the newspaper, until then owned by the Lyche and Raknerud families, was sold to Orkla Media, who were purchasing most of the independent newspapers in the country. The online newspaper was launched in 1998, followed by a name change in 2000. The paper was published in broadsheet format until 2004 when it switched to tabloid format. Drammens Tidene was taken over with the rest of Orkla Media by Edda Media in 2006. The circulation of Drammens Tidende was 45,000 copies in 2003. Its circulation was 40,954 copies in 2007. The paper had a circulation of 37,500 copies in 2009. It was the tenth best- selling newspaper in the country in 2013 with a circulation of 29,124 copies.
