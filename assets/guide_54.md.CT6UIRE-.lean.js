The Test series would have formed part of the inaugural 2019‚Äì21 ICC World Test Championship. Originally, the tour was scheduled to take place in July and August 2020, but it was postponed to October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, the tour was postponed again, after both boards could not agree on the quarantine requirements for the series. Background In May 2020, Nizamuddin Chowdhury, CEO of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), confirmed that they were in discussions with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) with regards to playing the series. Nazmul Hasan, President of the BCB, suggested that their priorities are ICC events, and will wait to see what the ICC and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) does first. However, on 24 June 2020, the tour was postponed due to the pandemic. In July 2020, both cricket boards were looking at the possibility of rescheduling the tour for October 2020. Also in July 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed it was their priority to reschedule the matches, along with the five other World Test Championship series that had been postponed due to the pandemic. In August 2020, both cricket boards were looking to play a combination of Test matches and Twenty20 International (T20I) matches, with a possible start date in October 2020. On 12 August 2020, the BCB confirmed they would travel to Sri Lanka, leaving for the country on 23 September 2020. On 12 September 2020, Sri Lanka Cricket confirmed that the Bangladesh team would need to quarantine for one week on arrival in the country before they can begin to train. The following day, Sri Lanka Cricket increased the quarantine period to 14 days, with the BCB disagreeing to the length of time their players would be quarantine and the lack of preparation time ahead of the first Test match. In response, Sri Lanka Cricket suggested that the quarantine could be split into two phases, with seven days done in Bangladesh, and the remaining seven days done once the team arrives in Sri Lanka. On 19 September 2020, Bangladesh named a preliminary squad of 27 players to begin training ahead of the tour. However, the following day, one player had to isolate after showing COVID-19 symptoms, along with anyone who came into close contact with him. On 28 September 2020, the tour was postponed again as both boards could not decide on quarantine requirements for the series. SLC insisted on a 14-day quarantine following guidelines from the Sri Lanka government, while the BCB insisted on a shorter length.

He is best known for his pop-music career in 1980s and '90's-era Japanese pop music'. Among his releases (totaling 45 singles and 18 original albums), from the 1980s to the 1990s, are eight albums which received Japan's Gold Disc Award (Japan's equivalent to a Grammy for Best Album). He was also awarded the Gold Disc Award for Best Male Pop Artist in 1989. Senri Oe's pop music garnered mass popularity in Japan following his first single \\"Wallabee Shoes\\" in 1983. He has held concerts in Japan's largest stadiums, including Nippon Budokan, Yokohama Arena, Yokohama Stadium, Chiba Marine Stadium, Seibu Dome, NHK Hall, and Osaka Castle Hall. He has also written and produced music for many artists, including Seiko Matsuda, Misato Watanabe, Hiromi Go, Hikaru Genji and Sayuri Ishikawa also composing music for the soundtrack of the film Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas, as well as \\"Believe\\" which was featured in Sanrio Puroland.  Early life  Senri Oe was born on September 6, 1960, in Fujiidera city Osaka, Japan. Oe began playing piano at the age of three, and was trained by his junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to become an acclaimed opera singer. After each of the lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose. Upon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to become a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker. In 1975, Oe participated in the final Yamaha Popular Song Contest POPCON (akin to American Idol). Later in 1980, Oe entered Kwansei Gakuin University and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career. He formed his first band during his time at university, was scouted by Sony Music and signed to Epic Sony Japan in 1981.  Music career  = 1983-1984: Early pop career and debut album = On February 27, 1983, Oe performed on STV Radio's Sunday Jumbo Special in Sapporo, Hokkaido, granting him his initial exposure as a professional musician. Within this segment, Oe began a ten-minute performance in which he improvised a song on live radio. Oe soon released his first single \\"Wallabee Shoes („ÉØ„É©„Éì„Éº„Å¨„Åé„Åô„Å¶„Å¶),\\" followed by his debut album, WAKUWAKU. Quickly garnering popularity, \\"Wallabee Shoes\\" charted at No. 10 in Sapporo radio. Oe appeared on All Night Fuji (Akin to Saturday Night Live in Japan) on Channel 8 alongside Epic Sony label-mates Wham from Britain. = 1985-2007: Greater pop music career success = After graduating from Kwansei Gakuin University, Oe rose to fame in November 1984 with the success of his sixth single, \\"10 People, 10 Colors (ÂçÅ‰∫∫ÂçÅËâ≤).\\" His third album, Miseinen (Êú™ÊàêÂπ¥) Juvenile charted at No. 5 on Oricon (Japanese equivalent to the Billboard weekly chart). With his now growing popularity across Japan, Oe began a tour, performing in Japan's largest venues and stadiums, including Nippon Budokan (with seating capacity of 14,471, akin to Madison Square Garden) to promote his fifth album, AVEC Tour Final, in 1987. His seventh album 1234 was awarded Album of the Year in the third Gold Disc Awards (Japan's equivalent of the Grammy Awards) in the Pop Male Solo Artist Category. Continuing to tour large venues throughout Japan, Oe released the album, Sloppy Joe, on March 25, 1989, which charted at No. 2 on the Oricon (Japan's equivalent of Billboard weekly chart). Meanwhile, Oe appeared as an actor on television for the first time, in the dramatic show entitled Kimi Ga Uso Wo Tuita. His ninth album, APOLLO, was the first of his albums to be recorded in New York City. The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the Oricon weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums (Yokohama Stadium, Seibu Dome, Chiba Marine Stadium, Yokohama Arena, Osaka Castle Hall). Oe's single \\"Never See You Again (Ê†ºÂ•ΩÊÇ™„ÅÑ„Åµ„Çâ„Çå„Åã„Åü) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\\" was released in September 1990 and is his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart. While continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, as an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan. Oe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music. Among these projects, he scored the soundtrack for the film Noto No Hanayome, Sanrio Puroland Park's Musical titled Believe, music for the performances of illusionist Princess Tenko Play, for Destiny. Also, notably, Oe scored music for the Japanese animated film Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas, as well as \\"Kono Hoshino Dokokade\\" by Yasuda Sisters. = 2008-2012: Career shift to jazz = On December 22, 2007, Oe announced that he would study jazz music in The New School for Jazz and moved to Manhattan on January 10, 2008, with his then puppy, a dachshund named Peace. Since Oe was only fifteen years old, he was intent on learning jazz music theory at school. Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life. = 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career = After graduating from The New School for Jazz, Oe launched his jazz record label in 2012. It was called \\"Peace Never Die\\" Records, abbreviated to PND Records. His dog, Peace, also appeared in PND's logo. Peace has received a certificate which allows her to officially qualify as an emotional support dog for Oe. Oe's jazz debut album was Boys Mature Slow.Following conversations with former Tokyo Jazz Festival producer, Atsuko Yashima, Oe concluded that his second album's style could expand to include for a jazz 'big band' ensemble. He then composed eleven pieces for his next album, Spooky Hotel, which was released in 2013.Following Spooky Hotel, Oe's big band performed in the Tokyo Jazz Festival at Tokyo Forum A Hall. Oe's working towards composing for a drum-less trio was entitled Collective Scribble; Oe remarked that, saxophone and piano combined with upright bass, \\"like a drawing scribble.\\" At the same time, Oe was creating his fourth jazz vocal album, Answer July, with Sheila Jordan, Jon Hendricks, Theo Bleckmann and Lauren Kinhan. Answer July was a Grammy-nominated consideration album in the Best Jazz Album in 2017. In addition, Oe challenged himself to adopt the concept of combining pop with jazz in his fifth studio jazz album Boys & Girls, released in 2018. For Boys & Girls, Oe selected some of his most popular pop songs to reinterpret into jazz compositions (which Oe calls, \\"Senri Jazz\\"). Boys & Girls charted at No. 1 in Japan Billboard's \\"Jazz and Classical Music Chart\\". Following the release, Oe toured to promote the new album in Amsterdam, Mexico City, and throughout the United States. Recently, Oe released his sixth studio jazz album Hmmm in 2019. Both the recordings and performances have featured bandmates Ari Hoenig (drums) and Matt Clohesy (upright bass).

Early life Ball was born in December 1993 in Liverpool. His mother is a GCSE dance teacher mother and a father who works in arts education. He started dancing at age 6, and entered the Royal Ballet Lower School at age 11. He moved to the Upper School at age 16, and graduated in 2013. However, due to a knee surgery, he could not perform at his graduation performance. Career Ball joined The Royal Ballet in the 2013/14 season, became a First Artist in 2015, Soloist in 2016 and First Soloist in 2017. In March 2018, he was tasked with replacing an injured David Hallberg mid-show as Albrecht Giselle, even though he had only danced the role once and had never danced with ballerina Natalia Osipova, who was playing the title role, in a full-length ballet before. Ball's performance was praised by The Times and the audience reacted positively to the performance. Ball was promoted to principal dancer in July that year.In December, he took time off from the Royal Ballet for 32 performance as the lead swan in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake at the Sadler's Wells Theatre. He had danced lead roles in the ballets such as classical version of Swan Lake, La Bayad√®re, Don Quixote, Ashton's Marguerite and Armand and McGregor's Infra.

The Watkins 27 design was developed into the pilothouse Watkins 27P in 1981, although only seven of that model were built. Production The design was built by Watkins Yachts in Clearwater, Florida, United States from 1977 to 1984. During the first full year of production, 1978, the company delivered more than 160 of the model, although production dropped to about 100 boats in the following year, 1979. With 514 completed it became the company's most successful and longest model in production. Design The Watkins 27 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of polyester resin-based fiberglass, with teak wood trim. Plywood coring is used in the structures of the cabin roof, the deck, seats and cockpit sole for additional stiffness. It has a masthead sloop rig with 6061-T6 aluminum spars, a raked stem, a vertical transom, a skeg- mounted rudder controlled by an Edson-built wheel and a centerboard with stub keel or optional fixed fin keel in deep or shoal lengths. It displaces and carries of ballast. The shoal keel-equipped version of the boat has a draft of , while the centerboard-equipped version has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted. The fixed keel model was created by adding a shoe to the bottom of the centerboard stub keel and filling in the centerboard trunk. Even though the centerboard was standard and the fixed keel optional, mostly buyers specified the fixed shoal-draft keel and the centerboard and deep keel models are rare. Only five of the centerboard models were built. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel engine. A number of Yanmar engine models were used, including the YSB8, YSB12, YSE8, YSE12, YSM8, YSM12 and the 2QM. After 1980 the 1GM and 2GM models were employed. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . Sleeping accommodation is provided for five people and consists of a bow \\"V\\" berth, a main cabin settee berth and a double-sized quarter berth. The head is fully enclosed and located to port aft of the forward cabin. The galley is aft, on the starboard side and includes an icebox and a two-burner alcohol or gas-fired stove mounted on gimbals. Ventilation is provided by six opening ports and two hatches, although some early boats delivered had two or more non-opening ports. The main cabin has of standing headroom. All woodwork is teak, including the cabin accents, bulkheads and the cabinets, which are teak veneer over plywood. The cabin sole is a teak parquet design. There is an anchor locker forward. The Edson pedestal-mounted wheel steering system drivings stainless steel cables, which rotate a quadrant that is bolted and keyed to the rudder post. The sail controls include a main sheet attached to the rear bridge deck on 1978 and 1979 models. After that the boats were delivered with mid-boom sheeting, using two blocks on either side of the cabin roof. The electrical system consists of two 12v batteries mounted in parallel and charged by the engine alternator. Operational history The design competed successfully in the market with the Catalina 27, offering better hardware and construction at similar price.

She was a controversial figure suspected by the British and by Ghanaians of a lack of loyalty and to have been too close to Nkrumah. She ghost wrote Nkrunah's autobiography and wrote her own interesting biography which was eventually published, after Nkrumah's death. Life Powell was born in Brighton on 15 March 1921 into a middle class family. She trained to be a secretary and then to teach. She came top of her class during the 1940 London Chamber of Commerce Shorthand and Typewriting exams. She went on to be employed by Barclays Bank during the second world war. On the rebound from a failed romance with a farmer in Lincolnshire she accepted an offer in February 1952 from the Crown Agents for the Colonies. They offered her the position of \\"Private Secretary (Female)/Gold Coast\\". She said that an attractive swimsuit got her the job of Private Secretary to the Governor of the Gold Coast, Sir Charles Arden-Clarke. While working for the Governor, she became a close friend and confidant of Kwame Nkrumah, then bidding for Ghana's independence from the United Kingdom. Her closeness to Nkrumah led to her being dismissed in 1954 and being sent back to the UK. Powell returned to Ghana in January 1955 to work for Kwame Nkrumah, a position she held for ten years. During that time she largely wrote Nkumah's (auto)biography. although this was not admitted until much later. She became close friends with the leading librarian Evelyn Evans who provided calm during periods of stress. Other ex-patriots in Ghana included Dorothy Hodgkin who visited her husband Thomas and Conor Cruise O'Brien. Her close relationship and loyalty to Nkrumah bred a lot of rumours both in Ghana and the UK. It also brought a lot of resentment from various quarters. She was accused of being a foreign spy whilst in Ghana. Nkrumah married an Egyptian even though they had no common language. He complained of being intensely lonely to Powell and wrote to her in 1965 saying \\"Did I ever tell you that I married not for myself but for the presidency?\\". Powell kept in contact with Nkrumah, after he was removed from power, while he was in exile in Guinea until his death in April 1972. Powell was made an MBE in 1958 and OBE in 1960. She later worked for Siaka Stevens as his private secretary from 1970 to 1979. She attended Nkrumah's funeral in 1972 as part of the official Sierra Leone delegation. In 1984 she published her autobiography and the title was drawn from the advert that she had applied to in the 1950s. The biography was delayed for some years because Nkrumah objected to the tone of earlier drafts. It was noted that missing sections of letters hinted that she had a very close relationship with Nkrumah. Powell died at Peterborough on 5 June 2007. Her obituary was covered by the Times and BBC Radio.

He married Magdalena (born 1603) on June 25, 1621, the daughter of the carpenter Jacob Flexlein. They had a daughter and five sons: Georg (1624, toolmaker), Gottfried (1634-1703), and Johann Andreas (1638). Gottfried invented the conical ignition for pistols in 1702, making them three times as fast. In 1649, Hans Hautsch built a wheelchair lift for hospital patients. Shortly thereafter, he built a four- wheeled clockwork-driven mechanical car, which allegedly drove 1.6 km/h by itself.Zitiert nach G. Schaetzel, K√∂niglicher Postoffizial: Motor-Posten.

According to some sources, in 1650 the future King Karl Gustav of Sweden bought the vehicle from Hautsch for 500 Reichstaler. However, there is no document in the Swedish (Royal) National Library. See http://www.digitalis.uni-koeln.de/Feldhausm/feldhausm1263-1274.pdf p. 1265. He delivered another triumphal car, which was specified to be driven by clockwork.

In 1664, he delivered a mechanised dollhouse with over 100 individual movements of the figures to the King of Denmark. The following year, he built a battle set for King Louis XIV of France and his son, with about 462 moving silver soldiers, complete with battle sounds.

The future governor √âtienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux was lieutenant-colonel in command of a detachment of 200 men of the 16th regiment of dragoons. They reached Cap-Fran√ßais (now Cap- Ha√Øtien) on 18 September 1792. The commissioners found that many of the white planters were hostile to the increasingly radical revolutionary movement and were joining the royalist opposition. The commissioners announced that they did not intend to abolish slavery, but had come to ensure that free men had equal rights whatever their color. D'Esparbes worked against the commissioners and became popular with the royalist planters. On 21 October 1792, the commissioners dismissed d'Esparb√®s and named the vicomte de Rochambeau governor general of Santo Domingo. Both D'Esparb√®s and his predecessor Blanchelande were deported to France. D'Esparb√®s was accused of disloyalty on 4 February 1793, but was acquitted by the Revolutionary Tribunal on 27 April 1793 and withdrew from public life. He died on 13 March 1810.

Looking Up premiered in China on July 18, 2019, and was released in the United States on July 19, 2019.  Plot  At a press conference for the two astronauts about to go on the Shuguang No. 16 spacecraft ‚Äì fourth-timer Gu Xinghe (Shao Bing) and first-timer Ma Fei (Bai Yu) ‚Äì the latter's family is conspicuously not present. September 1990: as a young boy (Feng Ze‚Äôang) in the city of Dongpei, Ma Fei's father, engineer Ma Haowen (Deng Chao), had given him a globe made from a football. But during a splashy ceremony for the opening of a bridge that Ma Haowen had designed, the bridge had collapsed, tarring Ma Haowen's reputation for ever. 15 December 2019: After 57 days the two astronauts are due to return to Earth in three days‚Äô time. Suddenly, however, all contact is lost with Jiuquan when some space debris damages the spacecraft's radio antenna. February 1991: Ma Haowen has been convicted of negligence and sent to a remote prison, where his wife Xinyu (Ren Suxi) visits and gets him to sign divorce papers. During his prison sentence Ma Haowen is bullied by fellow convicts; at home, his son Ma Fei is also bullied. In 1997 Ma Haowen returns home to Dongpei after seven years, still hated by people in the town. Xinyu now has a sugar daddy, railway administrator Meng (Liang Chao), and the two have sent Ma Fei (Sun Xilun) to Boyu High School, an exclusive local boarder that's among the four best in Dongpei. When Ma Fei is expelled for skipping class and reading a Jin Yong martial-arts novel, Ma Haowen publicly challenges the headmaster, Yan (Li Jianyi), over the decision. Yan finally agrees to let Ma Fei stay on for a while, as long as he makes the top 10 in class. When Meng has to go to Guangzhou on business, Ma Haowen spends time with his son but he's still mocked by locals in the street and still can't find a job. One man, Liu Baliang (Wu Yaheng), does give him a job after Ma Haowen helps him out; and Ma Haowen's onetime apprentice, Lu Datou (Wang Ge), surreptitiously gives him and his son a place to stay. In return, Ma Haowen does a lot of work under Lu Datou's name. With his father's encouragement, Ma Fei starts to study hard, though Xinyu is appalled at what is going on. At the high school, Ma Haowen becomes friendly with Gao Tianxiang (Wang Xi), a young replacement teacher who believes in Ma Fei. Ma Haowen tries to get his son to learn in a lateral way, not just rote from school books, and to open his eyes to the world. He finally pulls him out of high school and educates him on the road, though Ma Fei is almost drowned in a heavy storm that separates the two of them. 16 December 2019: Ma Fei volunteers to go outside the spacecraft to inspect the damaged antenna, without which they cannot return to Earth. Gu Xinghe forbids him, but eventually Ma Fei is to make his own, unconventional decision, as his father has always taught him.

It is now a defunct congressional committee, having been consolidated into the Committee of Finance in 1923. The first U.S Congress (1789-1791) appointed 220 committees, while the U.S. Senate as of 2017 had 16 standing committees with 67 subcommittees, and five non-standing committees. The merger and combination of committee responsibilities and jurisdiction is the prime reason for the lower number of committees today.  Origin  The Committee on Tariff Regulation operated under the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance. While the Select Committee on Finance had passed the Tariff Act of 1816, they did not have full jurisdiction over tariff legislation. The Finance Committee shared jurisdiction over tariffs with U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce and Manufactures. Senators on the Commerce and Manufacturers Committee tended to be more protectionist, as the U.S strove to grow its industry. And at the time the Senate steered most tariff legislation to the Commerce and Manufacturers Committee. Senators on the Finance Committee made many attempts to get tariff legislation referred to the Finance Committee. They argued that tariffs were a means to raise revenue, and revenue was within the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. But every attempt to refer tariff bills to the Finance Committee failed, as more parochial concerns over protecting the industries of particular Senators‚Äô states resulted in the Senate referring legislation to the Commerce and Manufacturers Committee. As years passed, tariff issues grew larger, exposing a geographic division in the country. Southern and western interests supported reductions in tariffs. Northern interests, however, felt that tariffs were still too low and did not afford enough protection. Out of this turmoil came the creation of the select Committee on the Tariff Regulation.  First impact  By 1833, disputes over tariffs reached a crisis. South Carolina threatened to nullify all tariff acts. The Senate was forced to act. And Henry Clay offered a solution in the form of a bill that would draw down tariffs over a 10-year period. Congress passed the bill, and President Jackson signed it into law. The Committee on the Tariff Regulation had approved the bill, allowing the Senate to bypass the protectionist Commerce and Manufacturers Committee. This move away from the Commerce and Manufacturers Committee allowed the Finance Committee to begin to claim the tariff jurisdiction. By the next major tariff revision, in 1842, the Finance Committee's claim of authority over tariff legislation was complete, this would not have been possible without the Committee on the Tariff Regulation.  Notable regulation passed by the committee  = Tariff of 1833 = After the Force Bill was passed through Congress, Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun proposed the Tariff of 1833, also known as the Compromise Tariff, to resolve the Nullification Crisis. It was subsequently passed by the Committee on the Tariff Regulation. The Tariff of 1833 guaranteed that all tariff rates above 20% would be reduced by one tenth every two years with the final reductions back to 20% coming in 1842. This essentially forced import tariffs to gradually drop over the next decade, pleasing South Carolina and other Southern states that depended on cheap imports. In addition, the Tariff of 1833 had some other impacts. First, it allowed many raw materials used by American industry to be admitted completely free of duty. In addition, it stated that all duties must be paid in cash, with no credit allowed the importing merchant. Ultimately, South Carolina and the rest of the United States would accept the Tariff of 1833, and warfare between the South Carolina army and the Union was avoided. Both sides received some benefit from the deal. South Carolina now had a much more agreeable tariff and did not have to mobilize its army to protect its economy, and the United States government, through the Force Act, was given the power to use force to enforce tariffs, strengthening the central government. Many believe that were it not for the Force Act, South Carolina may have continued its Nullification policies because the Force Act gave the United States government the ability to use military force to enforce tariffs and other economic policies, it made fighting for nullification a potentially devastating choice. = Tariff of 1842 = The Tariff of 1842, or Black Tariff as it became known, was a protectionist tariff. It reversed the effects of the Compromise Tariff of 1833. As the 20% level approached in 1842, industrial interests and members of the Whig Party began clamoring for protection by claiming that the reductions left them vulnerable to European competition. The bill restored protection of U.S industry and raised average tariff rates to almost 40% and stipulated sweeping changes to the tariff schedule and collection system. It also replaced most ad valorem with specific duties, assessed on a good-by-good basis. The main beneficiary industry to receive protection under the 1842 tariff was iron. Import taxes on iron goods, both raw and manufactured, amounted to almost two thirds of their price overall and exceeded 100% on many items, such as nails and hoop iron. The law also raised the percentage of dutiable goods from just over 50% of all imports to over 85% of all imports. The impact of the 1842 tariff was felt almost immediately, with sharp decline in international trade in 1843. Imports into the United States nearly halved from their 1842 levels and exports, affected by overall trade patterns, dropped by approximately 20%. = Morrill Tariff of 1861 = The Morrill Tariff of 1861, concluded only two days before the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, and largely defined the dimensions of American international trade policy for the next fifty years. President James Polk began reforming tariffs in 1846 with moderate rate reductions. These reforms also standardized assessments onto a fixed ad valorem schedule in which tariffs were assessed as a percentage of the import's declared value, replacing the old discriminatory system of specific duties on specific goods enacted by the tariffs of 1842. In 1857 there was a further uniform reduction in tariff rates. Then the Panic of 1857 saw yet another reversal of course when federal revenues declined significantly. Work began on the Morrill Tariff in 1859. In the 36th Congress no party held a majority and tariff-supporting Republicans faced off against anti-tariff Democrats in a 44-ballot stalemate over the selection of the new speaker of the House of Representatives. In early 1860 the Morrill Tariff passed in the House, not only raising tariff rates but replacing Polk's ad valorem system with the reintroduction of a specific duties-based system. With southern delegations of seceding states no longer in Congress to block the measure, the Morrill Tariff was signed into law by President James Buchanan in March 1861. British opinion at the time favored free trade and the Morrill Tariff was detested in Britain. This development lent unexpected sympathy to Confederate efforts to secure British support early in the U.S. Civil war, but was eventually eclipsed by the Emancipation Proclamation after which British public opinion swung behind the Union. For the northern government, the Morrill Tariff was a shortsighted strategic mistake. It unintentionally alienated an otherwise natural anti-slavery ally for what could, at best, be described as short term economic favors to a few politically connected firms and industrialists. The Morrill Tariff was a turning point, as it began 52 years of high tariff protectionism as a national economic policy in the United States. Whereas early 19th century tariff battles saw the U.S. pivot between competing regimes of protection and relatively free trade, the Civil War inaugurated a semi-permanent political ascendance of the tariff's industrial beneficiaries in the Gilded Age. Traditional free trade constituencies in the absent and then politically weakened south, along with the agricultural west, were unable to regain the upper hand until the Woodrow Wilson administration. As a result of its settlement in 1861 and its wartime entrenchment, the tariff remained the dominant topic of American economic policy until the eve of the First World War.

She was one of the best two-year-old fillies in Europe in 2019 when she was unbeaten in three races including the Group 1 Fillies' Mile. Background Quadrilateral is a chestnut filly bred in England by her owner Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farm. She was sent into training with Roger Charlton at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. She was from the fourth crop of foals sired by Frankel, an undefeated racehorse whose other progeny have included Cracksman, Anapurna, Soul Stirring and Without Parole. Quadrilateral's dam Nimble Thimble showed modest ability on the track, winning one minor race from three starts. Her dam Skiable was a half-sister to the outstanding broodmare Hasili. Racing career =2019: two-year-old season= Quadrilateral was ridden in all of her races as a two-year-old by Jason Watson. The filly began her racecourse career in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 16 August when she started the 7/2 second favourite in a ten-runner field. After racing in mid-division she made steady progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead in the closing stages and won by a neck from the colt Mambo Nights. Five weeks later, over the same course and distance, Quadrilateral contested a minor fillies' race in which she tarted the 7/4 second favourite behind the Michael Stoute-trained Melnikova. She was restrained by Watson at the rear of the seven-runner field before moving up to take the lead approaching the final furlong and drawing away from her opponents to win in \\"impressive\\" style by eight lengths. On 11 October at Newmarket Racecourse Quadrilateral was stepped up is class and started the 9/4 favourite for the Group 1 Fillies' Mile. Her eight opponents included Love (Moyglare Stud Stakes), Cayenne Pepper (Flame Of Tara Stakes), Powerful Breeze (May Hill Stakes), Boomer (Prestige Stakes) and West End Girl (Sweet Solera Stakes). She settled behind the leaders as West End Girl set the pace, before making progress in the last quarter mile. Quadirlateral maintained her run, overtook Powerful Breeze in the final strides and won by a head with a length and a half back to Love in third place. After the race Charlton said \\"She kept responding and I thought she did really well to get there. She fought like a good‚Äôun and handled the track, it was a great effort really... that was a proper test and she did it 100%.\\" =2020: three-year-old season= The flat racing season in England was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and the 1000 Guineas was run a month later than usual on 7 June over the Rowley mile at Newmarket. Quadrilateral headed the betting at odds of 11/4 in a fifteen- runner. With Watson in the saddle she was in contention from the start and kept on well in the closing stages but never looked likely to win and came home third, beaten two and a half quarter lengths and a head by Love and Cloak of Spirits. Thirteen days later, the filly started favourite for Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and finished third behind Alpine Star and Sharing, beaten six lengths by the winner.

Outstanding features in the soilscape are the fertile highland Vertisols and Phaeozems in forests.  Factors contributing to soil diversity  = Climate = Annual rainfall depth is very variable with an average of around 800 mm. Most rains fall during the main rainy season, which typically extends from June to September. Mean temperature in woreda town Hagere Selam is 16.8 ¬∞C, oscillating between average daily minimum of 9.3 ¬∞C and maximum of 24.1 ¬∞C. The contrasts between day and night air temperatures are much larger than seasonal contrasts. = Geology = From the higher to the lower locations, the following geological formations are present: * Phonolite plugs * Upper basalt * Interbedded lacustrine deposits * Lower basalt * Amba Aradam Formation * Agula Shale * Mekelle Dolerite * Antalo Limestone * Adigrat Sandstone * Enticho Sandstone * Edaga Arbi Glacials * Quaternary alluvium and freshwater tufa = Topography = As part of the Ethiopian highlands the land has undergone a rapid tectonic uplift, leading the occurrence of mountain peaks, plateaus, valleys and gorges. = Land use = Generally speaking the level lands and intermediate slopes are occupied by cropland, while there is rangeland and shrubs on the steeper slopes. Remnant forests occur around Orthodox Christian churches and a few inaccessible places. A recent trend is the widespread planting of eucalyptus trees. = Environmental changes = Soil degradation in this district became important when humans started deforestation almost 5000 years ago. Depending on land use history, locations have been exposed in varying degrees to such land degradation.  Geomorphic regions and soil units  Given the complex geology and topography of the district, it has been organised into land systems - areas with specific and unique geomorphic and geological characteristics, characterised by a particular soil distribution along the soil catena. Soil types are classified in line with World Reference Base for Soil Resources and reference made to main characteristics that can be observed in the field. = Hagere Selam Highlands = Typical catena in the Hagere Selam highlands Luvisol in Dingilet This land system occurs on the central basalt plateau and adjacent ridges;

Nutrients and organic matter were lost and soil depth was reduced. Hence, soil erosion is an important problem, which results in low crop yields and biomass production. As a response to the strong degradation and thanks to the hard labour of many people in the villages, soil conservation has been carried out on a large scale since the 1980s and especially 1980s; this has curbed rates of soil loss. Measures include the construction of infiltration trenches, stone bunds, check dams, small reservoirs such as Chini and May Leiba as well as a major biological measure: exclosures in order to allow forest regeneration. On the other hand, it remains difficult to convince farmers to carry out measures within the farmland (in situ soil management), such as bed and furrows or zero grazing, as there is a fear for loss of income from the land. Such techniques are however very effective.

Biography  Alexander Dorosinskiy was born in Sverdlovsk on August 13, 1973 in the family of a teacher of the Ural Polytechnic Institute Leonid Grigoryevich Dorosinskiy (now - a professor and a doctor of technical sciences) and a teacher Anna Vladimirovna Dorosinskiy (now - an honored teacher of Russia). In his own words, Dorosinskiy's interest in motorsport arose in childhood due to his frequent trips all over the Soviet Union in his father's Zhiguli car, which his father taught him to drive at the age of 12. Then Alexander began to attend kart racing classes, and at the age of 27 he went on to become a professional racing driver - through a former racing driver Vladimir Talanov, a champion of Russia. He studied at the Ural State Medical University, but he dropped out after the second year of studies. In 2005 he graduated from the Ural State University of Economics. In 2001, Dorosinskiy began entrepreneurial activity, launching ‚ÄúSIMphony‚Äù network of mobile communication salons, which in 2005 already had 111 stores in the Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, Kurgan and Tyumen regions, and its share in the Ural mobile retail market was 17-18%. In 2005, he founded ‚ÄúMirai-Avto‚Äù company, which became the official dealer of Subaru cars in Tyumen, and then opened a Subaru service center in Surgut. According to Dorosinskiy, his business was aimed primarily at the opportunity to engage in car racing. At the same time he was developing a career in motorsport and in October 2004 he became the winner of the Estonian Classic Rally Championship in N2000+ class (the main one that year) with three prizes in the absolute at the stages of the tournament. In the same year he made his debut at the stage of the World Rally Championship in Finland. In 2005, Dorosinskiy together with a racing car driver founded the rally team \\"Subaru Team Russia\\", which was even called ‚Äòthe Russian rally team‚Äô in the press. In the same year, a team with Alexander Dorosinskiy took part in the World Rally Championship at the stage in Cyprus, and in 2006 Alexander‚Äôs crew took a third place in the Production category in the Rally New Zealand. In the same year, Dorosinskiy became the third in the overall classification of the stage of the Finnish Rally Championship (at SM Waltikka Ralli). His result was the best achievement ever made by Russians at Finnish rallies before Nikolay Gryazin won the Finland Rally 2019 at The FIA World Rally Championship-2. According to the results of the entire 2006 season, Alexander took eighth place in the A8 class of the Finnish championship. In 2007, as a part of a crew with a navigator Dmitry Eremeev, he took part in the Rally Sweden, the Rally Mexico, and the Rally Argentina. In 2009, 2017 and 2018, he took part in Russian ‚ÄúCan-Am-X-Race‚Äù. Also in 2018, he was a part of a crew with a navigator Oleg Uperenko in the Morocco Rally in the all-terrain vehicle class. In 2019, he took part in the Dakar Rally in Peru as part of the Russian crew of all-terrain vehicles. Also for a long time Dorosinskiy was a coach of a racing driver Sergey Karyakin, who won the Dakar rally in 2017 in the classification of all-terrain vehicles. In 2019 the crew of Alexander Dorosinskiy and Oleg Uperenko performed in three stages of the FIA World Cup for Cross-Country Bajas, and they took fifth place in Bajas Italy, second place in Bajas Aragon and third one in Hungarian Bajas in T3 class (10, 15 and 10 places in the absolute), which provided Alexander the fifth place following the results of the tournament in his category. Also in 2019 Alexander Dorosinskiy and Oleg Uperenko took part in the Morocco Rally for the second year in a row - the final stage of the World Cup in rally- raids, their crew took third place in the T3 class and ninth in the overall classification. He is currently a pilot of the Sport Racing Technologies rally team, driving a buggy.

Composed in Yan'an in early 1939 during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the work is a setting of patriotic texts by Chen Bingjun. Historical background The work was premiered on 24 March 1939 in the Shanbei Gongxue Hall of Yan'an, conducted by the composer. The Production Cantata was originally conceived as a three movement staged tableau with costume. After the first performance, an additional movement was interpolated between the second and third movement of the original version to create a four movement work. This final version was subsequently performed in the early 1940s at the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts. Upon receiving request from the Communist leadership to produce works that would galvanize people‚Äôs support for the major offensive battle taking place in 1939, Xian completed his first opera March of the Army and the People in January 1939, followed by two cantatas, the Production Cantata, which premiered on 24 March 1939, and the Yellow River Cantata, which was first performed four weeks later on 13 April. The Production Cantata clearly shows Xian‚Äôs considerable progress at coming to know ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs situation‚Äù. Xian worked with the librettist Chen Bingjun (ÈôàÁßâÈíß), who was known by his nom de guerre Sai Ke (Â°ûÂÖã) meaning ‚Äúthe Bolshevik‚Äù. Sai Ke was another of Xian‚Äôs colleagues who had acquired renown as a playwright and lyricist in the South China Society. Librettist and composer produced a secular cantata centered on the seasonal cycle of peasant life and correlated their daily life growing crops to the 8th Route Army‚Äôs battle against the enemy. Musical influence Although Huang Zi‚Äôs setting of Chang Hen Ge for chorus and piano was written in 1933, the Production Cantata is the first work by a Chinese composer for chorus and orchestra, and accordingly can be claimed as China‚Äôs first large-scale choral-symphonic work. Production Cantata is all the more noteworthy in this regard, as the orchestra used is an ensemble of Chinese instruments (with the bass line augmented by cellos and basses), rather than an ensemble of western instruments. Xian Xinghai‚Äôs student Li Huanzhi assisted with the orchestrations. Liu Wenjin also had input into the orchestration of the third movement. The Production Cantata‚Äôs second movement begins with the tune Er Yue Li Lai (‰∫åÊúàÈáåÊù•). This melody was an instant hit, and remains a permanent fixture of Chinese musical life. The tune demonstrates Xian Xinghai‚Äôs genius as a melodist. His ability, on display throughout this work and his other compositions, to craft melodies that echo Chinese folk music and thus obtain an instant emotional response from Chinese listeners can be compared to **Tchaikovsky‚Äôs ability in the same field. Structure The Production Cantata consists of four movements that unfold through the seasonal farming cycle. The first movement, Spring Plowing, begins with thunderous Chinese drums that recall itinerant music troupes announcing their arrival in the countryside to attract peasants to their performances. The percussion then segues to folk melodies played on a combination of plucked and bowed Chinese instruments, before progressing to solemnly soaring music that captures the sacred nature of the rituals for opening the spring earth for planting, a commoner‚Äôs ritual that came to be celebrated in imperial ceremonies for thousands of years. The peasant audience would have been excited to hear their work cries and vocabulary in the ornate choral arrangement. The first movement rises to equate the labour of farmers with the valour and courage of the peasant army, a connection that would not have been apparent to farmers in generations past. Sai Ke‚Äôs lyrics dispensed with older customs of opaque couplets in classical Chinese so that the content of music reflected reality ‚Äì the thoughts, feeling and lives of the countryside. The second movement, Planting, commences with lion dance percussion followed by the melody Er Yue Li Lai, a lieder celebrating the sowing of seeds and the karmic reward of such work in terms of sustenance for life. The lyrics call to the farmers to rise above the age-old curse of petty factionalism and embrace unity. The second section returns to a percussive segment that replicate the rhythms of soldiers on the march and then builds to a folk idiom where the tempo ever increases, suggesting the storm of a guerrilla assault on the enemy. The third movement, Harvest, juxtaposes blocks of material taken from folk music, weaving work cries in accelerating calls to reap the harvest and thereby defeat an invader that is hopelessly bound to fail. The choir lapses into hearty laughter at completing the enemy‚Äôs impossible task, a tweaking of the nose of the Japanese imperial ‚Äúsuperman.‚Äù The fourth movement, The Abundant Year, releases the tension of the prior movement through its celebration of the harvest and the satisfaction felt by the peasants at the fruits of their labour. Xian and Sai Ke bring the peasant audience further into the composition through their musical and lyrical wit, reproducing the sounds of livestock in whimsical innovations and building to exultant exclamation of the invincibility of a new China. The Cantata ends as a monument to a revival of a great civilization shorn of the straightjacket of faux Confucian restraints and grounded in the celebration of ordinary people. Performances and recordings After its initial performances, the second movement of the Cantata became popular, but the work as a whole did not enter the mainstream repertory and full performances were rare, possibly because the chorus parts are significantly more difficult to sing than those of the subsequent Yellow River Cantata. In 2015, the work was revived by Nicholas Michael Smith, who performed it with the International Festival Chorus of Beijing and Peking Sinfonietta. Smith subsequently recorded the work with the International Festival Chorus of Beijing, the Baroque Chamber Chorus of Beijing, the Beijing No. 80 Middle School Choir and Peking Sinfonietta. This is currently the only available recording of the Production Cantata.

In widowhood, Charlotte Chang worked at the Oakland International Institute branch of the YWCA as a \\"nationality worker\\", from 1928 into the 1930s. She is considered one of the first Chinese-American social workers in the San Francisco area. She also volunteered at the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital. She applied again to have her American citizenship reinstated in 1935.  Kong Chow Temple  In 1968 and 1969, while in her nineties, Chang led protests against plans to demolish the old Kong Chow Temple, established on land her father donated in 1854 for the purpose. Her niece, artist Nanying Stella Wong, joined her efforts. The temple was ultimately demolished; Chang did not live to see the new Kong Chow Temple erected at another location in 1977.  Personal life  Charlotte Ah-Tye Chang was widowed when Hong Yen Chang died in 1926. Her daughter died in a car accident in 1929. Charlotte Chang died in Berkeley in 1972, aged 98 years. Her gravesite is in Oakland.

The film, produced by Heera John, had musical score by Prasad Ganesh and was released on 10 July 2009. Plot The film begins with the famous playback singer Mithuna (Mithuna) returns home in Chennai. In the past, in Yelagiri, Muthu (M. D. Muthu) was a blind man selling plastic wire baskets in the street to support his poor family: his stepmother (Nalini) and his school-going two stepsisters. Mithuna and her elder sister Devi (Devadarshini) who went for the holidays in Yelagiri came across Muthu and his family. Mithuna had sympathy for them so she decided to help them: she took them to Chennai, she lodged them in her house and she enrolled his stepsisters in an elementary school. Thereafter, Mithuna deeply fell in love with the innocent Muthu. She proposed her love for Muthu but he was sceptical about her love. Mithuna decided to donate her eyes to Muthu but doctor Ramana (Delhi Ganesh) refused to operate her and Muthu eventually found a donor. Back to the present, Muthu has gained vision after the eye operation and he finally understands the pure love of Mithuna. Meanwhile, Mithuna's friend Jennifer (Jennifer) comes from Malaysia to Chennai and she falls in love with Muthu. Mithuna slowly becomes jealous and upset about the intimate relationship of Muthu and Jennifer. When Jennifer decides to return to Malaysia, she wants to bring Muthu with her and he accepts. Mithuna's family and friends begin to scold Muthu for being an ingrateful person and Jennifer reveals the reason behind his sudden behaviour change. Just after the eye surgery, Muthu came to know that he was infected with the Hepatitis B virus. Knowing that his days are numbered, he didn't want to torment Mithuna and wanted her to forget him so he begged Jennifer to act as his girlfriend but Jennifer truly fell in love with him. A mournful Jennifer goes back to Malaysia and a sorrowful Mithuna continues her work. One night, Muthu wants to see Mithuna for the last time in her recording studio and Muthu bumps into a rowdy who wants to kill Mithuna outside the studio. Muthu manages to kill him and he is heavily wounded. A bloodied Muthu falls on the street and he tries to warn Mithuna of his presence but Mithuna drives away without seeing him and Muthu dies.

For eight years in her youth, Herrero was bullied on account of her weight and felt depressed, useless, and without identity. She has said that she realized she had been bullied when she entered a new, positive school environment. There, she did a research project about youth identity and bullying that was awarded by the University of Girona, where she studied psychology for a year. An accompanying video titled \\"El dolor silencioso\\" (The Silent Pain) featured bullied youth including herself encouraging others to speak up. Her organization Rompe el Silencio (Break the Silence), formed in 2013, supported bullied youth in online and face-to-face settings. Early life and education Herrero's classmates started bullying her when she was eight years old. A third-grade student at a primary school in Tordera, Barcelona, Herrero was a little bit heavier than her peers and somewhat introverted. Classmates would use nicknames and insults to isolate and make fun of her on account of her weight. Amid the bullying, which she did not explicitly perceive while it was happening, she turned further inward, becoming silent and averse to eye contact. She recalled feeling alone as she saw other children playing during recess. Eating was a temporary relief, though as she gained weight she was subjected to more insults. Her home and supportive family were a refuge from harassment. At the age of 11, Herrero joined a social group in which one student led the others in continuing to judge and bully her. The girls in the group, she later reflected, made her feel inferior and thus easier to manipulate. They were also physically hurtful: One time, they pushed her down stairs, and another time, they pulled a chair out from under her. Herrero had suicidal thoughts and began to self-harm; she said she felt anguished, depressed, confused, victimized, and useless. She said she did not know who she was‚Äîduring a developmental stage at which a child is supposed to form her identity. Looking in a mirror, feeling her skin, and hearing her voice all made her feel bad, she said. Breaking her own silence, she later said‚Äîletting someone know‚Äîwould have been the best thing to do. She said she slowly came to realize that she liked talking to people outside her punishing social group. The bullying lasted eight years, ending when she started bachillerato and, she said, adopted a healthier mindset. Herrero said she liked this new environment, where she got good grades and realized that her social group had not been a true friendship. Online, under the pseudonym Silay Alkma, she blogged about her bullying experience and met other young bullying victims from around the world. Her diary was put together in a book, titled Alma de Cristal (Soul of Glass). Her bullying also inspired a bachillerato research project about youth identity amid bullying that she undertook at IES Llu√≠s Companys in Tordera. The work argues that the identity of bullied people is suppressed, that they stay this way for fear of being totally outcast, and that an environment supportive of resilience and self-expression is needed for them to overcome bullying. To accompany the research project, Herrero made a video titled \\"El dolor silencioso\\" (The Silent Pain) featuring some of the people she met online and herself, describing their bullying and encouraging other young suffering people to speak up. The video received wide attention on the internet. Herrero's family learned about her bullying only when the research and video came out. In 2012, her work won a Consell Social prize for research in youth issues from the University of Girona. The award covered one year of studying psychology at the University of Girona starting in September 2012. Later that year, at the university, she gave a TEDxYouth talk about her experience being bullied and finding others online. Career In 2013, with backing from the Fundaci√≥n Telef√≥nica program Think Big J√≥venes, Herrero formed an organization called Rompe el Silencio (Break the Silence) to support youth who have suffered bullying, abuse, and psychological disorders. Its purpose was to help those people get access to treatment and regain their identity. With the organization, Herrero gave lectures and workshops at schools to raise awareness about youth harassment. The organization's website provided a platform for youth to communicate. The Think Big program helped develop her organization and expand its reach, and it ran programs in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, and Mexico. In 2015, Rompe el Silencio was among ten winners in Spain's Making More Health contest sponsored by the nonprofit network Ashoka and the pharmaceutical firm Boehringer Ingelheim, receiving along with professional training in Barcelona. The next year, Herrero was one of two finalists from Spain to attend an international Making More Health conference at Boehringer Ingelheim's headquarters in Germany. According to the leadership consultancy WALK (a member of Oxford Leadership), where Herrero works as an office and program manager, she received a psychology degree from the National University of Distance Education, previously volunteered for the United Nations as a research data analyst, and worked with Youth Europa and the European Youth Parliament.

It is a product of high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water.  Role of nano particles  The incorporation of ultra-fine particles into a Portland-cement paste within a concrete mixture alters the concrete's material properties and performance by reducing the void space between the cement and aggregate in the cured concrete. This improves strength, durability, shrinkage and bonding to steel reinforcing bars.  Manufacture  To ensure the mixing is thorough enough to create nanoconcrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30‚Äì600 watts per kilogram of the mix. This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific energy expended upon the mix of at least 5000 joules per kilogram of the mix. and may be increased to 30‚Äì80 kJ per kilogram. A superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete mixer. In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation and absorption of energy by the mixture and increases shear stresses on the surface of cement particles. As a result, the temperature of the mixture increases by 20‚Äì25 degrees Celsius. This intense mixing serves to deepen hydration process inside the cement particles. The nano-sized colloid Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) formation increased several times compared with conventional mixing. Thus, the ordinary concrete transforms to nanoconcrete. The initial natural process of cement hydration with formation of colloidal globules about 5 nm in diameter spreads into the entire volume of cement‚Äìwater matrix as the energy expended upon the mix. The liquid activated high-energy mixture can be used by itself for casting small architectural details and decorative items, or foamed (expanded) for lightweight concrete. HEM Nanoconcrete hardens in low and subzero temperature conditions because the liquid phase inside the nano-pores of C-S-H gel doesn't freeze at temperatures from ‚àí8 to ‚àí42 degrees Celsius. The increased volume of gel reduces capillarity in solid and porous materials. References Category:Concrete ","title":"Nanoconcrete"},{"id":"62227504","text":"R.

It is considered to be a zosterophyll, one of a group of plants that were related to the ancestors of the modern lycopsids. Fossils were found in the Posongchong Formation in Guangnan County, Yunnan, in southwestern China, where they occur as compressions. Description The first species to be described was Ramoferis amalia. The plant branched isotomously (equally) many times, with branches forming angles of about 30‚Äì60¬∞. Usually the axes (stems) were 3‚Äì4 mm across, although some were up to 5 mm across. The longest axis found bearing sporangia was about 12 cm long, branching four or five times, with the branching intervals decreasing towards the top. The smallest terminal branchlets were less than 1 mm wide and about 6-10 mm long. Sporangia were borne on short stalks both terminally and laterally. Some were found below the first branching point of the main axis, others were gathered into a spike. The sporangia were flattened, usually about 3‚Äì6 mm wide and 2.5‚Äì5 mm high. Viewed from the front, the sporangia were ovoid or pear-shaped, narrowing towards the stalk. They opened (dehisced) along a narrow rim at the edge opposite the stalk (the distal edge), producing two equal valves. Only poorly preserved spores were found, 48‚Äì77 ¬µm in diameter. Nothing is known about the internal anatomy of the axes. A second species, known only as Ramoferis cf. amalia, was described from fossils found in a slightly different location. Only limited material was found. Differences regarded as significant included the branching angle being greater, 60‚Äì70¬∞; the more kidney (reniform) shaped sporangia; the longer sporangial stalks; and the less distinct spikes of sporangia. Taxonomy Hao and Xue place Ramoferis in class Zosterophyllopsida, order Zosterophyllales. They use Zosterophyllales for species with both terminal and lateral sporangia; Gosslingiales have only lateral sporangia. =Phylogeny= An cladistic analysis by Hao and Xue in 2013 placed Ramoferis clearly within their Zosterophyllales clade: References Bibliography * Category:Early Devonian plants Category:Pragian life Category:Zosterophylls Category:Lycophyte genera Category:Prehistoric plant genera ","title":"Ramoferis"},{"id":"62227783","title":"Anbariv"},{"id":"62227793","text":"Windmill Hill is a village in the Wealden district of East Sussex.

The area that was once platted into city blocks is now nothing but open crop field. The post office at Salt Marsh, which was the original name of Seapo, was established July 9, 1866, and was the first post office in Republic County. It was also one of only three post offices between Manhattan and Denver. The post office was discontinued September 25, 1889. Seapo was the oldest village in Republic County. The town was \\"well laid out on a level plain\\", but \\"without tree or fence ornaments\\". There were three church organizations: Christian, Methodist, and Presbyterian, and a school building. Just north of the town was a three-story gristmill. The Seapo Mill was built in 1872 by A. W. Miller, who also operated the mill. The construction of the native limestone mill cost $12,000 and was financed by T. B. Hazen, who ran a store in Seapo. The mill was originally powered by running water but later by a 45 horsepower steam engine. The mill was capable of running five run of burr stones with a capacity of 100 barrels of flour per day. The mill was converted into a house in 1898. The house was abandoned in 1988 when the owner died, but the structure remains standing.

She is best known for her popular series Sapsaam Dim, known as Miss 13 Dot or 13-Dot Cartoon in English, which follows the adventures of a rich, fashion-oriented teenager. Sapsaam Dim was one of the best selling comics in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.  Early life  Statue of Sapsaam Dim in Kowloon Park, Hong Kong Lee recalls her early influences as children's book illustrator Kwan Shan Mei (), comics artist Chan Chi-dor (), American Don Flowers, creator of the comic strip Glamor Girls, and imported Harvey Comics like Richie Rich and Hot Stuff the Little Devil. Richie Rich would become an inspiration for her most famous creation. As a teenager, she won a 1965 children's fashion design contest sponsored by Tin Tin Daily. Her first comic book, Fafa Siuze (Miss Flower), was published in March 1965 and lasted eight issues. Sapsaam Dim (Miss 13 Dot) began in 1966. Zai-se-ti, literally translated as \\"13 dots\\", is Shanghainese slang for frivolous young women. The title character is the daughter of a millionaire banker, Mr. Cash, and a lenient mother, Mrs. Lovely. Like Richie Rich, the series focused on her unrealistic, luxurious adventures. Western fashion was a major focus of the series; it is estimated that the first 28 issues featured over 1700 different pieces of clothing. Readers took copies of the comic to tailors to have imitation outfits made. Miss 13 Dot was intended and received as a feminist icon during a time of change for women in Hong Kong; Lee said \\"can do what she likes, make her own decisions, have her own ideas.\\" At its peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Sapsaam Dim was selling 50,000 copies a month. The series ended in 1980. In 1978, Lee and her husband were artists on a new children's magazine called Sannei Gogo (Brother Sunny). In 2005, Lee and the company Dog 9 released a 12-inch Miss 13 Dot doll. She also published a Miss 13 Dot graphic novel, Lyun-lyun Baa-lai (Love in Paris), in February 2008.

Undercuts on molded parts are features that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an injection molding machine. They are categorized into internal and external undercuts, where external undercuts are on the exterior of the part and interior undercuts are on the inside of the part. Undercuts can still be molded, but require a side action or side pull. This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine... If the size of the undercut is small enough and the material is flexible enough a side action is not always required. In these cases the undercut is stripped or snapped out of the mold. When this is done usually a stripping plate or ring is used instead of ejector pins so that the part is not damaged. This technique can be used on internal and external undercuts.

Successful applicants receive either 'Pre-settled status' or 'Settled status', depending on the length of time they have been resident in the United Kingdom. Application process The application process is predominately digital. Applicants are required to use an NFC-enabled device to scan the biometric chip on their relevant identification document, after which they are free to complete the application on any internet-enabled device. During the early stages of the Scheme's rollout process, there was a ¬£65 fee for applicants above the age of 16 (the fee was halved for younger applicants) at the point of application. This was, however, dropped following pressure from a number of groups and individuals. To complete an application through the online portal, citizens must have a valid passport or national identity card, and may be asked to provide proof of continuous residence if checks with the Department for Work and Pensions and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs cannot confirm the duration of stay using the applicant's National Insurance number. Eligibility The EU Settlement Scheme applies to all EU, EEA and Swiss citizens resident in the United Kingdom prior to its departure from the European Union, and their family members. Relevant nationals who are not in their own right British nationals, or who do not already have indefinite leave to enter the UK or indefinite leave to remain in the UK, and who wish to remain in the United Kingdom, are required to apply under the Scheme lest they face enforcement action. All applicants must have started living in the UK by 31 December 2020. 'Settled status' requires five years of continuous residence; this is defined as living in the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man for five consecutive years, and for at least six months in any 12-month period during those years. Longer absences are permitted for specified reasons, such as one period of up to 12 months for childbirth, illness, study, training or a work posting.  Rights granted  =Settled status= Citizens resident in the UK prior to 31 December 2020 and exercising Treaty rights for a continuous period exceeding five years ('continuous residence') will usually receive 'settled status' ‚Äì formally Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) under Appendix EU to the Immigration Rules. They are able to remain in the UK as long as they wish, subject to conditions, and retain the same rights to employment, welfare, education and public funds as previously; they may also apply for British citizenship. Citizens with 'settled status' may spend up to exactly five continuous years outside the United Kingdom without impacting their immigration status, and will lose their 'settled status' if they spend any continuous time of five years and a day or longer outside the UK. Similarly, close family members may join citizens with 'settled status' before 31 December 2020, or 31 of December 2025 for the spouses and civil partners of Swiss citizens; these close family members must register on the Scheme when they become resident. Children born in the UK to parents, at least one of whom is a citizen with 'settled status' at the time of the child's birth, automatically have British citizenship from birth. Children born in the UK, at least one of whose parents acquire 'settled status' after the child's birth, have an entitlement to acquire citizenship before the child's 18th birthday. = Pre-settled status = Citizens who started living in the UK on or before 31 December 2020 but do not have five years' continuous residence at the time they apply, are usually granted pre-settled status. They are allowed to stay in the UK for a further five years from the date of grant, and can apply during that time to change their status to 'settled', on completing five years' continuous residence. Pre-settled status is lost if a continuous period of longer than two years is spent outside the UK. = Others = Rights and status of all EU, EEA and Swiss citizens living in the UK remain unchanged until 30 June 2021.  Statistics  In the period up to 31 May 2020, the Home Office had received 3,612,400 applications under the scheme, with 76,400 in May 2020 alone. Of these, 3,319,000 had been completed, with 57.47% of applicants receiving settled status, 41.20% receiving pre-settled status, and a further 1.32% resulting in another outcome (e.g. 28,900, 0.87%, were withdrawn or received a void outcome, 14,100, 0.42%, were invalid, and 900, 0.03% were refused. As of the end of May 2020, more applications had been received from Polish citizens (697,900) than any other nationality; the least from any EU country had been Luxembourg (1,000) and the least from any country had been Liechtenstein (fewer than 50).

They were commissioned by the Bishop of Norwich, Henry Despenser, in 1382 following his destruction of a rebel peasant army at the Battle of North Walsham the previous year. Historians generally consider him to have been using the opportunity to remind the peasantry of their social position following the Peasants' revolt. Background =Bishop Despenser= Henry Despenser (c. 1341‚Äì1406) was an English nobleman and Bishop of Norwich. Destined for a career in the church from a young age, he spent much of his earlier life at the Papal curia in the service of Pope Urban V. There he fought in the papal armies against the city state of Milan during the crusade against the Visconti. The year after the Peasants' Revolt, Despenser had led an army against supprters of the antipope, Clement VII, in Ghent. He gained the moniker 'Fighting Bishop' following his suppression of the Peasants' Revolt in East Anglia with his crushing defeat of the rebels at the Battle of North Walsham in June 1381. =Reredos= A reredos is an altar screen which holds multiple portraits of saints. They have both decorative and practical purposes: while luxurious, they have the effect of drawing an observer's eye towards the most important‚Äîbut often blandest‚Äîfeature of the church, the altar. Despenser reredos Despenser commissioned the new reredos for St Luke's chapel in Norwich Cathedral's priory shortly after putting down the revolt in Norfolk. It comprised five sections, each devoted to a distinct aspect of Christ's final days: his flagellation, the procession to the cross wearing the crown of thorns, and finally his cruxifiction, burial and resurrection. The medievalist Sarah Beckwith has argued that the commission was directly related to the insurrection in the manner of an object lesson, suggesting that \\"the peasants who had dared, albeit abortively, to contest their ordained position in the social hierarchy and whose revolutionary gestures were based on an identification with Christ, are once again shown a story, a story they already know very well. In Despenser's reredos, Christ is shown as humbly accepting his fate from those with the power to prescribe it; a similar position, says Beckwith, to the position the peasantry now found themselves in following their abortive rebellion.

Early life Ole (or Olaus) Judich√¶r was born on 20 March 1661 in GotlandBjerg in Gyldendal, although this date may have been 20 February 1661Project Runeberg Vol 8 pp 554 - 556 where his father was the parish priest in the very south of the island. At the age of seventeen he departed for Copenhagen where, in 1683 and 1684, he studied theology. Later he studied mathematics under the scientist Ole R√∏mer, who recommended Judich√¶r to Niels Juel and to Admiral Henrik Span. He became tutor to the household of the latter, during which time he occasionally preached in the naval Church of Holmen. Naval career In 1690 he was appointed deputy dockmaster at Bremerholm (better known as Gammelholm in today‚Äôs Copenhagen) and a short time thereafter as leader in the shipbuilding department. With the launch of the ship-of-the-line Dannebroge in 1692 ‚Äì the first ship to be built at Nyholm ‚Äì he was officially named as dockmaster and fabrikmester, positions he retained until 1725. From being a civilian employed as shipbuilder at the Royal Naval dockyards, he was commission in 1698 direct to the rank of commander ( kommand√∏rkaptajn) despite not having followed the normal officer training pathway. In 1706 or 1708, in response to complaints that his ship designs were influenced by too much theory, he embarked on a study tour to Holland and Britain. Whilst in Britain he accompanied Admiral George Byng on a voyage to Lisbon. The return of hostilities in the Baltic caused his study tour to be curtailed, and shortly thereafter he was in Lithuania purchasing timber for shipbuilding, followed by Christians√∏ where he was to renovate the defence works of that Baltic island. In 1710, at the Battle of K√∏ge Bay, Judich√¶r commanded a squadron in the fleet led by Gyldenl√∏ve. As chief of coastal defence from 1711 he was responsible for the scuttling of decommissioned warships to form the foundation of the sea fort Trekroner on the approaches to Copenhagen harbour.

During the Great Northern War he was loaded with many responsibilities in addition to shipbuilding, including officer commanding Zealand‚Äôs coastal defences ‚Äì despite his lack of traditional training as a naval officer or in naval warfare. His distinguished performance in many of these duties saw him grow in confidence and also in stubbornness. In 1700 he refused to take defensive measures to block FlinterendenFlinterenden is the strategic 15 Km passage at the southern end of √òresund, between Saltholm and Sk√•ne, before the Baltic Sea.

Judich√¶r, by his whimsical response to these charges, did not gain any friends and was made a scapegoat for all that was wrong at the shipyards, being dismissed in 1725 ‚Äì a decision formally approved in 1727. The story that he had to leave Holmen in disgrace through the Slaves Gate is provably untrue. He retired to N√¶stved where he died on 29 September 1729.

Biography He is one of the least known literary figures in Serbia whose biography is incomplete. There is no sure date of his birth or death and the chronological happenings that occurred in his lifetime have yet to be put in sequence. His contemporaries were Dositej Obradoviƒá, Jovan Rajiƒá, Pavle Solariƒá, Stefan von Novakoviƒá, and others. Maksimoviƒá wrote his satires in a series of articles under the title Mali bukvar za veliku decu (\\"Little premier for grown-up children\\") in the language of the common people instead of the antiquated Slavonic-Serbian. His articles, printed in Serbian newspapers, were later compiled and published as a book in Vienna in 1792 under the same title. We know he was a professor because he was moved so many times to new posts. That happened because he was opposed to the Roman Catholic Church's dominance of secular concerns, especially education. He was forced to spend the rest of his life in minor posts distant from Vienna (such as Petrovaradin and other such places that were considered remote in the Habsburg Empire), like many others in the decade following the French Revolution he became quite reactionary in line with the shifts that saw most of the Emperor Joseph's reforms of the 1780s retracted before he died. Literary work Not surprisingly, the great age of satire in Serbian literature dates from the eighteenth century and comes from the pen of Mihailo Maksimoviƒá who put into common Serbian ƒåto je papa? (Was ist der Papst? or \\"Who is the Pope?\\") in 1784 that gleans the works of Fran√ßois-Antoine Devaux's (1712-1796) on reclaiming of lands and the Austrian Febronianist pamphleteer Joseph Valentin Eybel's relentless and scurrilous attacks on the Roman Curia, namely the Pope. In 1792, Mihailo Maksimoviƒá's Mali bukvar za veliku decu (Small Primer for Grown-up Children) was published as the first satirical book of modern Serbian literature.

History  The Nizhny Tagil Museum of Regional History was originally built in 1840 as the Museum of Natural History and Antiquities (, ). The museum was established on the basis of the exhibition that was organized for Tsesarevich Alexander Nikolaevich, the future Emperor Alexander II, who visited Nizhny Tagil in 1837. The museum was a sheltered institution. Its purpose was to collect, store, and study collections which were also used as a study aid for the students of the Demidov Vyya Technical School. On the basis of the collections from \\"Muzeum\\" and from the Vyya Museum, Metallurgical Museum of the Nizhny Tagil and Lunyevka Factories was established in 1891. However, this museum closed its doors in 1907 due to lack of funding. It caused the loss of many exhibits. The museum was re-established only in 1924 as the Nizhny Tagil Museum of the Regional History. Its collection has been supplemented with the rare items from the and from the surrounding churches.

Description The bronze sculpture with green patina measures approximately 8 ft. 2 in. x 3 ft. x 18 in., and rests on a granite base that measures approximately 27 x 72 x 87.5 in. It cost $180,000, and weighs 600 lbs. History The memorial was designed in 1988 and dedicated on May 29, 1990, the date that would have been Kennedy's 73rd birthday. The ceremony attracted a crowd of 2,500 that included Kennedy's widow Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, his brother Ted Kennedy and other family members.. The statue, which depicts Kennedy in midstride, quickly became a tourist attraction on the State House grounds. It was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in 1994. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, however, police closed the gates to the State House lawn, cutting off public access to several statues, including Kennedy, Anne Hutchinson, Henry Cabot Lodge, Horace Mann and Daniel Webster. These statures were still visible at a distance from the Beacon Street sidewalk, through a fence. Only the equestrian statue of Joseph Hooker and the statue of Mary Dyer remained open to close public inspection, as they are located in the pedestrian plaza of the building's main public entrance. For two days in 2013, on the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, state officials allowed visitors to get close to the statue, with a park ranger present. Starting in 2015, they made access to the statue a regular feature during business hours, on weekdays, in spring and summer. There is still no direct access from the street; visitors must first enter the State House and go through security screening, then exit the building from a door near the statue where security officers are stationed.

It is native to the Palearctic realm but has spread to North America. The larvae feed on the foliage of birch trees. Description The adult Profenusa thomsoni is black and about in length and fly-like in appearance. The whitish larva has short legs, dark markings on the first segment of the thorax, and two black spots on each of the second and third segments. It develops inside a leaf blade, the egg usually being laid close to the midrib and the larva hollowing out a \\"blotch\\"-shaped cavity. There are six instars, the last stage taking place on the ground as the larva searches out a place to pupate. A very similar sawfly, Fenusa pumila, also mines birch leaves, but tends to infest young, expanding leaves, and causes crinkling of the leaf blade, whereas P. thomsoni infests mature leaves which remain undistorted. Distribution and habitat Profenusa thomsoni has a widespread distribution in the Palearctic realm in Europe and Asia. It was introduced into North America in the early twentieth century where it became invasive. By 1970 it had spread to Alberta, and by 1996, to Alaska. The larvae feed on a number of species of birch (Betula) and other members of the family Betulaceae. Life cycle Larva All individuals of Profenusa thomsoni are female and reproduction is by parthenogenesis. The eggs are laid inside mature leaves of the host tree, usually near the midrib. The larvae feed on the mesophyll tissue inside the leaf, creating a pale brownish \\"blotch\\"-shaped mine. Some leaves may have multiple larvae developing inside them. When fully mature, the larvae emerge through the underside of the leaf and fall to the ground, where they make chambers in which to pupate. They overwinter in these, emerging as adults in July and August the following year. There is a single generation per year. Ecology P. thomsoni and F. pumila often occur on the same tree, and heavy infestations may cause extensive defoliation. P. thomsoni is uncommon in Europe, but after its introduction into North America, populations built up rapidly. In Alberta, populations of P. thomsoni plummeted in the early 1990s, and have remained low ever since. This was found to be associated with the larvae being attacked by the parasitic wasp Lathrolestes luteolator; hitherto the wasp had parasitised other species of sawfly larva, and this was the first occasion that this particular host/parasite relationship had been observed. The wasps lay eggs in late-stage larvae of the leaf miner, and the wasps' larvae mainly develop in the overwintering prepupae of their hosts.

It publishes detailed descriptions of useful organic reactions. Each article (called a chapter) is an invited review of the primary source material for the given reaction, and is written under tight editorial control, making it a secondary to tertiarylevel source. Each chapter explores the practical and theoretical aspects of the reaction, including its selectivity and reproducibility. The longest chapter runs to 1,303 pages. While individual articles are not open access, the journal's wiki maintains a repository of summaries of reactions. The series is abstracted and indexed in Scopus. History Prior to World War II, the center of organic chemistry research and industrial production was Germany. Students interested in pursuing a career in organic chemistry needed to learn German to read articles and textbooks, and often went to graduate school in Germany. When the war broke out, an effort to jumpstart a native US organic chemical industry and academic network was initiated. As part of this effort, the journal was launched. The first volume was published in 1942, with Roger Adams as editor-in-chief. In the early years a volume would come out every two years or so, but the pace of publishing has accelerated, with volume 100 due out in 2019 or 2020.

She is sometimes referred to as Canada's Betsy Ross. November 6, 1964 During the 1963 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Lester Pearson promised that Canada would have a new flag within two years of his election. Three designs were chosen from a list of more than 3,500 entries. The designs included the current Canadian flag, the ‚ÄúPearson Pennant‚Äù, and a third design that resembled the current flag, but with a Union Jack and three fleurs-de-lis. On November 6, 1964 ‚Äì a Friday ‚Äì Pearson requested that prototypes of the three flag designs under consideration be delivered to 24 Sussex Drive so that he could see them displayed at his summer residence at Harrington Lake that weekend. The request came to Ken Donovan, O'Malley's father, who was the assistant purchasing director with the Canadian Government Exhibition Commission. The flags had to be entirely ‚ÄúCanadian content‚Äù. However, the request had come after normal business hours and the only company that could supply the material ‚Äì S.E. Woods ‚Äì had no overtime staff to sew the flags. Donovan contacted O'Malley, then 20 years old, and explained his dilemma. A secretary at the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Citizenship, O'Malley did not consider herself a professional seamstress and, at the time, her sewing experience was limited to sewing her own clothing. Nevertheless, she agreed to prepare the prototypes. She packed up her Singer sewing machine and drove to the Exhibition Commission office shortly after 7:00 pm. O'Malley completed the six flags ‚Äì two flags of each design ‚Äì shortly after midnight. They were delivered to 24 Sussex in the middle of the night and hoisted at Harrington Lake the next morning. Legacy O‚ÄôMalley was initially told to keep her role in creating the Canadian flag secret and she did not speak of her experience for 10 years. In recent years, however, she has increasingly become an ambassador for the flag and has attended dozens of flag-related events. At a ceremony on Parliament Hill on November 14, 2014, O'Malley was presented with the flag that had been flown on the Peace Tower on November 6 of that year, exactly 50 years after she had sewn the first prototype. At the ceremony, she noted that while she was never paid to create the flags, she considered the recognition she received to be payment enough. The Singer sewing machine that O'Malley used to create the six prototypes was displayed at the Canadian Museum of History‚Äôs Canadian History Hall from 2017 to 2019. The whereabouts of the prototypes themselves is unknown. =Comparison to Betsy Ross= O'Malley is sometimes compared to Betsy Ross, an American upholsterer who, according to legend, created the first American flag. However, she rejects the comparison, noting that much of the story surrounding Ross is more myth than fact. Personal life O'Malley continued to work for the federal government and eventually took a job with the Ontario Attorney General's office in Ottawa. She retired in 1996. O'Malley and her husband, Brian, raised two children. They reside in Ottawa South.

Holmes (January 6, 1927 ‚Äì November 24, 2017) was an American firefighter, rising to the rank of assistant fire chief of the Oklahoma City Fire Department. After retiring in 1981 he founded the Carl Holmes Executive Development Institute for Fire Management Training as an alternative to the National Fire Academy, an annual conference at Dillard University in New Orleans, La. He was best known for mentoring thousands of African American firefighters in leadership training from 1981 to 2017. Early life and career Holmes was one of the first twelve African-Americans appointed to the Oklahoma City fire department in 1951; the class was carefully selected by the NAACP and the Urban League to staff a firehouse.http://okcfox.com/news/local/black-history-month-the-trailblazing- firefighters-who-integrated-okcfd-in-1951 As black firefighters were entering the profession post WWII, most endured what was a common occurrence for the Jim Crow era, ostracism and racism from fellow firefighters in the station houses upon their integration. They were not allowed to use the common stores found in the firehouse, the assignment of a single bed for their exclusive use and they did not share in purchases made with a common fund for commissary. He and his cohort worked hard to blend in to the semi-segregation of two firehouses to which they were assigned, they were singled out for an award given to the most efficient fire-crews in Oklahoma city. Firefighters gained seniority but were denied the job assignments such as tillerman and special equipment operators which other white firefighters with less experience attained.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229814054_Outsider_Within_the_Firehouse_African_American_and_White_Women_Firefighters Frequently they were assigned the heavy chores on trucks like the can-man (assigned to carry the heavy water can while in full gear when responding to fire scenes), or to clean the lavatories and other menial firehouse maintenance duties. During his time as a firefighter, Holmes noted that becoming an officer would be the hardest task he would face.https://www.firefighterclosecalls.com/chief-carl-holmes-rest-in-peace/ Only two of his class made the transition to management. Firefighter and officer Holmes rose through the ranks, overcoming the hostility in the newly integrated firehouses and gained the respect of peers and officers. In 1969 he attended the first conference of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters in New York City with a contingent from OKFD, protesting harassment and mistreatment in promotions. In 1978 Holmes was promoted to Assistant Chief, the highest ranking attained at the time by an African American. After thirty years as an active firefighter Holmes took issue with the training offered to African Americans whom gained access to the National Fire Academy yet were seemingly bypassed for promotions. Seeing that change would not be in the offing upon retiring in 1981 from the OKCFD he founded the Executive Developmental Institute (EDI) to provide the necessary skills for leadership and advancement. As a motivational speaker he travelled around the country spreading a positive message of inclusiveness; and spoke of the potential to reach the higher rungs of the fire service. Other cities courted him for his professional credentials to work for them, however he had loftier goals. His experiences in overcoming obstacles due to racial restrictions and eventually become an officer by emphasizing people and tactics made him a recognized expert in the field of leadership training.https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2017/12/04/extensions- of-remarks-section/art... Executive Development Institute The Executive Development Institute first held its conferences at Florida A&M; University in Tallahassee, Florida. Currently in the 29th year, the national conferences and training are at Dillard University, a HBCU for Liberal Arts in New Orleans.Https://edionline.net African American course instructors offer a concise look at their area of expertise or management skillset in the fire service; providing the highest level of executive training to prospective promotion candidates from across the country. There are skill intensive pre- assignments for completion prior to the June semester in equipment and modification of processes similar to the NFA coursework. Tuition assistance in the form of scholarships for qualified applicants is made available. The goal is to provide instructors and mentors to guide EDI participants to succeed at becoming Officers and Fire Chiefs within their own departments. In 2009 There were approximately twelve female fire chiefs in the U.S. Five of them attended Holmes' EDI. Later life Holmes received the CFSI/Motorola Mason Lankford Fire Service Leadership Award. He was a speaker at IAFC-FRI, Command School, FDIC, Firehouse and his notable fire officer training series at EDI exposed many African American Firefighters to promotion training. He died at his daughter's home in Texas on November 24, 2017.

It saw active service in the Western Desert Campaign, losing a battery at the Battle of Gazala, and then joined 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division for the assault landings in Sicily (Operation Husky) and Normandy (Operation Overlord). It ended the war with 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division in Germany, and was reformed in the postwar TA, eventually merging with other Liverpool units. Origin The regiment had its origin in the 12th Lancashire Battery of the 3rd West Lancashire Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, headquartered at 65 Admiral Street, Toxteth, Liverpool. The '3rd West Lancs' had fought on the Western Front in World War I as part of 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division and then as an independent 'Army' field brigade. After the old Territorial Force was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, the units were redesignated, the battery becoming 353 (12th West Lancashire) Field Battery in 89th (3rd West Lancashire) Field Brigade of the Royal Artillery (RA).Frederick, p. 523.Monthly Army List, various dates.Litchfield, p. 125.Liverpool and Merseyside Remembered.3rd West Lancashire Artillery at Regiments.org. In the late 1930s the need for improved anti-aircraft (AA) defences for Britain's cities became apparent, and a programme of converting some existing TA units was pushed forward. In October 1937 89th Field Brigade (now based at Tramway Road, Aigburth, Liverpool) became 70th (3rd West Lancashire) Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Three of the batteries were equipped with 3-inch guns, later defined as Heavy AA (HAA), while 353 Field Battery became 225 (12th West Lancashire) Light Anti-Aircraft Battery. At this stage Light AA (LAA) units were armed with Light machine guns (AALMGs), but the new Bofors 40 mm gun was on order.Frederick, p. 773.Routledge, pp. 52‚Äì5. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. The TA was doubled in size after the Munich Crisis, and on 23 June 1939, 225 LAA Bty was expanded to form 25th Light Anti- Aircraft Regiment consisting of 81 and 82 LAA Btys in addition to 225.Frederick, pp. 801, 803, 824.Litchfield, p. 131. World War II =Mobilisation and Phoney War= In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA sites. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, Anti- Aircraft Command was fully mobilised at its war stations, with LAA units distributed to defend Vulnerable Points (VPs) such as factories and airfields.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 25th LAA Regiment was part of a new 53rd Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade that was forming in 4th Anti-Aircraft Division, responsible for defending the industrial areas of North West England.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. During the period of the Phoney War the AA defences of NW England were not tested in action, and the time was spent in equipping and training the TA units. =Egypt= After the entry of Italy into the war in June 1940 there was an urgent need to reinforce British forces in the Middle East, and a series of convoys began shipping troops (including AA units) on the six-week journey via the Cape of Good Hope and the Red Sea to Egypt.Farndale, pp. 117‚Äì9.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 190‚Äì2.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 244‚Äì5.Routledge, pp. 127‚Äì30. 25th LAA Regiment was one of the first units selected and arrived early in 1941. By then the Italian invasion of Egypt had been defeated, but the commitments of Middle East Forces were widening, including campaigns in East Africa and Greece, and the Siege of Malta. On 4 March 1941 225 LAA Bty was put on 12 hours' notice to move to Malta. On 16 March it left El Tahag Camp and moved by rail to the Alexandria area. On 17 March the first party boarded a transport that sailed to Haifa and then in a convoy to Malta. On 20 March the rest of the battery embarked in Royal Navy warships which met the transports from Haifa. the convoy was divebombed on 21 March without serious damage, and docked in Malta on 23 March. The battery proceeded to St Andrews Barracks where it became part of 74th LAA Rgt, which had been formed on the island the previous month.Rollo, p. 215; Annex A, p. 325. It served throughout the Siege of Malta and later took part in the campaigns in Sicily and Italy.Routledge, Table XLII, p. 267; Table XLIV, p. 293. Meanwhile, 25th LAA Rgt was brought back to strength on 14 March by the addition of A Bty from 102nd (Northumberland Hussars) LAA/Anti-Tank Rgt, which formed 274 (Northumberland Hussars) LAA Bty. (102 (NH) Regiment continued as a pure anti-tank (A/T) unit thereafter).Frederick, pp. 804, 846.Northumberland Hussars at Regiments.org. Bofors gun being emplaced in the Western Desert, 1942. Towards the end of January the Luftwaffe had begun attacking the Suez Canal from Italian bases on Rhodes, dropping magnetic and acoustic mines at night to disrupt shipping in the canal. Most of the vital supplies and reinforcements therefore had to be landed at Suez rather than passing through the canal.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 326‚Äì8.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 226‚Äì7. Defending against these attacks was an obvious role for searchlights (S/Ls) and LAA guns, but the numbers required for complete coverage were excessive. The compromise plan involved siting single S/Ls on either side of the canal at intervals, with additional rows on the flanks spaced at 5-6000-yard intervals. Thus illumination was restricted to a belt along the length of the canal. Fighter aircraft were to provide the main defence, but the need to defend against low-level raids led to the deployment of single Bofors guns spaced at intervals of about yards on the banks of the narrow stretches of the canal. 25th LAA Regiment was given responsibility under 2 AA Bde for the 'Canal North' sector with its commanding officer (CO), Lieutenant-Colonel F.L. Orme, appointed as AA Defence Commander (AADC).Farndale, Annex F.Routledge, pp. 134‚Äì5. Occasional bombing raids by Junkers Ju 88s flying from Greece against Suez began in July and became almost nightly in August and September. The targets were the Port Tewfik dock installations, the oil refinery, railway marshalling yards, Shallufa Airfield and shipping at the anchorage in the bay.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 298-301. During September and October the AA defences were strengthened further and by the end of October 81 LAA Bty with its 12 Bofors was operating in the Suez and Shallufa area under AADC Suez. By this time the Canal defences had absorbed 96 LAA guns and 66 S/Ls.Routledge, Table XXII, p. 143. =Gazala= In October 1941 25th LAA Rgt transferred to 12 AA Bde which had been reorganised as a mobile formation to provide AA cover for Eighth Army and the landing grounds (LGs) of Desert Air Force during the new British offensive into Libya (Operation Crusader). 'Crusader' began on 18 November 1941, and 12 AA Bde's units moved up behind the advance, spread over many LGs and other VPs. Despite a counter-attack by Gen Erwin Rommel that created confusion among the leading LAA units, Eighth Army attacked again, relieving the Siege of Tobruk and capturing the LGs around Sidi Rezegh, where 12 AA Bde established itself.Routledge, pp. 135‚Äì9. The opening of the Battle of Gazala, 26‚Äì27 May 1942. There was then a pause in the fighting as both sides regrouped. Eighth Army established defensive positions along the Gazala Line. By 22 May 1942, 25 LAA Rgt with 81, 82 and 274 (NH) LAA Btys was listed as 'Army Troops' attached to the recently-arrived 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division occupying part of this line.Order of Battle of Eighth Army, May‚ÄìAugust 1942, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 201/692.Joslen, pp. 81‚Äì2. The Gazala Line consisted of a series of occupied 'boxes' each of brigade strength set out across the desert with minefields and barbed wire watched by regular patrols between the boxes. 51st (N) Division was operating as three independent brigade groups, each with an attached LAA battery. 81 LAA Battery was with 150th Brigade at Sidi Muftah in the centre of the line, with a gap of to 1st Free French Brigade's box at Bir Hakeim in the south, and to 51st (N) Division's 69th Bde in the north, then 151st Bde was stationed just north west of 69th. The Gazala Line was not equally manned, a greater number of troops covering the coast route leaving the south less well guarded.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 215‚Äì7, 227; Map 25. Rommel attacked on 26 May, launching the Battle of Gazala. The German advance was spotted at first light on 27 May. While the northern boxes were pinned by direct attacks, the bulk of the Axis armour swung round Bir Hakeim. The ensuing armoured fighting (the Battle of the Cauldron) therefore occurred to the east, behind 150th Bde's positions. By the evening of 28 May it was clear that 150th Bde was going to be attacked from this direction, and it prepared for all-round defence, reinforced by a few tanks. Early on 30 May elements of the Afrika Korps attempted to break through the position but drew off after taking losses. Next day the Italian Trieste Division and German 90th Light Division attacked, but made little progress against a defence that they described as 'skilful and stubborn'. On 1 June Rommel reinforced the attackers with the 21st Panzer Division and more artillery, and the assault was resumed after heavy dive-bombing. Early in the afternoon 150th Bde was overrun by a series of concentric attacks, the brigadier was killed, and the survivors including most of 81 LAA Bty became prisoners of war.Joslen, p. 334.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 223, 226‚Äì8; Map 26. The battle raged around the remaining boxes for several days until the Axis broke through on 13 June. On the night of 14/15 June the rest of 50th (N) Division broke out of its boxes and escaped towards the Egyptian frontier. 25th LAA Regiment's Royal Army Service Corps transport section had been with 69th (Royal Warwickshire) Heavy AA Rgt in Tobruk. On 16 June, 69th HAA Rgt was ordered back to the Egyptian border with its attached units: the convoy drove through the night to Sollum and therefore escaped the surrender of Tobruk four days later.69 HAA Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 169/4799.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 251‚Äì275. 81 LAA Battery was not reformed after the battle; it was reduced to a cadre in September 1942 and was later placed in suspended animation. 25th LAA Regiment, with its two remaining batteries, was with XXX Corps in August, then returned to 12 AA Bde's command, while 34th LAA Rgt took over as 50th (N) Division's LAA component for the Battle of Alamein. Indeed, 25th LAA Rgt remained in the rear and was not up with 12 AA Bde when the battle began on 23 October.Order of Battle of Eighth Army, August 1942, TNA file WO 201/692.Order of Battle of Eighth Army, October 1942, TNA file WO 201/693.Joslen, p. 569.Routledge, Table XXIII, p. 161. 50th (Northumbrian) Division's formation sign. =Tunisia= After Alamein, 50th (N) Division went into reserve and did not follow Eighth Army into Libya until early December. 25th LAA Regiment moved up and formally joined 50th (N) Division on 16 December 1942; 102nd (Northumberland Hussars) had been the division's A/T regiment since October, and both remained with the division for the rest of its active involvement in the war. 83 LAA Battery from 16th LAA Rgt was apparently regimented with 25th LAA Rgt at this time, but the division still consisted of only two brigades, so its LAA regiment only required two batteries. During January‚ÄìMay 1943 83 LAA Bty remained detached to 27th LAA Rgt defending the LGs and bases under 2 and 12 AA Bdes. 83 Bty later joined 27th LAA permanently.Routledge, Table XXIV, pp. 162‚Äì3; Table XXV, p. 164. Bofors gun and crew in Tunisia, 1943. 50th (Northumbrian) Division moved up from Tripoli to the front and led Eighth Army's attack on the Mareth line on the night of 19/20 March It took three nights' hard fighting to establish bridgeheads over the Wadi Zigzaou, and in the end the Mareth Line was taken by a wider outflanking move. Then on 6‚Äì7 April 50th (N) Division followed 4th Indian Division to breach the anti-tank ditch and wadi at the Battle of Wadi Akarit, another difficult operation but this time successful. The division then followed up and took part in the fighting round Enfidaville before the Tunisian campaign ended with the capture of Tunis on 13 May. Although Axis air attacks against LGs, artillery positions etc had been frequent early in the campaign, these had tailed off as the Allies achieved air superiority.Horrocks, pp. 148‚Äì50.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 334‚Äì54, 364‚Äì7, 372‚Äì3.Routledge, pp. 158‚Äì60. By this stage of the war 25th LAA Rgt was commanded by Lt-Col G.G.O. Lyons, MBE.Barnes, p. 182. =Sicily= Bofors gun and crew in Sicily, 1943. 50th (Northumbrian) Division was selected as one of the assault formations for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). It returned to Egypt and sailed aboard a Fast Assault convoy from Port Said on 6 July; its first wave began landing before dawn on 10 July. Despite some initial confusion the division secured its beaches, but after sunrise subsequent waves were attacked by Axis aircraft. Anti-aircraft cover for the beaches was the responsibility of 2 AA Bde, which had the tricky task of landing LAA and HAA guns, radars etc, across open beaches with the Beach groups. The divisional LAA regiments were thus freed to land with later waves and advance inland with their parent formations. 2 AA Brigade's guns began landing during the morning and by the end of the day leading elements of 50th (N) Division were moving inland, though few of its guns had yet arrived. The division advanced against rearguards for the next three days along poor inland roads to protect the left flank of XIII Corps on the coastal road.Barnes, pp. 6‚Äì15.Molony, Vol V, pp. 52, 58, 60, 69, 78.Routledge, pp. 259‚Äì63. On the night of 13/14 July 50th (N) Division was ordered to advance up Highway 114 to Lentini to link up first with No. 3 Commando, which had landed from the sea to capture Malati bridge there, and then press on to link up with 1st Parachute Bde, which had carried out a landing (Operation Fustian) to capture Primosole Bridge and clear they way for Eighth Army to advance on Catania Airfield and the city beyond.. Both the commandos and paratroops ran into heavier than expected opposition, and 50th (N) Division was also held up: the paratroops were driven off Primosole Bridge before help could arrive, and the operation turned into a bitter four-day fight to recapture the bridge and cross the big irrigation canal beyond. In the end the attempt was given up and 50th (N) Division went on the defensive while other formations outflanked the enemy positions and captured Catania on 5 August. By now the Luftwaffe was carrying out frequent low-level divebombing and strafing attacks, but these were concentrated against airfields and ports. During August 50th (N) Division slowly advanced up Highway 114 as the Allies drove the Axis troops out of Sicily.Barnes, pp. 15‚Äì51.Molony, Vol V, pp. 93, 100‚Äì6, 114, 179.Routledge, pp. 263‚Äì4. =Overlord training= 50th (Northumbrian) Division played no part in the subsequent Italian campaign, having been chosen to return to the UK and prepare for the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). In Sicily the division had operated with a third brigade on loan from 56th (London) Division, but this was earmarked for the Italian campaign. 50th (Northumbrian) Division was therefore brought up to full strength by the permanent addition of 231st Bde, originally part of the Malta garrison, which had fought as an independent brigade group in Sicily and the initial landings in Italy.Joslen, pp. 392‚Äì3.Molony, Vol V, p. 102. The divisional LAA regiment consequently required three batteries once more, and on 23 September 1943 25th LAA Rgt was joined by 138 LAA Bty from 27th LAA Rgt (which had previously gained 83 LAA Bty after its loose association with 25th LAA Rgt). The enlarged 50th (N) Division left Sicily on 10 October 1943 and sailed back to the UK as part of XXX Corps to train for Overlord. The ships carrying 50th (N) Division arrived in the Mersey Estuary in November. Its units were brought up to strength and refitted, and carried out training in the south of England and at combined training centres in Scotland.Barnes, pp. 61‚Äì8. On 14 March 1944 the absent 81 LAA Bty was formally placed in suspended animation and the regiment's other three (82, 138 and 274 (NH) LAA Btys) were augmented to a strength of four troops each when 75‚Äì77 Trps joined from 501 Independent LAA Bty.Frederick, p. 811. 501 LAA Battery had been formed on 7 June 1943 from 358 S/L Bty of 40th (Sherwood Foresters) S/L Rgt on its conversion to 149th (Sherwood Foresters) LAA Rgt. It had become independent on 23 February 1944 before joining 25th AA Rgt and being split up.Frederick, p. 807, 843, 859, 866. The regiment was still commanded by Lt-Col Lyon.Barnes, p. 217. =D-Day= For the actual assault on 6 June (D-Day), 50th (N) Division was reinforced by 8th Armoured Bde and 56th Independent Infantry Bde. Its target was Gold Beach, between Le Hamel, and La Rivi√®re, on which it was to land two assault brigades. AA cover for Gold Beach and the beach exits on D Day was the responsibility of 76 AA Bde, which was to land three LAA batteries, including 320 LAA Bty of 93rd LAA Rgt equipped with triple 20 mm Polsten guns, half of them self-propelled (SP), mounted on Crusader tank chassis to go inland with the assault troops. Although 76 AA Bde could not land all its guns on D Day, the Luftwaffe only made a few scattered attacks during the first 24 hours. 50th (Northumbrian) Division's own units landing during D Day included 82 LAA Bty, which arrived that night and moved up to defend the division's field artillery area.Barnes, pp. 74‚Äì101.Ellis, Vol I, pp. 171‚Äì8, 209‚Äì11.Joslen, p. 581.Routledge, pp. 307‚Äì10.76 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 10 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1084.76 AA Bde War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 171/1084. As the build-up continued on 7 June (D + 1) the other other batteries of 25th LAA Rgt landed. Their convoy had been shelled during the voyage down the English Channel and had suffered casualties and some loss of equipment. They arrived with a mixture of 20 mm and 40 mm equipment to cover the divisional area, while 320 LAA Bty left to protect the site for the Mulberry harbour at Arromanches. Enemy air activity rose sharply on D + 1 and continued for the next two weeks, though the day and night raids were mainly directed against the landing beaches and harbours, and the airborne bridgehead over the River Orne.Routledge, pp. 310‚Äì13. =Normandy and the Low Countries= For the next two months the division fought its way slowly through the Bocage country.Barnes, pp. 102‚Äì31.Ellis, Vol I, pp. 230‚Äì1, 334, 388‚Äì9, 402, 409. Since the Allies had achieved air superiority over the beachhead, there was little call for AA defence, and AA units became increasingly used to supplement the divisional artillery to support ground operations. LAA units fired tracer to guide night attacks onto their objectives, and the Bofors guns were much in demand for infantry support. They could give useful close-range fire to help infantry working from cover to cover in the bocage; their rapid fire was good for suppressing enemy heavy weapons, the 40 mm round's sensitive percussion fuze providing an airburst effect among trees. It was also used for 'bunker-busting', though the lack of protection made the gun detachment vulnerable to return fire. LAA units also provided 'refuge strips' for Air Observation Post aircraft spotting for the field guns: a Bofors troop deployed with Local Warning radar and ground observers could alert the pilot to the presence of enemy aircraft and provide protection for him.Routledge, pp. 314, 317. Bofors gun deployed in North West Europe, 1944. 50th (Northumbrian) Division was relieved on 5 August, but was back in action on 9 August, attacking against stiff opposition in the advance beyond Mont Pincon as the Allies closed the Falaise Gap.Barnes, pp. 132‚Äì7. Once the Seine was crossed and the pursuit began, 50th (N) Division supported 11th Armoured Division's rapid advance, protecting the flank and 'mopping up' local resistance. On 1 September the division secured bridges over the River Somme near Amiens and reached Arras. The AA brigades accompanying 21st Army Group quickly followed up to provided cover for these bridges, while 25th LAA Rgt was able to continue the advance with its division, which took part in the Liberation of Brussels on 3 September.Barnes, pp. 137‚Äì40.Ellis, Vol I, pp. 468‚Äì71.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 4‚Äì6.Horrocks, pp. 195‚Äì201.Routledge, pp. 320‚Äì4, Table L, p 327, Table LI, pp. 328‚Äì30. More resistance was met at the Albert Canal, where 50th (N) Division had to make an assault crossing before pushing on to capture Gheel after bitter fighting (7‚Äì11 September).Barnes, pp. 141‚Äì7.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 12‚Äì3. The division was due to play a minor role in Operation Market Garden, holding the bridgehead from which Guards Armoured Division advanced, and later defending the road and bridge at Nijmegen, but the latter turned into a major defensive battle after the defeat at Arnhem, when the bridges came under heavy air attack.Barnes, pp. 148‚Äì55.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 32, 42, 98.Routledge, p. 325. 53rd (Welsh) Division's formation sign. =Reorganisation= The static warfare in the Nijmegen bridgehead was 50th (N) Division's last operation. It was now very weak and in view of 21st Army Group's acute manpower crisis it was broken up at the end of November to provide reinforcements for other formations. The infantry battalions were reduced to cadres which were sent home to train surplus Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel as infantry replacements; however, the divisional artillery remained with 21st AG. 25th LAA Regiment was assigned to 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division on 1 December, replacing that division's 116th LAA Rgt which was disbanded on 31 January 1945.Barnes, pp. 156‚Äì60.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 158‚Äì9.Frederick, p. 838.Joslen, pp. 87‚Äì8. When the German Ardennes Offensive threatened to break through in December, 53rd (W) Division was among XXX Corps' formations rushed up to seal off the 'Bulge'. It then took part in the counter-attack beginning on 3 January 1945.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 186, 191. =Germany= SP Bofors in Holland, December 1944. 53rd (Welsh) Division was next engaged in the fighting in the Reichswald, (Operation Veritable). XXX Corps launched its attack at 05.00 on 8 February, and as the field and medium artillery concentrated on the enemy's batteries, command posts and communication centres, the divisional LAA regiments took part in the 'Pepperpot', in which guns and mortars of all calibres saturated the enemy positions in front of the assaulting infantry. By this stage of the war divisional LAA regiments had received quadruple 0.5-inch Browning machine guns on SP mountings (the M51 Quadmount) in place of a proportion of their Bofors guns, to improve their capability against 'snap' attacks by the new German jet fighter-bombers. Under this arrangement a troop comprised four SP or towed Bofors and two quadruple SP Brownings. The improvement in LAA barrages led to the resumption of high-level bombing by the Luftwaffe'.Ellis, Vol II, p. 257.Martin, pp. 229‚Äì32.Routledge, pp. 349‚Äì51. 53rd (Welsh) Division's role in Veritable was to capture the northern half of the Reichswald, and by 02.00 on 9 February it was through the Siegfried Line defences. It was then engaged in a week-long fight through the forests as a thaw set in and turned the roads to mud, though the bad weather prevented much air activity on either side. By 17 February the division was approaching the Goch escarpment. The next phase of the operation began on 22 February, with 53rd (W) Division joining on 24 February with an advance from Goch towards Weeze against heavy opposition. By 3 March the division had taken Weeze and met up with the converging US troops: the west bank of the Rhine was effectively cleared.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 258, 261, 263, 267, 271, 274.Horrocks, pp. 250‚Äì5. The assault crossing of the Rhine, Operation Plunder, involved a large and complex air defence plan. Although 53rd (W) Division was not involved in the initial assault, 25th LAA Rgt was one of the LAA units moved up close to the west bank where it was dug- in and carefully concealed in the 48 hours before D-Day. Their role was both to provide AA cover during the night and to take part in the initial 'Pepperpot'. 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, leading the assault for XII Corps had over 700 guns of all types on call when the bombardment began at 23.30 on 23 March, Routledge, pp. 352‚Äì6; Table LVI, p. 365. followed by 'the start of the Divisional \\"Pepperpot\\" at 1 A.M. to swell the din in a mad crescendo and to criss-cross the darkness with the vivid red of anti-aircraft and anti-tank and machine-gun tracer'.Martin, p. 282. The infantry set off across the river in amphibious Buffaloes at 02.00 on 24 March, and made rapid progress inland to link up with the airborne troops who landed during the morning (Operation Varsity).Martin, pp. 283‚Äì5. The Luftwaffe did virtually nothing during the assaults or during D-Day itself: only after nightfall did Junkers Ju 88s begin scattered divebombing attacks at medium and low level against the British bridging sites, artillery positions and supply routes. Some of these were engaged by searchlights and LAA guns. The number of attacks increased the following night and were maintained on the fourth night, but after that 21st AG's exploitation was so deep that the Luftwaffe was forced to switch its attacks away from the Rhine to harassing the leading formations. These nuisance raids continued until the German surrender and were dealt with by divisional LAA units.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 289‚Äì92.Routledge, pp. 356‚Äì62.Saunders, pp. 143‚Äì78. 53rd (Welsh) Division crossed the river on 26 March and continued the advance into Germany. By 10 April it had crossed the Weser and was attacking up the road to Hamburg. It failed to take Rethem, but then found a way over the Aller downstream and advanced towards Verden, which it captured on 17 April. 21st Army Group then closed up to and crossed the Elbe, and 53rd (W) Division had reached the outskirts of Hamburg by the time of the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 293, 306, 310, 316.Routledge, p. 363. 25th LAA Regiment with 82, 138 and 274 (NH) LAA Btys was placed in suspended animation in British Army of the Rhine on 4 February 1946.

When AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 there were wholesale mergers among its units. 525 LAA/SL Regiment, together with 626 (Liverpool Irish) Heavy AA Rgt, was amalgamated into 470 (3rd West Lancs) HAA Rgt, descended from the 70th HAA Rgt that had provided 25th LAA Rgt's original cadre battery in 1939.

Biography  = Early years in the French Royal Navy = Peynier joined the Navy in 1744, aged just 13, taking part in the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1751, he was promoted to Ensign, and assigned a diplomatic mission in the Mediterranean between May and September 1752. Serving on the 64-gun Triton, he called the ports of Tripoli, Smyrna, Tunis, and Algiers. When the Seven Years' War broke out in 1756, Antoine was on a four-year campaign in the Indies. During that mission, in 1757, he was promoted to Lieutenant. In 1759, he was shot in the head, sustaining a lasting and debilitating injury. After the Treaty of Paris restored peace in 1763, Peynier was given command of the 32-gun frigate Malicieuse, making a voyage of exploration and diplomacy in the Lesser Antilles. He arrived at Martinique in March 1765 and remained in the area until the summer of 1766. The governor of Guadeloupe, Count de Nolivos, gave him several diplomatic missions in that time. In May 1765, he was sent as an ambassador to the British governor of Grenada, Robert Melvill, while also spying on British military and naval forces on the island. His instructions stipulated: \\"Without compromising the flag of his Majesty, he will acquire all possible knowledge of the English islands that he will approach [...]\\". After Grenada, Antoine de Thomassin sailed to the Spanish Coast of South America, visiting the ports of Cuman√° and Caracas until June 1765. His goal was to explore and open new maritime routes to trade, especially to supply the French colonies with mules. On his return leg, he stopped at Dominica to inquire about the situation of the French on this island. Peynier was then stationed in Guadeloupe for a while. His Sextius, who served as a Lieutenant on Malicieuse, died at that time. He was buried on 16 August 1765 at the cemetery of the Moule. In January and February 1766, Peynier conducted reconnaissance of Saint Martin, sounding the seabed as to improve the defences of the island. He mapped the coast of the island, and in April 1766, he similarly mapped the coasts of Guadeloupe. In 1772 he was promoted to Captain. =American Revolutionary War = Suffren. The latter leads the 16 ships of his squadron to victory against the 18 of Hughes. 1836 painting by Auguste Jugelet (1805-1875). In 1778, France entered the American Revolutionary War, triggering an Anglo-French War. In 1780, at the request of Lafayette, France sent a 38-ship squadron under De Grasse, ferrying 7,000 men under Lieutenant- General Rochambeau. Peynier took part in the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780, commanding the 64-gun Art√©sien. With the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo- Dutch War in 1780, France and the Dutch Republic found themselves allied against the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Dutch expected the British to send an expeditionary force to try and capture their Dutch Cape Colony, and Suffren was given command of a 5-ship squadron to reinforce it. Peynier became the commander of the second wave of reinforcements sent to Suffren in 1782. Although the British captured part of the convoy, Peynier managed to land troops at the Dutch Cape Colony and sailed on to make his junction with Suffren. At the Battle of Cuddalore on 20 June 1783, Peynier was captain of the fleet for the van of the French squadron, with his flag on the 74-gun Fendant. At the Peace of Paris, Suffren was recalled to France, and Thomassin de Peynier kept command of the French fleet in the Indian Ocean until 1786 with the position of squadron leader, which he obtained in 1784. After the American War of Independence, Peynier went to the United States where he was admitted in the Society of the Cincinnati, receiving his diploma from George Washington. In 1786, Peynier returned to France. The following year, he obtained the command of a frigate in Brest. In 1787, in B√©arn, he married Jeanne Timoth√©e Marthe Ang√©lique d'Arros d'Argelos (born 24 January 1761), daughter of Chef d'Escadre Jean-Fran√ßois d'Arros d'Argelos and his wife Mademoiselle de Lahaye (1726‚Äì1791). They had two daughters. = Governor of Saint-Domingue = Saint-Domingue in 1780, view from the mole Saint-Nicolas. (Pierre Ozanne) On 26 July 1789, Peynier was made governor general of the French colony of Saint-Domingue. He arrived there in late August, and remained in office until late 1790. The political situation there was extremely tense, particularly in 1790: the 212 deputies of the Assembly of Saint Mark started displaying more and more overt secessionist tendencies. These deputies, who were all white landowners, went as far as opening the ports of the colonies to foreign trade, which was against the laws of exclusive commerce still in force in the Kingdom of France. These White settlers were also stark supported of slavery. Although not very active, as a representative of the central power, Peynier opposed the Assembly. In the night of 29 to 30 July 1790, he dismissed the deputies. Eighty-five of them left the island aboard the ship Leopard and sailed to France to plead their case with the Constituent Assembly. ‚Äî earning the nickname of \\"Leopards\\". On 2 November 1790, Jean-Paul Marat wrote in the L'Ami du peuple: \\"It is not disputed that the Sieur de Peynier exercised a terrible despotism, that he used violence to disarm the Port-au-Prince National Guard. . [...] He armed against them the negros and the people of colour \\". In France, the events of Saint-Domingue were only partially understood: most political actors did not see the Assembly of Saint-Marc as undemocratic, although it was in fact uninterested in the revolutionary ideals of the Constituent Assembly. In late 1790, White settlers openly accused Governor Peynier and Colonel Mauduit, commander of Port-au-Prince, of protecting men of colour. Tired and sick, Peynier resigned and handed power over to Philippe Fran√ßois Rouxel de Blanchelande, before embarking for France, where he arrived in early 1791. He then had to report to the National Assembly, which approved of his conduct during the entire period of his governorship. = French Revolution = On 7 October 1791, took the civic oath that the National Assembly was demanding, swearing \\"to be faithful to the Nation, to the Law and to the King, and to maintain by all his power the constitution decreed by the National Assembly\\". On 1 January 1792, Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier was promoted to Vice-Admiral. The following spring, he accepted command of the Brest Squadron of the French Navy, but after reconsidering, he eventually declined on the advice of the Minister Bertrand- Molleville. He resigned from all the positions he still held, and retired after a 48-year career in the Royal Navy. He requestion a 4,300-livre pension, which he did not receive. After the fall of the Monarchy and the proclamation of the Republic late in the summer of 1792, Peynier swore before the municipal officer of Orthez, Dutilh, \\"to be faithful to the Nation and to maintain freedom and equality or die by defending it\\". On 1 September 1793, he returned his Grand Cross of Commander in the Order of Saint Louis. Nevertheless, between late 1793 and 1794, his was under house arrest at home in Ch√¢teau Orthez. In his testimony to the Orthez District Revolutionary Committee, in a letter date 31 Pluviose An III (9 February 1795), he stated that this arrest stemmed from \\"oppressive and general measures\\". In December 1794, a month his father died, Peynier moved to Aix where he hopes to restore his health. At this time, losing his sight because of his old head injury. Peynier died on 11 October 1809 in Arance (now Mont, Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques).  Origins and family  Antoine de Thomassin came from the house of Thomassin, a noble family from Burgundy, known from the 15th century and based in Provence.

Temporary Memorial Efforts In an effort to honor the 49 victims and to memorialize the location surrounding the Pulse Nightclub building, the City of Orlando dedicated $4,518 to erect a barrier fence to fulfill this purpose. Following this, the City discussed purchasing the Nightclub for $2.25 million, but the vote was postponed. In the end, Pulse Nightclub owner, Barbara Poma, cited personal and emotional connection to the site as the main reasons as to why she chose not to sell the property. Since this time, Poma and others have been raising funds for victim's families, survivors, a memorial, and community support programs through her nonprofit, the onePULSE Foundation. Design & Construction The onePULSE Foundation released a request for proposals in March of 2019, with proposals being due by January 31st, 2020. Six finalists were selected from the total 68 submissions received, with the final design being chosen from Coldefy & Associes with RDAI. The selection process was completed by a blue-ribbon jury made up of representatives from onePulse, the Orlando community, architect professionals, and others. The decision was made as a collective group, with consideration in mind to the over 2,300 comments that were submitted from the victim‚Äôs families, survivors, and the community with recommendations for memorial concepts. The current design includes several pieces that come together to form a community presence and dedicated reflective, interactive, and connective spaces. The National Pulse Memorial has the focus of serving as a quiet and peaceful garden setting, and is set to include different symbolic features such as 49 trees, 49 color lines, and a reflecting pool surrounding the Pulse building, to honor the 49 victims lost in the events of the Pulse shooting. A separate museum will be located at 438 West Kaley Street, Orlando, FL 32806, and will be erected in a shape representing a growing flower. The museum will serve as an interactive center to learn, gather, and host community programming. In total, the project is set to cost $45 million to complete. Entrance to the memorial and museum will be free year-round, and the two locations are set to open in 2022.

Bessems played first Carom billiards, but later switched to artistic billiards, more commonly associated with trickshots. Bessems made his international breakthrough in 1965 at the European Youth Billiards Championships. In the Cadre 47/2 European Championship 1971 in Nice, he won his first silver medal in the men's competition.

Born in London, Bird performed exceptionally well during her education, and received a master's degree in history at Bedford College, London in 1922, becoming the first of its alumni to earn such a distinction in the subject. From 1923 until her retirement, Bird was a schoolteacher, a profession she excelled at, remembered as a \\"inspirational and enthusiastic\\" teacher. Bird also engaged in some historical scholarship. She composed a history of London guilds during the reign of Richard II and edited the journal of Giles Moore, clergyman of Horsted Keynes; this town was the subject of much of her study after retirement. Bird died in 1987 and was buried in Horsted Keynes. She was memorialised by those who knew her as a \\"devout and faithful\\" Christian and \\"perhaps the greatest [teacher] I ever met\\". Early life and education Bird was born on 26 May 1899 to George Bird (1863‚Äì1912), entrepreneur and engineer, and his wife, Theresa Mary (1867‚Äì1953), at their home on 62 St Quintin Avenue, Kensington, London. On her paternal side, Bird was descended from a well-off, 19th-century merchant background, but, after George Bird's death in 1912, the family found themselves in some financial difficulty. Bird entered the boarding school of Elstree Grange in Eastbourne in 1909, where she performed exceptionally well in exams. Bird left Elstree in 1917 to attend Bedford College, London, where she remained until 1922. She took her BA examinations in 1920, where she was the only historian to receive first-class honours. In May 1921, she was awarded the inaugural grant of the Amy Lady Tate scholarship. This covered her tuition fees and awarded her use of Institute of Historical Research while she studied at Belford, under the supervision of Jeffries Davis and J. W. Allen. She was awarded her master's degree in December 1922, the ninth history master's the college had granted, and its first distinction. Her master's thesis was entitled \\"Civic factions in London and their relation to political parties, 1376‚Äì1399\\" Teaching career In 1923, after leaving Belford, Bird began teaching at Truro High School, Cornwall; in 1926, she left for Wyggeston Grammar School for Girls, Leicester, where she would remain until her retirement in 1959. During her 33 year tenure, she chose to obtain no teaching qualifications and became senior mistress of the school. She was remembered as a remarkable teacher. D. Anne Welch, writing for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, memorialised her as an educator who \\"loved her chosen career, and was an inspirational and enthusiastic classroom teacher\\". Professor Claire Cross, a former pupil and professor emeritus of history at the University of York, described Bird as \\"perhaps the greatest [teacher] I ever met\\". Scholarship Twenty-seven years after its composition, Bird prepared her master's thesis into a book- length publication, having made some revisions at the London School of Economics in 1935‚Äì6. The Turbulent London of Richard II (1949) analysed the convoluted shifting of alliances between the guilds of London during the reign of Richard II ( 1377-99). According to Welch, this publication revealed \\"deep political and personal complexities, which have precluded any subsequent simplistic assessment of the situation\\". The monograph was published with an introduction from prominent English historian James Tait, who had died four years before its publication. After her retirement, Bird mainly studied the local history of Horsted Keynes, Sussex. Bird edited the \\"day books\\" of Giles Moore, clergyman of the parish church of St Giles, for the Sussex Record Society, published under the title: The Journal of Giles Moore, 1656‚Äì1679 (1971). The book was reviewed favourably by A. Tindal Hart, writing for the Journal of Ecclesiastical History, who described that, while ostensively dull in subject matter, in its pages \\"there emerges the vivid portrait of a seventeenth century country rector in relation to his home and family, his parishioners, and the authorities in Church and State\\". Moore's detailed accounts of his personal and household expenditures have come to be recognised as an important source for the history of English provincial clothing during Moore's lifetime. In Leicester, Bird co-wrote the Victoria County History entries on Humberstone and Knighton for the series' 1958 publication on Leicestershire. As of her death, Ruth Bird was co-writing a history of a 17th- century school in Horsted Keynes. Personal life, character, and death Welch memorialised Bird as \\"a small, slight figure, with a short severe hair cut, Ruth Bird possessed great natural authority and a remarkably warm smile. She dressed simply, lived humbly, and owned little.\\" Bird was an Anglican, and a member of the Third Order of Saint Francis, the reason for her frugal lifestyle. Her vicar at Horsted Keynes described her as \\"practising Christian, devout and faithful in her prayer life, in worship and private study\\". According to Welch, Bird was also a keen traveller and \\"emphasized the international perspective to history as a means of furthering peace among nations\\". Bird's health deteriorated in later years, developing a weak chest. On 24 January 1987, She died at Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath aged eighty-seven. She was cremated and her ashes were buried in St Giles churchyard on 31 January 1987. Her will was probated at ¬£126,919 on 15 May 1987.

It deals with the photo books from the series Children's Everywhere by Anna Riwkin-Brick, Astrid Lindgren, Leah Goldberg and Elly Jannes. Where Is Elle Kari and What Happened to Noriko-san? is the first part of a film trilogy. The follow-up films, which also deal with the photo books from the series Children's Everywhere, were filmed in 2016 (Africa! Sia Lives on Kilimanjaro) and 2017 (Where Is Lilibet the Circus Child and What Happened in Honolulu?).  Plot  As a child, director Dvorit Shargal read Anna Rivkin-Brick's books Elle Kari and Noriko-San: girl of Japan. Through these books she learned about the lives of other girls in other distant countries. She identified with the protagonists, wanted to have skis like Elle Kari from the book of the same name, or wear a kimono like Noriko-san. When she opens her former favorite books, Shargal finds a letter written by her to Noriko-san. This was, however, sent back to her with the note: address unknown. Then she decides to start looking for the protagonists from the books. Noriko-san is of particular importance to her. The search for Noriko-san, however, is more difficult than expected, after all, Shargal only has a first name. Therefore, she tries to find Ella Kari first, a girl from the indigenous S√°mi people and the protagonist of the book with the same name. Shargal actually finds an Elle Kari through an internet search. It turns out that this Elle Kari is the daughter of the writer Elly Jannes. She is named after the protagonist of Anna Riwkin-Brick and Elly Janne's book. After interviewing her, Shargal finally meets Elle Kari from the book. Elle Kari tells about her life, shows more photos of Anna Riwkin-Brick and a documentary about her daughter from the 1970s. In addition, Shargal reports how the indigenous S√°mi people developed after the 1950s. To find out more about Anna Riwkin-Brick, Shargal searches the archive of the Swedish National Library in Stockholm. There she learns that Anna Riwkin wrote books along with the Israeli author Leah Goldberg. In Israel she meets the protagonists Anat, Shaul, Daniel and Miriam from the books Eli lives in Israel and Miriam Lives in a Kibbutz of the Children's Everywhere series. Later, she continues to search for her favorite protagonist Noriko-san. She learns that the book was written by Astrid Lindgren. Although she does not find any information about Noriko in the Astrid Lindgren Archive in Stockholm, she comes across a letter from the protagonist of the book Dirk lives in Holland, who is not called Dirk, but Jackie. She meets Jackie. He tells her about the work with Anna Riwkin and Astrid Lindgren. In addition, Jackie takes Shargal to the places where the photos were taken. He tells her about his first bicycle, which he had received from Astrid Lindgren for his birthday and reads a letter that Astrid Lindgren had written to him. In it, Astrid Lindgren recalls her visit to Holland, where she created the book together with Anna Riwkin. When Shargal publicly searches for Noriko-san, she finds Eva, another protagonist from Noriko-san. Together they are lookig Noriko-san. They fly to Japan and visit the places where the photos were taken. They also ask locals about Noriko-san and eventually make adds in newspapers. Through a newspaper article they finally find Noriko-san and meet her.  Overview  Where Is Elle Kari and What Happened to Noriko-san? is the debut film of the director Dvorit Shargal. Originally, Shargal worked as a journalist, but gave up her work to make a documentary about her search for the heroines of her childhood from the Children's Everywhere photobook series. Children's Everywhere deals with the lives of children in different countries, such as Sweden, Japan, Israel etc. The director had a particular interest in finding Noriko-san from the book of the same name. But the search was extremely difficult because she had only a first name. During her search, she came across other protagonists from the same book series and tried to find out more about the life of the photographer of the series, Anna Riwkin-Brick. The documentary has been shot within four years in different countries and continents. Shargal first met Ella Kari in Jokkmokk (Sweden), then she traveled to Israel and Tokyo. Because of the film nine photo books of the series were being reissued in Israel, including: Elle Kari, Noriko-San: girl of Japan, Sia lives on Kilimanjaro, Lilibet, circus child, Dirk lives in Holland, Noy lives in Thailand, Salima lives in Kashmir, Eli lives in Israel and Gennet lives in Ethiopia. Eva Crafoord-Larsen and Noriko Shiraishi, the protagonists from Noriko-San, met each other again within the film. In an interview, they explained that they have become good friends. They had met again after making the film, in Tokyo and Sweden. The film was shown in several international film festivals. In Israel, the film premiered on 3 July 2014 as part of the Children and Youth Film Festival Tel Aviv. As of December 3, 2014, the film was shown nationwide in Israel in the cinema.

Sia Lives on Kilimanjaro = On August 5, 2016, the film Africa! Sia Lives on Kilimanjaro (Hebrew ◊°◊ô◊ê◊î ◊î◊ô◊ú◊ì◊î ◊û◊ê◊§◊®◊ô◊ß◊î) was published. In the film the director Shargal drove again to the Astrid Lindgren archive in Stockholm. She talked to Astrid Lindgren's daughter Karin Nyman to learn more about Anna Riwkin-Brick and her books. However, Karin Nyman could not tell Shargal much anbout her. At a screening of Where Is Elle Kari and What Happened to Noriko-san? a member of the audience said that she had the name and email address from \\"Sia\\" from Sia lives on Kilimanjaro. The e-mail address turned out to be wrong, but Shargal managed to find Sia, who is actually called Erica Malekia, anyhow. Shargal met Erica Malekias family and found out more about their culture and their lives in Tanzania. = Where Is Lilibet the Circus Child and What Happened in Honolulu? = On October 20, 2017, Where Is Lilibet the Circus Child and What Happened in Honolulu? (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ô◊§◊î ◊ú◊ô◊ú◊ë◊° ◊ô◊ú◊ì◊™ ◊î◊ß◊®◊ß◊° ◊ï◊û◊î ◊ß◊®◊î ◊ë◊î◊ï◊†◊ï◊ú◊ï◊ú◊ï?) was released. Once again Shargal tried to find more protagonists of the Children's Everywhere series in the Astrid Lindgren Archieve Stockholm. There she found out that Lilibet from Lilibet, circus child, had performed in a circus called Cirkus Scott. Shargal visited the circus, but the circus director did not know Lilibet. He later promised Shargal to try to find out more about the girl. In the meantime Shargal met Eva Brick, the niece of Anna Riwkin-Brick. She found out more about the family and life of the photographer Anne Riwkin-Brik. She discovered that Anna Riwkin-Brick had flown to Hawaii with her sister Eug√©nie S√∂derberg to create a photo book about the girl Mokihana (Mokihana lives in Hawaii). Immediately Shargal flew to Hawaii to find that girl. At first, her search was unsuccessful, but then she met an elderly gentleman who knew the book and reported that Anna and her sister lived in Hawaii for several months and his son was also photographed for the photo book. The search near Mokihana turned out to be more difficult than expected. But shortly before her departure Shargal managed to meet her. Shargal came from Hawaii directly to Sweden, where she learned the name of Lilibet and her father. In addition, she came in contact with Lilibets half-brother. She learned that Lilibet is actually called Ingrid Heinrich and now lives in Bussum, Holland. Shargal visited her in Holland. Ingrid Heinrich told Shargal about her work with Astrid Lindgren and Anna Riwkin-Brick, as well as her life in the circus.

The building was primarily used as a facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, which established county councils in every county, the Grand Jury Room also became the meeting place for Kildare County Council.

His research focuses on the boundary and links between the atmosphere and space. He is the former project scientist for the Heliospheric Imager instruments on NASA's twin STEREO spacecraft.  Education and research career  Scott attended Brockenhust College, before completing a BSc in Physics with Planetary & Space Physics at Aberystwyth University in 1989. He was awarded a PhD in upper atmosphere and auroral physics at the University of Southampton in 1993. After his PhD, he moved to the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, initially to support the EISCAT ionospheric radar, before taking up a number of research posts, including project scientist for the Heliospheric Imagers on the twin STEREO spacecraft. At the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Scott worked closely with Richard Harrison and Mike Lockwood. In 2010, Scott moved to the University of Reading.  Research highlights  Scott's primary research focus is on the ionosphere, particularly perturbations from below by atmospheric phenomenon. Scott was the first scientist to demonstrate lightning effects on the 'sporadic E' layer; transient, localized patches of relatively high electron density in the mid-ionosphere, which significantly affect radio-wave propagation. He subsequently investigated the relation between lightning occurrence and magnetic structures in the solar wind. Scott has also used novel datasets to study how pressure waves from the lower atmosphere can lead to disturbances in the ionosphere, most notably using records of the London Blitz World War II bombing raids and ionospheric measurements from Slough. Using the Heliospheric Imager instruments on the STEREO spacecraft, Scott made the first observations of a solar eruption tracked continuously from the Sun to the Earth.  Public outreach and citizen science  Scott is actively involved in the public communication and promotion of science. He has made numerous appearances on TV and radio, most notably the BBC‚Äôs Sky at Night, Newsnight, BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme, BBC2's James May's Man Lab, ITN news, and the Discovery Channel. He was science adviser for episode 1 of the BBC series ‚ÄòSeven Wonders of the Solar System‚Äô Scott is the co-founder of the citizen science \\"Solar Stormwatch\\" project, to track solar eruptions in heliospheric imager data.

The museum interprets the story of the Mormon Trail along with the history of a temporary Mormon settlement known as Winter Quarters, which was located in the Florence area between 1846‚Äì1848. The museum is located on a bluff above and to the west of the Winter Quarters settlement site and is directly across the street from the historic Mormon Pioneer Cemetery and the Winter Quarters Nebraska Temple. History =Early Visitors' Center= Prior to the construction of the current center, a small remodeled house had served as a visitors' center for tourists coming to see Florence and the Mormon Pioneer Cemetery. This center was closed on August 1, 1995 in preparation for the construction of the new museum, and trailers served as a temporary center for visitors during the building process. =Current Museum= The new museum, constructed of red brick, has 11,000 square feet of display space and a large lower level. It opened at the end of 1996 with a preview of partially completed exhibits and that year's gingerbread house display. The museum was dedicated by Church President Gordon B. Hinckley on April 18, 1997. The dedication was part of that year's sesquicentennial celebration of Brigham Young's Vanguard Company leaving Winter Quarters, trekking across the United States, and arriving in Mexico's Salt Lake Valley in 1847. In 1998 a life-sized statue of a Mormon handcart family was placed on a round, concrete pedestal in front of the museum. The statue was created by Latter-day Saint sculptor Franz M. Johansen. Exhibits =Christmas Gingerbread Houses= In 1985 an annual Christmas gingerbread house display was established in the old visitors' center. The annual event continued following the construction of the new museum and has become a popular local tradition, with nearly 300 gingerbread houses on display during the 2018 Christmas season (additional gingerbread houses are also put on display at the nearby Kanesville Tabernacle). =Zion in the Wilderness= The museum opened with an exhibit titled \\"Zion in the Wilderness - from Temple City to Temple City.\\" The exhibit contains three phases, the first, titled \\"An American Exodus,\\" interprets the Mormon Exodus from Navuoo, Illinois, along with the story of the Mormon Trail (and its many refugee camps) across Iowa. The second phase, titled \\"At the Bluff,\\" tells the history of Winter Quarters and surrounding settlements, and the final phase \\"Gathering to Zion\\" shares the story of the Mormon Trail from Winter Quarters to the Salt Lake Valley.

Life Bhau Singh was a younger son of Man Singh I, Raja of Amber, born of Rani Sahodra Gaud, daughter of Raimal. He had one full brother named Durjan Singh. Prior to his accession to the throne, Bhau Singh had been posted in Bengal, working alongside the Deputy Subedar of the region. Following the death of his father in 1614, Hindu custom dictated that Maha Singh, the son of Bhau Singh's late elder brother Jagat Singh, inherit the throne. However, the Mughal emperor Jahangir overruled this and instead bestowed the crown of Amber on Bhau Singh. The former, who had a close relationship with the new Raja, justified this decision by declaring that he was \\"the most capable of Man Singh's sons\\". Maha Singh was given the rule of the lands of Garha (present-day Jabalpur) as consolation for his loss. Upon his accession, Jahangir initially raised Bhau Singh's mansab to 3000, then to 4000 the following year, before finally promoting him to a commander of 5000 in March 1617. However, when the Emperor dispatched him to the Deccan to serve in the campaign against Malik Amber, Bhau Singh only served as a subordinate captain, in contrast to the supreme commands previously enjoyed by his father and grandfather. The languid manner and poor management of the campaign, combined with the bafflement of Mughal officers when faced with Malik Amber's guerrilla tactics, prevented Bhau Singh from having any substantial achievements in this role. This inactive and inglorious life appears to have caused a deep melancholy in the Raja, who turned to drinking in response. Following a sojourn to the Mughal royal court, he returned to the Deccan where, in December 1621, he suddenly fainted. His health now debilitated due to alcoholism, Bhau Singh did not regain consciousness and died a day later at the age of 44. Having not had sons, Jahangir appointed as Bhau Singh's successor his great-nephew Jai Singh I, the son of Maha Singh, the latter having died some years earlier under similar circumstances.

First published in 1959 by Journeyman Press it consists of a cycle of 31 short poems that tell the story of a traveling circus. The poem is included in the collections: 33 Poems (1987), Love Had a Compass (1997) and Circus Days and Nights (2000). The poem follows a day in the life of a circus as they arrive in a new town, set up, rehearse, perform and take down the circus. It is arranged according to the phases of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, the midway, and night) which deliberately align with the canonical hours and the title alludes to the song written by Francis of Assisi, \\"Canticle of the Sun.\\" Lax used his own experience traveling with the Cristiani Brothers Circus, where he would sometimes perform as a clown as inspiration for the poem. In writing about the circus Lax is able to write about theological ideas of creation and Christian allegory. Widely considered his best poem it marks the conclusion of the early, lyrical phase of Lax's career before he started writing experimental, minimalist poetry.  Background and origin  Lax first met the Cristiani family when his friend Leonard Robinson was sent to write a piece about the family of acrobats for the \\"Talk of the Town\\" section of The New Yorker. The Cristiani family left a lasting impression on Lax. Several years after meeting them he suggested to The New Yorker that he travel with the Cristiani family and write a \\"Reporter at Large\\" story for the magazine. In 1948 Lax was given a $500 dollar advance for the project and spent the next month traveling with the Cristiani family and their circus. Over the next three years he would work on what would become \\"The Circus of the Sun.\\" In the summer of 1949 after having left the circus, Lax, along with his childhood friend Ad Reinhardt went to live with artist Robert Gibney and writer/editor Nancy Flagg Gibney in Henley Cay. There, Lax worked on writing his account of traveling with the circus. After Henley Cay, Lax returned to his hometown of Olean, NY and set up in the basement of the library at St Bonaventure University and worked on the poem everyday.Spaeth, Paul. 2000. \\"Introduction.\\" Circus Days and Nights. New York: The Overlook Press, p. 13 In 1950 an excerpt of \\"The Circus of the Sun\\" was published in New Story and presented as part of a forthcoming novel. When published 7 years later by Journeyman Press, the excerpt published in New Story was included, now as a poem known as \\"The sunset city...\\" Another excerpt, this time containing nearly a third of the completed poem and titled \\"The Circus\\", was published in New World Writing #13 in 1958. After completing the poem Lax struggled to find a publisher. Eventually, Emil Antonucci, an artist who had made illustrations \\"The Circus of the Sun\\" offered to use the money he received from a Guggenheim grant to found Journeyman Press and publish the poem. This began a life long collaboration between Lax and Antonucci.  Themes and tone  The poem relies on several Biblical allusions to develop what Michael McGregor called an \\"analogy between circus and Creation.\\" Paul Spaeth identifies the opening of \\"The Circus of the Sun\\" as a \\"reworking of the Genesis account of creation.\\" While James Uebbing sees the same lines as an improvisation \\"on the prologue of St. John's Gospel\\" before calling the overall tone of the poem reticent and distinctive. Strengthening the connection between the Bible and the circus, Thomas Merton wrote that the circus was, \\"symbol and sacrament, cosmos and church.\\" In her assessment of \\"The Circus of the Sun\\" in the Encyclopedia of Catholic Literature Jeannine Mizingou writes that Lax uses the circus as a \\"microcosm of the universe\\" that \\"manifests variety and difference and yet a constant unity and community.\\" McGregor supports this view of the poem when he writes, \\"the Cristianis remained his vision of how to live in the world as individuals and as a community.\\" The theme of individuals and community is reinforced through the structure of the poem itself, where the poems are individual, various, and different while also unified as a whole. As Denise Levertov wrote in her 1961 review in The Nation the poem is, \\"not a collection of entirely separate poems but a unified book of variations on a theme.\\" Another central theme identified by Mizingou is grace, writing that in the poem the circus is a place where, \\"grace enables human beings to relate to others without dominance and without violence.\\" Mizingou's reading builds off of the way Thomas Merton saw the poem demonstrating, \\"the importance of human love.\\"  Critical reception  Shortly after \\"The Circus of the Sun\\" was published, ee cummings, having also written poems about the circus, invited Lax over to his house to drink tea and talk about the circus. Despite the stated admiration of cummings and many other poets, \\"The Circus of the Sun\\" was not widely reviewed, a fact lamented by Thomas McDonnell in a review of the poem published in Commonweal. In the review McDonnell goes on to call the poem a \\"praise of creation\\" and sees in it Gabriel Marcel's \\"concept of man's nuptial bond with being.\\" When the poem was reviewed it generally received high praise. Denise Levertov writing for The Nation called the poem \\"dreamlike and vivid\\" before drawing favorable comparisons to Gerard Manley Hopkins. In a review for Stars and Stripes William Claire said the poem evoked \\"the wonder and beauty of motion and people and ideas and faith....\\"Claire, William. \\"Letter to Robert Lax.\\" 4 April 1960. Robert Lax Papers, Columbia University. Thomas Merton called the poem \\"one very fine book\\" in a letter to Lax. In a critical assessment of Lax's poetry, critic and poet R.C. Kenedy wrote of \\"The sunset city...\\" section, \\"[it] must be one of the greatest poems in the English language\\" and called its rhythm \\"the most blood-curdling... yet devised by poet.\\" In his introduction to the collection Circus Days and Nights Paul Spaeth quotes another appreciation penned by Kenedy referring to \\"The Circus of the Sun\\" as one of \\"the finest volume of poems published by an English-speaking poet of the generation which comes in the wake of T.S. Eliot.\\"Spaeth, Paul. 2000. \\"Introduction.\\" Circus Days and Nights. New York: The Overlook Press, p. 21.

The line operates every 15 minutes during the weekday rush hour/peak period commuter times and every 30 minutes at all other times on weekdays. On Saturdays and Sundays, the line operates every 25‚Äì35 minutes. T18 trips roughly take 50 minutes. Background Route T18 also operates alongside route T14 but under different line names and routes. Route T18 also runs a direct route while route T14 runs primarily thru neighborhoods. Route T18 operates weekly between New Carrollton station and Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station providing service along Annapolis Road Line and connecting passengers between Prince Georges County and Northeast. Route T18 also runs a limited stop segment between Mount Rainier terminal and Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood station alongside routes G9 and T14 only stopping along five stops. Local service is provided by routes 83, and 86. Route T18 currently operates out of Landover division. History Route T18 was created as a brand new Metrobus Route by WMATA on December 3, 1978 to operate between New Carrollton station and Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station shortly after New Carrollton station opened on November 20, 1978. Route T18 was designed to replace the segment of routes T14, T16, and T17 routing between Annapolis Road in New Carrollton and the Rhode Island Avenue Metro Station, via Capital Plaza Mall, since routes T14, T16, and T17 were truncated to terminate at New Carrollton. Route T18 would operate along Ellin Road, Harkins Road, and Annapolis Road, then divert off Annapolis Road after passing the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway and Capital Plaza, and make a loop along 57th Avenue, 58th Avenue, Emerson Street, and then 57th Avenue to serve Bladensburg High School, as well as the adjacent apartment complexes. Then the route returns onto Annapolis Road remaining straight on Annapolis Road and Bladensburg Road, then turn onto the intersection of 38th Avenue and 38th Street, another left turn at the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue and remain straight on Rhode Island Avenue before reaching the intersection of Washington Place NE and ultimately making a left turn onto that street to enter Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station. Route T18 would then turn back and operate on the same routing (except in the exact opposite direction), back towards New Carrollton station. =Limited Stop Segment= Beginning on December 14, 2014, route T18 began a newly limited stop segment along Rhode Island Avenue between Mount Rainier terminal and Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood station along with route T14. The limited stop segment was to reduce bus bunching along Rhode Island Avenue and improve on time performance for route T14, and T18. Buses would only serve the following stops: * Rhode Island Ave & 12th St NE * Rhode Island Ave & Montana Ave NE (eastbound)/14th St NE (westbound) * Rhode Island Ave & 18th St NE * Rhode Island Ave & South Dakota Ave NE (eastbound)/24th St NE (westbound) * Rhode Island Ave & Newton St NE Passengers wishing for local service will have to use routes 83 or 86.

There she received the Anne Molson Gold Medal for excellence, awarded to the best student in physics, mathematics, and physical science at McGill. In 1923, McPherson received a M.Sc. from McGill, under the supervision of Arthur Eve.

Born in 1858 in Vienna, Lang was raised in a liberal, upper-middle-class home. After divorcing her first husband in 1884, she married Edmund Lang and the two hosted an influential salon for politicians and intellectuals. Joining the women's movement toward the end of the 1880s, she quickly became an influential women's rights activist. In 1893, along with Auguste Fickert and Rosa Mayreder, she founded the Allgemeiner √ñsterreichischer Frauenverein (General Austrian Women's Association). In spite of provisions in Section 30 of the law governing associations, which prohibited women's political involvement, the three friends used their networks of influential politicians and intellectuals to press for legal changes in laws governing women and children's civil rights and in favor of women's suffrage. In 1898, she co-founded the women's journal Dokumente der Frauen (Women's Documents), serving as its editor-in-chief until 1902. In 1902, Lang attended the International Abolitionist Federation's conference in London and visited the Passmore Edwards Settlement, becoming an advocate of social welfare programs. When she returned to Austria, she gave lectures for the Frauenverein on the settlement movement and organized the , serving on its board until 1909. In 1901, she founded the Ottakring Settlement House, which served as a place for women to receive social services. Joining the Committee on Woman Suffrage in 1905, she worked actively to change Section 30 and gain women's voting rights. During World War I she worked in a war hospital, performing Swedish massage therapy. Her husband died in 1918 and after two years she retired from work with the Settlement Society to devote time to her family. She is remembered as one of the leading figures in the turn-of-the- century women's movement of Austria. The Settlement Society she founded remained in operation until 2003 and pioneered many social services in Austria, such as adult education, child and maternity care, summer camp programs, and tuberculosis treatment. Early life Marie and Theodor K√∂chert, circa 1880‚Äì1884 Marie Katharina Auguste Friederike Wisgrill was born on 8 March 1858 in Vienna, capital of the Austrian Empire, to Emilie (n√©e Scholz) and Karl Wisgrill (also known as Carl Matthias Wissgrill). Her family were part of the small Viennese liberal upper-middle class. Her mother was an actress and the niece of the comedian Wenzel Scholz. Her father was a master carpenter; a proponent of civil liberty, he had supported the Revolutions of 1848. Wisgrill was educated at home by a teacher from the local gymnasium. In 1880 or 1881 Wisgrill married the court jeweler Theodor K√∂chert. They had one son, Erich, before separating in 1884. As required by legal conventions of the time, she lost custody of her son by K√∂chert when they divorced, but mother and son would remain close. During the marriage, she met Edmund Lang, a Jewish lawyer, who was Theodor's brother-in-law, through Heinrich K√∂chert's marriage to Melanie Lang. In 1885 Wisgrill and Edmund had a son, Heinz, and married soon after. Upon their marriage, Edmund converted to Protestantism. In 1886, the Langs had a second son, Erwin, who would become a painter in later life and marry the dancer Grete Wiesenthal. Career The Langs were heavily involved in the salon culture of Vienna, and hosted gatherings of artists and politicians in their home almost every evening. They also summered with a colony of friends in Grinzing at the Schlo√ü Belle Vue, known as the place where Sigmund Freud experienced his dream, Irma's injection. The couple also created a theosophical study group with Frederick Eckstein and Franz Hartmann. In 1888, they met Rudolf Steiner, a philosopher, and introduced him to theosophical literature, as well as to Lang's friend Rosa Mayreder. The women would both become influential in Steiner's development and he and Mayreder would continue a correspondence for many years. Steiner commented that Lang was the soul of the circle, and that it was her personality and interest in theosophy that encouraged the participation of group members with widely differing views. Her hospitality extended to the composer Hugo Wolf, for whom she cared in her home for many weeks during his illness. At the end of the 1880s, Lang was introduced to the women's movement by her friends, Auguste Fickert and Mayreder. She quickly became one of the most prominent women's rights activists of her era. In 1891, Lang's daughter Lilith was born, for whom Mayreder would serve as godmother. In 1893, the Allgemeiner √ñsterreichischer Frauenverein (General Austrian Women's Association) was formed by Lang, Fickert, and Mayreder, as one of the radical organizations in the Viennese women's movement. More similar to organizations developed for workers than middle- and upper-class women's groups, which focused on charity, the Frauenverein supported working class rights to employment, education and legal protection for the poor, and the abolition of laws regulating prostitution. In spite of Section 30 of the Vereinsgesetz (the law which sepcified public rules for private associations), which prohibited women from political participation, Fickert, who led the organization, specifically aimed to influence politics. Using their personal networks and ties with politicians, Fickert, Lang, and Mayreder pressed for changes in the laws on prostitution, for abolition of laws requiring women teachers' celibacy, and encouraging support for women's suffrage. Lang also advocated for legislation to safeguard unwed mothers and their illegitimate children. The Frauenverein became \\"one of the most influential women's organizations in fin-de-si√®cle Vienna, changing the face of politics and society for women\\". Dokumente der Frauen, 1901 Lang was a supporter of the artists known as the Vienna Secessionists, led by Gustav Klimt. Modernist artists and feminists were typically supported by educated intelligentsia, and though they were not allowed to participate in Secession meetings, feminists saw the links with the artistic movement, as they too contested outmoded values. Lang compared the works of architects like Adolf Loos and Joseph Maria Olbrich; musicians like Gustav Mahler; painters such as Klimt; and set designers like Alfred Roller as expressions of freedom to feminists' rejection of patriarchy. In 1898, along with Fickert and Mayreder, Lang co-founded Dokumente der Frauen (Women's Documents), as the press organ of the Frauenverein to echo the artistic revolution of the Secessionists. The journal provided a cultural and political forum in which women could express their views on the need for societal change. Lang served as the editor-in-chief, soliciting other writers, while Fickert and Mayreder wrote articles for the journal. In 1899, Fickert and Lang fell out and both she and Mayreder left the publication. Lang continued to publish Dokumente der Frauen until 1902 when funds were no longer available to keep it in production. She also served on the press commission of the (Federation of Austrian Women's Organizations). In 1898, Lang was selected as the Frauenvereins delegate at the conference of the International Abolitionist Federation to be held in London. Else Federn asked Lang to study the settlement movement while she was in England. Lang visited the Passmore Edwards Settlement and was impressed with the way the organization was working to solve social problems. By providing self-help training and childcare facilities, which were unheard of at the time, settlement houses provided social services which are now commonplace. When she returned to Austria, she lectured on the settlement movement under the auspices of the Frauenverein. The following year, she began to organize the establishment of the . Between 1901 and 1909, she served as the vice president of the Settlement Society, under its president, Karl Renner. The first project of the Settlement Society was a school kitchen they operated in Brigittenau, though they were unable to locate a suitable building for housing. In 1901, Lang founded the Ottakring Settlement House to provide help to working women. She chose Ottakring because it was one of the most populous areas of Vienna and there was a need for alternative housing to the unsanitary tenements in which most workers lived. She hired Secessionist designers Josef Hoffmann, Koloman Moser, and Roller to remodel an old brewery. Federn served as the matron of the facility but was unable to establish communal residential housing as in England. Instead, the Oattkring House served as the first gathering place for social services in Austria which were not funded by charity. Without ties to political or religious affiliations, for a small fee workers could benefit from health care for pregnant women and for children, a nursery for childcare for working mothers, mixed-gender education, classes on cooking, and social evenings with musical performances or lectures. 1913 Women's Suffrage demonstration in Ottakring Lang was appointed to serve on the press committee of the International Council of Women in 1903 and in 1904, attended the Berlin Congress, from which the International Woman Suffrage Alliance was formed. That year, Lang's son Heinz committed suicide after a failed love affair with , wife of Adolf. Arthur Schnitzler wrote a play, (The Word) based on the tragic events, which led to Heinz's death. His death had a profound effect on Lang and for a time she lessened her involvement in the women's movement, believing that as she had failed as a mother to protect her own son, she had no right to counsel other women. Heinz fathered a son, Karl Friedrich \\"Peter\\" (1904‚Äì1947), who was posthumously born to Ida Oberndorfer. Lang took the child in and raised him. In 1905, the Committee on Woman Suffrage () was founded. They presented petitions to both houses of Parliament that same year and in 1907 submitted a petition with 4,000 signatures to abolish the law banning women's political organizations. Lang represented the Committee as Austria's delegate to the 1908 International Woman Suffrage Alliance 4th congress held in Amsterdam and gave a report on their activities. During World War I, Lang worked in the military hospital set up in the Akademisches Gymnasium, performing Swedish massage therapy. She also conducted numerous private consultations to assist women in finding help and support. Edmund died on 6 April 1918, and later that year, on 12 November, women gained the franchise in Austria. For two years Lang continued to be active working at the Oattkring House and then retired to devote her time to her family. Death and legacy Lang died on 14 October 1934 in Altm√ºnster, where she was living on Lake Traunsee with her oldest son Erich K√∂chert. She is remembered as one of the leading figures in the turn-of-the-century women's movement of Austria. The Vienna Settlement Society, which she founded, pioneered adult education, child and maternity care, summer camp programs, and tuberculosis treatment in Austria and operated until 2003, though many of its original programs became government services. In 2012, Marie-Lang-Weg (Marie Lang Way) was dedicated to her in Blaustein, Germany, and in 2016 a street bearing the same name in the Floridsdorf district of Vienna, near the (Leopoldau Gas Works), was named in her honor. Lang's daughter, Lilith married Emil von F√∂rster, son of the architect . The couple's sons Heinz von Foerster became a noted a physicist in the United States and was a musician who introduced jazz to Austria. Lilith left her family papers, which are protected by the Federal Monuments Office, to the Wiener Privatbesitz (Viennese Private Collection).

He has been described by Dimitris Pikionis as \\"the van Gogh of Greece\\" because he was an exceptional post-Impressionist, and one of the forerunners of Post-Impressionism in Greece.  Life  He was born on 29 August 1874 in Athens, where he spent his childhood. In September 1891 he went to Paris for the first time to study at Lycee Janson-de-Sailly, preparing for the French Naval School and pursuing a military career. His guardian during that time was Dimitrios Vikelas. However, in June 1893 he failed the Naval School exams and in October of the same year he enrolled at the Sorbonne Law School. In the summer of 1896 he was in Munich to study law at the University of Ludwig-Maximilans, while at the same time he became friend with the painter Dimitrios Geraniotis, who studied at the Munich Academy. In November 1897, Nikos Dragoumis obtained his degree from the University of Sorbonne and returned to Greece to pursue a career in the Foreign Ministry. However, he broke up with his family and his father, Stephanos, sent him to Volos to work as an assistant manager of the Thessaly Railway Company. But Nikos Dragoumis secretly left Volos in May 1899 and returned to Paris this time to study painting. Nikos Dragoumis, Marika Dragoumis, Sister of the Painter, 1909, ink and gouache on paper, private collection He was enrolled in the Julian Free Academy in October 1900 and studied there until December 1902 in the workshop of William Bouguereau (1825-1905). At the same time, in the years 1900, 1901, 1902 he was enrolled in the entrance examinations of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts but seems to have failed in all three of his attempts. During these years he befriended Dimitris Galanis, who portrayed Dragoumis in one of his first works in Paris, the painting by Trovadouros (1900, today at the National Gallery and the Museum of Alexandros Soutsos). In June 1903 Dragoumis went to the village of Graveson for the first time in Provence, where he spent a long period of his life painting. In August 1904 he visited Greece and his family in Kifissia. It is noteworthy that Nikos was the last member of the Dragoumis family to see Pavlos Melas alive: he stayed with him on the night of August 29 and accompanied him the next morning to the train station, from where Melas left for his last trip to Macedonia. Dragoumis returned to Paris in June 1905, although he remained in Graveson. In 1908 he began his relationship with the Russian painter Lydia Borzek. He was again found in Greece from October 1909 until July 1910 before returning to Paris. In October 1911, while in Graveson, his mental illness developed. On 2 November he left Marseille for Piraeus. Accompanied by his brother Ion, a few days later, he entered a private clinic for the mentally ill in Naples, Italy. Dragoumis did not stay in Naples for a long time. Shortly afterwards the family moved him to Corfu and in the summer of 1913 he and Borzek visited Andros. In August 1913 he settled in Kifissia, but in May of the following year, accompanied by Ion Dragoumis, he traveled to the village of Sent, near Geneva, and entered a private psychiatric clinic. He stayed there for 18 years until 1932, when his family brought him back to Greece due to financial difficulties. He entered the Dromokaitio Institute in Chaidari in August, where he died a few months later, on 6 January 1933, possibly from a stroke. \\"Marika Dragoumi\\", the artist's sister, 1909, indian ink and gouache on paper, private collection  Works  \\"Cha√Æne des Alpilles, Saint-R√©my-de-Provence\\", gouache on paper, private collection \\"Lydia in Kokkinaras\\", 1913, pencil and gouache on paper, private collection The first time that Nikos Dragoumi's works were presented to the public was after his death, in 1936, at the 6th Exhibition of the Avignon Group of Independent Painters (March 20-30, at the Town Hall), under the responsibility of the painter and his friend Jean Baltus. In Greece, the first reference to the painter Dragoumi was made by Dimitris Pikionis in 1963 in an article in the Zigos magazine: \\"I had met him in the spring of 1911 in Paris, in the Luxembourg gardens. Breton costume, cap and wooden footwear. [‚Ä¶] He gave me a sketch of his sister combing her hair. The next day he would start early in the morning to go to Provence, hiking under the fiery rays of Apollo, to show the vintage, this Greek Van Gogh!\\" Essentially, the Greek public first came into contact with Dragoumis' paintings through an exhibition organized by the National Bank Education Foundation in 2015 (May 7-July 18). In an unpublished text, his brother, Philippos Dragoumis, remarked: \\"Nikos never wanted to sell any of the paintings because he believed that true art was sacred and non- marketable. [...] He was a follower of the principle of L'art pour l'art (= Art for art), that art is simply an expression of the artist's mental aesthetic world and nothing more. \\" Since Dragoumis himself burned several of his paintings in 1911, with the onset of his mental illness, today the family archive preserves basically lightweight designs (pencil, charcoal, watercolors) on paper. These reveal his intentions and aspirations, his stylistic influences and the spirit in which his artistic creation was shaped. Dragoumis, who did not systematically study painting, was nurtured as a painter in Paris at the beginning of the 20th century, at a time when Impressionism and post-Impressionist movements dominated French art, while in the Salons of the avant-garde the cubists were presented for the first time. Dragoumis was rather indifferent to Modernism and the experiments of Matisse, Braque and Picasso, focusing his attention essentially on the Nabian circle and more broadly on Symbolism. He was also greatly influenced by Van Gogh's painting, both thematically and stylistically, and secondarily by Gauguin and the Pont Aven School (Provence). He was interested in depicting the (French and, to a lesser extent, Greek) countryside [cf. the project: Cha√Æne des Alpilles, Saint-R√©my-de-Provence], the relationship between the human form and the landscape (especially the woman in the landscape), but also the lives of the people of labor (farmers, workers). In his work, of course, one does not identify the social concerns that characterized Courbet, but rather the symbolic extensions that distinguish Gauguin, Van Gogh and Les Nabis. Similar observations can also be made at the level of style: Dragoumis is not part of Impressionism but rather of post-Impressionist quests. His works are not shaken by the strong light, but are characterized by hard outlines, love of the line, tough forms [cf. the work: Marika Dragoumi, sister of the painter]. Finally, some exposures to expressionism should also be understood as loans by Van Gogh. On the other hand, Dragoumis stayed away from the problems faced by Greek visual artists in the early 20th century. It is noteworthy that even the few works he created in Greece exude a clear French aura [cf. the work: Lydia in Kokkinaras] with the possible exception of his plans from Andros (summer 1913).

The northern edge of Kinder Scout, a high moorland landscape in the Peak District which became the first English national park in 1951. Clark advised on its purchase, citing an essential link with people in northern cities. Abergwesyn Common became a National Trust property in 1984. Work goes on to conserve peatlands there. A view from the South Downs facing Clayton Hill. The South Downs and adjoining areas became a national park in 2009 after 4 decades of Clark's support. Leonard Joseph John Clark (19 August 1916 ‚Äì 11 September 2019) was an English countryside campaigner and civil servant. He was the last surviving member of the committee that led to the National Parks and Countryside Act in England and Wales being passed in 1949. Biography He was born in 1916 in Islington, London to Edie (n√©e Symonds) and Joseph Clark. His mother was a seamstress and his father a shop assistant. He went to Highbury Grammar School on a scholarship. An article in the News of the World encouraged his teenage interest in hiking, which he did initially in the Chiltern Hills and in Surrey. He passed the London County Council exam and began a career in local government for the Council and then the National Health Service (from which he retired in 1977 as senior administrator of the London Ambulance Service). He joined the Youth Hostel Association (YHA) in 1937. During World War II he was assigned to a non-combat role, having been refused registration as a conscientious objector; he was posted to Hereford and the Welsh capital, Cardiff, where he began a youth hostel club. He hiked in Wales and the Marches. He met a like-minded partner, Isobel Hoggan, through the YHA. On their first date, the couple watched the passage of the National Parks and Countryside Act in Parliament in 1949, on which Clarke had worked. They married in 1952 and lived in Guildford and later near Godalming. Hoggan was a committed feminist; both became active Quakers and vegetarians. Clark's passion was for the countryside. He joined the YHA executive committee in 1948; he was national treasurer and then chairman till 1963. He worked for the general public to gain access to land e.g. working for the National Trust (on the properties and executive committees for 23 years) as their YHA representative (from 1961), the Campaign for National Parks and the Open Spaces Society, the latter from 1978 as commons liaison officer and he was vice-president at the time of his death. He toured widely on his scooter to view potential acquisitions for the National Trust. He supported and argued for the Trust's founders' emphasis on protecting the landscape, rather than ownership of buildings thereon. In 1967, his tact and diplomacy avoided a schism at the Trust and he was on the committee which drove through a change to a more inclusive organisation. Through his influence, the moorland plateau of Kinder Scout in Derbyshire and the archaeological and environmental resources of the Abergwesyn Commons in Wales (which would have been planted with forest) were purchased by the Trust. After a 40-year effort, his campaign for the South Downs to become a national park was successful. He was the chair of the YHA and the National Trust's southern regional committee, voluntary director of the Samaritans in Guildford (active for three decades after his retirement), a member of the Department for Transport's advisory committee and a member of the Campaign for State Education. From 1983 to 1986, he was secretary of the Common Land Forum whose recommendations were passed to the Government. For his 100th birthday, the National Trust planted trees in his honour at its site at Polesden Lacey, Surrey. He was awarded their founders medal and was appointed a CBE for his conservation work. His wife, Isobel, died in 2016. Clark's memoirs were published in 2018. He died in 2019, aged 103; he is survived by his sons ‚Äì Alistair, Stuart, and Neil ‚Äì and his grandchildren.

It contains a single species, Thiosocius teredinicola, which was isolated from the gills of the shipworm. The specific name derives from the Latin terms teredo (shipworm) and incola (dweller). Ecology The host K. polythalamius can be found in the Philippines. Its habitat is woody organic-rich marine sediment. The giant shipworm has a symbiotic relationship with T. teredinicola which in exchange for housing can oxidize inorganic sulfur compounds to generate energy that is used to fix inorganic carbon and nitrogen into food for the shipworm host.Marvin A. Altamia, J. Reuben Shipway, Gisela P. Concepcion, Margo G. Haygood, and Daniel L. Distel. (2019). Thiosocius teredinicola gen. nov., sp. nov., a sulfur- oxidizing chemolithoautotrophic endosymbiont cultivated from the gills of the giant shipworm, Kuphus polythalamius. Int J Syst Evol Microbiol; 69:638‚Äì644.  Sampling / Culture  T. teredinicola strains were isolated from the gills of two giant shipworms specimen (K. polythalamius) then grown on liquid medium culture. These strains were able to grow chemolithoautotrophically and heterotrophically. During chemolithoautotrophic growth, the cells used hydrogen sulfide, thiosulfate, tetrathionate or elemental sulfur as the energy source and bicarbonate as the carbon source. The cells showed diazotrophic capabilities during chemolithoautotrophic growth without a source of nitrogen. The cells also grew heterotrophically with organic acids such as acetate, propionate, pyruvate, malate, succinate, fumarate, glycerol, ethanol, D-fructose, glutamine, and glutamate. Cell growth was observed at 30‚ÑÉ - 37 ‚ÑÉ (Optimum at 34 ‚ÑÉ), pH range of 5.5 - 8.5 (Optimum: 8.5) and salinity range of 0.0-0.7 (Optimum: 0.2). T. teredinicola was the first pure culture of a thioautotrophic animal symbiont.  Phenotypic Characteristics  The cells are gram-negative, and rod shaped with an average length of 1.7 ¬µm and width of 0.5 ¬µm. The cells are motile via single polar flagellum. The cells have carboxysomes and sulfur globules which turn carbon dioxide into sugar and store sulfur, respectively.  Genetic Characteristics  All T. teredinicola strain cultures that were isolated showed nearly identical 16S rRNA gene sequences (>99.8%). The 16S rRNA strain places T. teredinicola with other uncultivated Gammaproteobacteria from marine sediments. The full genome for T. teredinicola strain 2141T was sequenced showing 4,790, 451 bp. The full genome was analyzed showing variety of capabilities that were present in culture. The genes that give the capability to oxidze a variety of reduced sulfur and fix carbon dioxide autotrophically (RuBisCO) was present. The niùëì gene that gives the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen was present. The complete TCA cycle and glyoxylate bypass pathway that is required for heterotrophic growth was present.

The regimental headquarters, 1st and 3rd Battalions were then transferred to Tawi-Tawi Island where an Allied landing was expected. The 2nd Battalion subsequently arrived at Labuan, and was ordered to march across the interior of Borneo rejoin the rest of the regiment due to a shortage of shipping; it eventually reached Sandakan. In February 1945 all elements of the 25th IMR on Tawi-Tawi Island other than the 9th Company of the 3rd Battalion were withdrawn to Tawao on the mainland of Borneo due to the difficulty of supplying the island. Soon after arriving on the mainland, the 25th IMR was ordered to march across Borneo to the Brunei Bay area with the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade. This required the soldiers to march on tracks for hundreds of kilometres through mountainous jungle with inadequate food supplies. The 2nd Battalion arrived at Jesselton in February, and all other elements of the regiment arrived there in May. The 25th IMR was assigned responsibility for defending the coastal area between Beaufort and Tuaran. Elements of the 25th IMR saw combat during the Battle of the Visayas and Battle of North Borneo in April and July 1945 respectively. At this time the regiment was one of the main elements of the Thirty-Seventh Army, along with the 56th and 71st Independent Mixed Brigades. The 9th Company resisted the 2nd Battalion of the US Army 163rd Infantry Regiment's landings on small islands off Tawi-Tawi between 2 and 6 April before withdrawing in small boats to the mainland of Borneo. Around 30 Japanese were killed in this fighting, and two Americans were killed and four wounded. After reaching Sandakan, the company began an overland march to re-join the remainder of the regiment, and was at Ranau at the end of the war. The only part of the main body of the 25th IMR's sector to be attacked was Papar. The regiment did not resist the Australian 2/32nd Battalion's occupation of Papar on 12 July, with Australian official historian Gavin Long writing that its only defenders were \\"two Japanese with a machine-gun who made off as the Australians approached\\". At the end of the war the 25th IMR had a strength of over 900 personnel.

Creation The Forces of the Democratic Alternative alliance was created in a meeting in Algiers on 26 June 2019 during the 2019 Algerian protests, among several political parties and prominent individuals. On 27 August, the FDA was forced by Algerian authorities to cancel a meeting it had planned for 28 August. The authorities did not explain why the meeting was forbidden. A formal convention between the participants was signed at a national meeting soon after, on 9 September 2019. Members As of its 9 September 2019 meeting, the FDA included the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD), the Workers' Party (PT), the Socialist Workers Party (PST), the Union for Change and Progress (UPC), the Democratic and Social Movement (MDS), the Party for Secularism and Democracy (PLD) and the (LADDH). Aims The FDA aims to organise a constituent assembly for a new political system in Algeria with an independent judiciary and a transitionary period to democracy. It opposes the 12 December presidential election. Its call for a boycott was joined by other groups, including the Party of Liberty and Justice led by Mohamed Sa√Ød and by the Justice and Development Front (FJD) led by Abdallah Djaballah. The Dynamiques de la soci√©t√© civile, a coalition of trade unions, citizens' groups and individuals created on 15 June 2019 during Hirak, stated that it would cooperate with the FDA and similar alliances. Actions In early January 2020, the FDA proposed a \\"national democracy meeting\\" ) on 25 January 2020 for all those wishing for a \\"democratic alternative\\". The meeting would aim to debate mechanisms and the nature of the political transition and of the procedures of a constituent assembly. The meeting was held on 25 January as planned, apart from a change of venue because the signed agreement to use the Safex hall was \\"tacitly\\" cancelled by the authorities the day before the meeting, with 400 participants from diverse political parties and citizens' associations. The participants agreed on what they saw as the illegitimacy of the 12 December 2019 presidential election and the new president's method of proposing modifications to the Algerian constitution. The organisers promised to hold another meeting to decide on the mechanisms of a \\"democratic, autonomous\\" institutional transition, during which \\"illegitimate institutions\\" would be dissolved, and to plan the procedures of organising a sovereign constituent assembly.

Among his roles at the National Trust for Historic Preservation he has been the founding director of the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund, with the goal of raising $25,000,000 to protect and preserve African American history via material culture and beyond. He has played a role in reframing the idea of historic preservation, expanding its scope and its approach, including ways of using preservation activities to encourage and develop community resilience and sustainability. Leggs' work is guided, he says, by the idea that preservation is \\"about economic development\\" and \\"the empowerment of people as much as it's about the history.\\"  Education  Leggs studied marketing at the University of Kentucky as an undergraduate, and earned his MBA there. He became the first African American to complete the University of Kentucky's graduate program in historic preservation (part of its School of Architecture); his graduate studies were supported by the National Trust through its Mildred Colodny diversity scholarships. He remains one of a very small number of African Americans working in his field, although he has played a role in \\"credentialling\\" others.  Professional achievements  The field work component of Leggs' career began with an inventory of Rosenwald schools in Kentucky during which he learned that his own parents had been students at Rosenwald schools. This experience convinced him \\"of the power that physical places have in shaping cultural memory.\\" His early practical preservation work includes being project manager for places designated by the National Trust as National Treasures, including Joe Frazier‚Äôs Gym in Philadelphia; Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson, New Jersey; and Villa Lewaro, Madam C. J. Walker's estate in Irvington, New York. Using his business school training Leggs has developed the Northeast African American Historic Places Outreach Program, guided by \\"its theme, the Business of Preservation,\\" with the goal of setting up \\"a regional movement of preservation leaders\\" to preserve African American landmarks. Leggs has become an advocate and an advisor to \\"city leaders, property owners, and stakeholders\\" at local and national levels on how to leverage business as well as cultural advantages from the preservation of historical sites as cultural assets. Many of these sites have been associated with the State of Alabama, especially the city of Birmingham, and the Civil Rights Movement there, as well as America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. He has also helped preserve Nina Simone's birthplace in Tryon, North Carolina, and John and Alice Coltrane‚Äôs home in Huntington, New York. The restoration of Simone's birthplace illustrates the sort of cooperation with locals Leggs advocates to find ongoing uses once an historical site has been preserved. It also illustrates his commitment particularly to the involvement of African American women in both jazz and civil rights activities. As part of his work with the National Trust Leggs has played a large role in getting numerous African American sites recognized as historically significant. = African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund =  Contribution to national discussion of monuments, racism, and preservation of history  In the 21st century a national discussion of the role of monuments in preserving and perpetuating a racist view of the United States' history turned into sometimes violent attacks on historical monuments glorifying Confederate soldiers and politicians. In 2017 protests and counterprotests at Charlottesville, Virginia, led to the death of Heather Heyer. National outrage made this an exceptional event that remains a reference point in various aspects of US culture, including historical preservation. Following this event, in 2018 Leggs wrote in Essence about the history of saving sites significant to African American history and the multifaceted importance of doing so. He credited the National Association of Colored Women, led by Mary B. Talbert, for \\"inaugurating the Black preservation movement\\" by preserving Frederick Douglass' home in Washington a century earlier. Pointing out that the National Trust for Historic Preservation was \\"chartered by Congress in 1949 to help tell the full American story,\\" Leggs concluded that \\"when the past is blanched and distorted through lack of diversity and representation, it affects both our understanding of today‚Äôs issues and our capacity to grow in the future.\\" In this context, the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund came into existence \\"to move the narrative beyond confederate heritage and ensure the preservation of national treasures integral to the full African American story.\\" Leggs sees the Fund's activities as playing a role in \\"reconstructing\\" America's national identity. \\"The largest-ever campaign to preserve African-American historic sites,\\" in its first year it \\"received more than eight hundred applications requesting nearly ninety-one million dollars in grants.\\" Set up as a multi- year effort with funding from public and private sources, it does not receive federal support since \\"the federal government stopped allocating funds to the National Trust in 1997.\\" Leggs has been responsible for much of the Fund's financial support, persuading both wealthy individuals and mainstream nonprofits such as the JPB Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to contribute.  Side effects  Side effects of the Fund's activities include training young people in the skills needed for preservation work and developing research on the role of preservation of historical sites for community resilience. The Fund uses these results as leverage to persuade policy makers and community leaders to recognize the value of preservation work. Understanding \\"the economics of historic preservation\\" to be both profitable as well as costly, Leggs and the Action Fund help communities wanting to save historic space find \\"adaptive reuses\\" for such spaces that often challenge traditional notions of what historical preservation is about. \\"Along with elevating forgotten places,\\" Leggs has written, the Fund aims \\"to reveal the hidden, and sometimes willfully obscured, layers of history at all historic sites.\\" This has involved retroactively adding information to existing recognized historical sites that might previously have ignored significant African American history associated with them, especially where the history of slavery in the United States is concerned. The foundation for this retroactive move might be seen nearly two decades earlier, when Representative Jesse Jackson, Jr., added language to an appropriations bill \\"encouraging\\" the National Park Service, as part of its US heritage tourism activities, to \\"acknowledge\\" the role of institutionalized slavery \\"in all of their public displays and multimedia educational presentations.\\" While he may be \\"typically contacted to help preserve something\\" that may have deteriorated badly, in 2013 Leggs got involved with ongoing attempts to save Shockoe Bottom in Richmond, VA, a place where much of the archaeological remains had been destroyed. The Fund accepts as a principle that historical sites may remain important to cultural memory even in such cases, perhaps especially so in the case of African American history.  Funded sites  The appearance of the award-winning film Green Book in 2018 drew attention to The Negro Motorist Green Book. Sites listed there are part of the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund's future plans and its current call for financial support. Awards are announced annually. In 2019 new sites receiving support included Langston Hughes‚Äò house in Harlem, NYC; The Harriet Tubman Home in Auburn, NY; Satchel Paige's home in Kansas City, Missouri; the Emmett Till Memorial Commission in Sumner, Mississippi; The Forum in Chicago‚Äôs Bronzeville neighborhood; the African Meeting House in Boston, MA; and the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina.  Academic accomplishments and honors  Leggs' faculty positions include \\"Clinical Assistant Professor\\" at the University of Maryland's School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, and adjunct status at the Boston Architectural College. He has also taught at Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania. He has co-authored Preserving African American Historic Places (2012), which the Smithsonian Institute called the ‚Äúseminal publication on preserving African American historic sites.‚Äù It \\"provides tools for protecting ... important landmarks in African American history.\\" He has also contributed to Preservation and Social Inclusion (2020). He has made numerous public appearances, including on C-Span, where he appeared four times between 2016-2019. In 2012 he was named a Loeb Fellow, an honor given to those with, among other characteristics, \\"a passionate commitment to revitalizing communities.\\" In 2018 he received the Robert G. Stanton National Preservation Award.

It was commissioned by William Harvey Ross, who had been president of the Gunnison Sugar Company, an entity financially rescued by William Wrigley Jr., the big chewing gum manufacturer. It was designed by architects Walter E. Ware, Alberto O. Treganza, and Georgius Y. Cannon. According to its National Register nomination, \\"Ross Hame is a three- story Tudor Revival villa covered with heavy, roughcast stucco.

The stucco finish is interspersed by false half timbering on the stair tower rising from the house‚Äôs front or west-facing fa√ßade and on a dormer rising from the house‚Äôs back or south-facing roof. This half-timbering together with the house‚Äôs flared rooflines, leaded glass windows, and parklike setting grant Ross Hame a storybook English cottage feel.\\" \\"Ross Hame‚Äôs exterior features roughcast stucco interposed in places by false half-timbering on the Tudor Revival-style house. The house‚Äôs interior maintains its original asymmetrical cross-wing floorplan which was designed to take full advantage of the house‚Äôs location on a rise above Spring Creek which flows through Ross Hame‚Äôs grounds. These grounds include many circa 1922 landscape elements including waterfalls, benches, bridges, lawns, and a tennis court, which is considered a contributing structure. The grounds also feature a contributing caretaker‚Äôs cottage which is located directly behind, or east of the main house. The two- story cottage, originally built to serve as a stable and carriage house, features a roughcast plaster exterior and a double pile interior.

The northwest side of the cottage was remodeled to be a large garage and storage area while its southeast end was transformed into a residence complete with a living/dining room and adjoining kitchen on the first floor, and two bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor. The cottage is in good repair, retains its historic integrity, and is a contributing property feature. Behind, or east of this cottage stands a large, three-bay, lean-to garage with wooden plank sides and a corrugated metal roof.

After the fall of Belgium to Nazi Germany, Marguerite published in the press, \\"La Deliverance\\". It was a resistance movement for resistance members to rise during the occupation and would transfer intelligence to the Allied Powers.Suzanne van Rokeghem, Jacqueline Aubenas, Jeanne Vercheval-Vervoort, Des femmes dans l'histoire en Belgique, depuis 1830, Luc Pire √©ditions, 2006, 303 p.

They were both carrying a shopping bag and a camera, once they reached the edge of the airfield they began to take pictures. A few minutes later a German sentry caught them by surprise and escorted them both to an officer nearby. They both showed their shopping bags and claimed that they were going to a nearby farm to get some food and take pictures of the fields. Unfortunately the German lieutenant ordered an investigation. A woman, a prosecution witness, provided evidence that led to the indictment of Marguerite Bervoets and the leaders of the group to which she belonged. At Marguerite's house they discovered weapons. She sensed her fate, and in high school she would often quote Maeterlinck, saying; \\"It is beautiful to when one sacrifices oneself, that sacrifice brings happiness to other men\\". After a few months of incarceration in Mons, Marguerite and Detournay were deported to Germany for their fates to be decided by the Volksgericht of Leer. Marguerite was sentenced to death and Detournay to 8 years forced labour.

It was released on June 1, 2012, by H2 Media and distributed by Kakao M. After releasing its debut single \\"Message\\" the previous October, the group focused on developing its musical style in the ensuing months. Following a series of photo and video teasers, Myname 1st Single and its lead single \\"Hello & Goodbye\\" were concurrently released. Myname 1st Single peaked at number seven on South Korea's national Gaon Album Chart, shifting over 9,000 units domestically since its release. Background and music structure Myname 1st Single was crafted to demonstrate Myname's diverse musical capacity and its ability to undertake various genres. Speaking of the record, vocalist Gunwoo stated, \\"It's still too early to tell what our colors are. But there are several opportunities for Myname to find its colors.\\" The group pursued its artistic development over promotional ventures, leading to an eight-month gap between the release of its debut single \\"Message\\" and its first single album. The opening track \\"Say My Name (Intro)\\", which incorporates a heartbeat and exudes a \\"dreamlike\\" ambience, conveys \\"beautiful yet melancholy feelings\\" which characterize the record. It is followed by \\"Hello & Goodbye\\", a medium- tempo R&B; song. It consists of a \\"groovy\\" melody, \\"heavy\\" bass, and \\"deep, somber\\" vocals. In the lyrics, the narrator requests for his girlfriend to \\"meet and break up if you love me\\". He simultaneously suffers between a \\"new beginning\\" and the \\"final goodbye\\". The song was made along with \\"Message\\", but was stored for a future release. \\"Hello & Goodbye\\" underwent various rearrangements prior to its release. \\"Girlfriend\\" displays a \\"standout\\" vocal delivery and \\"Replay\\" is a ballad track. Vocalist Insoo explained that the latter describes replaying \\"old memories\\" and \\"holding onto emotions\\" after a breakup.

In 1968 the book was published at Rab√©n & Sj√∂gren.  Plot  Matti lives on a farm in Finland. He has one friend named Merja. Merja has a nice grandfather, who Matti also likes to visit. In addition, Merja owns a dog named Kari, which Matti loves. Matti would also like to have his own animal, but he does not get it. One day when Merja falls into the sea and threatens to drown, Matti is able to save her. The two promise each other not to tell anybody about this. Some time later, Matti's father comes to the farm with a small calf, which he gives to Matti. From then on, Matti takes care of the calf every day and visits it constantly. However, one day, Merja's grandfather buys the calf from Matti's father. He wants to slaughter the calf for his birthday dinner. Matti is heartbroken, but Merja's grandfather does not make compromises, and when Matti's father wants to buy the calf, he refuses. Merja sees how desperate and sad Matti is and decides to talk to her grandfather. She asks how much she is worth to him. Her grandfather says she is worth all the money in the world. Then she says that her grandfather should give the calf to Matti, because Matti had saved her and she would no longer exist without Matti. This is the moment when the grandfather realizes how important the calf is to Matti and gives it to him. After this everyone celebrates grandfather's birthday.  Overview  Matti Lives in Finland was first published in 1968. It was released as Matti bor i Finland by the Swedish publisher Rab√©n & Sj√∂gren. It is the thirteenth of a total of 15 children's books from the Children's Everywhere series. It is the last book by Anna Riwkin-Brick and Astrid Lindgren. Now, the book is out of print and can only be purchased second-hand. The book has been translated into many other languages, such as German, English and Hebrew. In Israel, the series Children's Everywhere, which also includes Matti Lives in Finland, was a great success. The latter was also based on the translations of the poet Leah Goldberg.  Development history  The book differs from the other Astrid Lingren works in the series. It was not Riwkin-Brick who first made the photos for the book, and Astrid Lindgren who wrote the text after it, but the other way around. Lindgren wrote to Riwkin- Brick that the book should become a sort of Bullerb√º photobook. It should be about a seven to eight-year-old, sweet, Finnish farm boy. It should show his everyday life while working on the farm and while playing.Bettina K√ºmmerling- Meibauer: Lost in nostalgia. Images of childhood in photobooks for children. In: Elisabeth Wesseling: Reinventing Childhood Nostalgia: Books, Toys, and Contemporary Media Culture. Studies in Childhood, 1700 to the Present, Routledge, 2017, Lindgren also wrote a manuscript describing which photos Rivkin should make of Matti. He was supposed to feed the pig, to pick up berries and so on. In the first version of Lindgren's story, Matti saves another boy's life. As he moves away, the boy gives his dog to Matti. Matti is not accepted by the dog as his new owner, which makes Matti very sad. Matti's mother explains that he should be patient. After Matti has dealt with other things throughout the day, the dog has become accustomed to the new environment. He accepts Matti as his new owner. In the last picture there should be a happy Matti, who jumps around with the dog. Lindgren wrote in close collaboration with Rivkin several versions of the story, which Riwkin oriented to with her photos. Lindgren changed her text in connection with the photos again and again, until the last and current book version was created.  Reception  Kirkus Reviews praises the wonderfully fresh landscapes. In addition, the story has a sweet innocence that is rare today. Readingastrid says the book, unlike many of the other books of the Children's Everywhere series, is amazingly up to date. The book focuses on a fight that almost all children are exposed to: wanting to have a pet. The idea that someone would just buy this animal and eat it, creates an exciting atmosphere for children even today, which encourages them to continue reading. Moreover, the children are able to empathize with the feelings of the main character, such as his anger.

Early years Horlick was born in Konotop, Ukraine, according to his sworn naturalization and draft registrations,U.S., World War II Draft Registration Cards, 1942 while other sources list Kyiv or Cherinkow, \\"a little hamlet just outside of Moscow, Russia\\". His brother's lack of financial success as concertmaster of the Imperial Opera Company of Tiflis caused their father to oppose another son's being a professional musician. Undeterred, Horlick built a violin when was six years old and played during his father's absences. Eventually the brothers persuaded their father to let Horlick have formal training in music. He went on to graduate from a conservatory in Tiflis.  Military service and melodies  During two years' service in the Russian army, Horlick's violin went unused; then he was captured by Bolshevik forces. They had him play first in a symphony orchestra and later in an opera company's orchestra. At some point he escaped and returned to Tiflis, then continued to Constantinople. That city contained refugees from various parts of Europe. As Horlick heard musicians from diverse backgrounds play in Constantinople's cafes, he collected tunes that he later featured during his American career. On January 20, 1922, Horlick arrived in the United States to reunite with his parents, who had moved before the war began. The change was made possible with the help of the American Consul in Constantinople, who also enabled several of Horlick's musically inclined compatriots to accompany him. Horlick's interest in music with European roots continued. He went to France and Italy, where he spent time in exchanges with gypsy groups, hearing and learning their native music and, in turn, performing for them. Horlick later fashioned much of that music into scores for his orchestra's performances. People who desired to buy copies of most of those pieces were unable to do so because the works had not been published. Some of the compositions were never transcribed on paper; Horlick taught them to the orchestra members, who played them without benefit of printed music. As Horlick's career progressed, he incorporated music from South America. A 1928 vacation in Brazil and Argentina exposed him to native music from those countries, and he arranged exchanges whereby composers in South America each week sent him music that he introduced to audiences in the United States. Career Horlick played violin in a symphony orchestra in Moscow before military service intervened. After he came to the United States, his career took a turn toward more popular music. A radio official heard a string ensemble that Horlick led at the Petrouschka club in New York, leading to the group's gaining a contract to perform on the air. In 1923, Horlick and the A & P Gypsies began broadcasting on WEAF radio in New York. The group also recorded on the Brunswick label. In the Gypsies' early years, Horlick usually led the group by playing his violin, rather than using a baton. A newspaper article described his technique as follows: > He stands in front of them, the fiddle under his chin, the bow moving > rhythmically across the strings. But his eyes move; they flash, they are > soft; there is fire in their black depths. The musicians watch his eyes, for > they are the cue to the music. As the orchestra grew larger, Horlick increasingly focused his efforts on directing, but he still occasionally played his violin with the group. After the Gypsies disbanded, Horlick formed the Harry Horlick Orchestra, which recorded on the Decca label, and he led the Decca Salon Orchestra, which also recorded on Decca. Horlick also recorded radio programs NBC's Thesaurus music service and for the World Broadcasting System. By April 1940, The syndicated service offered 56 episodes of Harry Horlick Presents, featuring his orchestra and the Imperial Male Chorus.

Described by No Clean Singing's Austin Weber, \\"Abyssal Gods, is overall a thoroughly vicious act of blasphemy packed with more memorable moments than many bands accumulate in a lifetime of albums\\". Commenting on the band's effort to date as a whole, Weber stated \\"Imperial Triumphant are not only one of the most important U.S. black metal acts currently active, truly carving their own stylistic path, but they are also important to the future of black metal.\\" Following the second album, in March 2016 Imperial Triumphant released Inceste.

Family at Deep Well; image from the Resonians Automobile Tour Collection (Library & Archives NT)  Early life  Johannsen was born in Denmark on 14 November 1876 and, in 1899, he left to emigrate to Australia: working his passage as a crew member. He had originally planned to emigrate to South Africa but the Boer War prevented this. When he arrived in South Australia he went to the Barossa Valley where he met an married Marie Ottilie (Tilly) Hoffmann in 1905. In 1909 Johannsen responded the a call for help from the Hermannsburg Mission and the family, which now included a three year old daughter Elsa Margaret Johannsen (born 21 June 1906), travelled by horse and buggy to Central Australia.  Life in the Northern Territory  In Hermannsburg Johannsen erected buildings, stockyards and performed general repairs. He was often assisted by and taught Aboriginal men building skills. In 1911 the family left the mission and moved to Deep Well Station; where Gertrude (Trudy) Ottilie Johannsen (28 August 1912) and then Kurt Gerhardt Johannsen (11 January 1915) were born. Johannsen sometime left the running of Deep Well to contractors and took building contracts elsewhere, this included sinking wells, building the police buildings at Alice Well and Arltunga (alongside Bill Liddle) and working on the Stuart Town Gaol. Johannsen also served as a guide to Walter Baldwin Spencer and Leonard Keith Ward during their 1923 visit and, once again hosted Ward and Vilhjalmur Stefansson. Stefansson wanted to compare the arid desert of Central Australia with the Arctic. Following the sudden death of Carl Strehlow in 1922 Johannsen returned to Hermannsburg to work as the station manager before again returning to Deep Well in 1924 . While here Johannsen started a tanning industry and encouraged gardening again. Mona Dora Johannsen (27 October 1923) was born at the Mission. Central Australia was in the midst of a severe drought and, Johannsen was experiencing poor health and had contracted polio myelitis, so after seeking treatment in Adelaide (where he had to say for 7 months) the family gave up their lease and moved to Alice Springs in 1928. Johannsen's trip to Adelaide was enabled by Sam Irvine, a mail contractor, who made up a canopy bed for him on his truck and looked after him until they were met at the Oodnadatta railhead by Australian Inland Mission sisters who assisted him on the train. However, in these year two additional children were born; Randle Werner Johannsen (10 August 1925) and Myrtle Edna Johannsen (22 November 1926). In Alice Springs Johannsen built a family house on Todd Street; what is now the site of the National Australia Bank (this was commandeered by the army for nursing sisters' quarters during World War II) . Shortly after this Johannsen pioneered the first mail truck to Arltunga, held the government contract for sanitary and garbage services (with his son Kurt), was involved in gold mining at Winnecke and mica mining in the Stranways Ranges; where the family lived during the war. Following the end of the war the family returned to Alice Springs and Johannsen retired from active bush work; a severe accident at Winnecke strongly contributed to his decision to retire.  Later life  In later life Johannsen was an active member of the Alice Springs Progress Association. Johannsen died suddenly on 4 April 1951 when he collapsed at the Pioneer Theatre and his funeral was one of the biggest seen in Alice Springs for many years.

Dick Durbin (D-IL) in the United States Senate on October 16, 2019. The bill seeks to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to end the immigrant visa backlog.  Introduction  The Immigration Act of 1990 established five occupational categories (in the Immigration and Nationalities Act of 1965 only two existed). It provided 140,000 immigrant visas (green cards) annually for employment-based immigration and mandated that foreign nationals of no country shall receive more than 7% of the available visas in each category in any given year, with the exception of excess unused visas. However, this is not the case for the H-1B visa system. As such, Indian nationals that for years have received the majority of H-1B visas, despite receiving about 20% of the annual Employment-based green cards have to wait decades before receiving one. A similar situation holds for immigrants applying for family-based green cards where millions of people, mostly from the Philippines, Mexico, India, and China, have to wait years before receiving a green card. The fundamental cause of the green card backlog is that annual demand for green cards is much higher than ones available annually and not, as some may assume, the per-country caps. It is estimated that currently there are 4.7 million people waiting in the green card backlog, 3.9 million of whom are waiting for a family-based green card and the rest waiting for an employment-based green card.  Provisions  The bill would, after a five-year transition period, remove the per-country caps for employment-based green cards and increase the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7% to 15%, while increasing the number of total available green cards. Specifically, this bill would do the following. * Over a five-year transition period, it would phase out the per- country numerical limits on employment-based green cards and increase the per- country limits on family-sponsored green cards from 7% to 15%. * It would create a pool of new green cards almost equal to the entire number of people in the employment- and family-based backlogs, and would distribute those in a course of five years. * It would uncap the family-sponsored second preference F-2A category for new spouses and minor children of existing legal permanent residents in the United States, which has a cap of about 88,000 and backlog of about 150,000. * It would increases the number of green cards for the family- sponsored first preference category from 23,400 to 111,334, essentially reassigning the 88,000 from the F-2A category. * It would exempt derivatives (spouses and minor children) of primary applicants from numerical limits. * It would protect ‚Äúaging out‚Äù children who qualify for legal permanent resident status based on a parent‚Äôs immigration petition.  Viewpoint of Third Parties  The bill has received the backing of several organizations, including American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA); immigration advocacy groups such as Support Alliance of US Immigrants, United We Dream, United Chinese Americans; and professional organizations such as Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and National Association of Graduate-Professional Students (NAGPS). They note that, unlike other legislation such as the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, this bill is a win-win since it both makes the immigration system more fair by eliminating or raising the per- country caps, and eliminates the backlog by increasing the number of available green cards. They argue that since immigrants impacted by this policy already have jobs here, no American jobs would be affected. Furthermore, by eliminating the backlog it would allow the United States to retain the international talent that studies in its institutes of higher education. On the other hand, the bill has received pushback from anti-immigration groups such as U.S. Tech Workers who argue that the bill does not address problems of the H-1B program and will further contribute to the displacement of American workers.

Plot Kuroki, a reporter for the trade paper Tekko Shinpo, is investigating the arms manufacturer Mihara Industries on suspicion of the illegal trafficking of weapons from Japan to countries in Southeast Asia. He notices some foreign visitors leaving the company and discovers that they are purportedly visiting in order to attend an exhibit sponsored by Toyo Arts Society, which is led by Takayama Hiroshi. Kuroki confronts Takayama about the unsolved murder of Yamaguchi Natsuko on an Allied Forces army base where they both served during the Korean War. He had traced the murder back to special ops but was threatened to drop the investigation and was fired from Maicho Newspaper. Takayama admits that Natsuko worked for the Japanese-Russian League and was killed and made out to be a prostitute for refusing to gather information for the allies but continues to warn Kuroki to drop the story. Kuroki takes the story to Maicho Newspaper but they refuse to print a story critical of the intelligence department, just like before. Kuroki bumps into his old friend Hiromi, who is now married to Sam, an African-American soldier who was injured in the Korean War. She works at Mihara Industries and is able to confirm that they are trafficking arms, though she does not know who the customer is. Takayama is involved in an affair with Marin, the wife of Sudan, the leader to whom he is selling arms to aid him in crushing revolutionaries in his country. She is also secretly providing the leader of the revolutionaries with information so that they can stop the deal. Hiromi is abducted and a fake Dear John letter is sent to Sam. Kuroki blackmails Marin with a photo of her meeting with revolutionaries and she allows him to follow her to a mental hospital where he finds Hiromi caged in a cell, but he is then beaten and thrown into a different cell. Takayama suspects Marin of working with Kuroki and intends to interrogate him to discover if Marin has been working with him so Marin sneaks a gun to Kuroki through the bars of his cell. Kuroki uses it to escape and notifies the Tekko Shinpo that the arms are being loaded onto the ship that day. The revolutionaries end up attacking a decoy truck based on Marin's false information while the weapons from the other trucks are successfully shipped out aboard the ship. Kuroki has Hiromi released from the mental hospital but she is seriously traumatized from the experience and Sam shouts at the staff in despair. Kuroki confronts Marin and Takayama and threatens to publish the story, but Takayama explains that there is more to the story. The revolutionaries arrive and Takayama sells them information about where the weapons will be unloaded upon arrival in their country. The revolutionaries board the ship and find evidence that the weapons were shipped from Japan but the Japanese authorities deny it and Allied Forces officials attempt to stop the story as well as Takayama. Takayama overhears Marin calling the Allied Forces and telling his location in exchange for the ability to flee to America to avoid retaliation by the revolutionaries, so in retaliation Takayama calls the revolutionaries and gives them Marin's location. Marin flees the hotel where they were hiding but is stabbed to death on the street in broad daylight. Takayama calls Kuroki and tells him to meet him one last time at Landfill 4 for the full story about the arms deal, but is shot and run over by Allied Forces members before Kuroki can reach him. The newspapers run cover stories suggesting yakuza wars as the cause. Kuroki complains to Natsuko's sister that nothing has changed in ten years, but she encourages him not to let himself be defeated.

Reception and analysis In an interview with Chris D. in the book Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film, Fukasaku explained that The Proud Challenge \\"was meant as an expos√© of the CIA's plot to crush the Communist and socialist left in Japan.\\" A reviewer for the website Noir Encyclopedia wrote that the film \\"packs a tremendous amount of plot into its relatively modest running time, and as a result never really has the time to be dull\\", further noting that \\"Hoshijima‚Äôs cinematography is full of slants and shadows.\\" Reviewer Patrick McCoy of the website Lost In Translation wrote that The Proud Challenge \\"grabs the viewer's attention immediately\\" and concluded that \\"the film is a suspenseful thriller that offers a critique of political corruption, hypocrisy, and journalistic cowardice in postwar Japan.\\" In the article \\"The Secret History of Japanese Cinema: The Yakuza movies\\", author Federico Varese wrote that the film \\"had a clear political message: a reporter uncovers evidence that a Japanese company is exporting weapons to Southeast Asia with the complicity of the CIA. The final scene suggests that the entire fabric of Japanese democracy is controlled by American interests aimed at crushing the socialist left (Toei's conservative managers seriously objected to the wider implication of the movie and put Fukasaku on probation for six months).\\" References External links * Category:1962 films Category:1962 crime films Category:1960s crime action films Category:English-language films Category:Films about arms trafficking Category:Films about journalists Category:Films about veterans Category:Films set in Tokyo Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese black-and-white films Category:Japanese crime action films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Toei Company films ","title":"The Proud Challenge"},{"id":"62232027","text":"The Edward and Irene Hobbs House, at 487 E.

The district was originally known as Hushan's Mills Township, one of five civil townships established in 1863, at the height of the Civil War; it was subsequently given the patriotic name of Union Township.United States Census Bureau, U.S. Decennial Census, Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870‚Äì2010. In 1872, West Virginia's townships were converted into magisterial districts.\\"Division of the County into Districts\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County, West Virginia, H.H. Hardesty & Co., New York, Toledo, and Chicago (1883). When Jackson County was redistricted in the 1990s, the area of Union District was included in the new Western Magisterial District. However, the county's historic magisterial districts continue to exist in the form of tax districts, serving all of their former administrative functions except for the election of county officials.W. Va. Code ¬ß 11‚Äì3‚Äì1A. Geography Union District is located in the westernmost portion of Jackson County. To the north, it is bounded by the Ohio River; to the northeast, by Ravenswood District; to the southeast, by Ripley District; and to the southwest by Cologne District in Mason County. Across the river to the north are Letart and Lebanon townships, in Meigs County, Ohio.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia‚ÄìOhio, Ravenswood Quadrangle (eds. Oct. 1908, 1960, rev. 1987).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Ripley Quadrangle (eds. 1907, 1928).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Cottageville Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1989).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia‚ÄìOhio, Mount Alto Quadrangle (ed. 1994). Although much of Union District is hilly, it also includes the most extensive and fertile bottomland in the county, both along the Ohio River, and along the lower course of Mill Creek. In the nineteenth century, Warth's Bottom in Union District was regarded as some of the finest agricultural land along the entire length of the Ohio.\\"Union District\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. The district once included Towhead Island, an island in the Ohio River at the northern end of the district, opposite the mouth of Oldtown Creek in Meigs County. Towhead Island was about a thousand feet long in 1908, but it is now submerged. =Streams= The main streams of Union District are Mill Creek and Little Mill Creek, both of which empty into the Ohio below Ripley Landing. The only other streams are Spring Creek, in the northern part of the district, which joins the Ohio about a mile above Ripley Landing; Cedar Run, the lower course of which forms the boundary with Ravenswood District; the upper waters of the Crooked Fork of Sandy Creek, which flow northward into Ravenswood District; and Toms Run, a small creek that flows into the Ohio a little less than a mile above the boundary with Mason County. Stedman Run and Pole Run are tributaries of Cedar Run that lie entirely within Ravenswood District. Mill Creek, sometimes called \\"Big\\" Mill Creek, to distinguish it from its neighbor, Little Mill Creek, as well as a tributary of the same name, is the largest and most extensive stream in Jackson County. Its upper waters extend eastward across Ripley and Washington Districts, and into the western portions of Roane County, and some of the tributaries along its lower course extend into Mason County. The main branch of the creek enters Union District from the east, about four miles below the town of Ripley, and flows northwest through the district, passing the villages of Angerona, Cottageville, and Ripley Landing. Here Mill Creek turns west after exiting the hills, before entering the Ohio River at Millwood. Within Union District, Mill Creek is met by Loglick Run, coming from the north about two miles below Angerona; then Cow Run, flowing from the southwest; both the right and left forks of Cow Run extend into Cologne District in Mason County. Bar Run enters Mill Creek from the west about a mile above Cottageville. At Cottageville, Mill Creek is joined by Falls Run, coming from the east; Sugar Run is a tributary of Falls Run. As it leaves the hills above Ripley Landing, Mill Creek is met by Lick Run, which drains much of the center portion of the district, coming from the northeast. The creek then flows northwest toward the Ohio, making a sharp bend to the southeast just shy of the river bank, then turns southwest toward Millwood, where it joins the Ohio just above the mouth of Little Mill Creek. Little Mill Creek‚Äîwhich must be distinguished from another Little Mill Creek, a tributary of Big Mill Creek, in Ripley and Washington Districts‚Äîdrains the western portion of Union District. Its upper course flows out of a deep valley northwest of Baden in Mason County, turning eastward just before it enters Jackson County; its main tributary, the Right Fork, also known as Huff Run, is in the eastern portion of Cologne District, due north of Baden. Little Mill Creek flows east through the hills above Millwood, then turns north, entering the Ohio at Millwood, just below the mouth of Big Mill Creek. =Communities= There are no incorporated towns in Union District, but there are several unincorporated communities, of which the largest are Cottageville, Flatwoods, Millwood, and Ripley Landing. Cottageville, Millwood, and Ripley Landing all lie along the course of Mill Creek, as does the village of Angerona; Flatwoods is in the eastern part of the district, on the upper waters of the Crooked Fork of Sandy Creek. Other communities in Union District include Mount Alto, in the hills in the western part of the district; Evergreen Hills, in the hills west of Cottageville; Estar, on the Ohio River bottom just above Ripley Landing; Hills Crossing, along the Ohio River at the northern end of the district; and Pleasant View, on the Ohio about half a mile below the boundary with Ravenswood District. Former villages of Union District include Huntsville, on the right fork of Cow Run; School House, on the Ohio River half a mile below Millwood; and Willow Grove, on the Ohio River, about three miles above Ripley Landing. =Roads and transportation= The main highways in Union District are West Virginia Route 2, West Virginia Route 62, and West Virginia Route 331. Route 2 runs through the district on its way from Point Pleasant to Ravenswood, passing through Mount Alto, Millwood, and Ripley Landing. Route 62 follows the course of Mill Creek between Ripley Landing and Ripley, passing through Cottageville; at Ripley Landing, it joins Route 2, and travels westward through Millwood to Mount Alto, where it turns westward and follows the course of the Ohio River through the northern part of Mason County, until it also reaches Point Pleasant. Route 331 runs from the junction of Routes 2 and 62 at Mount Alto, westward to Cottageville, where it rejoins Route 62. A railroad runs along the Ohio River through Union District, on its way between Huntington and Parkersburg. Formerly part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the line is now part of CSX. There are no bridges over the Ohio in Union District; but until the twentieth century there were ferries at Millwood and Willow Grove. History The first European settlers in Jackson County were probably William Hannaman and Benjamin Cox, who came to what is now Union District in May of 1796. James McDade built a cabin nearby around the same time, but he was an \\"Indian scout\\", and did not settle permanently on his land for several years. The Treaty of Greenville had been signed in December of 1795, ceding Indian claims to the Ohio Valley and much of the land beyond to the United States. The signing of the treaty was the event that convinced many pioneers to begin moving westward, although occasional Indian incursions east of the Ohio continued for a few years. About 1797, two hunters from Belleville, by the names of Coleman and Savney, were shot by Indians while camped at the present site of Cottageville. Coleman was killed, but Savney, though wounded, managed to escape. The first settler child born in the district was a son of William Hannaman, in 1797. The district's first grist mill was a hand-powered mill established by a man named Hushan in 1799. The next settlers to arrive in Union District were Joseph Parsons, Cornelius King, and John Douglas in 1800; they were followed by many more in the first decade of the nineteenth century. In 1802, Benjamin Wright built a horse-powered grist mill at the site of Cottageville. His son-in-law, John Brown, established the county's first sawmill nearby in 1803. The same year saw the organization of a Methodist congregation, led by a preacher named Noah, at the house of Joseph Parsons. The first settlers on Little Mill Creek were Joseph Hall and Isaac Hide, who came to the area in 1806; the first road in the district was laid out by Jackson Smith between the Ohio River and the current site of Ripley. 1806 saw a log schoolhouse built in Union District; the following year, Andrew Hoschar took up residence as schoolmaster, leading a class of fifteen pupils. Until the establishment of Jackson County in 1831, all of Union District lay within the boundaries of Mason County. Soon after the new county's formation, the United States Post Office Department began appointing postmasters for the area. Union District's first post office was established in 1834, at \\"Wright's Mills\\", now Cottageville, with David Woodruff as postmaster.United States Post Office Department, Record of Appointment of Postmasters, 1832‚Äì1971, NARA Microfilm Publication M841, Virginia, Fluvanna‚ÄìJefferson Counties, p. 95. On July 31, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature passed an act requiring the division of the counties into civil townships. Section five of the bill appointed George L. Kennedy, John Johnson, Robert R. Riley, Abraham Slaughter, and George Click to establish Jackson County's townships. Union, originally called \\"Hushan's Mills\\", was one of the five original townships of Jackson County. The original purpose of the townships was to provide for local government, as well as local control over revenue and the newly-created system of free public schools. However, the rural nature of the state proved an impediment to participation in township government, and revenues fell far below expectations. In 1872, the townships were converted into magisterial districts, serving various administrative purposes, but having no governmental function.Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, West Virginia: A History, 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240. The names and boundaries of Jackson County's magisterial districts remained relatively unchanged until the 1990s, when the county was redistricted in order to equalize the area and population of its magisterial districts as nearly as possible. All of Union District, the western portion of Ripley District, and part of southwestern Ravenswood District were included in the new Western Magisterial District. However, redistricting in a number of counties created confusion with land and tax records, so the legislature provided for the establishment of tax districts, following the lines of the historic magisterial districts, and serving all administrative functions other than the apportionment of county officials. As a result, Union District remains an administrative unit of Jackson County, although it is no longer one of the magisterial districts. Like the rest of Jackson County, Union District was heavily forested when the first settlers arrived, and began clearing land for agriculture. Beginning in the latter part of the nineteenth century, the county was heavily logged to produce lumber, barrel staves, and railroad ties.\\"Geographical and Physical\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. Hardesty's reports that by 1883, the timber along the bottomlands of the Ohio River and Mill Creek was nearly exhausted, but in the hills there remained \\"considerable quantities of the various kinds of oak, pine, poplar, and hickory\\".

The march opposes Prime Minister Imran Khan, demanding his resignation, and new elections. No women were part of the protests. The protest involved tens of thousands of protesters. Background Islamists had accused the government of Imran Khan of Zionism, Qadianiat and authoritarianism ever since he delved into politics. These allegations would increase when Imran Khan's ex-wife Reham Khan herself claimed that he was a Zionist puppet. Later on further controversies would corroborate their allegations including accusations of 2018 general elections, appointment of Ahmadi economist Atif Mian as an advisor in the EAC on 1 September 2018, the alleged visit to Pakistan by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 25 October 2019 and later acquitting of Asia Bibi who was convicted of Blasphemy, the arresting of Khadim Hussain Rizvi and other TLP leaders on 23 November 2018, arresting of members of the other two main opposition parties Maryam Nawaz(August 2019) and Asif Ali Zardari(June 2019) and accusations of bribing Members of the Parliament which were raised during a No confidence motion against Senate Chairperson Sadiq Sanjrani and Deputy Chairperson Saleem Mandviwalla in August 2019 when 64 parliamentarians of 53 parliamentarians required raised their hands yet 50 parliamentarians voted in the secret ballot. The country had also underwent a Debt crisis and Inflation in 2019 during his regime. In June 2019 the party had announced that it would hold a great march towards the capital. On 4 October 2019 Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman announced that the Azadi March would commence on 27 October 2019 in order to force the Prime Minister to resign, it was to reach Islamabad by 31 October 2019, Fazl had said that the march will commence from karachi. On 11 October 2019 Maulana Fazl ur Rehman had an important meeting with Saudi Ambassador to Pakistan Nawaf bin Said al maliki regarding the political situation of the country and persuaded him to call of the Azadi March. The two major Pakistani opposition parties, PPP and PML-N had said that although they would not join the Azadi March physically yet they would provide support to JUI-F in the Azadi March. After a meeting on 14 October 2019, ANP president Asfandyar Wali Khan said that he would lead the Azadi March if Maulana Fazl ur Rehman is arrested.On 21 October 2019 two JUI (F) leaders, Maulana Shafiq-ur-Rehman and Maulana Muhammad Irshad, were arrested when they were caught inciting people against the government to join the Azadi March in Shams Colony, Islamabad.The government would then form a seven member committee headed by Defence Minister Pervez Khattak consisting of Education minister Shafqat Mahmood, Religious Minister Noor-ul-Haq Qadri, Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser, Speaker of Provincial Assembly of Punjab Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi and Minister for planning development and special initiatives Asad Umar to negotiate with the opposition led Rehbar committee to end the Azadi March however the Committee demanded the resignation of Imran Khan. Once the Committee returned to Prime Minister Imran Khan the government allowed the Azadi March as long as it be held within ambit of law. NACTA would later on alert the leaders of various political parties, especially those participating in the Azadi March regarding the danger of terrorist attacks. On 26 October 2019 JUI-F Islamabad General Secretary Mufti Muhammad Abdullah and Islamabad's Deputy Commissioner signed an agreement that the march will not enter the Red Zone in exchange for a NOC. At a news conference at Bannu Akram Durrani, the head of the Rehbar committee, announced that the participants of the Azadi March would not enter the Red Zone. The government created a two-layer security ring for the protection of the Red Zone and had placed hundreds of containers at roadsides and greenbelts in case of need, the government also took additional security measures to protect the Faizabad Interchange and important entry points like Rawat and Tarnol. The protesters would ensure that the participants do not leave their designated value, public rights would not be violated and would hold responsibility for internal security. The government on the other hand would neither create hurdles for the protestors nor block their food supply. According to JUI-F plans after having a speech in Sohrab Goth regarding Kashmir the marchers will depart from the area after being joined by caravans from Hub, after being joined by more caravans at Rohri bus stand, Sukkur the marchers will enter Punjab through Ubauro. Marchers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would gather at meeting areas in Peshawar, Mardan, Charsadda, Nowshera and Buner for solidarity with Kashmir before joining at a meeting point on Grand Trunk Road. A JUI-F convoy lead by Maulana Abdul Wasey would also start from Baleli road, Quetta and reach Islamabad via the Loralai-Dera Ghazi Khan route, marchers would also come from Chaghi, Nushki, Gwadar and Turbat. Shortly before the Rally started on 27 October, JUI-F leader Mufti Kifayatullah was arrested in Islamabad. The March On 27 October 2019 JUI (F)'s Azadi March left Karachi's Sohrab Goth area for Islamabad by using the M-9 motorway, thousands of people including seminary students participated in the march, additional convoys from the PPP, PML-N and ANP also joined the march. Meanwhile thousands of people under the leadership of Maulana Abdul Wasey also left the Kuchlak area of Quetta to pass through Loralai then Dera Ghazi Khan to reach Islamabad and join the Azadi March, the party had also hired a large number of transportation vehicles including buses, according to a senior member of opposition the number of buses had already exceeded 400. Earlier the day of 27 October Maulana Fazl-ur-Rahman's container got stuck on an overhead bridge which caused a delay for a few hours. Other then JUI (F) leadership PPP leaders Raza Rabbani and Saeed Ghani who on 26 October 2019 had announced to join the march from Jamshoro, PML-N leaders Mohammad Zubair and Nehal Hashmi and ANP leaders Shahi Syed were also onboard the leading container. At 7:00pm the Caravan reached Hyderabad and after a short rest left for Sakrand to reach Sukkur. The caravan then spend a night at Sukkur where they were joined by PPP leaders Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Nisar Khuhro and Nasir Hussain Shah before preparing for a large rally in that city. On 28 October 2019 Fazl-ur-Rahman along with Nisar Khuhro would criticize the government and in particular PEMRA for media censorship. On that day the general secetary of JUI (F) Abdul Ghafoor Haideri would reassure the government that the protesters would gather in a ground at Islamabad at H-9 but not enter the Red Zone after meeting Muhammad Hamza Shafqaat in Islamabad. On the evening of 28 October 2019 the caravan reached Daharki to go to Multan. According to CPO(City Police Officer) of Multan Zubair Dreshak the marchers were preparing to raid the Fatima Jinnah Housing Scheme in Multan, CPO Zubair had claimed to arranged excellent security measures. The marchers coming from Dera Ghazi Khan and Muzaffargarh were to take bypass from Bahawalpur chowk to reach Multan. Meanwhile on the way to Multan three speeding vehicles crashed into each other at Ghotki, no casualties occurred. Once the Azadi March caravan entered Punjab Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman thanked Sindh leader Rashid Mahmood soomro for making good arrangements in Sindh for Azadi March, the Azadi March arrived at Multan on 28 October 2019. After an overnight stay at Multan the caravan then headed for Lahore where they were supposed to arrive at 29 October 2019. On the night of 29 October 2019 the March reached Sahiwal, which lied in between Lahore and Multan. The March was then expected to reach Lahore in the next four to five hours. Many political parties had set up camps at Lahore to welcome the Azadi March, JUI (F) had set camps at Data Darbar and Thokar Niaz Beg, Jamiat Ahle Hadith has set up a camp at Batti chowk on Ravi road. PML-N had set its camp at Chauburji while PPP had set its camp in Samanabad while the Traders community had its camp at Multan Chungi and Yateem Khana. On the wee hours of 30 October 2019 the Azadi March arrived at Lahore. Later on the March would enter Muridke in Sheikhupura where the PML-N Legislator Rana Tanveer Hussain welcomed the march, Maulana Fazl ur Rehman then did a speech there to pray for the health of Nawaz Sharif. The Azadi March then entered Kamoke in Gujranwala. The DC Islamabad then announced that metros will not be functional on 31 October 2019. According to the plans the march participants were to stay overnight at camps in Gujar Khan near Rawalpindi before marching to the capital. According to the plans by JUI-F Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief Atta-ur- Rehman the JUI (F) caravan will depart from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on 31 October 2019, Caravans will depart from Peshawar, Chitral, Dir, Kohistan, Shangla, Torghar, Bajaur and Mohmand to arrive at October 31 2pm at Rashakai Interchange. Caravans from South and North Waziristan, Kurram Agency, Orakzai and Kohat will arrive at Peshawar. Caravans from Abbottabad, Mansehra, Battagram and Haripur were expected to unite at Hasan Abdal at 4pm. Aftermath Media censor ship had reportedly increased and sources suggest that it had exceeded the media censorship of the Military regime of Zia-ul- Haq. The march was called-off on 13 November 2019 and was converted to a blockade of major roads as 'Plan-B'. After Nawaz Sharif left Pakistan for the UK on an air ambulance on 19 November 2019 for treatment the blockade 'Plan-B' was called-off as well. ‚ÄòPlan C‚Äô of the Azadi march included opposition parties in Balochistan held rallies and protests across the region against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf‚Äôs government. However, as of January 2020 Imran Khan remained the prime minister, with the march failing in its primary objective as Pakistan's powerful military backed the incumbent government, according to Reuters news agency.https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-pakistan-politics- protests/pakistan-army-says-supports-elected-government-amid-major-protest- idUKKBN1XC06F Analysts have divergent opinions on the march's failure, some say it failed as the military backed the government, while others argued that the opposition itself was divided, as the two main opposition parties had 'stayed away' from the sit-in protests.https://www.dawn.com/news/1514353 See also *2014 Azadi March *2017 Faizabad sit-in *2019 Article 370 Violation *2019-2020 Lebanese protests *2019-2020 Iraqi protests *Inaugaration of the Kartarpur corridor *2019 Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya dispute References Category:2019 protests Category:2010s in Islamabad Category:Civil disobedience Category:Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Category:November 2019 events in Pakistan Category:October 2019 events in Pakistan Category:Politics of Pakistan Category:Protest marches Category:Protests against results of elections Category:Protests in Pakistan Category:2019 in Pakistani politics ","title":"2019 Azadi march"},{"id":"62232233","text":"Sonam Tshering Venchungpa is an Indian politician.

The Serratus Glacier lies to the west of Alpha, unnamed glaciers lie on the northern and eastern slopes, and Lake Lovely Water lies below the south slope. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Squamish River. History The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1914 by Basil Darling and Alan Morkill via the southwest ridge. These two named the peak shortly after they made the ascent, alluding to Alpha, which is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, because the peak is the first (southeast) summit of the Alpha-Serratus-Tantalus-Zenith Ridge, and also because of its form. The mountain's name was officially adopted on June 6, 1957, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Alpha Mountain seen from the shoulder of Pelion Mountain Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Alpha Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Alpha.

He is the director of the Institute for Preventive Medicine and professor for postgraduate studies (ECPD). In 2019, some of the works of Maticek and his co-author, psychologist Hans Eysenck, were reviewed by King's College London and 26 were declared \\"unsafe\\".  Biography  Ronald Grossarth-Maticek was born in 1940 in Budapest. In 1973 he received his PhD at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, and in 1991 a doctorate in medical sciences (Dr. med. sc.) in the medical faculty of the University of Belgrade. From 1975 to 1982 he headed the research project \\"Social Scientific Oncology\\", supported by the German Research Foundation and the Foundation for Education and Handicapped Support in Stuttgart, among others. From 1982 to 1990, he was the head of the international research program \\"Prospective Epidemiology and Preventive Behavioral Medicine\\". In 1990 he became Director of the Institute for Preventive Medicine and Political, Economic and Health Psychology in Heidelberg, an institution of the European Centre for Peace and Development (ECPD) in Belgrade, which belongs to the University for Peace in Costa Rica associated with the United Nations. Grossarth-Maticek was awarded the title Professor by the European Center for Peace and Development (ECPD), which he may use in Germany with the addition Professor for Postgraduate Studies, ECPD.  Research  Ronald Grossarth- Maticek is well known for his lectures, numerous books and articles in professional journals. From 1973 to 1995 he directed the Heidelberg Prospective Study, a long-term study in which around 30,000 people from 18,000 Heidelberg households were examined at regular intervals over a period of more than 20 years for a variety of health-influencing variables.Ronald Grossarth- Maticek and Helm Stierlin: Cancer Risks - Survival Opportunities - How Body, Soul and Social Environment Interact. Carl Auer Systems, Heidelberg 1998, page 110 On extensive questionnaires, he recorded dozens of physical factors (such as cigarette smoking, exercise, organ damage, genetic disposition and nutrition) as well as psychological factors (attachment to the mother in early childhood, stressors, distress, eustress, self-regulation). He developed his own behavioral typology, into which he classified the interviewees according to the degree of their self-regulation. According to Grossarth-Maticek's research results, the risk of illness is multiplied by an insufficient self- regulation. Physical risk factors work mainly in sum, but especially when psychological risk factors are present at the same time. In the \\"Heidelberg Prospective Study\\" Grossarth was able to prove a predominantly multi-causal origin of chronic diseases. Grossarth-Maticek speaks of a \\"peculiar compulsion to act without necessity in a certain way and not differently\\". Such behavior arises from a consolidation of behavior patterns in the first years of life.Brand eins: Wo das Dogma beginnt, ist das Leben am Ende If the \\"free flow of love\\" was disturbed by early childhood rejections, traumata, disappointment or other experiences, there could be disturbances of the inner and outer communication in adulthood,Grossarth-Maticek quoted by , p. 1 which, in combination with other factors synergistically, have an effect on health. Inspired by the cooperation with the psychologist Hans J√ºrgen Eysenck Grossarth developed a new behavioural typology. = Grossarthian behavioral typology = In the behavioral typology developed by Grossarth, six types of behavioral patterns are distinguished:R. Grossarth-Maticek: Self-regulation, autonomy and health. Disease risks and social health resources in the socio- psycho-biological system. 2002, Chapter 4. Grossarth's typology of behaviour pp. 118-120 Type I: Suffering in isolation: central and persistent orientation towards a longed-for but withdrawing object; inhibition in the realization of the longed-for proximity, thus inhibiting the satisfaction of this emotionally most important need. Type II: Helpless excitement: Central and persistent orientation towards a disturbing, obstructive object, without reaching the desired distancing, with recurring overexcitation and a feeling of helplessly being at the mercy of others. Type III: Ambivalence: High ambivalence and strong egocentrism. Emotional instability with interim phases of autonomous self-regulation, but also with phases of intensive search for closeness with emotional needs on the one hand and after injuries phases of hyperactive excessive distancing on the other hand. Type IV: Good self-regulation: Orientation towards current objects that enable subjective well-being, pleasure and security through which a sense of purpose can be experienced. Flexible self-regulation adapted to the situation and needs. Type V: Emphasizes rational: Rational and antiemotional behavior. When overwhelmed by emotions, psychological crises and depressive mood arise. Type VI: Irrational- emotional: Irrational, behaviour dominated by one's own feelings, without rational verification of one's own behaviour. This typology is the result of Grossarth-Maticek's investigations into and considerations for the history and frequency of chronic diseases and health. He emphasizes similarities between types I and II and sees type III as a hybrid of I and II. Of course, in one subject, characteristics of several behavior types may be present at the same time, but one of them is usually dominant in behavior. = Autonomy training = Grossarth-Maticek and his collaborators, as Helm Stierlin who wrote a preamble in Grossarth's book \\"Selbstregulation, Autonomie und Gesundheit\\",Ronald Grossarth-Maticek: Selbstregulation, Autonomie und Gesundheit - Krankheitsfaktoren und soziale Gesundheitsressourcen im sozio- psycho-biologischen System table of contents. De Gruyter Verlag 2003 developed an autonomy training aimed at stimulating self-regulation. In this autonomy training, a special form of cognitive behavioral therapy, the ability to achieve well-being, pleasure, security, and fulfilment of meaning through self-active problem solving is strengthened in conversation. The trainee is encouraged to perceive himself/herself and to recognize which activities increase his/her well-being.Theodor Dirk Petzold: Erfahrungen mit dem Autonomietraining nach Grossarth-Maticek - als Allgemeinarzt mit psychosomatischem Schwerpunkt und als Ausbilder im Autonomietraining 2005 Autonomy training is seen as a preventive intervention, which is suitable for achieving effective behavioural changes in a relatively short time and then incorporating them into a long-term preventive programme. .Ronald Grossarth- Maticek: Kompentent Gesund page 10 Grossarth uses the term \\"autonomy\\" in the sense of an inner independence from objects with negative experienced consequences, which results from self-knowledge and redesign of communication. Self-regulation includes the personal ability to create the conditions for pleasure, well-being, security and inner balance through one's own behaviour in interpersonal relationships. However, the aim of this autonomy training is not egocentric Epicureanism, which ignores fellow human beings, but an attainment of happiness in a socially accepted framework, which respects and supports both the fellow human beings and one's own person.Interview with Ronald Grossarth: Wenn Liebe und Schmerz zur Vers√∂hnung f√ºhren Rhein Neckar Zeitung, January 2019 In 2001 Grossarth-Maticek had this protected under trademark law under the term Autonomietraining Gesundheit und Probleml√∂sung durch Anregung der Selbstregulation.Der Titelschutz Anzeiger Nr. 516, Woche 18/2001 The statistically average life-prolonging effect of autonomy training in cancer patients demonstrated in the Heidelberg prospective study cannot be interpreted in such a way that autonomy training is a method with which permanent healing can be achieved in any case, but the results show that the improvement of self-regulation is one of the factors that contribute to an improvement in the function of the immune systemR. vein, N.

According to Grossarth-Maticek's findings, a high degree of self-regulation is also a significant factor for prevention. This was evident both in those people examined in this longitudinal study who already had good self-regulation and in those who learned it in the course of autonomy training.Systemic epidemiology and preventive behavioural medicine of chronic diseases Strategies for maintaining health.

In an article in the Deutsches √Ñrzteblatt there is a correction by Helmut Kiene (Witten/Herdecke University) in which Kiene maintains that all the points mentioned were based on incorrect assumptions and a lack of professional understanding.Helmut Kiene: Misleading statements Deutsches √Ñrzteblatt, vol. 101, issue 30, 23 July 2004Dr. Helmut Kiene International Congress for Integrative Health and Medicine Roderick D. Buchanan argued that Grossarth, who had \\"come a long way from ... war-torn Yugoslavia\\" was \\"living in a fine house overlooking the Heidelberg Castle in Germany on the steep embankments of the Neckar river\\" (in the neighbourhood of the Helm Stierlin-InstituteYellow pages Heidelberg: Wissenschaftliches Institut Grossarth-MaticekDeutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Systemische Therapie: Helm Stierlin Institut e.

Buchanan: Playing with Fire: The Controversial Career of Hans J. Eysenck page 376, 378, 380.Springer: Manfred Amelang Beginning around 1984 Grossarth worked in collaboration with the London psychologist Hans J√ºrgen Eysenck.Aho v. Suomen; Tupakka Oy: Tobacco Documents Library Id: kqgf0028. Available at: Truth Tobacco Industry documents: Sworn statement of Hans J√ºrgen Eysenck 10 December 1990, page 17.. Eysenck played no role in the initiation of Grossarth's studies, nor had much influence over the process of most of the data-gathering. Eysenck would suggest analysis of the existing data and suggested that certain variables be explored more systematically.Roderick D. Buchanan: Playing with Fire: The Controversial Career of Hans J. Eysenck page 383. Their joint work was published during the years 1985-2000. In an article published in 2019 in the journal Journal of Health Psychology Anthony J. Pelosi and David F. Mark's requested a review of some of Hans J√ºrgen Eysenck works with whom Grossarth- Maticek published for many years. Further details of which can be found in the Dr. Eysenck article. Dr. Grossarth has presented some rebuttal points on a website.  Actual Replication Studies  A single potentially positive response to the withdrawal of over 26 article can be found in Whitfield et al. (2020): \\"Despite criticisms of the Grossarth-Maticek and Eysenck data, we found empirical support for some SIRI subtypes. In accord with the Grossarth- Maticek and Eysenck personality-stress model, and consistent with two previous SIRI studies, inverse associations of Type 4 (healthy) scores with all-cause mortality were found and also Type 2 scores predicted CVD mortality. However, no significant relationship was found between Type 1 scores and cancer mortality.John B. Whitfield, J. George Landers, Nicholas G. Martin, Gregory J.Boyle: Validity of the Grossarth-Maticek and Eysenck personality-stress model of disease: An empirical prospective cohort study The results of a cross-sectional study conducted by the Medical Clinic 3 of the Ruhr University Bochum to investigate self-regulation and smoking as predictors of lung cancer confirm the correlations found by Grossarth et al. that risk factors, above all the psychosocial risk factor smoking, are significantly modulated by the factor self-regulation. In the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory cited therein, cancer patients showed a higher pre-morbid score in terms of repression and depression compared to non-cancer patients.Michael Bloch: Querschnittsstudie zur Untersuchung von Selbstregulation und Rauchen als Pr√§diktoren f√ºr Lungenkrebs page 9, Bochum, 2019 The understanding of the influence of the psyche on the immune system and thus on the possible development of cancer is growing in conjunction with more recent results from psychoneuroimmunology.Michael Bloch: Querschnittsstudie zur Untersuchung von Selbstregulation und Rauchen als Pr√§diktoren f√ºr Lungenkrebs Bochum, 2019  Selected works       * * References Category:1940 births Category:German sociologists Category:Heidelberg University alumni Category:German people of Hungarian descent Category:Living people ","title":"Ronald Grossarth-Maticek"},{"id":"62232317","title":"2018 NCAA Division II football rankings"},{"id":"62232324","text":"Bijoy Malakar is an Indian politician.

At the time, she commented she was used to \\"stepping aside for the men\\". However, Phelan died in 1966, and as the leader of the majority party, Wilkins assumed the office of Speaker.

Alex is mysteriously offered a full-ride to university following her trauma despite her background and lack of qualifications. She attempts to navigate her new life at the Ivy League while tasked by her benefactor with monitoring the eight Houses of the Veil, secret societies that harbor dark occult magic and power, from Lethe, the ninth house. Background The novel is Bardugo's first adult novel and beyond the fantasy elements is largely inspired by her time at Yale University. Bardugo became inspired upon discovering the tombs of Yale's secret societies as she walked down New Haven's Grove Street during her freshman year. When her friend sent her pictures from their time at Yale years later, Bardugo was struck with memories, both pleasant and unpleasant, which inspired her to explore trauma for this novel but also companionship through it.

I can't think of a better way to send off an old friend than to remember what made them so special in the first place.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated the episode 6.1 out of 10, saying \\"Arrows final season is spending too much time revisiting the show's checkered past rather than moving forward.\\" Chancellor Agard of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B and said, \\"I really like that Arrow isn't ignoring or breezing past the aftermath of the season premiere. It's still hanging over the characters two episodes later, which makes complete sense. This is also a sign of growth on the show's part because it's not the first time Team Arrow has faced an apocalyptic event. A nuclear bomb went off in a populated town in season 4, and yet you never really got the sense that catastrophe truly affected the team even though it should have, especially because they had been trying to prevent that from happening. Here, though, Earth-2's destruction isn't something they can forget.\\"  Notes   References   External links  * Category:2019 American television episodes Category:Arrow (TV series) episodes Category:Television episodes about time travel Category:Dystopian television episodes ","title":"Leap of Faith (Arrow)"},{"id":"62232360","text":"Nabanita Handique is an Indian politician.

Biography  He studied Law (University of Barcelona in Lleida) and Information Sciences (Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona), although he never graduate from either degree, combining his university studies with a budding career in journalism. Benet began his professional career in 1975 in El Diario de L√©rida as a staff writer for local news and sports. In December 1976, he moved to Barcelona to participate in the launch of the newspaper Catalunya Express as a reporter for the Sports section. In June 1977 he returned to Lleida as a correspondent for the national daily El Pa√≠s and from November 1978, working as a delegate for El Peri√≥dico de Catalunya. In September 1980, Tatxo made what was to be his definitive move to Barcelona to work at El Peri√≥dico as editor of Las Cosas de la Vida, being appointed chief-editor of the section in the spring of 1982. In September 1983, he joined the founding team of TV3-Televisi√≥ de Catalunya with the position of head of the News Department‚Äôs Catalonia section. It was here that Tatxo first met Jaume Roures and Gerard Romy. In January 1984, as TV3 began regular broadcasting, Tatxo was appointed Head of News Assignments. Since then, and for the next fifteen years until 1997, Tatxo Benet was responsible for a variety of areas and held several managerial positions at Televisi√≥ de Catalunya. He presented and directed news section in several newscasts, and directed and presented Tothom per tothom magazine. In June 1987, Tatxo was appointed Head of the Sports Department, a position he held for almost ten years, until September 1996. During the period he was Head of Sports, and along with Jaume Roures, TV3 acquired the rights and exclusive broadcasting in Catalonia for the Spanish La Liga and the Copa del Rey, UEFA Champions League, Wimbledon and US Open tennis tournaments, the four Grand Slam golf tournaments: British Open, US Open, Augusta Masters and USPGA, as well as many other top-level Spanish and international competitions, breaking the monopoly held by Spanish Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola up to this point. During this period, the appearance and content of sports programming underwent significant modernization, as well as the way networks utilized different sporting footage and images. In fact, TV3‚Äôs Channel 33 was soon transformed into a sports channel given the quality and volume of broadcasts and sports programs the channel featured, especially at weekends. During the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games Tatxo was appointed director and Head of Canal Ol√≠mpic, broadcasting the games in Catalan 24 hours a day. With the creation of FORTA, the Federaci√≥n de Organismos de Radio y Televisi√≥n Auton√≥mica, which brings together all the regional autonomous TV and radio networks in Spain, Tatxo was appointed Coordinator and Head of the Sports Division. In January 1997, Tatxo moved to Madrid and was appointed General Director of Audiovisual Sport, a company participated by Sogecable (40%), Antonio Asensio (40%) and Televisi√≥ de Catalunya (20%), which was set up to commercialize the media rights to the Spanish Football League. In the summer of 1997, Antonio Asensio sold their stake in Audiovisual Sport to Telef√≥nica, who had just launched its Via Digital platform. This operation brought about a standoff in the company, given that the two majority shareholders (Sogecable and Telefonica) held conflicting positions. Faced with this situation, in September 1997, Tatxo resigned from his position and returned to Barcelona. Once there, Benet decided to set up his own company to produce and distribute rights, a company that was to merge with Mediapro, which had been set up some years earlier by Jaume Roures and Gerard Romy.  Contemporary art collection and patronage  In February 2018 he started his contemporary art collection, which he has titled \\"Censored.\\" It consists of more than seventy artworks that were censored at some point in history. The collection includes works by Abel Azcona, Ai Weiwei, Francisco de Goya, Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. In February 2018, shortly before it was withdrawn from Arco, Tatxo Benet acquired the piece Presos Pol√≠ticos en la Espa√±a contempor√°nea (Political Prisoners in Modern-day Spain) by Santiago Sierra. Outraged by what he considers ‚Äúan act of intolerable censorship,‚Äù he made the piece available to anyone who wishes to exhibit it, with the Museum in Lleida being its first destination, and from where the works of the Sixena Monastery had recently been removed. The work has been shown in more than thirty cities in Catalonia and Spain, and in several European countries. One of the most important pieces in Tatxo Benet's Contemporary Art collection is Amen or The Pederasty by Abel Azcona, which was censored and persecuted by the Catholic Church, as well as Piss Christ by Andres Serrano and photographs by Ai Weiwei, which are considered to be some of the most recognized censored artworks in art history. In January 2020, Benet bought a nude, feminized painting of Mexican Revolutionary General Emiliano Zapata, La Revoluci√≥n by Fabi√°n Chairez. Descendents of Zapata sued Ch√°irez for defamation after the painting was exhibited at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. The painting will be taken to Catalu√±a to be exhibited alongside 25 other controversial paintings in Benet's collection.Un empresario espa√±ol compra la pol√©mica pintura de Zapata Milenio, 15 Jan 2020 In 2019, Tatxo acquired the bookshop llibreria Ona from Montse √öbeda.

Early life and career  Francis Bruce Oswell was born on 11 January 1920 in Malvern, Victoria. He studied engineering at the University of Melbourne part time beginning in 1939 before enlisting in the Army and RAAF during WW2. He studied his Diploma in Architecture from the Central Technical College in Brisbane and later at the University of Queensland, graduating in 1952 with his Graduate Diploma in Architecture. He had worked as a draughtsman for Bligh Jessup in 1949. His firm F.B. Oswell and Associates found steady work as a result of the post war boom for housing, employing a number of architectural students. He moved his firm out of the centre of Brisbane city and into nearby Spring Hill where a number of other architects had moved their business. He later joined Basil Veal to form a new partnership in 1965. In 1973, Oswell and Veal joined with Trude and Webster to become Trude, Webster, Oswell and Veal Pty Ltd but this partnership ceased in 1974. Oswell returned to Oswell and Associates and retired in 1978. The rise in wool prices in the early 1950s also saw Oswell being contracted to provide designs for sheep stations, as farmers benefitted from the booming economy. His firm was in near constant employment through the 1950s, and utilised their preferred builders to achieve project completion. Oswell articulated the view that without the restrictions placed on building materials as a result of World War II, much of the architecture that emerged in Queensland would not have developed. Corrugated iron for example was in short supply, and due to research into industrial materials as a consequence of the War, corrugated roofing made of asbestos cement became a popular alternative.  Modernist architectural style  Oswell‚Äôs design for the Glencrag Apartments applied new elements of modernist design. He carefully used glass mosaic tiles as decorative features in planter boxes to provide each apartment with its own individual features whilst maintaining the uniformity of the whole building‚Äôs aesthetic. He designed external fixed metal louvres to buildings to provide sun shade, another trend of the era. He also noted the preference for high set homes to provide for under floor car storage as more people took up car ownership. Oswell used steel in his commercial design for the Walk Arcade to express movement. The upper balcony balustrades extended over the lower floor paths and steel was stretched in a zig zag pattern on the upper and lower balconies to imitate movement. He promoted colour choices featured by international designers. With the success of Torbreck, Brisbane‚Äôs first high rise apartment block, other projects were developed in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Oswell‚Äôs firm designed the Glencrag Apartments in Spring Hill, the first large scale mixed use development incorporating apartment living with commercial levels underneath. Its use of multi colour, textures and shapes were controversial with some parts of the community. His firm designed Garfield Towers on the Gold Coast, a high rise holiday rental apartment block which featured glass window walling.  Personal life  Frank Oswell died in Brisbane on 19 August 2003. He married Glenda in 1945. They had three children, Simon, Christopher, and Margaret.

It resulted in a U.S. National Alzheimer's Plan for increased spending on scientific research, care, and public engagement.  Development  The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) was initially developed due to recommendations from a taskforce created in 2009, and was authored by Senator Susan Collins and Senator Evan Bayh, before being signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 4, 2011. Named the 'Alzheimer's Study Group', the taskforce consisted of health policy experts and was co-chaired by former House Speaker Rep. Newt Gingrich and Sen. Bob Kerrey. They assessed the current status of response to the burden of Alzheimer's disease, looked at the current trajectory for coping with this burden, and determined whether current policy was sufficient. They concluded in their 52 page report, entitled 'A National Alzheimer‚Äôs Strategic Plan: The Report of the Alzheimer‚Äôs Study Group' that the 'national effort to address Alzheimer‚Äôs disease has lacked coordination and focus, and has been woefully underfunded relative to the scale of the mounting crisis'.  Details  A National Plan to address Alzheimer's disease was subsequently released on May 15, 2012 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This National Plan has 5 goals: # Prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease and related dementia by 2025 # Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency # Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families. # Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement. # Track Progress and Drive Improvement. To inform the National Plan, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services worked with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to create an Interagency group. This group also consisted of Health and Human Services representatives from the following agencies: * Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) * Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) * National Institute on Aging (NIA) * Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) * Administration on Aging (AoA) * Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) * Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) * Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) * Food and Drug Administration (FDA) * Indian Health Service (IHS) * Administration for Children and Families (ACF)  Follow-up and output  = Reports = Reports on each goal are generated yearly. = Budgets = The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) recommended $2 billion a year to achieve their goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. In 2017, a bill was approved to boost government funding for Alzheimer's disease to almost $1.4 billion for the fiscal year. In 2015, Congress requested that a 'professional judgement', or 'bypass' budget be created for Alzheimer's disease. This budget goes directly to Congress and the President, and in biomedicine has only been seen previously in the fields of cancer and AIDS.  Global context  The existence of NAPA means that the U.S. joins 31 other countries and territories around the world who have developed a plan for dementia. In May 2017, the World Health Organization established a Global Action Plan for Dementia, focusing on the public health response.

Joseph Moakley Professor of Political Science at Boston College. Schlozman has made fundamental advancements to the study of participation in American politics, and was a pioneer in the field of gender and politics. Her contributions include the theory of civic voluntarism, several landmark studies on the relationship between access to resources and different types of political participation, and related investigations into the nature of civic culture. Schlozman has one of the highest citation counts of any political scientist, including being among the top 50 most cited active political scientists and top 10 most cited women in the discipline. She worked closely with Sidney Verba for nearly 50 years, first as his student and then as his collaborator. Early life and education Schlozman was born on December 23, 1946 in Chicago, Illinois to Elliot Lehman and Frances Lehman. Schlozman majored in sociology and minored in English at Wellesley College, graduating with a BA in 1968. She then completed an MA and a PhD in political science at the University of Chicago in 1973 under the supervision of Sidney Verba. Career and contributions Schlozman became a political science professor at Boston College in 1974. When she arrived at Boston College, Schlozman was the only woman in the department (and only one of 7 woman professors then working at Boston College), soon becoming the first woman in that department to receive tenure. She has been a visiting professor at Wellesley College, Harvard University, and Paris Diderot University, as well as a Fulbright Lecturer at Aix-Marseille University. Schlozman has published widely on the causes of participation or non-participation in American politics, and the political mechanisms and institutions that enable and hinder civic engagement in America. She has focused particularly on gender and politics, the roles of interest groups in political processes, and political parties and elections in the United States. Schlozman is the coauthor of six books, and the editor of two more. She has also been noted for innovative teaching, and for unusually high departmental and professional service. =Political participation and institutions= Schlozman has contributed to the theory of political participation for four decades. Her first book was Injury to Insult: Unemployment, Class and Political Response, coauthored with Sidney Verba, which surveyed unemployed Americans to address the paradox that the unemployed, who appear to have the most to gain from political engagement, are also disproportionately politically inactive. Schlozman turned her attention to political structures and institutions in her second book, Organized Interests and American Democracy, in which she and her coauthor John T. Tierney used extensive interviews to document the expansion of interest groups in Washington, D.C. during the 1980s. In 1995 Schlozman wrote perhaps her most important work, Voice and Equality: Civic voluntarism and American politics, with Sidney Verba and Henry E. Brady. This book develops a three- factor model of political engagement that the authors call \\"civic voluntarism\\". They develop and test the claim that citizens can only become political participants if they possess all three of the following conditions: the resources to engage in politics, a psychological engagement in politics, and some connection to a political recruitment network. John Aldrich reviewed Voice and Equality positively, writing that while it is not a complete theory of political participation in itself, it \\"will be a component of all kinds of theories of political behavior\\", while Jane Mansbridge described it as a fundamental advance in the theory of political participation that \\"documents how even in the realm of citizen participation liberal democracies fail to live up to the norm of equal responsiveness to the interests of each citizen\\". Schlozman, Verba, and Brady further developed and tested their resource theory for several decades, and in 2012 they analyzed the implications of wealth inequality on political participation under the resource model in a book called The unheavenly chorus: Unequal political voice and the broken promise of American democracy. The book was noted for compiling and presenting data from throughout the authors' half-century of data collection. In 2018 the authors followed this analysis with a final book, Unequal and unrepresented: Political inequality and the peoples' voice in the new gilded age, but the nearly half century-long collaboration between Schlozman, Verba, and Brady ended with Verba's death in 2019. =Gender and politics= In addition to being a central scholar in the study of political participation, Schlozman was a pioneer in the study of gender and politics. One of her first works to explicitly engage with gender was an early article on campus sexual harassment; in 1991, prompted by allegations of sexual harassment against another member of her department at Boston College, Schlozman wrote an academic article investigating the sexual harassment of students by faculty members. Most of Schlozman's work relating to gender, however, has also been connected to her interests in political participation. Her 2001 book The Private Roots of Public Action: Gender, Equality and Political Participation, coauthored with Nancy Burns and Sidney Verba, adds another dimension to the three requirements for participation that Verba, Schlozman, and Brady had studied in Voice and Equality: they now consider the influences on participation of citizens' private lives through mechanisms like domestic power relations and differential treatment in the workplace. They show that a small gender gap persisted in American political participation in the early 1990s even when political participation is understood quite broadly, with men performing slightly more political actions than women, but they argue that even a very small gap on an individual level can produce real differences in representation and policy outcomes in the aggregate. The book tests the hypothesis that individuals' private (and necessarily gendered) experiences affect their level of public political participation, using the theory of civic voluntarism. This addition to the theory was well-received. =Impact= Schlozman is one of the most-cited scholars in political science. In 2019, she was ranked as the 45th most cited active political scientist in the world in a citation analysis by the political scientists Hannah June Kim and Bernard Grofman. This made her the 8th most cited woman who was actively conducting research in political science, as well as one of the 25 most-cited scholars who obtained their PhD between 1970 and 1974, and one of the 25 most-cited researchers of American politics. Many of her books and articles are considered landmark developments in the study of political participation, gender and politics, and civic culture. Kay Schlozman is married to Stanley Schlozman. Schlozman's son, Daniel Schlozman, is also a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and her daughter, Julia Schlozman, is an attorney. Awards and recognition In 2003, Schlozman was named a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Some of her major awards include: *Rowman and Littlefield Award for Innovative Teaching in Political Science from the American Political Science Association, 2004 *Frank Goodnow Award for Distinguished Service to the Profession of Political Science from the American Association of Political Science, 2006 *PROSE Awards, Government and Politics and Excellence in Social Sciences, from the American Association of Publishers, 2012 *Samuel Eldersveld Career Achievement Award, 2016 *Warren E.

The total area of the island is 0.94 square kilometers. The island is rocky, and is surrounded by numerous offshore rocks and reefs. History Shinojima has been inhabited since at least the J≈çmon period, as archaeologists have found Yayoi period and Kofun period remains. Long associated with Ise Shrine, the island is mentioned in the Nara period Man'y≈çsh≈´ poetry anthology. It has supplied salted and dried sea bream to the shrine for use as offerings since before the Nara period. During the reconstruction of Ise Shrine every twenty years, one of the buildings from Ise Shrine is always dismantled and shipped to Shinojima where it is re-erected as the honden of the local Shimmei Jinja, founded in 771 AD. During the Edo period, it was part of the holdings of Owari Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate and contained a fishing settlement. Kato Kiyomasa is said to have used granite quarried on Shinojima in the construction of Nagoya Castle. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system after the start of the Meiji period, the island was organized as a village within Chita District, Aichi. It merged with surrounding towns and villages to form the town of Minamichita on June 1, 1961.

He had two famous sons; the economist, and the painter, Guszt√°v Kelety. Biography His father was a clerk in the court of the Electorate of Saxony. He displayed an aptitude for art at an early age and began his studies immediately upon finishing his primary education. Following some initial work in Dresden, he moved to Prague, then completed his studies in Vienna. A few years later, he went to Hungary and found employment with the noble Zichy family. He became well known at the court of Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary, and later taught art to Joseph's son, the future Archduke Stephen. It was around this time that he became acquainted with the S√°nth√≥ family and, through that connection met his wife, Johanna Bayer. They had three children; two sons, mentioned above, and a daughter, Franciska, who became the wife of J√°nos Hanz√©ly (1821-1899), a Royal Counselor. He was appointed a court painter in 1832. When the Archduke Joseph died in 1847, his family moved to Vienna and his court was dismissed. Stephen, now Archduke, moved to his estate at Schauenburg, in the Duchy of Nassau. He invited Klette to spend the summers there, which he did for three years. He continued to maintain some contact until Stephen's death in 1867. Many of his works were reproduced in color and sold throughout Germany and Austria. Despite enjoying a fair amount of popularity, he was largely forgotten by the time of his death.

It now operates as a museum managed by Heritage Alice Springs Incorporated.  History  Adelaide House was the first hospital in Alice Springs and it was brought about through the hard work and advocacy of the Reverend John Flynn. The Reverend John Flynn (Flynn) travelled regularly to Alice Springs, and other far-flung places and, as a part of his role as superintendent of the Australian Inland Mission (AIM) where he started in 1912, he was determined to improve the lives of people in Central Australia. Before Adelaide House was built there was no doctor in the region and people had to rely on their own experience and basic supplies in case of general illness. In cases of emergency, a doctor would be called in to the Central Telegraph Office in Adelaide and their advice would be transmitted via telegram. This, of course, lead to many preventable deaths. Fundraising started for the hospital in 1918, with Flynn \\"passing around the hat\\" and with local residents forming a fundraising committee. It is worth noting that Flynn prioritised the building of a hospital over that of a church. Construction started in 1920 when local stonemason Jack Williams (who had built the Stuart Town Gaol), who was 70 years old was given the contract. Williams struggled with the contract as he found it hard to find good help and worked alone for most of the three years he worked on the project. In 1923 construction stalled when the cost was blowing out and there were no more available funds. With further funds raised construction restarted in 1925 when Flynn hired Bert and Angus McLeod from Adelaide and it was completed and opened on 24 June 1926. Once completed, Adelaide House was the 9th in a network of 14 medical facilities established by the AIM and they were an important part of the \\"mantle of safety\\" Flynn envisioned for the people of the outback. In February 1934 the government decided they would no longer allow Aboriginal people to use Adelaide House and a galvanised-iron hut was built on the east bank of the Todd River. A new, much bigger hospital was opened in 1939 and Adelaide House stopped working as a hospital but remained in use by the AIM as accommodation for children from remote areas whose parents were in hospital and as pre and post-birth care for women and their children.  Design  Flynn designed the Adelaide House to feature a cellar with ducts taking cool air up to the upper levels; it was a unique cooling system based upon the ‚ÄúCoolgardie safe‚Äù.  Current use  Adelaide House now operates as a local history museum, run by volunteers, and it has a focus on health in Central Australia.

Amongst the roles she created were Jemmy in Rossini's William Tell and Sina√Øde in his Mo√Øse et Pharaon. Born in Boulogne-sur-Mer and trained at the Conservatoire de Paris, she made her stage debut at the Paris Op√©ra at the age of 17 and remained with that company until her retirement from the stage in 1835. After her retirement she taught singing in Paris, where she died at the age of 73. She was married to the French baritone Henri-Bernard Dabadie. Life and career Dabadie was born Louise-Zulm√© Leroux in Boulogne-sur-Mer, where she began her music studies. According to the memoirs of Louis Gentil, her father was an army officer who had died in 1812 during the retreat from Moscow, after which her mother settled in Paris with their children. Dabadie continued her music studies at the Conservatoire de Paris under Charles-Henri Plantade and was awarded first prize in singing and declamation in 1819. She also received second prize in piano in 1823, which she had continued to study after her stage debut at the Paris Op√©ra on 31 January 1821 as Antigone in Sacchini's ≈ídipe √† Colone. In March of that year she was offered a permanent position at the Op√©ra as a remplacement, singing the roles of the primadonnas Caroline Branchu and Caroline Grassari when they were unavailable. When Branchu retired, Dabadie was promoted to the first rank. Her first big success in a major role came in August 1825 as Julia in Spontini's La vestale. In June of that year she had sung the role of The Spirit of France in Boieldieu's Pharamond. The opera was a failure at its premiere, which was attended by the recently crowned King Charles X, and only the final tableau with Dabadie was singled out for praise. She appeared on a cloud dressed in a gold breastplate and helmet and carrying a banner emblazoned with the fleur-de-lis. She then gestured to the back curtain, which parted to reveal a receding line of illustrious French kings ending with the Arc de Triomphe and the Tuileries Palace on the far horizon. Dabadie as the angel Miza√´l in La tentation, 1832 Dabadie went on to create the roles of Sina√Øde in Mo√Øse et Pharaon (1827), Lady Macbeth in Ch√©lard's Macbeth (1827), Jemmy in William Tell (1829), Miza√´l in La tentation (1832), and Arvedson in Gustave III (1833). Her other leading roles at the Op√©ra included Eurydice in Orph√©e et Eurydice, Iphig√©nie in Iphig√©nie en Tauride, Pamyra in Le si√®ge de Corinthe, Ad√®le in Le comte Ory, Amazily in Fernand Cortez, and √âglantine in the first French performance of Euryanthe. Dabadie's voice was beautiful and well-schooled, with a purity of style and diction, but Laure Cinti-Damoreau somewhat eclipsed her fame when she joined the company in 1826. Several of the leading roles in Paris Op√©ra premieres were given to Cinti-Damoreau, with Dabadie either in secondary roles (as in Mo√Øse et Pharaon and William Tell) or singing Cinti-Damoreau's roles in revival performances (such as Le si√®ge de Corinthe and Le comte Ory). During this time Dabadie's two younger sisters also began performing at the Paris Op√©ra: the soprano Clara Lavry (n√©e Leroux) and the ballerina Pauline Leroux. From 1821 to 1830, Dabadie was also a principal singer in the Chapelle royale of Louis XVIII and later Charles X. She had been engaged by the Duc de La Ch√¢tre in 1821 after he heard her performance at Notre Dame Cathedral in a Te Deum marking the baptism of the Count of Chambord. In addition to her appearances at the Op√©ra and the Chapelle royale, Dabadie regularly sang in the concert series held by the Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire and twice performed cantatas in the final round of the Prix de Rome composition competition. In 1827 she sang Jean-Baptiste Guiraud's version of La Mort d'Orph√©e, the first-prize winner. Berlioz hired her to sing his version of Hermine for the 1828 competition and was awarded the second prize. He hired her again in 1829 for La mort de Cl√©op√¢tre. She sang in the qualification round, but a last-minute rehearsal for the premiere of William Tell prevented her from singing it in the final round. Instead, she sent her sister Clara, who was still a student at the Paris Conservatory and was overwhelmed by the difficulty of the score. Berlioz failed to win either first or second prize. Dabadie retired from the stage in 1835. Writing in 1861, Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis attributed her relatively early retirement at the age of 31 to a serious deterioration of her voice and claimed that this early vocal decline was due to the \\"deplorable\\" training system at the Paris Conservatory during the years she studied there. This assessment was strongly disputed by Jacques-L√©opold Heugel in his obituary of Dabadie published in Le M√©nestrel. According to Heugel, her vocal powers were undiminished at the time of her retirement. He wrote that Dabadie had been schooled and excelled in works of the earlier classical composers such as Gluck, Sacchini, and Spontini and saw no future for herself in the newer repertoire that was coming into vogue at the Op√©ra. In 1822, she had married the baritone Henri-Bernard Dabadie and often appeared together in the same operas such as William Tell or Mo√Øse et Pharaon . After their retirement from the stage, they both taught singing in Paris. The couple had several children, including a son Victor (1823‚Äì1853) and a daughter who was also a musician prior to her marriage to the architect Edmond Guillau. Henri-Bernard died in 1853. Louise died at her home in Paris in 1877 at the age of 73. Following her funeral at the √âglise de la Madeleine, she was buried next to her husband in Montmartre Cemetery.

(10 February 1795 ‚Äì 8 December 1863), born in Glasgow, was a writer and traveller; later in life he had a career in civic affairs in the city. Life The grave of John Strang, Glasgow Necropolis Strang was the son of a wine merchant in Glasgow. He received a liberal education, and his studies particularly included French and German. When he was fourteen hs father died, and in due course he inherited the business, for which he had little interest. In 1817 he spent some time in France and Italy, which gave him a liking for continental travel. When at home, he began to contribute to periodicals tales and poems translated from French and German. His youthful translations from the German of E. T. A. Hoffmann and others, were collected into a volume, and this introduced him to men of letters in London and in France and Germany. Having artistic as well as literary tastes, Strang sketched some of the outstanding features of Old Glasgow. In 1831 his pamphlet Necropolis Glasguensis appeared, advocating the site of a new garden cemetery; this eventually became the Glasgow Necropolis. In that year Strang made a long tour of Germany, and from there he wrote many letters which were subsequently published. He became editor in 1832 of The Day, a short-lived daily literary paper, to which he contributed articles. He was a regular contributor to the Scots Times from 1826 to 1831, and a literary critic for The Scotsman from 1832 to 1833. In 1834 he was appointed City Chamberlain of Glasgow, and he held the office for thirty years. He regulated the finances of the city, and helped to improve its architectural features.

Balaam was captured after his would-be fifth victim escaped, and he was later given a life sentence for his crimes. Early life Much of Balaam's early life is enigmatic. He's a native of Trenton, living at 421 Stuyvesant Avenue with a roommate at the time of the killings. Although a crack user, he had a ten year relationship with a woman who bore him two children, and was described as an unassuming, polite and soft-spoken young man. He didn't interact much with his neighbors, and from July 1995 to January 1996, he moved temporarily to Detroit, before returning to Trenton. Before his capture, he was arrested on several occasions for drug offences and burglary. Murders Balaam's modus operandi was to cruise around the streets, within two miles of his home, looking for potential victims. He selected drug-addicted sex workers, as they were abundant in the area. He would approach them in the early hours of the day, offering them crack in exchange for sex, and when they moved to an isolated location, he pulled out a knife and threatened them. Balaam would then rape, and subsequently strangle them. Three of the bodies were disposed of in vacant lots, while the last one was left in a rundown hotel. In addition, authorities asserted that his would-be fifth victim had managed to escape after being raped on February 16, and that at least one other woman had managed to flee unharmed. The victim were as follows: * Karen Denise Patterson (41) - October 24, 1994 * Valentina Cuyler (29) - March 19, 1995 * Connie Hayward (27) - April 10, 1995 * Debora Ann Walker (37) - July 29, 1996 Arrest, trial and sentence On the morning of July 29, 1996, Catherine Emerson, a neighbor of Balaam's, was contacted and informed to go look outside by another neighbor. Upon doing so, she found the body of a small-framed woman, lying on the grass at a nearby lot. The police were informed, quickly determining that the body belonged to Walker. Soon after, another body was found in the vicinity. Both of the women had been raped before death, and DNA testing on the semen pointed to somebody who lived in the neighborhood: Anthony Balaam. He was swiftly arrested, but remained calm and collected, speaking to the detectives in a polite manner. Balaam admitted responsibility for the stranglings, describing about the rage and power he felt while slowly strangling the women. His guilt was reinforced by a description of the woman who had evaded him. Before bringing him to court, investigators contacted with their colleagues in Detroit, in order to determine whether Balaam might've committed murders there. A homicide investigator from the city denied that Balaam was a suspect in any unsolved cases in or around the area. With this cleared up, the trial began, charging him with the murders, in addition to robbery and possession of illegal weapons. After a five-year-long trial, Anthony Balaam was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.  See also  * List of serial killers in the United States References External links * State v.

After graduating from the Hongik University, Yun became associated with the Dansaekhwa movement. Yun is well known for the smearing effects of brunt umber and ultramarine blue paints on raw canvas or linen, which reveals a Korean sensibility of reflection and meditation. Early life Yun Hyong-keun was born in Cheongwon-gun (present day Cheongju), North Chungcheong Province. Thankfully, even at the height of Japanese colonial rule, Yun had the chance to learn art from Oh Dong-myeong and Ahn Seung-gak in Cheongju Commercial School, from which he graduated in 1945. From the influence of Ahn, Yun enrolled in a short-term course at Cheongju Teachers' College to study drawing for half a year in 1946. Accordingly, in the following year, although his family was against him studying in art, Yun attended the College of Fine Arts at the newly founded Seoul National University. It was at the university where Yun and Kim Whanki, who was the professor supervising the university's entrance exam, first met. From then on, Yun began his art career under the tutelage of Kim, who even became Yun's father-in-law in 1960. However, shortly after entering SNU, Yun's hardship began. In 1948 and 1949, he was arrested, tortured, wounded and expelled from school for joining the campus-wide protests. But his most difficult times came in 1950 when the Korean War broke out. Because of his prior arrest, Yun was detained and set to be executed by a firing squad, before he miraculously escaped at the last moment. In 1956, Yun was imprisoned for six months in Seodaemun Prison, not only for partaking in the student movement while attending SNU, but also for drawing portraits for the North Korean army while Seoul was occupied. After his release, Yun transferred to Hongik University, where Kim was leading the art department, and graduated in 1957. In the following year, he started teaching art in high schools and submitted his works to the second and third ‚ÄúEngagement‚Äù exhibition (1962, 1963, Central Public Information Center, Seoul). He held his first solo exhibition in 1966 at the Press Center Gallery located in Seoul, and in 1969 he presented his works at the 10th S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. Yun's early works during the 1960s generally consist of lyrical and fantastical abstract paintings with blue backgrounds. Only a few of works from the 60s survive, but from their simple forms, brilliant use of colors, and subtle texture, we can clearly see Kim Whanki's influence. In the 1970s, Yun once again found himself in a deep trouble. When Yun was teaching at Sookmyung Girls' High School in October 1972, he was unfairly charged with violating \\"anti-communist laws\\" for disclosing corruption at the school. As a result, Yun was taken to the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, and was detained in Seodaemun Prison for about a month. Even after his release, he was blacklisted until 1980, which means that he could not find a proper job and had to be under police surveillance. Artistic Style It was not until 1973, the year Yun was released from prison, that he began dedicating himself fully to painting. Notably, it was during this period that he began to produce works in his own distinctive style which were shown during his solo exhibitions at Myongdong Gallery(1973, 1974) and Munheon Gallery(1975, 1976), Seoul, as well as in Tokyo at Muramatsu Gallery(1976) and Tokyo Gallery(1978). His works made from late 1974 until the mid-1980s are mostly made up of a rectangular canvas featuring a large portion of unmarked space flanked by two, occasionally three, columnar dark sections running up and down the entire height of the canvas. Placing a thick cotton or hemp canvas on the floor, Yun drew broad lines from top to bottom, adding his oil colors layer upon layer until the outer edges of the canvas glow with deep near-black. In his early years, Yun explained that the thesis of his paintings is ‚Äúthe gate of heaven and earth.‚Äù To Yun, who used only two alternating colors, blue and umber, ‚Äúblue [was] the color of heaven, while umber [was] the color of earth. Thus, [Yun called] them ‚Äòheaven and earth,‚Äô with the gate serving as the composition.‚ÄùArtist's Diary, January 1977 As Sid Sachs remarked, ‚Äúwhat seems casual initially: non-relational, non-compositional, turns out to be a discrete sensibility, fully conscious, wholly formed.‚Äù With only minor variations, Yun continued with this artistic practice for about 40 years. Although Yun was a senior member among the Dansaekhwa group, Yun did not prefer himself to be categorized merely as a so-called ‚ÄòDansaekhwa Artist.‚Äô Undergoing such turbulence throughout his early life, Yun attached more importance to human being, society and nature than art itself. Corresponding to one's own words, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt make art from theory. I truly believe that eternal and fragrant art can only come from a pure and innocent person,‚Äù Yun remained thoroughly faithful to a mode of living uniquely suited to his personal idiosyncrasies.Artist's Diary, 1979 Therefore, it is commonly said that one can sense a strong self-imposed discipline oozing out from his works. Every additional stroke and repetitive process by Yun is not really meant to be an endeavor towards a certain goal, nor to be better. It is rather a continuous routine and repetition, as in living a life. As Yun described, ‚Äú[his] paintings are like a diary that [he used] to record each day.‚ÄùArtist's Diary, Night of December 21, 1984. The outcome of Yun‚Äôs weighty brushstrokes of a trained body and mind result in a peculiar presence built out of real energy fields on the physical material surface of a canvas; invisible to the eye but present. Somehow, Yun's works from later years became even simpler and more stringent in terms of their forms, colors, and process. The subtle differences among the hues disappeared, and the colors were almost purely black. Also, the surfaces became drier resulting from the reduction in the use of oil. Most of Yun's later works were painted in a more concrete form: he drew rectangles on canvas with a ruler and a pencil, covered the edges of the rectangles with tapes, and then removed the tape after painting within the taped area. But these seemingly simple works have a hidden depth just as all Yun‚Äôs works do- gazing into the large black void is like plunging into a deep abyss. This kind of 'being' began to gain recognition in the west, followed by several remarkable solo exhibitions at Galerie Humanite, Nagoya (1990, 1991); Inkong Gallery, Seoul (1991); and Gallery Yamaguchi, Osaka (1989, 1992). In Europe, starting from \\"Working with Nature\\" in 1992, at the Tate Gallery Liverpool, Yun took part in the inaugural exhibition of the Korean pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1995. Hyundai Gallery in Seoul organized a solo show at the Basel Art Fair in 1997, and in 1998, Manfred Wandel brought together 70 of Yun's works, at the Stiftung fuer Konkrete Kunst, in Reutlingen, Germany. Jean Brolly Gallery showed works during Yun's stay in Paris, at a couple of exhibitions in the early 2000s. On the other hand, in the US, Donald Judd, impressed by Yun's work at first sight, invited him to exhibit at the Donald Judd Foundation in New York(1993), and at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa(1994, 1996). Recent exhibitions Until recent years after Yun's death, his works still have a strong tendency to be understood together with Dansaekhwa, featuring him as the main figure who had led the movement. Yun's works were shown in various group exhibitions along with his contemporary Dansaekhwa artists: \\"Korean Abstract Painting: 10 Perspectives\\", Seoul Museum of Art, Seoul(2011), \\"Dansaekhwa: Korean Monochrome Painting\\", National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, and Jeonbuk Museum of Art, Wanju (2012); \\"The Art of Dansaekhwa\\", Kukje Gallery, Seoul(2014); \\"Seoul Paris Seoul\\", Mus√©e Cernuschi, Paris (2016); \\"Rhythm in Monochrome Korean Abstract Painting\\", Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery, Tokyo (2017); and \\"The Ascetic Path: Korean DANSAEKHWA\\", Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art, Saint Petersburg (2017). In the meantime, there has been various essential exhibitions re- framing and redefining Yun's distinctive style. Especially, the solo exhibitions in the late 2010s held by PKM Gallery as the representative of his estate. Yun's works have been exhibited in other prominent galleries such as Blum and Poe, Axel Vervoordt Gallery, Simon Lee Gallery and David Zwirner. Above all, Yun's first posthumous major retrospective was held at National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul in 2018, which provided a comprehensive understanding of Yun's life and his artistic style. The exhibition attracted roughly 100,000 visitors in four months and the duration of the exhibition was extended for two more months. Moreover, the retrospective traveled to Palazzo Fortuny in Venice and coincided with the 58th Venice Biennale. The exhibition at Palazzo Fortuny was introduced as one of the best off-site and collateral exhibition during the biennale period.

He served as a senator between 1923 and 1924 and again between 1948 and 1953. He also held ministerial office, most recently as Minister of War for slightly more than twelve months during 1944/45, serving under \\"Presidente del Consiglio\\" (\\"Prime Minister...\\") Bonomi. Biography =Provenance and early years= Count Alessandro Casati was born in Milan, the younger son of Gian Alfonso Casati (1854 ‚Äì 1890) by his marriage to Luisa Negroni Prati Morosini (1857 ‚Äì 1927). The Casatis came from the Milanese nobility: they could trace their ancestry back more than eight hundred years. Family was important. In the judgment of one commentator, family ancestry influenced Count Alessandro more deeply than mere dynastic awareness. The recollections of friends along with his own letters and writings attest to a constant habit of invoking people and practices from the past in order to correct present disjunctures, usually without any very obvious awareness of solutions that might emerge through a process of continuity. Public service ran in the blood: Gabrio Casati and Camillo Casati were uncles. =Philosophy= Sources describe him variously as a \\"religious liberal\\" or as a \\"liberal modernist\\". His upbringing was privileged and heavily influenced by the nineteenth century liberalism that in Italy had grown out of eighteenth century enlightenment ideals. He was a student at the \\"Alessandro Manzoni College\\" (\\"Collegio Alessandro Manzoni\\") in Merate. An influence from his adolescence that recurs most frequently in Casati's writings is the wily pragmatic economist-politician Stefano Jacini. But Alessandro Casati also lived through the social ructions and the neo-conservatism that grew out the rapid industrialisation during the closing decades of the nineteenth century. Through the prisms of these influences and experiences he emerged as a voice for social and political stabilisation and moderation, first through the Giolitti years, and later under Fascism. =Commentator and networker= He was also, as a young man, an enthusiastic child of Modernism, both in terms of his religion and more broadly. This was apparent from his contributions to Il Rinnovamento (loosely \\"Renewal\\"), a short-lived Milan-based literary and cultural bi-monthly magazine which he co-founded with Tommaso Gallarati Scotti and Antonio Aiace Alfieri, and which was launched in January 1907. It was a magazine produced by and for angry youth: Scotti described Rinnovamento as \\"not simply a reaction against religious conservatism ... [but] also a reaction against the neo-paganism, the neo-aestheticism, the positivism and the scepticism that were corrupting the Italian soul\\". During these early years of the twentieth century Casati was also a significant contributor to Leonardo, a literary magazine (which was described as a monthly publication and appeared slightly irregularly between 1903 and 1907) and La Voce, a more influential magazine produced (also rather irregularly) in Florence between 1908 and 1916. Casati's contributions to these publications brought him to the wider attention of Italy's intellectual class, including several literary celebrities of the day. A particular case in point was the philosopher- politician Benedetto Croce. Context for Casati's view of the world was provided by his religious belief. Croce, in contrast, had robustly and permanently rejected religion during his teenage years. Despite such fundamental difference, Casati and Croce became life-long friends: abundant evidence for their mutual respect and affection survives in their sometimes combative correspondence that runs for more than forty years. After Il Rinnovamento folded in 1909 Alessandro Casati was involved in discussions about launching a new literary-political publication, but he was never by nature a polemicist, increasingly demonstrating a certain constrained detachment with regard the surging intellectual currents of the times: such discussions - at least as far as Casati was concerned - came to nothing. One source refers to his evident wish, at this time, to retreat into an inscrutable process of ethical and intellectual \\"self-discipline\\". =War= Alessandro Casati was not among those who professed themselves surprised by the outbreak of war at the end of July 1914, and he regarded Italy's military intervention in April 1915 as an inevitable if deplorable development. He participated in the fighting, ending the war with the rank of \\"Tenente colonnello\\" (\\"Lieutenant colonel\\"), having received the Bronze and Silver Medals of Military Valor (\\"...medagliere di bronzo e d'argento al valor militare\\"). He fought at the Battle of Asiago, led the successful attack by the 127th infantry regiment of the Florence Brigade at Monte Kobilek and was badly wounded at Bainsizza, following which he needed an operation. He also fought with his \\"Alpini\\" forces against the Austrians in the so-called \\"White War\\" in and around the Tonale Pass in the mountains north of Bergamo and Brescia. There are also a number of reports, albeit not formally confirmed, that during 1917 Alessandro Casati became a close associate of his fellow Lombard, General Capello, commander of the Second Army, providing critical advice and practical support, notably in respect of using innovative propaganda techniques to sustain troop morale, both before and after the important Battle of Caporetto. Capello was considered unusual in senior military circles because of the way he liked to surround himself with \\"intellectuals\\", and the \\"catholic liberal\\" Alessandro Casati was prominent among these. =Public service= Casati's record during the war had in any event raised his profile with the Italian political establishment and in the immediate aftermath of it he was entrusted with several important political- diplomatic assignments. In September 1923 he accepted an invitation from the Education Minister, Giovanni Gentile, to take on the vice presidency of the country's \\"Higher Education Council\\" (\\"Consiglio superiore della Pubblica Istruzione\\"), a body charged with ensuring the efficacy and consistency of Gentile's schools reforms. Already in March 1923 he had accepted nomination as a member of the senate. The senate was (and is) the upper house of Italy's bicameral parliament. One of twenty-two nominees accepted on that occasion, he was proposed for senate membership by his old friend, the senator Benedetto Croce. Casati joined the government as part of the cabinet re-shuffle of 1 July 1924, taking over from Giovanni Gentile at the Education Ministry. Politically he was, at this stage, a still slightly semi-detached member the group around the former \\"Presidente del Consiglio\\" (\\"Prime Minister...\\"), Antonio Salandra. The murder, in a Lancia Lambda on 10 June 1924, of the anti- fascist politician Giacomo Matteotti was widely blamed on Fascist thugs: it triggered a widespread political and public backlash against the increasingly autocratic Mussolini government. As the political temperature rose, on 3 January 1925 Benito Mussolini delivered a speech to the lower house of parliament \\"Camera dei deputati\\" accepting \\"moral\\" but \\"not material\\" responsibility for the Matteotti murder. He assured the parliament that within the next 48 hours the situation would be clarified. That indeed proved to be the case: Interior Minister Luigi Federzoni sent out a precise instruction to the prefects (regional administrators) which had the effect of drastically restricting press freedom and closing down political opposition parties across the country. If it had not been clear before, it was now impossible to avoid the reality that Italy was well advanced along the path to one-party dictatorship. 3 January 1925, the date of that Mussolini speech to a recalcitrant parliament, was also the day on which Alessandro Casati resigned from the Mussolini government. In the immediate term this appeared to mean joining Francesco Ruffini and Luigi Albertini in political opposition to the government from within the senate, but in reality it was Albertini whose example he now followed, , withdrawing from both the political stage and from public life more broadly. =Scholarship= Correspondence with his friend Benedetto Croce indicates that Casati had difficulty adjusting to the reduction in the size of his social circle that followed his withdrawal from public life. The years that followed were to be his most productive in terms of his writing, however. His 1931 essay and subsequent work on the memoires of Giuseppe Gorani and the Seven Years' War date from this period. He also devoted himself to preparing a three volume historical work on contemporary Italian history. This was never published, however. The papers he had gathered and the drafts he had prepared for it were destroyed in February 1943 when most of his \\"palazzo\\" in Milan, including the rich and extensive Casati family library which he had inherited and then greatly extended, were destroyed by British bombing. (Casati nevertheless continued to receive friends in the two rooms that survived in the rubble.) Later he relocated to a new home at Arcore, a short distance to the northeast of the city centre. =1943= The first half of 1943 the saw an unfolding collapse of the Fascist regime. During this period Alessandro teamed up with others to prepare for a re-emergence of the \\"Partito Liberale Italiano\\" (PLI / \\"Liberal Party...\\"...) which by this time had been outlawed for twenty years. Nevertheless, Mussolini's Grand Council colleagues only actually removed their leader him from power on 25 July 1943: Alessandro Casati's political activity during the first half of that year took place under conditions of considerable secrecy. However, a letter dated 10 April 1943 survives which he addressed from Rome to Benedetto Croce, inviting Croce to join the \\"new\\", still \\"underground\\", Liberal Party. (Croce became \\"party president\\" later in 1943 or early in 1944.) By September 1943 Casati had become the PLI representative on the \\"Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale (CLN / \\"\\"National Liberation Committee\\"). As Fighting drew closer to Rome, in November 1943 Casati was one of several leading politically active anti-fascists who took refuge in the pontifical seminary at San Giovanni in Laterano. Others included the socialist Pietro Nenni, the Christian Democrat Alcide De Gasperi, the former radical Meuccio Ruini and the democratic socialist Ivanoe Bonomi. These were some of the founder members of the emerging National Liberation Committee (CLN) which became the political face of Italian resistance. The CLN would oversee the transition from Fascism to multi-party democracy after the liberation of Rome from (by this point) German military control in June 1944. =Alfonso= Alfonso Casati (1918 ‚Äì 1944) was the much loved only son of Alessandro and Leopolda Casati. Alfonso volunteered for service in the Liberation Corps in May 1944. He was assigned to the Special Battalion of the First Grenadiers. In command of the \\"Bafile\\" battalion he took part in the fighting for control over Belvedere Ostrense and Corinaldo (near Ancona) which were being held by the Germans as strongholds along the \\"Heinrich line\\". While protecting the retreat of Polish and Italian units serving with his platoon, Alfonso Casati was shot dead by a German mortar at Corinaldo on 6 August 1944. He became a posthumous recipient of the Medaglia di bronzo al valor militare. =Postwar= The short-lived Badoglio coalition government fell following the liberation of Rome. A new multi-party coalition under the leadership of Ivanoe Bonomi took over on 18 June 1944, formally appointed by the crown prince, and with the approval of the British military commander on the ground (if not, at this stage, of the British and American governments). The Bonomi cabinet was, in effect, the CLI as government. Alessandro Casati served under Bonomi between 18 June 1944 and 21 June 1945 as Minister of War. He used this as an opportunity to help build up the strength of the Corpo Italiano di Liberazione (Liberation corps) and implement various military reforms of a technical nature. These included the (re-)establishment of the \\"Legnano\\" and \\"Cremona\\" battalions which, along with the \\"Arma dei Carabinieri\\", helped allied forces break through the German defensive \\"Gothic line\\" in northern central Italy. After he was succeeded at the ministry by his friend Stefano Jacini in June 1945, Alessandro Casati became president of the \\"Consiglio supremo di difesa\\" (\\"Supreme Defence Council\\"). There were a number of other public service and government appointments during Casati's final decade. of which one of the more significant was his appointment as a member of the Italian delegation to UNESCO. In May/June 1950 he presided over the UNESCO General Conference, held on that occasion in Florence. A new constitution, signed off at the end of 1947, meant a new senate, instituted on 1 January 1948 (although the new republican senate continued to meet in the Palazzo Madama, just as the old senate had under the monarchy). Alessandro Casati was nominated to membership of the (greatly enlarged) republican senate on 1 April 1948, formally on the basis that he had been a member of the old senate. He was elected president of the Liberal Party group of senators on 8 May 1948, retaining this position till 24 June 1953. He was elected to the ruling council of the Italian Institute for the Study of History (\\"Istituto italiano per gli studi storici\\") and to the presidency of the National Council of Public Instruction (\\"Consiglio nazionale della pubblica istruzione\\"). He became a member of the Dante Alighieri Society between 1953 and 1955, and of the Italian Press Association (\\"Federazione Nazionale Stampa Italiana\\"). Between 1951 and 1954 he was, in addition, a member of the Italian Association of Librarians, and between 1952 and 1955 he resumed his membership of the Lombardy History Society, with which he had already been closely involved during the first two decades of the twentieth century. He was also president of the commission charged with the publication of Cavour's correspondence and related diplomatic documents. =Final months= During his final months, which were marred by serious illness, Alessandro Casati retreated to his villa at Arcore, ordering his affairs and entrusting some surviving inherited ancestral papers from his Teresa Casati and Federico Confalonieri to the Risorgimento Museum in Milan. He died on 4 June 1955. Senior senators paid tribute to his scholarship, his generosity and modesty complemented by powerful persuasiveness in argument, his shrewd judgment, his courage as a soldier and politician, and his over- riding patriotism. His physical remains are buried, alongside those of his wife and of the son who predeceased them both, in the family masoleum at the Muggi√≤ municipal cemetery, near to the family home of his later years at Arcore.

Taiwan is an island country in East Asia, while it is also located at the center of the first island chain and commands the busy traffic of Taiwan Strait and Bashi Channel.  History  In 1683 the Qing dynasty, the Kangxi Emperor's comment on the geostrategy of Taiwan is that \\"Taiwan is nothing but a tiny island. The empire earns nothing with it and loses nothing without it.\\" After the Sino-French war of 1884-1885, the Qing dynasty started to notice the strategic importance of Taiwan. After the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Qing dynasty yielded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan by Treaty of Shimonoseki, which is opposed by Russian, French and German, who also have interests in taking over Taiwan island, but in vain. Taiwan has gone from a natural barrier of Qing dynasty to Japan's bridgehead of expansion after Japan acquiring Ryukyu Islands. In the scope of a larger geostrategic picture, Taiwan is also located in the rimland of the East Asia inner sea, the so-called Asiatic Mediterranean, which is described by Nicholas John Spykman's book , The Geography of the Peace (1944), as Formosa. Spykman provided the insight that it is the rimland that the real struggle for mastery has taken place since the great naval battle in Asia-Pacific ocean during World War II happened largely in the inner sea. Halford John Mackinder also modified his earlier Heartland Theory and published an article The round world and the winning of the peace in 1943 Foreign Affairs to emphasize the importance of rimlands and marginal seas. The Third Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1996 and the 1997 Asian financial crisis show that the safety, security and stability of Taiwan does affect the steadiness of the East Asia region. The PRC's attitude towards Taiwan also reflects the need of security for mainland China to compete with the United States.  Values  After political transition from one party authoritarian to modern democracy, there are now multiple parties participating in competitive campaigns in local and national elections in Taiwan, including but not limited to municipal mayors and the president of Taiwan. The economy of Taiwan is highly dependent on foreign trade utilizing the sea lane. = International Environmental Partnership = In April 2014, the was founded in Taipei, Taiwan by Environmental Protection Administration Taiwan, with founding partner from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to address the following environmental challenges: * expanding mercury monitoring * air quality protection * managing electronic waste * establish eco-campus school partnership between U.S. and Taiwan * support Global Environmental Education Partnership = Global Cooperation and Training Framework = is held by American Institute in Taiwan and for broader U.S.-Taiwan cooperation, which allow Taiwan to engage in the Asia Pacific region and the world with the United States. The GCTF cooperation address issues on international humanitarian assistance, public health, environmental protection, energy, technology, education and regional development. The Framework is a milestone for Taiwan to transform from an international aid recipient to an aid provider.  Technology  American Institute in Taiwan cohost with Japan to open GCTF on Network Security and emerging technologies, which is a multilateral platform for Taiwan to cooperate with Japan, Chile, Mexico, Federal Communications Commission and United States Department of Homeland Security experts and law enforcements, including endorsing the Prague Proposal of 5G network security.  Democracy  American Institute in Taiwan cohost with Taiwan Foundation for Democracy to open GCTF on Defending Democracy through Media Literacy. National Security Strategy (United States) describes a geopolitical competition between free and repressive visions of governance is being played out in Taiwan and United States. There are foreign actors using social media to interfere elections in United States. Taiwan is also on the frontlines to marshal academic, policy, and technical resources to confront external pressures. Second GCTF on media literacy discuss the implementation of media literacy education in curriculums and how governments and private enterprises can cooperate to combat disinformation, among other challenges.  Challenges  To People's Liberation Army Navy's naval planners, the control of Taiwan has strategic value, as a gateway to the Pacific ocean. Taiwan should synchronize security interests with the United States in current context, including President Obama's Asia rebalancing strategy and President Trump's \\"free and open Indo- Pacific\\" strategy. The minimum defense requirement for Taiwan is to withstand the first wave of PRC attack before the U.S. assistance. It is also critical for Taiwan to build a consensus on how to deal with China.

His mother explains to Marko and his brother Petor that they should look for the pig. Finally, they find it and play with it for a while. Then it is Petor turn to take care of the pig. However, the pig runs away again. Petor is not able to find it again. While searching for the pig, the boys are distracted by a wedding and other events, such as finding a secret cave. When Petor and Marko finally arrive home after a long day, the pig is already there. It has gone back there on its own.

The book has been translated into many different languages, including English and German. In 1962, the book was first published in Sweden by Rab√©n & Sj√∂gren. Marko Lives in Yugoslavia is one of the few books in the series that has not been published in Israel, where the books were very successful. The reason for this was that in the story was about a pig, that is embraced in the photos by Marko, which is considered in Judaism as not kosher. During her eleven-year correspondence with Louise Hartung, which was published the book Jag har ocks√• levat! Astrid Lindgren wrote about the book. She explained that Anna Rikwin and the Yugoslav Legation wanted to take photos in Dalmatia. On September 27, 1960 Lindgren traveled to Yugoslavia, where she first made holidays with Louise Hartung, before she met up with Anna Riwkin on October 4, 1960 to create the photo book. First, the photo book should take place in Lovran, later Riwkin decided to relocate it to Macedonia, as this still has something of the \\"original Balkan\\". When Lindgren left Macedonia, however, Riwkin had barely begun with the book.Astrid Lindgren and Louise Hartung (2016): Jag har ocks√• levat!. Rab√©n & Sj√∂gren After completing the series, Lindgren explained that while working with Riwkin-Brick was nice, she did not like the books, especially Marko Lives in Yugoslavia. She was not dissatisfied with the photos of Riwkin-Brick, but rather with her own performance as a writer.

Early life  Liddle was born at Hatches Creek, his mother's country, in the Davenport Ranges of Central Australia to Milton and Polly (Ngwarie) Liddle in 1940. In 1942, when he was a toddler, the family moved to Alice Springs, although they did regularly visit his family's cattle station Angas Downs Station (now Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area). As an Aboriginal family, they were subject to regular inspection and, at risk of the children being taken farther away, they were forced to make the decision to have the children live away: the government considered Liddle and his siblings \\"5\\\\8 caste\\". Because of this, Tony and his siblings boarded at the convent and, from 1951 - 1956, St. Mary's Hostel, an institution for half-caste children, and they attended Hartley Street School during the day. Liddle has said that he was luckier than other children living at St. Mary's as he was not a ward in the same way and he was able to visit his family during the school holidays.  Working life  After finishing school, in 1956, Liddle spent a year working in a stock camp at Alcoota Station before getting his truck driver's licence in his father's Morris Commercial. Starting in 1928 Liddle worked for his father in the families small wood cutting and carrying business, alongside his brothers Bob and Mick. The business grew and they were soon delivering rations and fuel to many remote communities, and what were then, government settlements throughout the region. Liddle fondly remembers delivering water to Albert Namatjira. Liddle left his fathers business and worked for Rosewall Construction and worked to extend the airstrip at the hospital. However, in late 1960 Liddle started working for Len Tuit running tours from 'the chalet' in Alice Springs to Palm Valley and the, short-lived tourist enterprise (pioneered by Tuit), Serpentine Lodge. Liddle was a well liked tour guide and \\"the passengers loved his personality and dedication to the job\\". Liddle gave up driving tours in 1992 and worked driving and operating machinery for Ingkerreke, outstation resource services, for 13 years before retiring, at age 65, in 2005.  Later life  Since retiring Liddle has shared his story of growing up as a part of a large, well-known, Central Australian Aboriginal family and show how involved Aboriginal people have been in all industries in Central Australia; especially the cattle industry where his family had being involved since the early 1900s. Liddle speaks about this regularly and is quoted as saying: > \\"All the Aboriginal people in the cattle industry worked like hell until > equal pay came through and they were pushed off the stations. That wasn‚Äôt so > much the case in the government settlements, where people were sitting > around. If they‚Äôd educated these people properly, the town would be a lot > different today\\". In 2014 Liddle was inducted into the Shell Rimula Wall of Fame at ReUnion at the National Road Transport Hall of Fame.

Every day she feeds the two elephants, Babette and Lona, with apples. Every day Lilibet plays with her boyfriend Leo. They feel sorry for the tigers and the monkeys, who should not sit in cages but belong in the jungle. Leo would like to release the animals, but unfortunately, he has no say in the circus. Lilibet wants to become a circus rider. But Leo keeps telling her that she can not do that. Although Lilibet practices riding horses every day, she is confused by Leo's statements. The clown Teddy Ballon believes in Lilibet. He gives Lilibet a magic rope and explains that Lilibet can become a circus rider when she puts the magic rope around the tail of a horse and says hocus pocus Fidibus. Lilibet does that. However, she can not convince Leo that she will be a good horse rider. Lilibet is sad and is comforted by her father. He thinks that she will become a great circus rider. This convinces Lilibet. In the end she is standing on the back of a horse.  Overview  Lilibet, circus child is the fifth of 15 books from the series Children's Everywhere. The story is based on true events. However, some things have changed. The book has been translated into many different languages, including English, German, Hebrew and Dutch. Lilibet is the only story of the series told in a first-person narrative. Astrid Lindgren first established contact with the circus. Then she visited it and invited the circus children to her home, where she had a party. Anna Riwwkin was also present at the party.

The square's original name was Kyriakou. It was renamed Viktoria in honor of the Queen of the United Kingdom on the occasion of the annexation of the Ionian Islands to Greece in 1864, as a gift to the enthronement of the Queen's nephew, Prince Christian William Ferdinand Adolf George of Denmark, later George I of Greece. Underneath the square passes the Athens Electric Railway at the homonymous stop. The square crosses the streets of Hayden, 3 September and Aristotelous, and in the center of the square is the sculptural complex of Johannes Pfuhl (1846‚Äì1914) of Theseus saves Hippodamia. Around the square, the homonymous district has been developed. Since the 1940s the district has been one of Athens' best and most sought after, comparable to Kolonaki. On its streets you will find important examples of classical modernism, such as the Spathari block (Mavrommatia street), the Sarantopoulos block (27 Derigni street), as well as the buildings on Heiden 1 and 2. The luxurious apartments of these buildings were addressed to the bourgeoisie of Athens at the time, since they provided a variety of amenities and had high quality architectural elements. Gradually, the area began to decline, largely due to its abandonment by its original inhabitants. The neighborhood today is generally regarded as degraded and facing problems of crime. Of course, in recent years there has been an improvement in the situation around the square, which is also linked to the general upgrading of downtown Athens. Gradually the district regains the glory of the past.

It was designed by Charles Ponting and built in 1921. It has been a Grade II listed building since 1985. Today the church is used for occasional services, and is maintained by the Manger family trust. History St George's was erected as a chapel of ease to the Gillingham parish church of St Mary the Virgin. The idea of building a small church at Langham originated with Mr. Alfred T. Manger of Stock Hill House, who was aware of the inconvenient distance of the parish church for residents of Langham and its surrounding farmhouses and dwellings. He intended to erect a small church on his estate, but died in 1917 before his plans were realised. In accordance with his wishes, Mr. Manger was buried in a vault on the site of his intended church on 29 January 1917. The site was consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev. Frederick Ridgeway, prior to interment. With his death, the family of Mr. Manger announced their intention to build a church in his memory once World War I ended. The church, designed by the diocesan architect Charles Ponting, was built in 1921 over the tomb of Mr. Manger and his wife, who died in 1919. It was dedicated by the Archdeacon of Sherborne, the Right Rev. Albert Joscelyne on 22 May 1921. Lieutenant Colonel Charles Harwood Manger, the eldest son of Mr. Manger, had the church dedicated to Saint George, the patron saint of soldiers, in memory of his brother, Lieutenant John Kenneth Manger, cousin, Private George Bredin Kitson, and brother-in-law, Second Lieutenant Robert Lancaster, who all fell during World War I. Architecture St George's is built of coursed and squared rubble stone, with a thatched roof and bellcote at the west end, containing one bell. Designed to accommodate 40 persons, it is made up of a nave, apse, north transept and north porch. The original fittings and ornaments are largely of oak, including the lectern and altar. A marble slab in front of the altar marks the tomb of Mr. and Mrs. Manger.

It was created in 1881 as a General Deputies Convent (ADC) and received its current name in 1902. It goes back to the ideas associated with the founding of the native fraternetie () in Jena in the year 1815. The ideal goals are outlined in the motto \\"Honor - Freedom - Fatherland\\". Today German Burschenschaft is considered as a right-wing corps. This status was preceded by internal directional struggles from the 2000s onwards, in which the German nationalistic fraternities prevailed.Dachverband Deutscher Burschenschaften: Abschied von jeglicher Liberalit√§t, in: S√ºddeutsche Zeitung November 25, 2012; According to their own numbers, Deutsche Burschenschaft has 7.000 members in almost 70 fraternities.Deutscher Burschenschaft: Kurzportr√§t: √úberblick, at: German Burschenschaft, July 7, 2019; History In 1881, the \\"General Deputies Convent\\" (‚ÄúAllgemeiner Deputierten-Convent‚Äù) was founded by 35 fraternities in Eisenach, renamed \\"German Burschenschaft\\" in 1902. The members agreed on commonalities in general student and student affairs, but in a number of other matters the individual fraternities should decide for themselves. A recording of Austrian Burschenschaft was initially rejected for the reason that the association at that time \\"basically rejected the active participation in political issues\\" according to the statement on the website of Deutsche Burschenschaft. When in 1919 the Treaty of St. Germain was made and the unification of Germany and Austria into a Gro√üdeutsches Reich got impossible, the Deutsche Burschenschaft merged with the Austrian \\"\\". In its understanding, at least the Burschenschaften unite the German fatherland. In a number of participating Burschenschaften antisemitism was common; all members had to confess Christianity. Judaism was not seen as a religion, more as a ‚Äòrace‚Äô. Resulting from several disputes at the annual Burschentag (fraternity day) in 1920 it was established that membership was not open to Jews or descendants of Jews or people whose fian√©es had Jewish ancestors. In addition, many Burschenschafter were against the first German Republic, the so-called Weimarer Republik and they scattered to accept the defeat in the first world war.Judenfeindschaft und Antisemitismus bei Kaiser Wilhelm II. In 1996 some liberal-conservative Burschenschaften stepped out of Deutsche Burschenschaft and founded the ‚ÄúNew German Burschenschaft‚Äù. In 2011 there were a debate at Burschentag in Eisenach about a so-called ‚ÄúAriernachweis‚Äù for members. Two years later this proposal was secluded. Nevertheless, some associations left Deutsche Burschenschaft and the numbers of members were cut in half. Some of the Burschenschaften stepped into ‚ÄúNew German Burschenschaft‚Äù and some others founded in 2016 the ‚ÄúGeneral German Burschenschaft‚Äù. In 2014 the executive committee of German socialdemocratic party SPD made a \\"incompatibility decision\\". It forbids belonging to both the SPD and a fraternity, which is organized in the umbrella organization Deutsche Burschenschaft. SPD reacted to the ongoing radicalization of DB and the \\"increasingly nationalist and Greater German program\\". That is incompatible with the values of social democracy.SPD schlie√üt Mitgliedschaft in Partei und DB aus, in: Der Spiegel June 26, 2014; Traditionally there were two wings in the German Burschenschaft: conservative on one side and v√∂lkisch or extreme-right members on the other side. The newspaper tageszeitung wrote in 2018, that for a long time, DB had seen itself as \\"nonpartisan - from the CDU / CSU on the Republicans to the NPD\\". But when Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained strength in German Burschenschaft the right-winged members gained more influence. Especially the AfD-Youth Organization \\"Young Alternative\\" became attractive for fraternity members. According to an AfD-member of paralament of Nordrhein-Westfalia, about 20 percent of Young Alternative members are also organized in fraternities by 2018.

Since 2012, the former factory has been protected as an industrial monument (Byggnadsminne) in accordance with the provisions of the Swedish Cultural Heritage Act.  History  = Ryttaren Peat Factory = Ryttaren Peat Factory The construction of the Ryttaren Peat Factory began in the spring of 1906. At the same time the light rail track from the factory to the moor was built. On 7 May 1906, an order was placed at AB Wilhelm Sonesson & Co. for of transportable rail sections, plus five switches, 24 wheel sets with double track rings and a trolley. The agricultural scientist Nils Hartelius founded the Ryttaren peat stock corporation in Grimstorp in 1906. In the same year the factory was built next to the railway between Falk√∂ping and N√§ssj√∂ to extract peat from the Ryttaren moor. The peat was mainly used for animal bedding, dry toilets and packaging of fruit. The factory had three balers with an annual production capacity of 75,000 bales. During the high season, up to 200 people were employed in the factory and in the moor. Foreman Notary Karlsson was plant manager from the beginning until his retirement in 1938. The factory was bought in 1964 by Hasselfors Bruks AB to produce peat for horticulture. Peat cutting at Ljunghemsmossen finished in 1995, peat production ceased in 1997. = Light railway = The first line was built from the factory to the northeast, where it branched-off into two parallel tracks at a distance of to the northern part of the moor. The rail system was then gradually extended to cover the southern part of the bog. In 1947, a major overhaul of the main line was carried out. New sleepers were installed and the rails weighing 5 kg/m (10 lbs/yd) were replaced by those weighing 7 kg/m (14 lbs/yd). At the same time, one of the northern lines was dismantled. In 1953 and 1954 the track network was further extended by the construction of lines to the Ljunghem and Ekelund Bogs. The rail network had then its maximum extension. After the takeover of the plant by Hasselfors Bruks AB in 1964, the line was again significantly relaid. In 1985 the line to Ekelund Bog and the rest of the northern line were demolished. In autumn 1996 the demolition of the track to the Ljunghem Bog began. Two kilometres (1¬º miles) at the end of the line were lifted, before the demolition was stopped. Today, more than three kilometres (1‚Öû miles) of the line are still in good condition and can be used for tourist traffic. = Operation = The first section of the northern line No 1 was opened in 1906. Horses were used here from 1906 to 1913 and during the war. The railway embankment was partly reinforced with gravel so that the horses could walk on it. In 1913 a locomotive was bought from Varbergs Gjuteri och Mekaniska Verkstad. The locomotive was up for sale again in 1915. 1918 an 8 hp kerosene locomotive from Vara Mekaniska Verkstad followed, which cost 6295 crowns. It was sold in 1925 to Stockaryds Torvstr√∂ AB for 900 crowns. In 1924 an Austro- Daimler locomotive built in Vienna was put on the line. The petrol-driven locomotive#Motor Locomotive had 6 hp, cost 2650 crowns and was scrapped around 1940. Next came a locomotive from Berg & Co. Mek. Verkstad in Lindesberg (Bergbolagen, BB) in 1939. It had a small air-cooled petrol engine, which was replaced in the same year by a two-cylinder Pentamotor with transmission. In 1941 the locomotive was converted to electric operation. It was equipped with Tudor accumulators, an ASEA DC motor and a driver's cab. Due to the small radius of action, it was then only used for short distances. The locomotive was used until the 1960s and was scrapped. The chassis remained in Ryttaren until the mid-1980s, when it was transferred to the Fr√∂vi Industrial Railway Museum and used for building a steam locomotive. Locomotive 175/1943 was built by Sydsvenska Kraft in 1942 for the construction of a power station in Traryd by E. W. Lundstr√∂ms Mekaniska Verkstads AB (EWL) in Limhamn. After completion of the power plant construction, the locomotive was resold via the machine shop of L. H. Sandstr√∂m in M√•nsarp. In 1957, it was sold to the F√§lhult Peat Factory in √Ñlmhult. In 1983 AB Sejle Myr in K√§rraboda bought the machine, which came to Ryttaren in 2002. In F√§lhult the locomotive was equipped with a six-cylinder petrol engine from Volvo. In the meantime this was replaced by a Mercedes four-cylinder diesel engine. The locomotive is used for work trains only, as it is too light for passenger service. In the summer of 1948, a locomotive was borrowed from R√∂de Mosse Peat Factory in H√§rlingstorp. After a fire in the factory in 1947, the lost production of the previous year had to be made up. The locomotive was manufactured in 1917 by S√∂derbloms Gjuteri AB in Eskilstuna. It was equipped with a 10 hp kerosene engine. This was later replaced by a Chevrolet petrol engine. During the expansion of the rail network from 1953 to 1954, it turned out that the electric Bergbolagen locomotive was not sufficient for the long transports from the moors of Ljunghems and Ekelund. The purchase of a new locomotive became necessary. It was decided to build the locomotive under their own management. The order went to engineer M√•ns Hartelius. M√•ns was the brother of the former managing director of the peat factory, Hans Hartelius, and worked for Volvo in Gothenburg, where he was responsible for Volvo's military vehicle development programme. The chassis was built around a steel frame and fitted with an individual wheel suspension to ensure maximum tracking on the rails and thus avoid derailment. A two-cylinder Pentamotor was chosen as the drive source. Power was transmitted via an intermediate shaft. The V-belt of the engine drove a generator, which generates electricity for an electric motor. The power was transmitted from the electric motor via chains to the axles. This ensured smooth starting, jerk-free driving and stepless speed changes. The lubrication of all drive chains and the sanding of all wheelswas carried out via tubes from the driver's cab. Its generator was manufactured by ASEA and delivered a maximum output of 11.2 kW at 70 volts DC. The Pentamotor was replaced in 1968 by a 60 HP Volvo engine of type B16. The locomotive used as a service locomotive is called Harteliusloket.  Museum  The Ryttaren peat factory is an industrial monument from the early 1900s that can still be seen today. It has a factory, machine houses, workers' homes with farm buildings, sawmills and peat bogs. The Ryttaren peat factory has been run as an open-air museum by the F√∂reningen Ryttarens torvstr√∂fabrik association since 1999. In 2004 it was voted Industrial Monument of the Year by the Swedish Industrial Monuments Association (Svenska Industriminnesf√∂reningen). It was listed as Industrial Heritage Monument (Byggnadsminne) in 2012. The museum is open and the railway is operated on weekends in July and August and on the Torvens dag in September.

The film features Bhushan, Vidhya Mohan and Bose Venkat in lead roles, with Ramya, Ansiba Hassan, Scissor Manohar, Mahalingam Pollachi, Porur Sekar and Thangam playing supporting roles. The film, produced by S. M. Thiyagarajan, had musical score by R. Haribabu and was released on 30 July 2010. The film was remade in Malayalam as Bhagavathipuram (2011). Plot A few months ago in a remote village named Aaravadhu Vanam, the villagers strongly condemned inter-caste marriages and strictly followed the caste system. The village bigwig Dharma (Bose Venkat) wanted to marry his college- going relative Malar (Vidhya Mohan) whereas the ruffian Puli (Bhushan) who had no family carried out crimes wearing a lion mask. Malar became curious about Puli, she then fell in love with him and she even kissed him one day. One week before her marriage with Dharma, Malar declared her love to Puli and Puli scolded her for being senseless to fall in love with a wastrel with no future. The day of the marriage, she left the wedding hall and went on to meet Puli but Puli brought her back to the wedding hall. Malar's father and his henchmen insulted Puli. Consumed with anger, Puli changed his mind and he swore to marry her. The two ran away from the henchmen, and when they arrived in Chennai, Puli is stuck by a car. Malar admitted him to the hospital in Chennai and Dharma came to support her. Puli was diagnosed with mental illness and Malar took care of her at the hospital, but a year later, Puli vanished. Back to the present, Dharma is still in love with Malar and wants to marry her at any cost. Dharma was the one who put Puli in a random container lorry and he even corrupted a police officer to declare him as dead. Malar finally accepts to marry Dharma. In the meantime, Puli returns to his village and has a brutal fight with Dharma and his henchmen. Puli is eventually killed by Dharma and Dharma marries Malar the next day as he planned. Just after the marriage, Malar reveals to Dharma that she knows that he has killed her lover and she suddenly dies. Dharma then discovers that all the villagers are dead except him and he finds that their marriage food was poisoned. After this incident, Dharma became a lunatic and he lived alone in the empty village. The film ends with Dharma dying. Cast *Bhushan as Puli *Vidhya Mohan as Malar *Bose Venkat as Dharma *Ramya *Ansiba Hassan as Anu *Scissor Manohar as Krish *Mahalingam Pollachi as Mahalingam *Porur Sekar *Thangam as Thangam *Madurai Mohan *Chinrasu *Rajini Mani Production R. Bhuvanesh, an erstwhile assistant of directors K. Bhagyaraj and R. Parthiepan, made his directorial debut with Aaravadhu Vanam under the banner of MPG Films International. Kannada actor Bhushan, Vidhya Mohan from Kerala and Bose Venkat were selected to play the lead roles. The story is derived from the Mahabharata in which the sixth forest (Aaravadhu Vanam) was supposed to be the toughest for the Pandavas to go through and the battle was the bloodiest in the whole war when going through this passage. Aaravadhu Vanam is based on a real-life incident about the entire village community vacating their lands for the sake of a young couple in love. Director R. Bhuvanesh wanted to film Aaravadhu Vanam in the same village, but the couple didn't allow them to do so. Without any options left, the crew journeyed across various places and finally nailed down Singaram Palayam located near Coimbatore district. But again, the villagers were infuriated on the plea of filmmaker to vacate their lands for five whole days. As they were explained about the contextual scenario and script, the villagers changed their minds and heeded to their petitions. R. Haribabu, a former assistant to Srikanth Deva, had scored the music. Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed by film composer R. Haribabu. The soundtrack, released in 2009, features 6 tracks. A reviewer rated the album 1.5 out of 5 and said, \\"This album hobbles around Keeravani and Natabhairavi ragas so much so that you get a feeling of d√©j√† vu by the time you come to the fourth song\\".

The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1959. History Pakhusgaarden was built in 1797-98 for destiller Christen Johansen after the previous building at the site had been destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. The building survived the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807. Christian Johansen sold it to a pension fund, \\"Det stigende og arvelige Livrente Selskab for begge K√∏n\\". It then changed hands several times over the next few years. In 1808, it was acquired by shoemaker Christian Ferdinand Danielsen for 24,650 Danish rigsdaler. In 1810, he sold it to master mason Daniel B√∂hlig and Ignatius Erlewein. In 1811, they sold it to silk merchants Anders Kierkegaard and Niels Aabye. In 1813, it was acquired by master carpenter and mill builder Johan Henrik Breede ejendommen for 18,000 rigsdaler. In 1825, he opened an oil mill in the building complex. Unlike traditional stamp mills, it relied on leverage, eliminating noise and sparing the building of harmful shaking. He was granted a 10-year monopoly on employment of the technology. The building with its oil mill was in 1835 sold to merchant J√∏rgen Peter Bech for 30,000 rigsdaler. Thomas H. Erslev (1852-1930), a literary historian, was a resident in the building from 1838 to 1840. Poet and professor at the University of Copenhagen Christian Winther was a resident in the building in 1845. In 1852, Bech's heirs sold it to Anton Michael Nyholm. He closed the oil mill. Later that same year Nyholm sold the property to destiller Carl Frederik Lassen for 26,105 rigsdaler. In 1857, Lassen transferred the garden to the neighbouring property which he also owned. The remains of Sankt Peders Str√¶de 28 was in 1877 sold to the businessman Rasmus Frederik Schrader for DKK 62,000. In 1898,Schrader's widow sold it for DKK 55,000 to merchant J.F. Rasmussen. In 1907, Pakhusgaarden was acquired by A/S Import√∏ren. The company was then headquartered in the building for almost 70 years.

He worked primarily in matroid theory. Education and career Brylawski was born in 1944, and grew up in Washington D.C. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for his undergraduate degree, finishing with a bachelor of science in 1966. He then went on to Dartmouth College for his graduate work. He completed his PhD under the direction of Gian-Carlo Rota and Robert Norman in 1970. After his PhD, he moved to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where he spent the rest of his career. Brylawski was an editor for the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society from 1977 until 1989. Brylawski wrote 40 mathematical publications, and advised 6 PhD students. Work Brylawski's early work used ideas and tools from category theory to understand the Tutte polynomial of a matroid. Indeed, this idea already appeared in his thesis, which made constructions in matroid theory similar to the Grothendieck group. He developed similar ideas in two papers in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. Another influential early paper of Brylawski's, published in the same journal, described the influence of a modular element in the lattice of flats on the characteristic polynomial of a matroid. Brylawski also contributed expository chapters to several matroid theory books that appeared in the Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications series published by Cambridge University Press. The Tutte polynomial chapter (written jointly with James Oxley) has over 400 citations. In addition to his work in matroid theory, Brylawski also had an interest in mathematics in art, particularly in the role of symmetry in art. He gave lectures on mathematics in art on two occasions at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.. Awards and honors A memorial conference was held in honor of Brylawski in October 2008 at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and a special issue of the European Journal of Combinatorics in 2011 was dedicated as a tribute to the work of Brylawski.

According to a Blockade IMARC organiser, the aim of the blockade was to protest the mining companies \\"exploiting workers, dispossessing indigenous people and violating human rights\\". Prior to the blockade, the event was planned to be the \\"S11 but for climate\\". The blockade was attended by \\"more than 20 splinter groups\\". The police were criticised for their use of pepper spray against protestors, and former Greens senator Lee Rhiannon reported that she \\"witnessed a number of examples of police violence\\". Events On the 13th of August 2019, the Yarra City Council passed a resolution unanimously supporting the IMARC protest. On Tuesday the 29th of October 2019, the protests commenced. According to The Age, \\"Police pushed protesters down the stairs, used their batons on those who refused to follow orders and repelled the crowd with capsicum spray, while activists harassed mining delegates, spat on them and dragged them to the ground\\". A protestor named Camila was severely injured after being pushed by police onto the floor, where she was trampled by police horses. By the end of the first day, 47 protestors were arrested by police. The protest continued onto the following Wednesday. The police reportedly \\"used capsicum spray at least four times\\" and 17 protestors were arrested, one for climbing up the building to put up a banner \\"charged with conduct endangering life\\". On the 31st, the protestors moved to protest outside Rio Tinto and PwC's Melbourne offices. By the end of the final day, a total of 107 protesters had been arrested. Aftermath A day after the blockade completed, the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that the government would implement laws against \\"environmental groups targeting businesses or firms involved in the mining sector\\". On the 2nd of November 2019, ABC News reported that a Victorian Police officer was under investigation for having \\"EAD hippy\\" written on their body camera. The following day, a police officer was criticised for having \\"alt-right material\\" on their personal social media page after performing an OK gesture at the blockade, \\"a symbol frequently used by members of the far right\\".

Thus, this was the last Congress of the Soviets. The congress was attended by 2016 delegates with casting vote (including 419 women). By social composition: workers 42%, peasants 40%, employees 18%. Party affiliation of deputies: Communists 72%, non-partisan 28%. The delegates represented 63 nationalities and were representatives of the councils of all Soviet republics, elected according to the norms: from city councils ‚Äì 1 deputy from 25 thousand voters; from regional, provincial and republican congresses of councils ‚Äì 1 deputy from 125 thousand inhabitants. On the first day of the congress, Joseph Stalin made a keynote speech on the draft new constitution of the Soviet Union. His report contained an analysis of the fundamental changes in the life of the country that occurred from 1924 to 1936 and required the adoption of a new constitution. The congress initially took as a basis the draft constitution of the Soviet Union proposed by the Constitutional Commission. In order to establish the final text of the constitution, taking into account the amendments and additions proposed both during the 5-month public discussion and at the congress itself, an Editorial Committee was formed consisting of 220 people, chaired by Stalin. On December 5, 1936, at its 12th, last meeting, the congress unanimously approved the final text of the Constitution of the Soviet Union submitted by the Editorial Committee, which was in force until the adoption of the 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union. Molotov on November 29, 1936 at the 8th All-Union Congress of Soviets said: > We have no other feelings for the great German people, except for a sense of > friendship and true respect, but the Nazi gentlemen would best be attributed > to such a nation, a \\"nation\\" of a \\"higher order\\", which is called the > \\"nation\\" of modern cannibals.Extraordinary 8th All-Union Congress of > Soviets.

The regiment is the logistic unit of the Mechanized Brigade \\"Sassari\\" and was established on 1 November 2019. The regiment has been assigned the war flag of the Logistic Battalion \\"Cremona\\", which was stationed in Sardinia during the World War II.  Mission  The Logistic Regiment \\"Sassari\\" provides logistic autonomy through projectable and close-support logistics to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Sassari\\".  History  The establishment of a logistic unit for the Sassari brigade was advocated for by several Sardinian politicians and the raising of the unit began in March 2019. In June 2019, the Parliament authorized the establishment of the Logistic Regiment. The Regiment was declared operational on 1 November 2019 and on the 29 of the same month the regiment's troops took their oath in front of the newly arrived the war flag. = Logistic Battalion \\"Cremona\\" = On 1 November 2019 the Logistic Regiment \\"Sassari\\" received the war flag of the Logistic Battalion \\"Cremona\\", which had been formed on 1 November 1956 as Services Unit \\"Cremona\\" in Turin by merging the logistic and support units of the Infantry Division \\"Cremona\\". The Infantry Division \\"Cremona\\" descended from the World War II 44th Infantry Division \\"Cremona\\", which had been sent to Sardinia in March 1941. When Italy and Germany occupied Vichy France in Operation \\"Anton\\" after Allied troops had landed in French North Africa the division was ferried to Southern Corsica on 8 November 1942 and remained there until Italy switched sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943. From 9 September 1943 the Cremona fought the retreating German Sturmbrigade Reichsf√ºhrer SS and 90th Panzergrenadier Division and the Italian XII Paratroopers Battalion of the 184th Paratroopers Regiment, The Cremona division fought in Zonza and Quenza, pushing north to Golo river and Sorbo-Ocagnano. After the end of operations on Corsica the division returned to Sardinia. In September 1944 the division was reduced to two infantry (21st, 22nd) and one artillery regiment (7th), armed with British weapons and materiel and renamed Combat Group \\"Cremona\\". The Cremona entered the front on 12 January 1945 as part of the British V Corps and when allied forces achieved a major breakthrough during the 1945 spring offensive the Cremona advanced towards Venice and liberated the city on 30 April 1945. On 1 January 1972 the Services Unit \\"Cremona\\" was reformed as Services Grouping \\"Cremona\\" with a command platoon, a transport unit, a medical battalion, and a provisions supply company in Turin, and the Supply, Repairs, Recovery Unit \\"Cremona\\" in Venaria Reale. During the 1975 army reform the Infantry Division \\"Cremona\\" was reduced to Motorized Brigade \\"Cremona\\" and the services grouping was reformed as Logistic Battalion \\"Cremona\\", which received all the traditions of the preceding logistic, transport, medical, maintenance, and supply units of the Cremona divisions. The battalion was granted a war flag on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. Initially consisting of a command platoon, a supply and transport company, a medium workshop, and a field park the battalion was reorganized on 1 October 1981 and consisted from then until being disbanded of the following units: * 30px Battalion Command, in Turin ** Command and Services Company ** Supply Company ** Medium Transport Company ** Maintenance Company ** Medical (Reserve) Unit On 5 November 1996 the battalion was disbanded and parts of it were incorporated in the 1st Military Region Logistic Unit \\"Monviso\\". Afterwards the war flag of the Logistic Battalion \\"Cremona\\" was transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome, where it remained until 28 October 2019.  Current structure  Like all Italian Army logistic units the Logistic Regiment \\"Sassari\\" consists of: * 30px Regimental Command, in Cagliari ** Logistic Battalion *** Command *** Tactical Control Squad *** Supply Company *** Transport Company *** Maintenance Company ** Command and Logistic Support Company *** C3 Platoon *** Transport and Materiel Platoon *** Deployment Support Platoon *** Commissariat Platoon *** Garrison Support Unit The Regimental Command consists of the Commandant's and Personnel Office, the Operations, Training and Information Office, the Logistic Office, and the Administration Office.

Lockey writes that: \\"The saga's eclectic character is perhaps its most interesting feature, for it demonstrates that the author had wide access to a variety of foreign sources from which many of the motifs were culled.\\" The saga is also notable for its intertextual reference to M√∂ttuls saga (referred to as Skikkju saga) and its chastity testing cloak. Samsons saga fagra gives a history of the cloak before it reaches Arthur's court. In the first part of the saga, Samson falls in love with Valentina, an Irish princess.

The area gained national park status in 1957 with the designated area of including mountain massifs to both the east and west of the Brecon Beacons proper. The geology of the national park consists of a thick succession of sedimentary rocks laid down from the late Ordovician through the Silurian and Devonian to the late Carboniferous period. The rock sequence most closely associated with the park is the Old Red Sandstone from which most of its mountains are formed. The older parts of the succession, in the northwest, were folded and faulted during the Caledonian orogeny. Further faulting and folding, particularly in the south of the park is associated with the Variscan orogeny. The area was subject to glaciation during the Quaternary ice ages and periglacial processes and landslips have contributed further to the character of the modern landscape. Quarrying for limestone and sandstone were significant extractive industries in the past whilst tourism based in large part upon the perceived quality of the area's landscape is important for the modern economy. Ordovician Rock strata of Ordovician age is found in the extreme northwest of the area. The oldest rocks exposed at the surface are the Llanvirn age mudstones of the Abergwilli (sic) Formation. Also in this tract of country between Llandeilo and Llangadog are the hard and often pebbly sandstones of the overlying Ffairfach Grit Formation which form the low hill of Y Garn Goch. Above these are the thinly laminated sandstones of the Llandeilo Flags Formation succeeded in turn by the slumped beds of the Ashgillian Nantmel Mudstones, seen at Myddfai for example. Silurian Silurian rocks are found in the northwest of the park where a north-east to south-west aligned tract of country running (within the park) from Halfway southwest to Trap is known to geologists as the Myddfai Steep Belt and formed from a succession of sandstones and mudstones of Wenlockian, Ludlovian and Pridoli age. Beginning with the Tirabad Formation, the Wenlockian part comprises the Sawdde Sandstone, Ffinnant Sandstone and Halfway Farm formations. The Ludlow age part comprises the Hafod Fawr, Mynydd Myddfai Sandstone, Trichrug and Cae‚Äôr Mynach formations. There are occasional siltstone, ironstone and limestone units within this succession. Much of the park sits within the Anglo-Welsh basin which was active from late Silurian times through the Devonian to the early Carboniferous during which time it acquired a mix of sand, mud and silt which would eventually become the sandstones, mudstones and siltstones of the Old Red Sandstone, often contracted to ‚ÄòORS‚Äô. The base of the Old Red Sandstone has traditionally been defined at the base of the Tilestones Formation, a thin mica-rich sandstone at the Ludlow ‚Äì Pridoli boundary. It is overlain by around 700m thickness of mudstones and siltstones with occasional sandstone beds and calcretes known as the Raglan Mudstone Formation. An airfall volcanic ash deposit (tuff) up to 1m thick, the Townsend Tuff Bed, can be seen towards the top of this formation. The Raglan Mudstones also form the lower slopes of Pen-y-crug near Brecon and the lower ground in the Wye valley section of the park between Talgarth and Hay-on-Wye. In the east of the park, the formation is completed by a calcrete locally up to 10m thick and representing a long period of sub-aerial weathering at the end of the Pridoli. It was traditionally known as the Psammosteus Limestone (from a mis-identified fossil), then as the Bishop's Frome Limestone and most recently, having been correlated with similar strata in Pembrokeshire, as the Chapel Point Limestone Member. Devonian  The lower ORS is essentially detrital material eroded from the Caledonian Mountains to the north and west and deposited in this basin south of the orogen. Its deposition continued in the early Devonian and is present as the St Maughans, Senni and Brownstones formations. During the middle Devonian, the Acadian orogeny resulted in uplift, non-deposition and erosion such that the Upper ORS sits with a slight angular unconformity on the lower ORS, middle Devonian strata being missing in this region. Mudstones dominate the lower part of the sequence but sandstones came to be more prominent towards the top. Besides calcretes, other horizons which appear markedly different are the intraformational conglomerates which often stand out as steps within stream profiles due to their being relatively hard-wearing. The upper ORS is formed by deposition of materials associated with the start of the Variscan orogenic cycle.[pdf, p15] In the west and centre of the park, the Upper Old Red Sandstone consists of the Plateau Beds and the unconformably overlying Grey Grits Formation. The former provide the flat tops of peaks like Pen y Fan and Corn Du as well as other of the higher summits. Going east from Talybont-on- Usk the Plateau Beds are increasingly overlain by the sandstones of the Quartz Conglomerate Group until, as the Plateau Beds are cut out south of Llangynidr, the Quartz Conglomerate constitutes, in its outcrop along the southern side of the Usk valley, the entire upper ORS sequence in the east. It forms an isolated outlier at the very summit of the Sugar Loaf. Carboniferous  The park sits at the northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield basin which was active throughout the Carboniferous period. During much of this time, world sea levels were fluctuating as South polar icecaps grew and shrank in the course of the long drawn out Karoo glaciation. =Carboniferous limestone= A narrow outcrop of Carboniferous Limestone extends east-west across the southern part of the park from Blorenge in the east through Gilwern Hill, Mynydd Llangatwg, Mynydd Llangynidr, Cefn yr Ystrad, Cefn Cil Sanws and Moel Penderyn to Dinas Rock. West of here its outcrop is offset to the north by the Neath Disturbance as it wraps around the north of Waterfall Country through the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu national nature reserve to Cribarth and the Black Mountains. Both the thickness and details of the sequence vary from east to west with dolomites and palaeokarsts more common in the east. Outliers of the Carboniferous Limestone occur at Carreg Cennen where the castle is built atop a 100m cliff of the rock in what is otherwise ORS territory, and again at Pen Cerrig-calch north of Crickhowell in the east of the park. The limestone sequence here is notably thinner than that evident a few miles to the south in the main ‚Äònorth crop‚Äô. There are further outliers around Cwm Taf Fechan associated with faulting along the Neath Disturbance. =Marros group= The Marros Group is the modern name for the South Walian rock sequence traditionally referred to as the Millstone Grit Series. It consists of the Twrch Sandstone Formation (traditionally the ‚ÄòBasal Grit‚Äô), overlain by the Bishopston Mudstone Formation (traditionally the Middle Shale(s)). The latter contains numerous thin sandstones, some of which are named and which provide for notable features in the landscape of the park, e.g the Twelve Foot Sandstone. It is this rock over which the Afon Pyrddin falls to form Sgwd Gwladus. The Twrch Sandstone forms large expanses of often rough and poorly drained moorland from the southern slopes of the Black Mountain in the west to those of Cefn yr Ystrad and Mynydd Llangynidr further east. =South Wales coal measures= Small areas of coalfield rocks occur within the park. At the base of the succession is the Farewell Rock, the faulted outcrop of which occurs along the park‚Äôs southern margin. It forms the lip over which the Nant Llech drops to form Henrhyd Falls at Coelbren. Succeeding parts of the lower Coal Measures extend into the park in the Amman valley and the lower parts of the Giedd and Twrch valleys as at Henllys Vale as well as sections of the Tawe and Pyrddin valleys. Further east Coal Measures sandstones and mudstones form large parts of the upper surfaces of Mynydd Llangatwg and of the hills which now form a part of the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape World Heritage Site including Blorenge. Geological structures The area was at the southern margin of the Caledonian orogen and at the northern margin of the later Variscan orogen and hence displays in its geology, influences of both orogenies. Three lineaments in the landscape, each commonly referred to as a ‚Äòdisturbance‚Äô, arise from the earlier mountain-building period; two of these were reactivated during the later one. Each one is a mix of faults and folds along its length. Movement on each of these is considered to have been complex. The Myddfai Steep Belt marks the edge of the Palaeozoic Welsh Basin; rocks to its southeast are generally flat-lying to gently dipping to the south and southeast whereas those within it are steeply titled and to the north Caledonian folding is evident through mid Wales.To the southeast of this zone is the Carreg Cennen Disturbance which runs on Caledonoid lines from Pembrokeshire to the English border, passing through the northwest of the park and around the castle from which it derives its name. The Swansea Valley Disturbance runs from Swansea Bay to Herefordshire up the Swansea Valley into the park, through the NE-SW aligned ridge of Cribarth and on towards Brecon. It is responsible for the WSW-ENE alignment of a portion of the Wye Valley. At Cribarth, Variscan movement on this Caledonoid feature has given rise to a couple of folds in the limestone and overlying Twrch Sandstone from which the present landform has subsequently been carved, in part by glacial action. The southernmost lineament is the Neath Disturbance which runs ENE from Swansea Bay up the Vale of Neath and into the park at Pontneddfechan. The limestone is tightly folded here at Bwa Maen (Welsh: 'stone bow') and again at Moel Penderyn, through which it next passes. It passes beneath Pontsticill Reservoir, across the top of Dyffryn Crawnon and then down the shallow Onneu valley to Crickhowell. The erosion of the faulted rocks further ENE on this alignment has led to the valley which separates Sugar Loaf from the main Black Mountains massif and also for a WSW-ENE aligned section of the Monnow valley. Numerous normal faults are recorded traversing the park in a north-south to NW-SE direction, particularly within the Carboniferous outcrop. Many were syn- depositional as the Coalfield basin extended east-west during the Variscan orogeny. Certain of the faults form significant modern day features, the Henrhyd Fault being responsible for the waterfall of that name at Coelbren and another for the celebrated Sgwd yr Eira on the Hepste. Cenozoic era In places within the limestone and Twrch Sandstone outcrop are pockets of silica sand which are weathered forms of the otherwise tough Twrch Sandstone which may have been formed during the period. They have been exploited for brick- making at Penwyllt and on Carn Fadog amongst other places. =Karst landscape= Dissolution of the limestone has led to the development of a karst landscape along the outcrop of this rock and one of interstratal karst along the outcrop of the overlying Twrch Sandstone. The interstratal karst of Mynydd Llangynidr has been recognised as being of importance and designated as a geological site of special scientific interest. A large number of caves have developed, several of which rank amongst the longest in Britain. In the upper Swansea Valley is Ogof Ffynnon Ddu, Britain‚Äôs deepest cave with a vertical development of 274.5m whilst nearby is Dan yr Ogof, part of which is operated as a show cave. In the east of the park are the Ogof y Daren Cilau, Ogof Agen Allwedd and Ogof Draenen systems. Also of note, partly on account of their cultural associations, are the caves of Eglwys Faen and Chartist Cave. The former is situated at the rear of the in the Craig y Cilau national nature reserve and the latter is high on Mynydd Llangynidr. =Glacial legacy= The area has been subject to several glacial periods, of which the last, the Devensian finished 11,700 years ago. Glacial ice is thought to have covered the majority of the park at the height of the last glaciation around 22,000 years ago though some areas remained unglaciated with the highest peaks protruding above the ice as nunataks. Though terminal moraines lay largely outside of the park's boundaries, a number of recessional moraines have been identified. There are several cirque moraines which are thought to date from the Loch Lomond Stadial between 12,900 and 11,500 years ago. These include the features around Llyn y Fan Fach and Llyn Cwm Llwch, both of which lakes occupy glacially excavated rock hollows or cirques. Glacial erratics are common, the most obvious being those of Old Red Sandstone perched on various of the limestone pavements which lie to the south of the sandstone outcrops. Glacial striations and polish are also recorded, particularly from exposed surfaces of the Twrch Sandstone. =Mass movement= A number of landslides are recorded within the park. Amongst the more spectacular is that at Craig Cerrig- gleisiad. This L-shaped cwm was thought to be entirely glacial in origin until the 1990s but it is now recognised that a significant long runout landslide occurred here with the failure of the glacially over-steepened western wall of the cwm, some time after the main glacial but before the Loch Lomond Stadial. Some 'rucking' of slipped masses of bedrock appears on the hillside to the north of this feature, the result of a separate bedding plane slide. =Superficial deposits= Superficial deposits of various kinds have accumulated during the Quaternary period. Narrow strips of alluvium i.e. accumulations of clay, silt, sand and gravel, occur along the valley floors Fragmentary rock material, the product of weathering, known as head is recorded. Peat of variable depth is extensive. River terrace deposits are found in places. Economic geology Several different rocks and minerals have been quarried or mined in the area over the centuries though only one limestone quarry remains active within the national park. =Limestone = Abandoned quarries lie along the length of the limestone outcrop. Early quarrying was on a small scale for the production of lime for agricultural use and building. Innumerable small quarries and ruinous limekilns remain. Quarries increased in number and in scale as the ironworking industry developed during the nineteenth century. The tramroads linking the quarries with the iron works remain a notable feature in the landscape. =Silica rock and sand= Certain units within the Twrch Sandstone (formerly known as the Basal Grit) were found in the nineteenth century to be of sufficient purity to make the rock suitable for the manufacture of refractory bricks for lining furnaces. The silica rock mines at Dinas Rock were amongst the first in operation after William Weston Young patented the method of production and leased land their for the purpose of mining and processing. Silica rock was also quarried at Penwyllt, prior to a deposit of much more readily workable silica sand being discovered a couple of miles away. =Lead and zinc= Lead and zinc ores were mined on a small scale during the nineteenth century in the area around Myddfai. =Rottenstone= The Upper Limestone Shale has weathered at outcrop to produce a material known as rottenstone. It was quarried along its narrow outcrop during the nineteenth century for use as an industrial polish. =Building stone= Innumerable quarries have been opened in suitable sandstone units of the Old Red Sandstone as local sources of stone for constructing buildings and field walls. None are now licensed for extraction within the park. =Tilestones= Prior to slates from North Wales being widely available later in the nineteenth century, poorer quality roofing material was obtained locally by working the flaggier sandstones within the Old Red Sandstone, notably the mica-rich strata of the basal Tilestones Formation. Referred to informally as the ‚ÄòLong Quarry‚Äô (the origin of the ‚ÄòLong Quarry Formation‚Äô, an earlier name for this rock unit), the workings along the narrow linear outcrop can still be seen across Mynydd Bach Trecastell and Mynydd Myddfai and further west along the strike of this unit. Geological conservation and protection There are a number of national nature reserves (NNRs), sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) and special areas of conservation (SACs) within the national park. Whilst most have been designated on biological grounds, many have a geological component. Eleven of the 85 SSSIs within the park such as that covering Mynydd Llangynidr are primarily focused on geology with a further thirteen characterised as 'mixed' i.e. designated on both geological and biological grounds. There are also several dozen regionally important geodiversity sites (RIGS) established within the park. Tourism The western half of the national park was established as a Geopark in 2005 and is now a member of the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network. Fforest Fawr UNESCO Global Geopark aims to promote sustainable tourism within the area based upon the area's natural and cultural heritage. The world heritage site at Blaenavon straddles the national park's southeastern boundary; its focus is on the exploitation of the area's diverse geological resources and the economic and social changes wrought.

The ship was built by Schichau at Elbing in Prussia (now ElblƒÖg in Poland), and was completed in March 1903. The ship was torpedoed and sunk by the British submarine on 6 October 1914. Construction and design The S90-class consisted of 48 torpedo-boats, built between 1898 and 1907 by Schichau and Germaniawerft for the Imperial German Navy. They were larger than previous German torpedo-boats, allowing them to work effectively with the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea, while also being large enough to act as flotilla leader when necessary, thus eliminating the need for separate larger division boats. S116 was one of a group of six torpedo boats built by Schichau between 1902 and 1903. She was launched from Schichau's Elbing shipyard on 14 October 1902 and commissioned on 28 March 1903. S116 was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Three coal-fired Thornycroft three-drum water-tube boilers fed steam to 2 sets of 3-cylinder triple expansion steam engines rated at , giving a design speed of , with speeds of reached during sea trials. of coal was carried, giving a range of at . While the S90-class were of similar size to contemporary foreign torpedo-boat destroyers, the German navy saw their role as primarily torpedo attack against opposing fleets, rather than defending their own fleet against attack, so the ships had a lighter gun armament than British destroyers, and a lower silhouette to avoid detection during night attacks. S115 had a gun armament of three 5 cm SK L/40 guns in single mounts, while torpedo armament consisted of three single 450 mm torpedo tubes (one in a well deck between the raised forecastle and the bridge, with the remaining two tubes aft of the bridge. Two reload torpedoes were carried. The ship had a complement of 49 officers and men. Service In May 1904 S116 was part of the 6th Torpedo-boat Division of the 1st Torpedo-boat Flotilla, while in 1907, she was listed as part of the 8th Half-flotilla of the 2nd School Flotilla, remaining part of the 8th Half-Flotilla in 1908. In 1910, she was listed as part of the 9th Half-Flotilla of the 5th Torpedoboat Flotilla, remaining there until 1912. In 1913 S116 was fitted with new boilers. In 1914, S116 formed part of the 7th Half-Flotilla of the 4th Torpedo-boat Flotilla. S116 remained part of the 7th Half-Flotilla on the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. On 6 October 1914, S116 was on patrol off the western entrance to the river Ems with , when she was spotted by the British submarine , commanded by Max Horton, one of three submarines that had been deployed as part of an abortive operation by the Harwich Force against the German patrols off the Ems estuary. The submarines had already left base when the surface part of the operation had been cancelled. E9 fired two torpedoes at S116, one of which hit the torpedo boat, which broke in two and quickly sank. Nine of S116s crew were killed, with S117 and rescuing the survivors. E9 escaped successfully.

Early life  Dransfield was born in Naganjuk, Indonesia in 1939.  Education  Dransfield got her first degree in Plant Taxonomy from the Academy of Agriculture, Ciawi, Bogor in Indonesia. In 1975, she got her PhD in biology from the University of Reading in the UK, her thesis entitled Revision of Cymbopogon (Gramineae). Career Dransfield began her career as a staff member of Herbarium Bogoriense, Bogor in Indonesia. After completing her PhD, she went back to working at Bogor and continued working on bamboos. She moved to the UK in 1978 to continue her research on bamboo taxonomy including the generic delimitation of the Old World tropical bamboos. She writes on the account of bamboos from Malaysia, Thailand and Madagascar. Her appointment as an honorary research fellow at the Royal Botanic Garden was a recognition of her work on the bamboos. Together with her husband John Dransfield, she traveled to South East Asia and Madagascar. They presented their research on bamboos at the Plant Resources of South East Asia meeting in Jakarta. Dransfield's efforts resulted in the identification and description of forty two erect bamboo species. In 1993 and 1994, Dransfield collected specimens of Schizostachyum and Dinochloa from Luzon in Philippines which she used to study, revise and publish articles. This was a three-year project on bamboos ‚ÄúField guide for the identification of erect bamboos grown in the Philippines and helped collect materials for taxonomy and updated nomenclature. At the Kew Herbarium, her primary research is on the paleotropical bamboos.

She was murdered on March 8, 2018 by fellow student Orlando Tercero in his apartment off-campus. Tercero fled to Nicaragua after strangling Anderson, was captured by Nicaraguan police, and was ultimately convicted of femicide. This was the first of two unrelated student murders that took place during Binghamton University's 2018 spring semester; the second was the on-campus murder of Joao Souza.  Background  = Haley Anderson = Haley Anderson was from Westbury, New York, the daughter of Karen and Gordon Anderson and older sister to Madeline Anderson. In March 2018, she was twenty-two and a fifth-year senior. While attending Binghamton University, she worked at Jazzman's, an on-campus coffee shop, for over three years. She planned to graduate in May 2018 and had a job lined up at a Long Island emergency room. Friends described Anderson as hard working, friendly and compassionate with a love of music. = Orlando Tercero = In March 2018, Orlando Tercero was a twenty-two year old nursing student at Binghamton University. He holds dual Nicaraguan and American citizenship, and his full name is Orlando Enrique Tercero Moreno. = Prior relationship and tire slashing incident = Tercero was suspected of slashing Anderson's car's tires on September 16, 2017, causing about $600 in damage. The police report included some details about Tercero and Anderson's relationship: they had previously dated for a short period of time. Additionally, on September 15, 2017, Anderson attended a party at Tercero's residence where he confronted her about her new relationship with a mutual friend. According to the police report, the party confrontation went as follows: he shouted at her, then offered her alcohol in an attempt to smooth things over. Anderson declined to press charges over the tire slashing incident. Tercero and Anderson may have had an off-and-on relationship for up to a year and a half. She reportedly wanted to end romantic involvement with him. According to Anderson's friend, she wanted to stay friends with Tercero.  Murder and aftermath  = Murder and immediate aftermath = Tercero murdered Anderson by manual strangulation on March 8, 2018 at his Oak Street apartment on the West Side of Binghamton, a city in Broome County, New York. She was asphyxiated from manual neck compression, and ligature strangulation due to the necklace she was wearing. His motive for the murder was likely jealousy, as Anderson had moved on from dating him. Anderson visited Tercero's apartment after a night out with friends. She had been drinking, and was likely sleeping when Tercero attacked her. Surveillance footage showed Anderson and Tercero entering his apartment early in the morning of March 8, and Tercero leaving alone hours later. He drove to John F Kennedy International Airport and boarded a flight to Nicaragua. Tercero may have attempted to kill himself by hanging after killing Anderson but before leaving his apartment. Police found a note apologizing to his family at the scene. Tercero's sister called 9-1-1 after receiving a concerning text from him on the morning of March 9. Police performed a welfare check at Tercero's residence, but did not make contact with him and left. When Anderson did not return home, her roommates became concerned. On March 9 they tracked her phone to Tercero's apartment, broke in through a window, and found her body in Tercero's bed, with severe bruising on her neck and arms. They called 9-1-1, which brought the police to the apartment for a second time that day. Anderson's body was found by police on Friday, March 9 at 12:53 PM after they conducted a welfare check at Tercero's apartment. Her death was declared a homicide on Saturday, March 10 after an autopsy was conducted at Lourdes Hospital in Binghamton. Police released a statement that day: \\"The victim and male student had a previous domestic/romantic relationship. The investigation determined that the person of interest had left the United States by an international air travel flight, prior to the discovery of Haley Anderson‚Äôs deceased body.‚Äù On Sunday, March 11, Tercero was officially named as a suspect by the Binghamton Police Department, which also stated that Tercero fled to Nicaragua. The Broome County District Attorney, Steve Cornwell, \\"said his office will be seeking an indictment from a grand jury in the case, and after one is granted, will file a warrant for Tercero‚Äôs arrest. According to Cornwell, the warrant will be presented to the U.S. Department of State, and his office will call on the Nicaraguan government to extradite Tercero.\\" Monday classes were cancelled for senior nursing students in the wake of Anderson's death. Also on Monday, March 12, University President Harvey Stenger and Decker School of Nursing Dean Mario Ortiz released statements mourning Anderson's death and extending condolences to her friends and family. Tercero was apprehended by the Nicaraguan National Police on Tuesday, March 13 at the Hospital de Leon. He had entered the country on Friday, March 9 at 3:55 pm. Tercero attempted suicide after killing Anderson and was placed in a psychiatric hospital upon arrival in Nicaragua. After Tercero was arrested at the hospital, he was taken to the Directorate of Judicial Assistance, also known as El Chipote, in Managua. In Broome County on March 17, Tercero was charged with second-degree murder, which meant he could face up to life in prison if convicted. The Broome County District Attorney also officially released a warrant for Tercero's arrest. Additionally, District Attorney Cornwell publicly released the information that Anderson's roommates initially found her unresponsive in Tercero's Oak Street apartment. They were concerned about Anderson and searched for her; once they found her they called 9-1-1 which triggered the police's welfare check and investigation. = Trial, conviction, and extradition attempts = In Nicaragua, Tercero was charged with femicide, making his first court appearance in September 2019. Tercero was convicted of femicide and faced 25 to 30 years in a Nicaraguan prison. He was eventually sentenced to 30 years; his appeal to reduce his sentence was rejected in March 2020. He still faces a second-degree murder charge in Broome County, New York but there are complications with the legalities of extradition.

In purposeful activity, feedforward creates an expectation which the actor anticipates. When expected experience occurs, this provides confirmatory feedback. Etymology The term was developed by I. A. Richards when he participated in the 8th Macy conference. I. A. Richards was a literary critic with a particular interest in rhetoric. Pragmatics is a subfield within linguistics which focuses on the use of context to assist meaning. In the context of the Macy Conference, Richards remarked \\"Feedforward, as I see it, is the reciprocal, the necessary condition of what the cybernetics and automation people call 'feedback'.\\"Richards, I. A. (1952). Communication Between Men: The Meaning of Language. In Heinz von Foerster (ed), Transactions of 8th Macy Conference - Cybernetics: Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social System. New York: Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation. Richards subsequently continued: \\"The point is that feedforward is a needed prescription or plan for a feedback, to which the actual feedback may or may not confirm.\\" The term was picked up and developed by the cybernetics community. This enabled the word to then be introduced to more specific fields such as control systems, management, neural networks, cognitive studies and behavioural science. Different applications of feedforward =Control= Feed forward is a type of element or pathway within a control system. Feedforward control uses measurement of a disturbance input to control a manipulated input. This differs from feedback, which uses measurement of any output to control a manipulated input. =Management= Feedforward has been applied to the context of management. It often involves giving a pre-feedback to a person or an organization from which you are expecting a feedback. =Neural network= A feedforward neural network is a type of artificial neural network. =Behavioral and cognitive science= Feedforward is the concept of learning from the future concerning the desired behavior which the subject is encouraged to adopt.
