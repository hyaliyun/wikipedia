It urged oppressed workers to unite and organize against their oppressors, namely the State, the latifundista landowners, and the Church. It quickly took a hold amongst the long-exploited agricultural workers in Andalusia, who joined the CNT union or the more radical FAI and had some limited success in improving wages and working conditions. The establishment's attempts to stamp out such revolutionary zeal came to a tragic head in 1933 at Casas Viejas, now Benalup- Casas Viejas, in the Province of Cadiz. A small group of militants trying to resist arrest after a failed uprising barricaded themselves in a cottage, which was burned down with the anarchists and their families still inside. Soldiers and police then arrested anyone in the village who possessed a gun, marched them to the smoking ashes of the cottage and their dead colleagues, and shot them in the back. The massacre led to national outrage and there was considerable debate about whether the orders to kill had or had not been issued by the President of the Second Spanish Republic, Niceto Alcalá-Zamora. This was never proven, but it is believed to have contributed to his defeat in the following general election.

His collection became the core of the National Museum of the American Indian. Life and career Heye was the son of Carl Friederich Gustav Heye; and Marie Antoinette Lawrence of Hudson, New York. Carl was a German immigrant who earned his wealth in the petroleum industry. George graduated from Columbia School of Mines (now Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science) in 1896 with a degree in electrical engineering. While superintending railroad construction in Kingman, Arizona in 1897, he acquired a Navajo deerskin shirt, as his first artifact.. He acquired individual items until 1903, then he began collecting material in larger numbers. In 1901, he started a career in investment banking that lasted until 1909. In 1915, Heye worked with Frederick W. Hodge and George H. Pepper on the Nacoochee Mound in White County, Georgia. The work was done through the Heye Foundation, the Museum of the American Indian, and the Bureau of American Ethnology, and was some of the most complete work of the time including numerous photographs. In 1918, Heye and his colleagues published a report entitled The Nacoochee Mound In Georgia. He accumulated the largest private collection of Native American objects in the world. The collection was initially stored in Heye's Madison Avenue apartment in New York City, and later in a rented room. The Board of Trustees of the Heye Foundation in 1920; left to right: Minor Cooper Keith, James Bishop Ford, George Gustav Heye, Frederic Kimber Seward, F. Kingsbury Curtis, Samuel Riber, Jr., Archer Milton Huntington, and Harmon Washington Hendricks By 1908, he was referring to the collection as \\"The Heye Museum\\", and he was soon lending materials for exhibit at what later became the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Philadelphia.. In 1916, he purchased from J. E. Standley of Ye Olde Curiosity Shop the collection of Alaskan Native artifacts that had won the gold medal for ethnological collections at the 1909 Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition.. Eventually, the Heye collection was moved to the Heye Foundation's Museum of the American Indian at 155th Street and Broadway, which broke ground in May 1916.. In 1919, he established the journal Indian Notes and Monographs. The museum opened to the public in 1922,. and closed in 1994, when the Smithsonian Institution opened the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian in the former Custom House in Lower Manhattan. Heye died on January 20, 1957. He is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City. Museum of the American Indian Boy holding a very large Kwakiutl mask, Museum of the American Indian, circa 1920 Heye created the Museum of the American Indian in 1916 in New York City and was its director until 1956. His collection of Native American materials was gathered over a period of 45 years. This collection became the basis of the National Museum of the American Indian. The largest in the world, it contains over one million objects from Native Americans. It was transferred to the Smithsonian in 1989, and about a third of the original collection has been repatriated. Artifacts were once stored in the Bronx along the Interstate 95 corridor, until the land and building was sold, then cleared to make way for private housing.

Monuments and sights * Iglesia de Santa María del Valle :It is a baroque-style church dedicated to the patron of Alcalá. It was built between 17th and 18th century. The interior is divided into three naves separated by large archways. The facade has a stepped design with a bell tower and a clock. The church possessed different pieces of work, like La Tabla del Milagro, which was brought there during the reconstruction of Caños Santos and El Cristo de la Buena Muerte. *Ermita del Cristo de la Misericordia :This chapel is dedicated to Lord of Mercy. It is home to one of the brotherhoods, the \\"coloraos\\". It is considered as a place of worship for locals. *Grupo dolménico de la Dehesa del Tomillo The magnifique view over the village 281x281px Feria y Fiestas de San Roque :The megalith deposit is located in the north of the Dehesa del Tomillo. It has been excavated in 1983 by the Museo Provincial de Cádiz and is confirmed to have served burials during the catholic period before 2000 a. C. The dolmenic group indicates an early population in this part of the sierra gaditana. It consists of a group of three dolmens arranged in a circle with a monolithic entrance and can be related to other similar groups in the regions of Sevilla and Malaga. 278x278px This is the Iglesia de Santa María del Valle in Alcalá del Valle :The most outstanding object in this deposit is a menhir, a huge rock of sharp end placed vertically on a small tumulus of stones. This menhir is the only example of this type in the province of Cádiz. * Cortijo de La Cacería :At the municipal border, a little separated from the village, the Cortijo de La Cacería arises majestically. Its ancient appearance of a palace or a retreat can be explained by its former existence as residence of the marquis of Benamejí. The construction dates back to the XVI century. High walls are an example of precious stonework with volcanic rocks and stout masonry. The main courtyard is dominated by an impressive arcade. Above its pillars a second unit of arcs and double stairs is rising up. Today the Cortijo is mainly used to provide accommodation for mountain hunters. *Fuente Grande (Great Fountain) :This spring is known from the beginning of the Moorish settlement. Nowadays it is embellished and completely restored. Water from this source is natural and it flows through five pipes. :In the area of the Fuente Grande, there have been found the archaeological remains of the Roman era, demonstrating the existence of population in antiquity. Excavations are being carried out to determine the type of site, which appears to be a villa with annexes agricultural production and ceramics. *Monasterio de Caños Santos: :Caños Santos is a Convent-Monastery dating back to 16th century. It is situated only 6 kilometres from Alcalá and it offers views of the landscape. :The origins of the monastery of Caňos Santos are connected to the Celtic village of Caricus, which was reduced to a Visigoth hamlet. After the Islamic invasion its inhabitants hid an image of the virgin in the nearby mountains which was discovered in 1512 in the rocky cavity of a spring. A small chapel consecrated to Our Lady of Caňos Santos was built soon after and in the middle of the 16th century a monumental complex was built and it was inhabited by Franciscan friars due to the great devotion of the parishioners. Therefore, in its architecture there is a mixture of the original building and the renovations from the 17th and 18th centuries. :This convent building, under restoration with state and European funds, consists of a church of Baroque and mannerism style, and a cloister around which there are other buildings. The church tower stands out, erected on one side of the facade, as the best-preserved element. The stoned carved baptismal font that came from the old sanctuary and the polychrome high relief that depicts the discovery of the virgin in this place are also worthy of mention. :Declared a Bien de Interes Cultural (BIC), with the category of Monumental in 2001, the monumental building of Caňos Santos is located on a natural balcony with a grove of chestnut, elms and olive trees, and in its surroundings there is the cave where, according to the popular belief, the virgin who gives the name to the convent appeared in the springs.

It is about the famous French courtesan of that name, who lived under the reign of Louis XIII. The play was first performed in 1831 at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, but was later prohibited by King Charles X. Synopsis Act I Didier visits Marion de Lorme in her bedchamber. The Rendezous. The play opens in 1638, in Blois, in the bedchamber of Marion De Lorme. Marion, famous Parisian courtesan, left the capital two months prior, to the despair of her lovers and admirers, and took refuge in Blois. Pressed by Saverny, who found her, she confesses that she has an appointment with a man named Didier who does not know who she is, and she knows nothing of his identity. She urges Saverny to leave. Didier arrives and confesses his love to Marion; he pressures her to marry him, although he has no fortune and is a foundling without a family. To the despair of Didier, Marion hesitates, judging herself unworthy. But she seems ready to yield when Didier reveals what he thinks of Marion Delorme, the famous courtesan: : Do you know what Marion Delorme is? : A woman, of beautiful body and deformed heart! At this moment, shouts erupt from the alley. Saverny is attacked, and Didier rushes to help him, thereby earning the Marquis' thanks. Act II The Encounter. The scene is the door of a cabaret, where a group of gentlemen are exchanging news from Paris. They discuss the merit of the last pieces of Corneille, voice their hatred of the omnipresent and all-powerful Cardinal Richelieu, and the disappearance of Marion De Lorme. One of them related that she was last seen in Blois, relating the events of the first act, but she has since disappeared. A crier appears who proclaims an order of the king: duels are henceforth forbidden under pain of death. Didier arrives at the cabaret, and a quarrel sparks between him and Saverny (who did not recognize him). They begin a duel, quickly interrupted by the entry of Marion, who screams and alerts the guard. Saverny, to save himself, feigns death. Didier is arrested. Act III The Comedians. The scene is the château de Genlis. Saverny enters, incognito, who related to the judge Laffemas the story of his own death. But during the conversation, Saverny learns that the man he fought with was Didier and that it was Marion's lover who saved his life. Shortly afterwards, Laffemas receives a letter announcing the escape of Didier, probably accompanied by Marion. He goes after them. Marion and Didier enter. They have hidden themselves among a troupe of traveling comedians and are given roles. Didier is desperate to flee with Marion, and asks her again to marry him. Marion is spotted by Savergny, who passes the information to Laffemas. He realizes that the fugitive he seeks must be among the actors. Didier discovers that the woman he loves is none other than Marion de Lorme, the courtesan. Revolted, he denounces himself to Laffemas, who arrests him. Saverny, in an attempt to save Didier, unmasks himself, but he is arrested too. Act IV The King. The scene opens in the guard room of Chambord Castle. Laffemas attempts to seduce Marion, but is refused. Marion determines to rely upon the king. Louis XIII enters, furious with Cardinal Richelieu who ousted him from power. Marion and the Marquis de Nangis (Saverny's uncle) plead for a royal pardon for the two convicts. But the king is intractable; he refuses to oppose the cardinal. Left alone with the king, L'Angély, his jester, tries to persuade the King by convincing him that the two convicts are falconers (the king is keen on hunting). At his insistence, the king, weak and undecided, relents to pardon the two men, and Marion departs with the pardon in hand. Act V The Cardinal. The scene is the dungeon of Beaugency. Marion, bearing royal pardon, arrives to have Dider released; but the royal pardon has been revoked by the cardinal. Confronted with Laffemas, she finally gives in, and agrees to prostitute himself to him in exchange for Didier's freedom. The thing done, she enters the courtyard where Didier and Saverny are awaiting death, but Didier, still angry and revolted because he guesses what she had to do to get there, refuses to follow her. The guards arrive to escort them away. At the last moment, Didier confesses his love to Marion, who forgives him and asks for forgiveness. The condemned march towards torture. Marion remains alone on stage, and sees the litter of the cardinal, who has just been present at the execution. Film adaptations In 1912 a short silent film was made directed by Albert Capellani. In 1918 a second feature-length film Marion Delorme was produced, directed by Henry Krauss and starring Pierre Renoir and Jean Worms.

According to the 2006 census, the town has a population of 5,633 inhabitants. Alcalá de los Gazules is situated in the Sierra de Cádiz. Although not officially one of the pueblos blancos, Alcalá is still listed, since 1984, as having Artistic-Historic status.  History  Alcalá de los Gazules was first populated by the Romans in CE189 and supplied them with food, oil, wine, and metal. During Roman occupation, the city was known as Lascuta. As the Roman empire weakened, the Vandals moved in and renamed the area Valdalusia but they lasted only twenty years, 409–429. They were followed by the Visigoths who left behind the impressive tower, the Mesa de Esparragal. For many years until the Catholic Ferdinand and Isabella took control, at the end of the 15th century of the last Muslim kingdom in the south of Spain, there was a demarcation line between the Islamic and Christian regions, along which sat towns that are now known as the pueblos blancos, the white towns, and Alcalá was on the border. Many of these towns were fortified and Alcalá has a number of towers around its perimeter, now fallen into disrepair. Following the Catholic consolidation in Spain, many mosques were knocked down and in Alcalá, the famous church of San Jorge in the top square was built in the mid-16th century on top of the ruins of the old mosque. During the Peninsular Wars in 1809 a mounted militia from Alcalá made a successful ambush on some nearby French troops. A year later General Manbourg's troops took revenge by cutting the throats of the entire population and blowing up the castle.

Demographics Monuments Mezquita, the Mosque 10th century The Mezquita The Mezquita was built from a visigothic basilica from the 5th century, reusing its materials, and is one of the few surviving Spanish rural mosques. It is an oddly-shaped building, made of brick and stone in a trapezoid shape, probably because of the hilly terrain. The oration room has 5 naves, whose arches, like in the Mezquita in Cordoba, are perpendicular to Qibla. The central nave is wider than the 2 nearby, which are in turn wider than the 2 outer naves. The sections of the South flank are wider than the others, suggesting a T shape. The Mihrab has lost its paint, and looks quite archaic; only the brick and stone is visible. To the North is the Alminar Square. The mosque probably only had one entrance, in the northernmost section of the second nave from the East. What little light it would have had would have come in via the patio, the door and 3 narrow or small windows, 2 to the left of the Mihrab and 2 to its right. In the oration room, 16 undated tombs were found. When Spain became Christian, many changes were made, including the addition of a central axis in accordance with the new religion. The old door and the North flank were also reconstructed. Despite these changes, the whole building still retains a rustic charm.

Mithatpaşa Primary School (1920s) for girls during Ottoman Empire. Phanar Greek Orthodox College is a Greek minority school was founded in Ottoman Empire in 1454. After the foundation of the Turkish republic the organization of the Ministry of Education gradually developed and was reorganized with the Law no 2287 issued in 1933. The Ministry changed its names several times. It fell under the Ministry of Culture (1935–1941 and was named Ministry of National Education, Youth, and Sports (1983–1989). Since then it is called the Ministry of National Education. Before the Republic, education institutions were far from having a national character. Schools were organized in three separate channels which were vertical institutions independent of each other. The first and the most common in this organization were the district schools and madrasas based on the teaching of the Quran the Arabian language and memorizing, the second were the Reform schools and high schools supporting innovation and the third were the colleges and minority schools with foreign language education. The Law of Integration of Education, no 430 was issued on 3 March 1924. With this law, the three separate channels were combined, the first one was closed, the second was developed and the third one was taken under the inspection and monitoring of the Ministry of Education. One of its aims was to apply secularism in the area of education. By the law for the Education Organization no 789 issued on 22 March 1926 the Ministry of National Education was given responsibility for defining the degrees and equalities of the public and private schools already opened or to be opened by a ministry other than the Ministry of National Education. This Law brought new arrangements such as \\"no school can be opened in Turkey without the permission and agreement of the Ministry of National Education\\" or \\"curricula shall be prepared by the Ministry of National Education\\". The vocational-technical education institutions formerly directed by local governments were put under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education. In 1923–24, there were in Turkey, slightly more than 7,000 secondary school students, almost 3,000 high school students, some 2,000 technical school students and officially 18,000 medrese students of whom 6,000 are claimed to be actual students and the rest who registered to be excluded from military service.Feriha Özkan, Atatürk’ün Laiklik Anlayışının Eğitim Sistemimizdeki Yansımaları (1919–1938), Dumlupınar Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Enstitüsü Yüksek Lisans Tezi, Kütahya, 2006 The population of Turkey was at that moment some 13–14 million.

In July 2017, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government presented a new curriculum for schools, inter alia removing evolution theory and adding the concept of jihad as part of Islamic law in books. \\"But what is this jihad? What our Prophet [Muhammad] says is that while returning from a war, we are going from a small jihad to a big jihad. What is this big jihad? It is to serve our society, to increase welfare, to ensure peace in society, to serve the society’s needs. The easiest thing is to wage war, to fight. The skill is the difficult one, which is to ensure peace and tranquility,” he said. Education ministry also adds that “Jihad is an element in our religion; it is in our religion… The duty of the Education Ministry is to teach every concept deservedly, in a correct way. It is also our job to correct things that are wrongly perceived, seen or taught.” The chairman of a teachers’ union described the changes as \\"a huge step in the wrong direction for Turkey’s schools and an attempt to avoid raising generations who ask questions,\\" adding that \\"the new policies that ban the teaching of evolution and requiring all schools to have a prayer room, these actions destroy the principle of secularism and the scientific principles of education.\\" Pre-primary education Pre-primary education includes the optional education of children between 36–72-month who are under the age of compulsory primary education. Pre-Primary education institutions, independent nurseries are opened as nursery classes and practical classes within formal and non-formal education institutions with suitable physical capacity. Services related to Pre-Primary education are given by nurseries, kindergartens, practical classes opened first and foremost by the Ministry of National Education and by day-centers, nursery schools, day care houses, child care houses and child care institutions opened by various ministries and institutions for care or education purposes based on the provisions of ten laws, two statutes and ten regulations. In the academic year 2001–2002, 256,400 children were being educated and 14,500 teachers were employed in 10,500 Pre-Primary education institutions.Taken from the Education Statistics by the Ministry of Education for 2002; accessed on 3 November 2012 Primary education Namik Kemal Lisesi in Izmir. Primary school () lasts 4 years. Primary education covers the education and teaching directed to children between 6–14, is compulsory for all citizens, boys or girls, and is given free of charge in public schools. Primary education institutions are schools that provide eight years of uninterrupted education, at the end of which graduates receive a primary education diploma. The first four years of the Primary School is sometimes referred to as \\"First School, 1. Level\\" () but both are correct. There are four core subjects at First, Second and Third Grades which are; Turkish, Maths, Hayat Bilgisi (literally meaning \\"Life Knowledge\\") and Foreign Language. At Fourth Grade, \\"Hayat Bilgisi\\" is replaced by Science and Social Studies. The foreign language taught at schools changes from school to school. The most common one is English, while some schools teach German, French or Spanish instead of English. Some private schools teach two foreign languages at the same time. Earlier the term \\"middle school\\" (tr: orta okul) was used for the three years education to follow the then compulsory five years at \\"First School\\" (tr: ilk okul). Now the second four years of primary education are sometimes referred to as \\"First School, 2. Level\\" () but both are correct. Already primary schools may be public or private schools. Public Schools are free but Private Schools' admission fees change from school to school. Foreign languages taught at Private Schools are usually at a higher level than at Public Schools for most Private Schools prefer hiring native speakers as teachers. There are five core subjects at sixth and seventh grades; Turkish, maths, science, social studies and foreign language. At eighth grade, social studies is replaced by \\"Turkish History of Revolution and Kemalism\\" (tr: T.C. İnkılap Tarihi ve Atatürkçülük). In the academic year 2001–2002, 10.3 million students were being educated and 375,500 teachers were employed in 34,900 schools. Secondary education Robert College in Istanbul Beşiktaş Anatolian High School in Istanbul Istanbul High School (Istanbul Erkek Lisesi in Turkish) was founded in 1886. Getronagan Armenian High School is a private Armenian minority school founded in 1884. In 2001, the school had 182 students. Secondary education includes all of the general, vocational and technical education institutions that provide at least three years of education after primary school. The system for being accepted to a high school changes almost every year. Sometimes private schools have different exams, sometimes there are 3 exams for 3 years, sometimes there's only one exam but it is calculated differently, sometimes they only look at your school grades. Secondary education aims to give students a good level of common knowledge, and to prepare them for higher education, for a vocation, for life and for business in line with their interests, skills and abilities. In the academic year 2001–2002 2.3 million students were being educated and 134,800 teachers were employed in 6,000 education institutions. General secondary education covers the education of children between 15–17 for at least three years after primary education. General secondary education includes high schools, foreign language teaching high schools, Anatolian High Schools, high schools of science, Anatolia teacher training high schools, and Anatolia fine arts high schools. Vocational and technical secondary education involves the institutions that both raise students as manpower in business and other professional areas, prepare them for higher education and meet the objectives of general secondary education. Vocational and technical secondary education includes technical education schools for boys, technical education schools for girls, trade and tourism schools, religious education schools, multi-program high schools, special education schools, private education schools and health education schools. Secondary education is often referred as high school education, since the schools are called lyceum (tr: lise). In public high schools and vocational high schools, students attend six classes each day, which last for approximately 40 minutes each. In Anatolian high schools and private high schools, the daily programme is typically longer, up to eight classes each day, also including a lunch period. All 9th graders are taught the same classes nationwide, with minor differences in certain cases. These classes are: Turkish language, Turkish literature, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geometry, world history, geography, religion & ethics, physical education, a foreign language (in most cases English), a second foreign language (most commonly German but could be French, Italian, Japanese, Arabic, Russian, or Chinese). When students enter the 11th grade, they typically choose one of four tracks: Turkish language–mathematics, science, social sciences, and foreign languages. In vocational high schools, no tracks are offered, while in science high schools only the science tracks are offered. Different schools may have different policies; some, but not many, schools offer electives instead of academic tracks, giving students a wider range of options. For the 10th, 11th and 12th grade, the compulsory courses are: Turkish language, Turkish literature, republican history, and propaganda. In addition to that, students may be taught the following classes, depending on the track they choose and/or the high school they attend: mathematics, geometry, statistics, physics, biology, chemistry, geography, philosophy, psychology, sociology, economy, logic, arts and music, traffic and health, computer, physical education, first and second foreign language. The students used to be given a diploma for the academic track they had chosen, which gave them an advantage if they wanted to pursue their higher education in the corresponding fields, as the University Entrance Exam scores were weighted according to the student's track. (e.g. A science student would have an advantage over a Turkish-Mathematics student when applying for Medicine). As of the 2010–2011 educational year, all high school students are given the standard high school diploma. At the end of high school, following the 12th grade, students take a high school finishing examination and they are required to pass this in order to take the University Entrance Exam and continue their studies at a university. There are four score types for different academic fields, including but not limited to: *Turkish language–mathematics: international relations, law, education, psychology, economy, business management, and similar. *Science: engineering, computer science, medicine, and other science-related professions. *Social sciences: history, geography, and education. *Foreign languages: language/linguistics and language teaching. International education Trakya University in Edirne. The International Baccalaureate has been available in Turkey since 1994 when the first school was authorized by the IB and 53 schools now offer one or more of the IB programmes. Vocational education A vocational high school for textile in Şile, Istanbul. Haydarpaşa campus of Marmara University, originally the Imperial College of Medicine (Mekteb-i Tıbbiye-i Şahane), Istanbul. Vocational and technical secondary education involves the institutions that both raise students as manpower in business and other professional areas, prepare them for higher education and meet the objectives of general secondary education. Vocational and technical secondary education includes technical education schools for boys, technical education schools for girls, trade and tourism schools, religious education schools, multi-program high schools, special education schools, private education schools and health education schools. In the academic year 2001–2002, 821,900 students were being educated and 66,100 teachers were employed in 3,400 vocational and technical secondary education schools. According to Article 37 of Vocational Education Lhiaw no 3308, the Ministry of National Education is organizing vocational courses in order to prepare the people who have left the formal education system and do not possess the qualifications required for employment for any vacant positions in the business sector. Based on apprenticeship training programs, the Ministry of National Education pays the insurance premiums against occupational accidents, sicknesses during the vocational period and other sicknesses of participants attending courses in relation to their occupation. These participants may take experienced apprenticeship exams after the education they have received and the work they have performed are evaluated according to the Regulations for Evaluating the Certificates and Diplomas in Apprenticeship and Vocational Training. People who work in the 109 branches mentioned in Law no 3308, have finished primary education and are below the age of 14 may receive training as candidate apprentices or apprentices. Law no 4702 gives apprenticeship training opportunity to those over 19. The period of apprentice training changes between 2–4 years depending on the nature of vocations. Adolescents who have not attended the formal education system or left the system at any stage may take the experienced apprenticeship exam after 1 year of adaptation training, provided they had reached the age of 16 at the date when the said profession was included in the coverage of law. Those at the age of 18 may directly take the experienced apprenticeship exam, if a certificate is provided to prove that he/she is working in the related profession. Those who graduate from vocational and technical secondary education institutions or from vocational and technical schools and institutions may take proficiency exam in their own professions. Graduates of technical high school or of 4-year programs in vocational and technical schools and institutions are given a certificate to start businesses with the privileges and responsibilities of a proficiency certificate. In 2001, 248,400 apprentices were being educated and 5,100 teachers were employed in 345 vocational training centers. The new system: 4+4+4 In March 2012 the Grand National Assembly passed new legislation on primary and secondary education usually termed as \\"4+4+4\\" (4 years primary education, first level, 4 years primary education, second level and 4 years secondary education). Children will begin their primary education in the first month of September following their sixth birthdays and will come to a close during the school year in which students turn 14 years old.See an article in English Sabah of 31 March 2012 Modern Turkey’s new liberal education system; accessed on 4 November 2012 The primary education stages, which includes the first two stages of four years' education each, will entail four years of mandatory elementary education, followed by an additional mandatory four years of middle school education, in which students will be able to choose whether they want to study at a general education middle school or a religious vocational middle school, which are referred to as Imam Hatip schools. The new legislation includes the reopening of Imam Hatip middle schools. Primary education establishments will be set up separately as independent elementary schools and middle schools.

Higher education includes all levels of institutions giving education past the secondary school level for a period of at least 17 years.2002 report of the Ministry for Education on Higher Education; accessed 3 November 2012 Higher education institutions include: * Universities * Faculties * Institutes * Higher education schools * Vocational higher education schools * Conservatories * Application and research centers In the academic year 2001–2002 there were 76 universities, 53 of which belonged to the state and 23 to foundations. In these institutions 66,700 personnel were working, 63,000 in state universities and 3,700 in others. After the national university entrance examination organized by the national examing body students, if they succeed, continue with their studies at a university. Foreign students take the Yös exam or provide equivalent credentials approved by the Higher Education Council (YÖK). Universities provide either two or four years of education for undergraduate studies, while graduate programs last a minimum of two years. Some universities also ask for an additional year of English preparatory study to be completed before the start of studies, unless an exemption examination is passed. There are around 820 higher education institutions including universities with a total student enrollment of over 1 million. Tertiary education is the responsibility of the Higher Education Council, and funding is provided by the state for public institutions that make up the bulk of the tertiary education system. There are 167 universities in Turkey, which are classified as either public or foundational (private) and 373,353 students were graduated from these universities in 2006. Public universities typically charge very low fees while private foundation universities are highly expensive with fees that can reach $30,000 per annum. Since 1998, universities have been given greater autonomy and were encouraged to raise funds through partnerships with industry. The quality of education at the Turkish universities varies greatly, some providing education and facilities on par with internationally renowned schools (the technical universities are often compared with universities in the United States, and are regularly visited by the US Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology and their engineering programs deemed substantially equivalent to comparable programs in the US. Turkish universities actively participate in the Socrates – Erasmus program of the European Commission, aiming to increase student and academician mobility within the European Union, the European Economic Area countries, and other EU candidate states. An increasing number of Turkish university students complete a part of their studies abroad at other participating countries' universities, and Turkish universities receive students of the same status from abroad. With the passage of law 2547, the rectors of all the public universities are appointed jointly by the faculty, Higher Education Council and the President of Turkey. The former president, Abdullah Gül, suggested that the system might be changed to eliminate the Higher Education Council and political influence. Research The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) coordinates basic and applied research and development, acting on proposed policies by the Turkish Academy of Sciences (TÜBA). There are more than 60 research institutes and organizations. Turkey's R&D; strengths include agriculture, forestry, health, biotechnology, nuclear technologies, minerals, materials, IT, and defence. Private schools Galatasaray High School entrance at Istiklal Avenue. In the Turkish education system, private schools may be grouped into four. * Private Turkish schools: In these schools, which are opened by real or corporate bodies of Turkish nationality, public education programs at pre- primary, primary and secondary education levels are given. * Private schools for minorities: These have been established in the Ottoman Empire period by Greek, Armenian and Jewish minorities and were placed under guarantee by the terms of the Lausanne Treaty. These schools are attended by students at pre- primary, primary and secondary education levels who belong to these minority classes and are of the Turkish nationality. * Private foreign schools: These are schools established during the Ottoman Empire by French, German, Italian, Austrian and American people who continue their activities under the terms of the Lausanne Treaty. Today these schools are attended by Turkish children. * Private international education institutions: They have been opened and are active as per the provisions in the amended article 5 of the Law no. 625.The Ministry of Education in 2002 Types of School; accessed on 3 November 2012 There are many dershane in cities. They will transform into academic high schools in 2015, as the new law requires. Religious education Robert College was founded in 1863 in Istanbul by Cyrus Haimlin and Christopher Robert. The school began its education program in the theology building of the American Missioners Commission. Today, the school is a secular leading-private school. Ince Minaret Medrese is a 13th-century medrese (Islamic school) located in Konya, now housing the Museum of Stone and Wood Art. Çifte Minareli Medrese is an architectural monument of the late Seljuk period in Erzurum. Built as a theological school a few years before 1265. Şemsi Pasha Mosque and medrese (Islamic school) was built by Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan in 1580, the most important architect of Ottoman Empire. De- establishment In 1927, all courses concerning religion were excluded from the curriculum of primary, secondary, and high schools on the basis that non- Muslims also live in Turkey. Between 1927 and 1949, religious instruction was not permitted in schools. In 1949, the Ministry of Education allowed a course on religion in 4th and 5th grades of primary school. Re-establishment In 1956, as a result of multi-party democracy, a new government was established. Being more sympathetic towards the religious sentiments of society, this new government introduced a religion course into secondary schools. This time, if the parents wanted to exempt their children from the course, they had to apply to the school with a written request. After nearly ten years, in 1967, the religion course was introduced to the 1st and 2nd grades of high school. Students, however, were enrolled for the course with the written request of their parents. In 1975, the course was extended to the third (last) grade of the high schools. And, finally, following the military coup in 1980, the religion course became schools was also constitutionally secured. The exact title of the course was, \\"The Culture of Religion and Knowledge of Ethics.\\" In 1985, the Institute for Creation Research, a United States creationist group, helped advise Turkey's education minister Vehbi Dinçerler on how to introduce creationism in high schools. Turkish academics have stated that the resulting ignorance of evolution led to Turkey coming last in a survey that measured knowledge of evolution in 34 industrialised nations. Currently, religious education courses begin at the 4th grade (age10) of primary school and continues throughout secondary and high schools. From the 4th to the 8th grade, classes consist of two hours per week. At the high school level, there is one hour of class per week Thus, a student who has graduated from high school receives 8 continuous years of religion courses. There are no fixed books for the course. Rather, each school decides which book to follow—provided that the book for each level is approved by the Ministry of Education. Nearly half of the content of these courses concerns religion and Islam (whom majority are Muslims) with remaining topics ranging from secularism to humanism and from ethical values to etiquette. The major world religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism are included in the content of the course. Foreign languages Galatasaray University and Galatasaray High School teaching in French. The most common foreign language is English, which in public schools is taught from 2nd grade (age 8) onwards through to the end of high school. In high school a second foreign language is introduced. However the number of lessons given in public schools is minimal compared to private schools, which begin teaching English in kindergarten, have two or three times as many English lessons in the timetable, and in many cases employ native speakers of English as teachers. In 2011 the Ministry of Education, under pressure from the Prime Minister to improve the learning of English in Turkey, announced that the approach to language would be thoroughly revised, part of which would include a plan to hire 40,000 foreigners as language assistants in public schools. As a result of the poor standards achieved by the public system many students take an intensive English language \\"prep year\\" when entering university. These are offered by both state and private universities throughout Turkey. In 2012, the Ministry of Education included Kurdish (based on both Kurmanji and Zazaki dialects) to the academic programme of the basic schools as optional classes from the fifth year on. Later, the Ministry of Education also included Abkhaz, Adyghe, Standard Georgian, and Laz languages in 2013, and Albanian as well as Bosnian languages in February 2017. In 2015, the Ministry of Education announced that as of the 2016-17 academic year, Arabic courses (as a second language) will be offered to students in elementary school starting in second grade. The Arabic courses will be offered as an elective language course like German, French and English. According to a prepared curriculum, second and third graders will start learning Arabic by listening-comprehension and speaking, while introduction to writing will join these skills in fourth grade and after fifth grade students will start learning the language in all its four basic skills.Al-Monitor: Turks divided over plans to introduce Arabic-language teaching, 2 November 2015, Retrieved 25 September 2018.Hürriyet Daily News: Arabic to be offered as second language in Turkish elementary schools, 23 October 2015, Retrieved 25 September 2018.

Project HARP's assets were then given to the newly formed SRC. The main facility of SRC was , straddling the Canada–United States border between Highwater, Quebec, and Jay, Vermont. Affiliated companies included SRCQ (SRC Quebec), Shefford Electronics Corp (SEC) Granby, Quebec, SRCI, Paragon, PRB (Belgian corporation), and SRCB (SRC Belgium). Background In 1965, McGill University sponsored the Aeroballistic Laboratory (alternately the McGill Aeroballistic Test Center) at Highwater, Quebec. Dr. Gerald Bull was the Director. The manager was R.C. Stacey. Artillery exports During the next decade, SRC worked for a number of governments including the People's Republic of China, Chile, Taiwan, and especially South Africa, and SRC contracted with the South African company Armscor. SRC's main product was a modification of the NATO- and U.S.-standard 155.4 mm (6\\") artillery cannon, the GC-45 howitzer (\\"GC\\" stood for \\"Gun, Canada\\", 45 for 45-calibre long), firing either NATO-standard 155 mm M107 rounds, or, more typically, a new shell of Bull's own design. The new \\"pointy\\" shell, designated ERFB (for extended range full bore), offered considerably better aerodynamics than the original; its spin was moderated by fins on the shell rather than only by rifling in the barrel, and the round was supported in the gun barrel by four aerodynamic nubs allowing the middle of the shell to be elongated and thus reduce drag. The shell was initially spun in the same way as conventional artillery rounds with a driving band towards the base. The result was a gun that could out-range the original by as much as 30%, while at the same time being much more accurate. Standard NATO and US artillery of the time had a range of less than while the GC-45, ERFB combination had a range of . With the innovative base-bleed system developed in Sweden this range could be increased to without loss of accuracy. South African connection The GC-45 work was paid for by the South Africans, but it has been claimed that Bull did the work largely at the urging of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) who considered South Africa as a defence against Soviet operations in Angola. Used in South Africa as the G5 howitzer, the new guns were used near the Angolan border in 1986 when South Africa invaded the former Portuguese colony of Angola, in order to assist UNITA. Because the Marxist government of Angola was aided by Cuban troops and Soviet artillery, it was also suggested that the CIA had encouraged the South Africans to invade the country in 1975 at the beginning of the Angolan Civil War. The G5 howitzers were instrumental in securing success in Angola, although wider strategic considerations led to South Africa's eventual withdrawal. Arms embargo Although the 1977 United Nations mandatory arms embargo prohibited the export of arms to South Africa, Bull's SRC supplied the apartheid regime with gun barrels and 30,000 shells, worth more than $30 million. Due to the ANC support by the Soviet Union, the CIA were said to have encouraged the deal and the shipment on the MV Tugelaland was with the co-operation of Israeli Military Industries. U.S. Customs initially considered prosecuting as many as 15 people involved but decided to indict just Bull and his partner, Rogers Gregory. Bull pleaded guilty, expecting a fine, but was angered when during 1980 he was imprisoned for four months. The effect of his guilty plea meant that the court did not hear any evidence of the suspected U.S. government collusion concerning these arms exports to South Africa. As a result of the arms embargo violation, however, SRC was liquidated. The company was subsequently re-incorporated in Brussels where Bull managed it for several years. He was murdered during 1990, it is commonly conjectured by MOSSAD. Gun development After the Canadian site was abandoned, a cannon was found there measuring in length, surmised to be the longest in the world.  Footnotes  References * Adams, James.

His research focuses on the role of the Vatican, Swiss authorities and the government of Argentina in organizing 'ratlines', escape routes for Nazi criminals and collaborators. Personal life Goñi was born in Washington, D.C. in 1953 and was raised in the US, Argentina, Mexico, and Ireland. Since 1975 he has lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Article on Goni's background at the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation website. Investigations Drawing on investigations in Argentine, Swiss, American, British, and Belgian government archives, as well as numerous interviews and other sources, Goñi's conclusions are detailed extensively in The Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Perón's Argentina and several follow-up books. He also wrote an article for The Guardian in which scientific testing on a skull fragment put into question the authenticity of mainstream accounts of the death of Adolf Hitler. Goñi is also well known for his reporting on the crimes of Argentina's 1976–83 military dictatorship while he worked at the Buenos Aires Herald newspaper during those years, and as a witness in two of the trials against former officers of the dictatorship. Repercussions The Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Perón's Argentina, originally published in London in 2002 and since then translated into Spanish, Italian, Slovenian, Portuguese and German, has had wide repercussions in those countries through which Nazi criminals and their collaborators passed in their escape, especially in Italy, the Netherlands and Argentina.As documented in the books English review at PAIDOS books. Following publication of the book in Italy, a group of parliamentarians in Rome demanded that Prime Minister Berlusconi open an investigation into the passage of Nazis through their country.He Vows to Press for Return of Suspected Nazi Criminal: A Berlusconi Bid to Polish Image? (New York Times June 17, 1994) In Milan, SS criminal Erich Priebke, sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the Ardeatine Caves Massacre of 1944, sought a court injunction against the Italian translation of Goñi's book, demanding 50,000 euros in damages. He was turned down on both counts, although he had already won a series of judicial cases against media stories about him. In Genoa, archbishop Tarcisio Bertone distributed 50,000 copies of a \\"Special Edition\\" of \\"Settimanale Cattolico\\" (\\"Catholic Weekly\\") announcing the creation of a special commission of inquiry to investigate Goñi's revelations regarding the role of the Genoese curia in aiding the flight of Nazi war criminals through the port city. In the Netherlands, KLM opened an internal investigation following the book's unearthing of documents regarding the use of the airline by Nazi officers after the war.KLM accused (May 8, 2007 - The Times Online website) In Argentina, President Néstor Kirchner ordered the repeal of a secret directive of 1938 prohibiting Argentine diplomats from granting visas to Jews fleeing from the Holocaust in Europe. This was the first official admission by the Argentine government of the anti-Semitism that marked the country's immigration policies during and after World War II. Goñi's book also caused previously secret files relating to the entry of Croatian and other war criminals to Argentina to be released. Other works Goñi writes for The New York Times, The New York Review of Books, The Guardian, and TIME. He has also written for various publications in Argentina.Uki's journalistics (on the journalisted.com website) He is also the author of two previous books in Spanish, El infiltrado, la verdadera historia de Alfredo Astiz, regarding crimes committed by Argentina's 1976–83 military dictatorship, and Perón y los alemanes, on wartime links between Berlin and Buenos Aires.Books by Uki Goñi Music Uki Goñi is also a musician.Interview with Uki Goñi (Interview in the daily Clarín about Uki Goñi's musical work) He formed his first band (Space Age Serenity) while growing up in Dublin, Ireland.

Two lines represent a country's respective internal (employment vs. unemployment) and external (current account deficit vs. current account surplus) balance with the axes representing relative domestic costs and the country's fiscal deficit. The diagram is used to evaluate the changes to the economy that result from policies that either affect domestic expenditure or the relative demand for foreign and domestic goods.  Mechanism  When there is a BOP disequilibrium, either by the market forces or policy measures for readjustments, SWAN model is helpful. Internal Balance looks forward to acquiring full employment with lowest possible inflation, whereas External Balance looks towards a \\"No surplus - No deficit\\" position in the economy. Any point above the internal balance line (or curve) would have inflation, and any point below it would have unemployment. Similarly, any point above the external balance line (or curve) would depict a surplus, and any point below it would depict a deficit scenario. To cure the Inflation, we would use Contractionary monetary policy which would lower it down and bring the economy to an equilibrium point. To curtail Unemployment, we would use Expansionary monetary policy which would do the same as above. In order to cure the Current account deficit in the economy, we need to increase the exports by a devaluation, that would, in turn, help in increasing the employment by creating more jobs. For Current account surplus, we would overvalue the currency so that the exports are diminished. The zone above the equilibrium point (the V - shaped) is called the \\"Critical Zone\\" because the problem there would be very close to equilibrium. So a policy measure might just worsen the condition by taking, the economy, past the equilibrium point.

He played in the NFL from 1957 to 1969 and is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Early years Born in Emporia, Virginia, Jordan graduated in 1953 from Warwick High School, Newport News,VA in 1953. He played college football at the University of Virginia, where he was the captain of the football team as a senior. Jordan was also an All-American wrestler, the ACC champion and NCAA runner-up in 1957. He was a member of the Beta chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity at UVA. NFL career Jordan was selected in the fifth round of the 1957 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns, who traded him two years later to the Green Bay Packers in Vince Lombardi's first season for a fourth round draft choice. At Green Bay, Jordan was elected to four Pro Bowls (1960, 1961, 1963, and 1966), and he was the Pro Bowl MVP in 1961. Jordan was All-NFL seven times, and he was a defensive leader on a Green Bay Packers team that won five of six NFL title games in eight seasons and won the first two Super Bowls. A tenacious competitor on the field, Jordan was the vibrant and jovial wit among Lombardi's Packers, and was highly regarded by his teammates. Highly quotable, his outgoing personality put him in demand as an after-dinner speaker. Most notably: “Lombardi treats us all the same, like dogs.” After football Jordan retired at age 35 in February 1970, after an injury-filled 1969 season. In 1970, Jordan relocated south to Milwaukee to create and oversee Summerfest. In 1974, Jordan was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In 1975, Jordan was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. In 1977, seven years after leaving Green Bay, Jordan died at age 42 of a heart attack after jogging on February 21, 1977. Jordan's funeral was held in the Zion Episcopal Church in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, and he is buried in La Belle Cemetery. He is survived by his wife Olive, and three children: Henry Jr., Theresa, and Suzanne. In 1995, Henry Jordan was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was represented in the coin toss ceremony at Super Bowl XXIX by former teammate Ray Nitschke, who was also named to the NFL's 75th Anniversary team. The ceremony brought together former NFL stars of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, with surviving members of that year's Hall of Fame class representing the latter decade (one of them, then-Congressman Steve Largent flipped the coin on their behalf). In 2000, the Warwick High School athletics field (Newport News, VA) was named in his honor. In May 2009, he was named to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches and administrators who contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia.

Nexon, \\"Whence Causal Mechanisms? A Comment on Legro\\" in Dialogue IO Vol. 1, 2002 Development Nicholas Onuf is usually credited with coining the term \\"constructivism\\" to describe theories that stress the socially constructed character of international relations. Contemporary constructivist theory traces its roots to pioneering work not only by Onuf, but also by Hayward R. Alker, Jr., Richard K. Ashley, Martha Finnemore, Friedrich Kratochwil, John Ruggie, and Christian Reus-Smit. Nevertheless, Alexander Wendt is the best- known advocate of social constructivism in the field of international relations. Wendt’s 1992 article \\"Anarchy is What States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics\\" published in International Organization laid the theoretical groundwork for challenging what he considered to be a flaw shared by both neorealists and neoliberal institutionalists, namely, a commitment to a (crude) form of materialism. By attempting to show that even such a core realist concept as \\"power politics\\" is socially constructed—that is, not given by nature and hence, capable of being transformed by human practice—Wendt opened the way for a generation of international relations scholars to pursue work in a wide range of issues from a constructivist perspective. Wendt further developed these ideas in his central work, Social Theory of International Politics (1999). Since the late 1980s and early 1990s, constructivism has become one of the major schools of thought within international relations. John Ruggie and Christian Reus- Smit\\"http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/theories-of-international-relations- scott-burchill/?isb=978023036222\\" have identified several strands of constructivism. On the one hand, there are constructivist scholars such as Martha Finnemore, Kathryn Sikkink, Peter Katzenstein, Elizabeth Kier, and Alexander Wendt, whose work has been widely accepted within the mainstream IR community and has generated vibrant scholarly discussions among realists, liberals, institutionalists, and constructivists. On the other hand, there are radical constructivists who take discourse and linguistics more seriously. Theory Constructivism primarily seeks to demonstrate how core aspects of international relations are, contrary to the assumptions of neorealism and neoliberalism, socially constructed, that is, they are given their form by ongoing processes of social practice and interaction. Alexander Wendt calls two increasingly accepted basic tenets of Constructivism \\"that the structures of human association are determined primarily by shared ideas rather than material forces, and that the identities and interests of purposive actors are constructed by these shared ideas rather than given by nature\\".Alexander Wendt, Social Theory of International Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.1 Constructivists must be counted among those scholars who conceive research as a matter of interpretation rather than explanation. Moreover, they have a substantial skepticism about the possibility of having a neutral attitude towards research. In the study of national security, the emphasis is on the conditioning that culture and identity exert on security policies and related behaviors. Identities are necessary in order to ensure at least some minimal level of predictability and order, as Hopf asserts in his studies. The object of the constructivist discourse can be conceived as the arrival, a fundamental factor in the field of international relations, of the recent debate on epistemology, the sociology of knowledge, the agent/structure relationship, and the ontological status of social facts. The notion that international relations are not only affected by power politics, but also by ideas, is shared by writers who describe themselves as constructivist theorists. According to this view, the fundamental structures of international politics are social rather than strictly material. This leads to social constructivists to argue that changes in the nature of social interaction between states can bring a fundamental shift towards greater international security. Challenging realism During constructivism's formative period neorealism was the dominant discourse of international relations, thus much of constructivism's initial theoretical work challenged basic Neorealist assumptions. Neorealists are fundamentally causal structuralists, in that they hold that the majority of important content to international politics is explained by the structure of the international system, a position first advanced in Kenneth Waltz's Man, the State, and War and fully elucidated in his core text of Neorealism, Theory of International Politics. Specifically, international politics is primarily determined by the fact that the international system is anarchic – it lacks any overarching authority, instead it is composed of units (states) which are formally equal – they are all sovereign over their own territory. Such anarchy, Neorealists argue, forces States to act in certain ways, specifically, they can rely on no-one but themselves for security (they have to self-help). The way in which anarchy forces them to act in such ways, to defend their own self-interest in terms of power, neorealists argue, explains most of international politics. Because of this, Neorealists tend to disregard explanations of international politics at the \\"unit\\" or \\"state\\" level.Alexander Wendt, Social Theory of International Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp.8-15Chris Brown, Understanding International Relations (Basingstoke: Palgrave Publishing, 2005), pp.40-43 Kenneth Waltz attacked such a focus as being reductionist.Kenneth Waltz, Theory of International Politics (McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 1979) Constructivism, particularly in the formative work of Wendt, challenges this assumption by showing that the causal powers attributed to \\"structure\\" by neorealists are in fact not \\"given\\", but rest on the way in which structure is constructed by social practice. Removed from presumptions about the nature of the identities and interests of the actors in the system, and the meaning that social institutions (including anarchy) have for such actors, Wendt argues neorealism's \\"structure\\" reveals very little: \\"it does not predict whether two states will be friends or foes, will recognize each other's sovereignty, will have dynastic ties, will be revisionist or status quo powers, and so on\\".Alexander Wendt, \\"Anarchy is What States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics\\" in International Organization (46:2, Spring 1992), p. 396. Because such features of behavior are not explained by anarchy, and require instead the incorporation of evidence about the interests and identities held by key actors, Neorealism's focus on the material structure of the system (anarchy) is misplaced.Alexander Wendt, \\"Anarchy is What States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics\\" in International Organization (46:2, Spring 1992), pp. 396–399. Wendt goes further than this – arguing that because the way in which anarchy constrains states depends on the way in which states conceive of anarchy, and conceive of their own identities and interests, anarchy is not necessarily even a self-help system. It only forces states to self-help if they conform to neorealist assumptions about states as seeing security as a competitive, relative concept, where the gain of security for any one state means the loss of security for another. If states instead hold alternative conceptions of security, either \\"co- operative\\", where states can maximise their security without negatively affecting the security of another, or \\"collective\\" where states identify the security of other states as being valuable to themselves, anarchy will not lead to self-help at all.Alexander Wendt, \\"Anarchy is What States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics\\" in International Organization (46:2, Spring 1992), pp. 399–403. Neorealist conclusions, as such, depend entirely on unspoken and unquestioned assumptions about the way in which the meaning of social institutions are constructed by actors. Crucially, because Neorealists fail to recognize this dependence, they falsely assume that such meanings are unchangeable, and exclude the study of the processes of social construction which actually do the key explanatory work behind neorealist observations. As a criticism of neorealism and neoliberalism (which were the dominant strands of IR theory during the 1980s), constructivism tended to be lumped in with all approaches that criticized the so-called \\"neo-neo\\" debate. Constructivism has therefore often been conflated with critical theory. However, while constructivism may use aspects of critical theory and vice versa, the mainstream variants of constructivism are positivist. Identities and interests As constructivists reject neorealism's conclusions about the determining effect of anarchy on the behavior of international actors, and move away from neorealism's underlying materialism, they create the necessary room for the identities and interests of international actors to take a central place in theorising international relations. Now that actors are not simply governed by the imperatives of a self-help system, their identities and interests become important in analysing how they behave. Like the nature of the international system, constructivists see such identities and interests as not objectively grounded in material forces (such as dictates of the human nature that underpins classical realism) but the result of ideas and the social construction of such ideas. In other words, the meanings of ideas, objects, and actors are all given by social interaction. People give objects their meanings and can attach different meanings to different things. Martha Finnemore has been influential in examining the way in which international organizations are involved in these processes of the social construction of actor's perceptions of their interests.Stephen Walt writes on the back cover of Finnemore's book \\"Many writers have asserted that social structures assert a powerful impact on national preferences...but Finnemore is the first to present sophisticated evidence for this claim.\\" In National Interests In International Society, Finnemore attempts to \\"develop a systemic approach to understanding state interests and state behavior by investigating an international structure, not of power, but of meaning and social value\\".Martha Finnemore, National Interests In International Society (New York: Cornell University Press, 1996), p. 2. \\"Interests\\", she explains, \\"are not just 'out there' waiting to be discovered; they are constructed through social interaction\\". Finnemore provides three case studies of such construction – the creation of Science Bureaucracies in states due to the influence of the UNESCO, the role of the Red Cross in the Geneva Conventions and the World Bank's influence of attitudes to poverty. Studies of such processes are examples of the constructivist attitude towards state interests and identities. Such interests and identities are central determinants of state behaviour, as such studying their nature and their formation is integral in constructivist methodology to explaining the international system. But it is important to note that despite this refocus onto identities and interests—properties of states—constructivists are not necessarily wedded to focusing their analysis at the unit-level of international politics: the state. Constructivists such as Finnemore and Wendt both emphasize that while ideas and processes tend to explain the social construction of identities and interests, such ideas and processes form a structure of their own which impact upon international actors. Their central difference from neorealists is to see the structure of international politics in primarily ideational, rather than material, terms.Martha Finnemore, National Interests In International Society (New York: Cornell University Press, 1996), pp. 6-7.Alexander Wendt, Social Theory of International Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 29-33. Research areas Many constructivists analyse international relations by looking at goals, threats, fears, cultures, identities, and other elements of \\"social reality\\" as social facts. In an important edited volume, The Culture of National Security,The Culture of National Security (New York: Columbia University Press, 1996) constructivist scholars—including Elizabeth Kier, Jeffrey Legro, and Peter Katzenstein – challenged many realist assumptions about the dynamics of international politics, particularly in the context of military affairs. Thomas J. Biersteker and Cynthia WeberThomas J. Biersteker and Cynthia Weber, eds., State Sovereignty As Social Construct (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996) applied constructivist approaches to understand the evolution of state sovereignty as a central theme in international relations, and works by Rodney Bruce HallRodney Bruce Hall, National Collective Identity (New York: Columbia University Press, 1999) and Daniel PhilpottDaniel Philpott, Revolutions in Sovereignty: How Ideas Shaped Modern International Relations (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001). (among others) developed constructivist theories of major transformations in the dynamics of international politics. In international political economy, the application of constructivism has been less frequent. Notable examples of constructivist work in this area include Kathleen R. McNamara's study of European Monetary UnionKathleen R. McNamara, The Currency of Ideas: Monetary Politics in the European Union (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1999) and Mark Blyth's analysis of the rise of Reaganomics in the United States.Mark Blyth Great Transformations: Economic Ideas and Institutional Change in the Twentieth Century (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992) By focusing on how language and rhetoric are used to construct the social reality of the international system, constructivists are often seen as more optimistic about progress in international relations than versions of realism loyal to a purely materialist ontology, but a growing number of constructivists question the \\"liberal\\" character of constructivist thought and express greater sympathy for realist pessimism concerning the possibility of emancipation from power politics.Patrick Thaddeus Jackson, ed. \\"Bridging the Gap: Towards a Realist-Constructivist Dialogue\\" in International Studies Review vol. 6, 2004, pp. 337-352 Constructivists may fail to recognize that their focus on describing the emergence of shared norms not only vitiates the predictive value of their theory but also that it ignores the important role of deception in international relations.John Hickman. \\"International Relations and the Second Space Race Between the United States and China\\" in Astropolitics: The International Journal of Space Politics & Policy vol. 17, issue 3, 2019, pp. 178-190 Constructivism is often presented as an alternative to the two leading theories of international relations, realism and liberalism, but some maintain that it is not necessarily inconsistent with one or both.Andrew Moravscik, Taking Preferences Seriously: A Liberal Theory of International Politics\\" in International Organization vol. 51, 1997 Wendt shares some key assumptions with leading realist and neorealist scholars, such as the existence of anarchy and the centrality of states in the international system. However, Wendt renders anarchy in cultural rather than materialist terms; he also offers a sophisticated theoretical defense of the state-as- actor assumption in international relations theory. This is a contentious issue within segments of the IR community as some constructivists challenge Wendt on some of these assumptions (see, for example, exchanges in Review of International Studies, vol. 30, 2004). It has been argued that progress in IR theory will be achieved when Realism and Constructivism can be aligned or even synthesized.Cornelia Beyer, \\"Hegemony, Equilibrium and Counterpower: A Synthetic Approach\\", in International Relations vol 23:3, 2009Jennifer Sterling-Folker, Realism and the Constructivist Challenge: Rejecting, Reconstructing, or Rereading, International Studies Review, 4(1), pg. 73–97, 2002. An early example of such synthesis was Jennifer Sterling-Folker’s analysis of the United States’ international monetary policy following the Bretton Woods system. Sterling-Folker argued that the U.S. shift towards unilateralism is partially accounted for by realism’s emphasis of an anarchic system, but constructivism helps to account for important factors from the domestic or second level of analysis.Jennifer Sterling-Folker, Theories of International Cooperation and the Primacy of Anarchy: Explaining U.S. International Monetary Policy-Making after Bretton Wood, State University of New York Press, 2002. Recent developments A significant group of scholars who study processes of social construction self-consciously eschew the label \\"Constructivist\\". They argue that \\"mainstream\\" constructivism has abandoned many of the most important insights from linguistic turn and social- constructionist theory in the pursuit of respectability as a \\"scientific\\" approach to international relations.Maja Zehfuss, Constructivism in International Relations: The Politics of Reality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) Even some putatively \\"mainstream\\" constructivists, such as Jeffrey Checkel, have expressed concern that constructivists have gone too far in their efforts to build bridges with non-constructivist schools of thought.Jeffrey Checkel, “Social Constructivisms in Global and European Politics” in Review of International Studies Vol.30, 2004 A growing number of constructivists contend that current theories pay inadequate attention to the role of habitual and unreflective behavior in world politics.,Iver B.

As a result, in the early 1990s an estimated 60 percent of agricultural land was polluted by fertilizers and pesticides, two-thirds of rivers were polluted, and two-thirds of primary forests had been leveled. Although environmental awareness improved in the post-communist era, the state’s lack of administrative strength and fears of unemployment prevented the curtailment of many dangerous practices. For example, the four reactors of Bulgaria’s only nuclear power plant, the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, were declared unsafe in the early 1990s, but the first reactor closure occurred only in 2003. All four of the original VVER-440/230 reactors have since been shut down, with only the two newer VVER-1000 units still in operation. Because cleanup has been economically problematic in the post-communist era, in the mid-2000s Bulgaria still had grave environmental crises. Among them were air pollution from industrial emissions; the inability to filter effluents into rivers, leading to concentrations of untreated sewage, heavy metals, and detergents; severely depleted natural forest cover; forest damage from air pollution and resulting acid rain; and soil contamination by heavy metals resulting from improper industrial waste disposal. In the 1990s and early 2000s, a rapid increase in motor vehicles using leaded fuel exacerbated urban air pollution. The agency responsible for protection against all forms of environmental pollution is the Ministry of Environment and Water. The prospect of membership in the European Union (EU) is expected to raise Bulgaria’s environmental standards.

Geography Kořenov is situated in the Jizera Mountains, a range of the Sudetes, near the well-known winter sports centre Harrachov. Parts of it are a protected landscape area. The municipality was established in 1960 by the merger of the former market towns of Polubný and Příchovice with Rejdice and Jizerka. Other settlements include Dolní Kořenov, Horní Kořenov, Martinovské Údolí, Na Kobyle, Nová Víska, Počátky, Růžodol, Světlá, Tesařov, Údolí Nadeje, Václavíkova Studánka, and Zelené Údolí. The hamlet of Údolí Nadeje (Hoffnungstal, ) previously belonged to the Silesian side of the Sudetes, it passed to Czechoslovakia in 1958. Today Kořenov is home to an elementary school in Horní Kořenov, as well as to a nursery school and retirements home in Polubný, two voluntary fire brigades (DHS Polubný and DHS Příchovice), and a factory producing salami packages. History The first settlers came to the remote forested area in northern Bohemia in 1577 when German Paul Schierer (von Walthaimb zu Falkenau) established glassworks at Rejdice (Reiditz). After the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, the lands were seized by Albrecht von Wallenstein, who sold them to the comital Desfours dynasty.

Two subspecies are recognised. The fruiting bodies appear in coniferous woodlands in autumn in northern Europe and North America. Their caps are coloured various shades of wine-red, purple to green. Mild tasting and edible, it is one of the most highly regarded brittlegills for the table. It is also notable for smelling of shellfish or crab when fresh.  Taxonomy  Russula xerampelina was originally described in 1770 as Agaricus xerampelina from a collection in Bavaria by the German mycologist Jacob Christian Schaeffer, who noted the colour as fusco-purpureus or \\"purple-brown\\". It was later given its present binomial name by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries. Its specific epithet is taken from the Ancient Greek meaning \\"colour of dried vine leaves\\", xeros meaning \\"dry\\", and ampělinos or \\"of the vine\\".Giovanni Pacioni1993> Two subspecies have been recognised, var. xerampelina and var. tenuicarnosa, with thinner flesh in the cap and the stipe. The name R. erythropoda is now considered a synonym, and former subspecies R. (xerampelina subsp.) amoenipes (originally named by Henri Romagnesi) now a separate species. A former variety with a greenish cap, R. xerampelina var. elaeodes, is now classified as R. clavipes. As the first defined species, it gives its name to the section Xerampelinae, a group of related species within the genus Russula, occasionally all termed R. xerampelina in the past. Common names include shrimp mushroom, shrimp Russula, crab brittlegill, and shellfish-scented Russula.  Description  Another colour variation of R. xerampelina Russula xerampelina has a characteristic odour of boiled crustacean. The cap is wide, domed, flat, or with a slightly depressed centre, and sticky. The colour is variable, most commonly purple to wine-red, or greenish, and darker towards the centre of the cap. There are fine grooves up to a centimetre long running perpendicular to the margin. The gills have a mild to rather bitter taste, narrowly spaced, and turn creamy-yellow on ageing specimens. The spore print is creamy-yellow to ochre. The oval spores measure 8.8–9.9 by 6.7–7.8 µm and are covered with 1 µm spines, The stipe long, wide, is cylindrical, white or sometimes with a reddish blush, turning ochre or brownish with age. This Russula has been divided into several similar species by some mycologists. However, they all have the singular dark green colour reaction to iron salts (iron(II) sulfate) when applied to the flesh, and all smell of shellfish. This aroma is quite distinct, and becomes stronger with age. More reddish-capped forms could be confused with the sickener (Russula emetica), although the latter always has a white stipe and gills; greener-capped species may resemble the also edible Russula aeruginea.  Distribution and habitat  Russula xerampelina is widely distributed; quite common in northern temperate zones, and often ranging into the Arctic Circle, it also ranges south to Costa Rica. Appearing in the autumn, it grows solitary, or in groups with conifers, and seems to have a preference for Douglas Fir, or more rarely pine trees or larch. It is sometimes found in deciduous woods, such as beech and oak. Variety tenuicarnosa has been found on sandy soils under pine in Slovakia and northern Italy in Trentino.  Edibility  The taste of Russula xerampelina is mild. This Russula is considered one of the best edible species of its genus, although the crab, or shrimp taste and smell will persist even when cooking. This is more pronounced and less pleasant in older specimens.Mitchell Beazley Publishers > The young caps are said to be superb stuffed with any suitable ingredients, and are rarely maggoty.

He was drafted in the eleventh round of the 1992 amateur draft by the Atlanta Braves, and was subsequently selected 12th by the Devil Rays in the 1997 MLB Expansion Draft. Bobby is now the hitting instructor in the Arizona Diamondbacks organization. Early Life Robert “Bobby” Eugene Smith was born on May 10, 1974 in Oakland, California. Bobby was a natural athlete, and he excelled in both basketball and baseball. He was often the best player on the field, and as a youth baseball player he was a six-time all-star and a Bambino League World Series champion. Bobby went to Fremont High School in Oakland, and was a three-year letterman in both Baseball and Basketball. In his Senior year, Bobby was recognized as the Oakland Athletic League’s “Player of the Year,” an award handed out annually to the best ballplayer in the Oakland Unified School district. Bobby was offered, and accepted a full scholarship offer to University of California, Berkeley, but was subsequently selected in the 11th round of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft by the Atlanta Braves, who he signed with on June 5, 1992 . Career Atlanta Braves Bobby spent 1993 with the Class-A Macon Braves before being brought up to the Class-A advanced Durham Bulls in 1994. It was here that Bobby started to show his potential hitting .266, but slugging 12 homeruns to go along with 18 steals. In 1995, Bobby hit .261 with the Class AA Greenville Braves, slugging 14 homers and swiping 12 bags. He was also regarded as a talented fielder who could play third base and shortstop, as well as outfield. After the season, Baseball America rated him 75th out of the top 100 prospects currently in the minor leagues. In 1996, Smith started the season with the AAA Richmond Braves, and seemed poised for a great season. His numbers dipped from the year before, as he was only able to manage a .256 batting average. His power numbers dipped as well, as he only hit 8 homeruns. However, he did steal 15 bases. After the season, he was removed from baseball America’s top 100. His 1997 season in Richmond did not show much improvement, as he was only able to hit .246. His power numbers, however, rebounded slightly, as he was able to hit 12 homeruns (in 24 less games than the previous season). Tampa Bay Devil Rays Bobby was selected twelfth overall by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 1997 expansion draft, and in 1998 he made his Major League debut. He was selected for the inaugural roster of the Devil Rays, with his role being defined as the 5th infielder, occasional outfielder, who would spell the aging legend, Wade Boggs at third base. Bobby’s major league debut came in the form of a bottom of the ninth, pinch- hit at-bat for starting center fielder, Quentin McCracken. Bobby singled off of Detroit Tigers reliever Bryce Florie. He would go on to have the best season of his professional career, (Majors or minors) hitting .276, with an on base percentage of .343, and a slugging percentage of .422. Bobby hit 11 homeruns in only 117 games. He was regarded as a player of the future, and a possible building block of the Franchise. After the season, Bobby was named (along with teammate Miguel Cairo) to the 1999 Topps Baseball All-Star Rookie Team. In 1999 Smith spent as much time with AAA Durham as he did with the big club, hitting only .181 in the majors. In the minors however, Smith hit .333, and slugged .613. Smith hit .234, .105, and .175 in 2000, 2001, and 2002 respectively. In that same time frame, he hit .291, .301, and .239 in the minors, proving himself to be an outstanding Minor Leaguer. His last MLB appearance was May 6, 2002, where he went 0-3 against the Boston Red Sox. Shortly thereafter, Smith was designated for assignment by Tampa Bay. Minor Leagues He began his journey through the minors, playing for affiliates of the Milwaukee Brewers, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, and Oakland A’s. In 2006, after his second stint with the AAA White Sox affiliate in Charlotte, where he hit .259 with a meager 6 homeruns, Smith retired from baseball at the age of 32. Smith’s playing days over, he joined the Arizona Diamondbacks as a hitting coach. As of July 18, 2016, he is no longer with their organization.

The station, which is governed by Transport Scotland and managed by Abellio ScotRail, lies on the Argyle Line and the North Clyde Line. In operation since 1887, the station stemmed losses for an area that was in decline. It is located near the Jordanhill Campus of the University of Strathclyde and sits atop Crow Road, an important western thoroughfare in Glasgow and the main route to the Clyde Tunnel.The station is at (coordinates ) with a Glasgow postcode of G11 7DW. The station is five stops and eleven minutes' journey time from on the Argyle Line. Trains on the North Clyde Line pass through without stopping at the station.  History  Early history The station opened on 1 August 1887 as part of the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway. Construction of the station structure was not completed until 1895, with modular-design wooden buildings, commonly seen on the new suburban railway lines, being built on both platforms. The station is located on part of the former site of brick and tile works, Jordanhill being an area of artisans and miners until the close of the nineteenth century. The railway station arrived just as much of the local industry was declining, giving residents, who previously had to walk to Hillhead or Partick to find transport into Glasgow, proper access to the city centre.Donnelly, Max (1987) \\"Jordanhill – A Historical Sketch\\" (2nd ed) (Glasgow: Self-published (printed at Strathclyde University)) The station's opening effectively filled a gap in provision, as lines in the area had already been constructed; the Whiteinch and Stobcross Railways both opened in 1874, but no station was constructed on these lines at Jordanhill. A new link allowed services to Whiteinch Victoria Park to begin in 1897, but they ceased in 1951 and the link was closed to freight in 1967.1967 Chronology of RAILSCOT The route of the link has been converted into a nature walk from Victoria Park to Jordanhill station, running alongside the existing line for approximately half its length. On 15 January 1898, J. Johnstone, a member of the Whiteinch Harriers running club, was killed while attempting to run across the line west of the station. A small lead memorial stood on the spot for many years.Railways in Jordanhill (contains Ordnance Survey map of station) The freight line saw near-disaster on 28 December 1932, when seventeen wagons laden with coal ran away on a slight incline on the sidings operated by the Great Western Steam Laundry; they ran into other wagons, derailing nine and spilling coal over the line, seriously disrupting passenger traffic.\\"Coal wagons derailed: A shunting accident\\", The Times, 29 December 1932 page 5 A serious accident occurred on 28 April 1980, when a three-coach train carrying 80 passengers from Dalmuir to Motherwell derailed at Hyndland West Junction, just after leaving Jordanhill. All the bogies on the leading coach left the rails, causing fifteen people (nine women and six men) to be injured seriously enough for them to be taken to the Western Infirmary.\\"Fifteen hurt as three- coach train jumps rail\\", The Times, 29 April 1980 page 4  Plans for rebuilding  In 1998, Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) undertook a study into the possible relocation of the station west to Westbrae Drive. A December 2002 report from the Scottish Executive included this station as part of their High Resource Scenario, estimating the project cost at approximately £2 million (US$4 million). By 2004, SPT had identified this station as one of their top three priorities, and Glasgow City Council had identified it as a \\"main priority\\".Faculty of Education Estate Strategy , Staff Meeting at Jordanhill Campus Monday, 11 October 2004 An alternative proposal would keep the existing station open but with many services calling only at a new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, who said that having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde.The Herald, 20 August 2001 The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away. The station at Jordanhill is to be rebuilt, one of six new stations in the west of Scotland, according to an announcement made on 19 May 2006 by SPT chief executive Ron Culley.

Cellular architectures are relatively new, with IBM's Cell microprocessor being the first one to reach the market. Cellular architecture takes multi-core architecture design to its logical conclusion, by giving the programmer the ability to run large numbers of concurrent threads within a single processor. Each 'cell' is a compute node containing thread units, memory, and communication. Speed-up is achieved by exploiting thread-level parallelism inherent in many applications. Cell, a cellular architecture containing 9 cores, is the processor used in the PlayStation 3. Another prominent cellular architecture is Cyclops64, a massively parallel architecture currently under development by IBM. Cellular architectures follow the low-level programming paradigm, which exposes the programmer to much of the underlying hardware. This allows the programmer to greatly optimize their code for the platform, but at the same time makes it more difficult to develop software.

Bay of Pigs fiasco He first became notable when in 1961, after having previously joined the Brigade 2506/Operation 40 organization and participating in the Bay of Pigs Invasion (possibly in revenge for Fidel Castro having destroyed his livelihood; Cartaya had been on very good terms with the former rulers of Cuba), he was sentenced to three years in jail for his part in the invasion. How he got out of jail is unclear. World Finance Corporation Back in the United States, he garnered infamy when his elaborate financial empire, centered around the World Finance Corporation which he founded in 1971, came crashing down in 1977 -- the scandal was estimated to have cost depositors and taxpayers on three continents more than $50 million. He was captured using forged passports to leave Miami after escaping from the United Arab Emirates (despite the confiscation of his real passport). In 1982, he was charged in court with a number of crimes, mainly money laundering, drug and arms trafficking, and embezzlement. For some reason, all charges except income tax evasion were dropped, apparently at the insistence of the CIA (which had, incidentally, sponsored the Bay of Pigs invasion, and has long been said to covertly support the Colombian cocaine trade Cartaya facilitated). In the aftermath, Florida Attorney General Robert Shevin returned $7,600 in contributions from WFC-connected Latin businessmen. Dade County Democratic chairman Michael Abrams resigned from the board of a WFC- backed insurance company. Acquittal and conviction Cartaya and his former aide Salvador Aldereguia-Ors were acquitted in 1978 of a 1978 indictment charging them with conspiring to use a false passport to help Hernandez Cartaya escape from Ajman in the United Arab Emirates. Cartaya's passport had been confiscated in an attempt by the Ajmani to have him repay the more than 12 million missing $USD. He, Francisco J. Fernandez, and Vicente Carrodeguas were only ever convicted of tax evasion (Henry Heitman, Jr., who was the only defendant to testify, was acquitted); they had not reported a number of large bonuses as salary.drawn from the UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT; 747 F.2d 1390; 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 16181; 85-2 U.S. Tax; Cas.

He is a graduate from the University of Tennessee, and was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 11th round of the amateur draft. He made his major league debut in with the Cards. On April 17, 1997, he recorded his first stolen base with a steal of home against pitcher Kevin Brown who threw a wild pitchout. DiFelice was chosen by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays with the 20th selection of the 1997 MLB Expansion Draft. On July 25, , he was traded with Albie Lopez to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Jason Conti and Nick Bierbrodt. His time in Arizona was short and tumultuous. In a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 14, DiFelice got into a fight with Kevin Young at home plate. He was suspended for two games but appealed the suspension; Pirates' manager Lloyd McClendon said \\"That guy deliberately stood on Kevin and kneed him. There's absolutely no excuse for that.\\" Before the appeal, on August 21, DiFelice was arrested after getting thrown out of a Pittsburgh nightclub. Police said he assaulted two women in the club, then punched a valet in the parking lot. Three days later, the Diamondbacks sent him to the AAA Tucson Sidewinders, before releasing him on September 4. In 2002, he signed as a free agent to play with the St. Louis Cardinals. Later, he played for the Kansas City Royals, Detroit Tigers, was sent to the Chicago Cubs as part of a conditional deal, then signed with the Florida Marlins, New York Mets, Washington Nationals, and again with the Mets. Over the first two seasons he spent with the Mets, (2005 and 2006), his batting averages were very bad, in 2005, he had a batting average of .118, (2-17), in 2006 he had only an .080 batting average, (2-25). However, in 2007, his final year with the Mets, his batting average improved to .250, (10-40). Even with that, the Mets still declined to offer salary arbitration to DiFelice. On January 6, , he signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays. He saw his last action at the major league level in April of that season, appearing in seven games. At his request, he was released in early September and retired. \\"Rays call up slugger, catcher from Triple-A\\". September 10, 2008, St. Petersburg Times. Retrieved on September 10, 2008. On February 5, , DiFelice was named the manager of the Rookie-level Kingsport Mets in the New York Mets organization. DiFelice's at-bat song was 'Got Another Thing Comin' by Judas Priest, which was recommended by former teammate Paul Ellis. He and Dan Wheeler are the only Tampa Bay players to suit up in all three of the franchise's uniforms. Since his retirement, Miguel Cairo is now the sole remaining active player from the 1998 Rays Opening Day roster. Another fact about DiFelice is that he was included on the Rays 40-man roster in the baseball video game MLB 09 The Show, even though he had retired in September 2008, and when the game was released, he was the manager of the Kingsport Mets.

In computer architecture, Gustafson's law (or Gustafson–Barsis's law) gives the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of a task at fixed execution time that can be expected of a system whose resources are improved. It is named after computer scientist John L. Gustafson and his colleague Edwin H. Barsis, and was presented in the article Reevaluating Amdahl's Law in 1988. Definition Gustafson estimated the speedup S gained by using N processors (instead of just one) for a task with a serial fraction s (which does not benefit from parallelism) as follows: : S = N + (1 - N)s Using different variables, Gustafson's law can be formulated the following way: : S_\\\\text{latency}(s) = 1 - p + sp, where * Slatency is the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of the whole task; * s is the speedup in latency of the execution of the part of the task that benefits from the improvement of the resources of the system; * p is the percentage of the execution workload of the whole task concerning the part that benefits from the improvement of the resources of the system before the improvement. Gustafson's law addresses the shortcomings of Amdahl's law, which is based on the assumption of a fixed problem size, that is of an execution workload that does not change with respect to the improvement of the resources. Gustafson's law instead proposes that programmers tend to set the size of problems to fully exploit the computing power that becomes available as the resources improve. Therefore, if faster equipment is available, larger problems can be solved within the same time. The impact of Gustafson's law was to shift research goals to select or reformulate problems so that solving a larger problem in the same amount of time would be possible. In a way the law redefines efficiency, due to the possibility that limitations imposed by the sequential part of a program may be countered by increasing the total amount of computation. Derivation A task executed by a system whose resources are improved compared to an initial similar system can be split into two parts: * a part that does not benefit from the improvement of the resources of the system; * a part that benefits from the improvement of the resources of the system. Example. — A computer program that processes files from disk. A part of that program may scan the directory of the disk and create a list of files internally in memory. After that, another part of the program passes each file to a separate thread for processing. The part that scans the directory and creates the file list cannot be sped up on a parallel computer, but the part that processes the files can. The execution workload of the whole task before the improvement of the resources of the system is denoted W . It includes the execution workload of the part that does not benefit from the improvement of the resources and the execution workload of the one that benefits from it. The fraction of the execution workload that would benefit from the improvement of the resources is denoted by p The fraction concerning the part that would not benefit from it is therefore . Then : W = (1 - p)W + pW. It is the execution of the part that benefits from the improvement of the resources that is sped up by a factor s after the improvement of the resources. Consequently, the execution workload of the part that does not benefit from it remains the same. The theoretical execution workload W(s) of the whole task after the improvement of the resources is then : W(s) = (1 - p)W + spW. Gustafson's law gives the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of the whole task at fixed time T , which yields : S_\\\\text{latency}(s) = \\\\frac{TW(s)}{TW} = \\\\frac{W(s)}{W} = 1 - p + sp. Applications Application in research Amdahl's law presupposes that the computing requirements will stay the same, given increased processing power. In other words, an analysis of the same data will take less time given more computing power. Gustafson, on the other hand, argues that more computing power will cause the data to be more carefully and fully analyzed: pixel by pixel or unit by unit, rather than on a larger scale. Where it would not have been possible or practical to simulate the impact of nuclear detonation on every building, car, and their contents (including furniture, structure strength, etc.) because such a calculation would have taken more time than was available to provide an answer, the increase in computing power will prompt researchers to add more data to more fully simulate more variables, giving a more accurate result. Application in everyday computer systems Amdahl's Law reveals a limitation in, for example, the ability of multiple cores to reduce the time it takes for a computer to boot to its operating system and be ready for use. Assuming the boot process was mostly parallel, quadrupling computing power on a system that took one minute to load might reduce the boot time to just over fifteen seconds. But greater and greater parallelization would eventually fail to make bootup go any faster, if any part of the boot process were inherently sequential. Gustafson's law argues that a fourfold increase in computing power would instead lead to a similar increase in expectations of what the system will be capable of. If the one-minute load time is acceptable to most users, then that is a starting point from which to increase the features and functions of the system. The time taken to boot to the operating system will be the same, i.e. one minute, but the new system would include more graphical or user-friendly features. Limitations Some problems do not have fundamentally larger datasets. As an example, processing one data point per world citizen gets larger at only a few percent per year. The principal point of Gustafson's law is that such problems are not likely to be the most fruitful applications of parallelism. Algorithms with nonlinear runtimes may find it hard to take advantage of parallelism \\"exposed\\" by Gustafson's law. Snyder points out an O(N3) algorithm means that double the concurrency gives only about a 26% increase in problem size. Thus, while it may be possible to occupy vast concurrency, doing so may bring little advantage over the original, less concurrent solution—however in practice there have still been considerable improvements. Hill and Marty emphasize also that methods of speeding sequential execution are still needed, even for multicore machines. They point out that locally inefficient methods can be globally efficient when they reduce the sequential phase. Furthermore, Woo and Lee studied the implication of energy and power on future many-core processors based on Amdahl's law, showing that an asymmetric many-core processor can achieve the best possible energy efficiency by activating an optimal number of cores given the amount of parallelism is known prior to execution.

A name change to the Uptown on April 11, 1929, coincided with the installation of sound equipment and a screening of The Dummy. A fire broke out in the ventilation system during Trade Winds on April 25, 1939, but the cinema was rebuilt soon after by the firm of Liebenberg & Kaplan. This new Uptown Theatre re-opened on November 16, 1939, with The Women. It was designed in streamline moderne, with two incised roundels on the exterior stone facade that portrayed themes of travel and adventure in cinema. Murals in the auditorium depict early explorers gazing at the future Minneapolis and the Father of the Waters presiding over water sprites that symbolize the lakes of the city. The Uptown closed in 1975 but was purchased and re-opened by the Landmark Theatres chain in 1976. After years of classic double features, the theater began screening foreign and independent films starting with The Coca-Cola Kid in November 1985. The building was deemed a heritage site in 1990 and soon after remodeled their lobby to re-create art moderne and neo-baroque elements. Landmark closed the theater on January 31, 2012 for renovation and upgrades. The theater re-opened September 14, 2012, showing Sleepwalk with Me. The new design added a full bar and replaced 35mm with digital projection. The structure has a 60-foot tower that once featured a revolving beam of light marking the Uptown area of Minneapolis and could be seen for miles around. It was the first three-sided vertical tower sign in the country and had to be approved by civil aviation authorities. The theater stands at one of the busiest intersections in the Uptown area (Hennepin-Lagoon) and has been a landmark in the area for decades. It is also one of the few cinemas in the midwest that offers balcony seating. The Uptown screens mostly foreign and art films and runs cult films at midnight screenings. It ran The Rocky Horror Picture Show from May 19, 1978, through 1997. The film returned on a monthly basis in 2009. The theater is known for its often clever and amusing marquees.

Professional career  Witt attended the University of Oklahoma, and in 1983 he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected with the third pick of the first round by the Texas Rangers in 1985. His first professional win came in 1986 with the Texas Rangers as he had failed to win a game in the minor leagues. He was known as a hard-throwing right-hander with control problems throughout his career and many in Arlington began to call him \\"Witt 'n Wild\\" as a play on the waterpark Wet 'n Wild, which was located next to Arlington Stadium. Witt led the league in walks three times and wild pitches twice.  Texas Rangers Witt made his major league debut in 1986 and made 31 starts for the Rangers, finishing the season with an 11-9 record. Known for his control problems, he led the league with 143 walks in 157.2 innings pitched. The following season he led the league again in walks, this time with 140 in 143 innings. On August 2, 1987, Witt struck out 4 batters in one inning. He set the Texas Rangers club record set in 1990 with his 7th consecutive road win of the season, a feat that was not matched by a Rangers pitcher until Scott Feldman did it in 2009.Palmer, Matt, \\"Rangers roll, trim Wild Card deficit to two: Feldman stifles Orioles for 11th road victory, 15th overall\\".

The Tropical Andes, Choco, and the Caribbean are considered biodiversity hotspots which puts these areas at high risk of concentration of colonizing activities. Colombia hosts over 1800 species and at least one new species is detected every year. Decades of civil war and political unrest has impeded biological and environmental research in Colombia. The political unrest in Colombia catalyzes the alteration of land patterns through the cultivation of coca and opium crops, the redirection of extractive activities, and land abandonment in some areas. Trash in the bay of Cartagena, Colombia (2005). Pollution on the streets of Barranquilla. There are many environmental issues in Colombia. Issues include deforestation, soil erosion, illicit drug crops grown in national natural reserves by mafias (not peasants), pollution on major bodies of water by corporations (backed up by unregulated / unsupervised policies and by the corruption of local and federal authorities) among others. There is soil and water quality damage from contamination by the use of chemicals in the coca-refining process, spillage of crude oil into the local rivers as a result of guerrilla sabotage of pipelines, overuse of pesticides, and air pollution (especially in Bogotá) from vehicle emissions. Natural hazards include highlands subject to volcanic eruptions, occasional earthquakes, and periodic droughts. Deforestation Colombia loses 2,000 km2 of forest annually to deforestation, according to the United Nations in 2003. Some suggest that this figure is as high as 3,000 km2 due to illegal logging in the region. Deforestation results mainly from logging for timber, small- scale agricultural ranching, mining, development of energy resources such as hydro-electricity, infrastructure, cocaine production, and farming. Around one-third of the country's original forest has been removed as a result of deforestation. Deforestation in Colombia is mainly targeted at primary rainforest which covers more than 80% of Colombia. This has a profound ecological impact in that Colombia is extremely rich in biodiversity, with 10% of the world's species, making it the second most biologically diverse country on Earth. A national and regional deforestation study in Colombia found a total loss of 5,116,071 ha of forest between 1990 and 2005 which indicates an annual deforestation rate of 341,071 ha. This concludes the national rate of deforestation equals to 0.62%. Higher deforestation rates are found in flatter areas around rural locations where protected areas are more present. Even though majority of ecosystems in the Amazon, the Choco, and the Orinoco remain intact, 71% of original forest in the Andes has been wiped out. Forest conversion has the highest probability in the Andean and Caribbean territory, although tropical forest in the Pacific and Amazon lowlands continue to be exterminated. The ecosystems most vulnerable to deforestation ranked: the plains in northern Amazonia, the humid high, sub, and mid-altitude Andean forests, the tropical high and low land forests in the Caribbean and the Magdalena tropical forest plains. Deforestation is happening more frequently in flatter zones, where cattle density and rural population are low. Illicit crop cultivation has been recorded a main driver of deforestation in Colombia. The globalized economy has extended new engenders of deforestation, such as biofuel production, mining, and hydrocarbon extraction. At the national level, rate of rural population, protected areas, cattle practicing, and slope, are deforestation drivers. Forest eradication is a crucial environmental issue given the biodiversity and ecosystems these forests provide and all the life that can be potentially lost. The concurrent forested areas predominately exist on less fertile soil and are distant from roads. Amazonian deforestation In Colombia, majority of forests are contained within the Amazonia. The population of this region is sparsely populated engendering the zone to be concentrated by deforestation and high levels of extractive activities. In the Colombian Amazonia from 1990 to 2005 there was a forest loss of 1,886,769 ha (3.9%) with an annual rate of 0.49%. Deforestation in this region is accounted to population and land use. The Amazonia possess a low populated area with small scale agriculture (including illegal crops), and cattle ranching. Fires in the Amazon also remain as a catalyst of deforestation which is an indicator of slash and burn activities associated with exploitation of natural resources. Study results suggest deforestation in the Amazonia often takes place in unoccupied rural territory where an influx of “colonist population move freely and colonization hotspots using the river” are created. Deforestation in the Orinoco Majority of the Orinoco is composed by grasslands and pastures areas with small-scale agriculture, forest with extensive river networks and a small population.Lasso, A. Carlos. “Biodiversidad de la cuenca del Orinoco: Areas prioritadas para la conservación y uso sostenible.” Instituto de Investigación de Recursos Biológicos Alexander von Humboldt. (2011): 2–304. Humboldt. Web. 21 Nov. 2016 A major threat to this region is deforestation, and deforestation is a critical menace to biodiversity. From 1990 to 2005, 507,337 ha that is 3.2% of the Orinoco forest disappeared at an annual rate of 0.83%. Causes of deforestation in this region range from land use for agriculture, illicit crops, and mining to slope elevation. Like the Amazonia, the Orinoco is scarcely populated and has a small-scale agriculture (including illicit cropping), and cattle grazing. Deforestation is highly affected by both legal and illegal cropping, and by mining that negative impacts mountain forest at higher lands of the basin. Over the last 10 years the Orinoco along with the Amazonia has been subjected to greater pressures from bio-fuel companies. Caribbean deforestation The Caribbean forest significantly has been transformed into an area of fragments of dry forest with pastures scarce of vegetation. During the fifteen-year period (1990–2005) 753,893 ha of forest were lost that is 5% of the Caribbean forest at an annual rate of 1.92%. In Colombia, cattle grazing productivity is the highest in this region, this practice plus its use of slash and burn activities influence deforestation. Land tenure and illicit cropping also prompt deforestation in this area. When land becomes scarce highland areas provide opportunity for agriculture expansion and forest removal. Three deforestation hotspots were found in the Caribbean: the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, San Lucas, and Perija, where slopes are wetter and steeper and flat land is occupied by cattle grazing or agricultural operations indicating that wetter and steeper municipalities had higher forest loss. Pacific deforestation The Pacific is regarded as one of the wettest zones in the world holding an annual precipitation of 4,000 mm up to more than 10,000 mm in some areas, the climate ranges from humid to superhumid, the population is sparse, and this region is recognized as one of the world's most biologically and culturally diverse areas composed by various Afro-Colombians, and indigenous peoples. In a fifteen-year period, the Pacific experienced one of the highest deforestation rate loss of 472,863 ha about 6.32% of forest loss at an annual rate of 0.42%. Logging has occurred in the region for decades, but over the last ten years, pressures from bio-fuel companies have intensified. Andean deforestation The Andes is of particular interest because of its known importance as a biodiversity hot spot, as a provider of water to a grand human population, and its vulnerability to climate change and deforestation. The Andean forest stand as the second most fragmented natural habitat In Colombia. Recent causes of deforestation in this region has shifted to illicit crops and cattle grazing.A Bayesian Spatial Model Highlights Distinct Dynamics in Deforestation from...: Start Your Search! http://eds.a.ebscohost.com From 2007–2010, 340,842 Ha of forest were lost, while 633 Ha of illicit crops and 225,279 Ha of pastures were added. The Deforestation rate of 0.67% found in the Colombian Andes is higher than the average deforestation rate reported for South American forests 0.38%.Understanding deforestation in montane and lowland forests of the Colombian...: Start Your Search! http://eds.a.ebscohost.com However, low lands in this region experience deforestation at higher rates than mountain lands because the population is mainly concentrated in mountain top areas. From 1990 to 2005 montane forests went from 7,335,125 ha to 6,405,591 ha (0.63%), and for lowland forest change from 3,671,768 ha to 3,123,369 ha (0.75%). Throughout the decades, deforestation in the Colombian Andean zone has only accelerated (Vina). By 1998, 69% of the Andean forest and 30% of the lowland Andean forests were cleared. In 2000 the remaining natural cover in Los Andes was 39%, that means that over 60% of its natural coverage has been lost and today this region continues to through natural resource extraction including exploitation, settlement and deforestation. Deforestation was mostly accounted to cropping 32% and cattle ranching activities for its remaining. In the montane forest deforestation was affected by land tenure of small parcels, road, water presence, and temperature. In the lowlands deforestation was associated with population, crops (licit and illicit), protected areas and temperature. The introduction of the oil industry in the 1990s and its promise of high wages has generated deforestation and migration of local farmers who abandoned their pasture maintenance to enter the extraction industry.  Biodiversity loss  Birds loss in Los Andes Colombia holds 18% of the world's bird species.Setting Practical Conservation Priorities for Birds in the Western Andes of...: Start Your Search! http://eds.a.ebscohost.com The Andes alone is one of the most diverse areas in the world. However, bird species specifically in the San Lucas Andean mountain ranges are endangered. The absence of government protection from armed conflict in San Lucas has facilitated the cultivation of coca crops and deforestation, which has resulted in local biodiversity loss. In some areas in the Western Andes concentrations of endemic threatened birds reached 46 species in certain areas. Neotropical birds especially from higher elevations are more prone to extinction. A study done in a 3000 ha reserve in Los Andes that conserves an extensive amount of endemic and small ranged bird species found 227 species in the region nine that pronounced threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature four of these are endemic species to Colombia: the Munchique Wood-wren, the Chestnut-bellied Flowerpiercer, the Yellow-eared Parrot, the Magdalena Tapaculo, the Bicoloured Antvireo, the Tanager Finch, the Ruddy Pigeon, the White-capped Tanager, and Red-bellied Grackle. Wildlife trafficking The black market of animal trafficking is considered the second biggest threat to biodiversity in Colombia and the third most lucrative illegal enterprise.Zimmerman, Mara E. \\"The Black Market for Wildlife: Combating Transnational Organized Crime in the Illegal Wildlife Trade.\\" Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 36.5 (2003): 1657–1690. Web. 17 Nov. 2016 Colombia has a seventy-year history of animal smuggling, in some cases impoverished families from the country side amplify their income by selling mafia groups lizards, monkey, and parrots. International smuggling entities tend to be involved in the business of smuggling other trades because they are specialized in smuggling routes. Experts approximate that each year 6,000,000 animals are illegally exported from Colombia, 200,000 of these are primates destined for laboratories and research centers. Colombian drug lords are known to have private zoos with endangered species engendering a demand of exotic creatures (Zimmerman, Moreno). Colombia has an animal trafficking policy of six months to three years of jail but no one has served such sentence. During the first months of 2012, enforcement officers rescued more than 46,000 animals including birds and reptiles heading for the illegal international trade.FIGHTING TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME.: Start Your Search! http://eds.a.ebscohost.com Sloths The biggest threat to sloth's survival in Colombia is the destruction and fragmentation of their habitat. Three types of sloths’ species are distinguished in Colombia: the brown-throated three-toed sloth, Bradypus variegatus which inhabits the Pacific and Amazonian lowland rainforest and the Caribbean, the Hoffman's two-toed sloth, Choloepus hoffmanni prevails in the north along with the B. variegatus, in the Pacific rainforest and the Caribbean savanna dry forest, but it is also found in Andean montane forest, and the southern two-toed sloth, Choloepus didactylus who is native in the south with B. variegatus, sharing the lowland Amazonian rainforest, but this specific species has been studied little in Colombia. Habitat for these species is limited primarily by the ongoing deforestation with in natural forest. The continuous expansion of agriculture, ranching, and urbanization are a direct threat to sloths’ survival. Frequently, sloths die in large numbers in accidents related to the destruction of natural forests that go underreported by the media and lack attention from wildlife agencies and police. All three-different species have a different rate and specific threat to their survival but collectively habitat loss – deforestation is pivotal. Deforestation facilitates the illegal trade of sloths as they are usually caught by young children who take them from deforested areas and sell them to traffickers. Poachers also take hundreds of young two-and three-toed sloths from their mothers. The Colombian Ministry does not recognize the three-sloth species as being in threat of extinction mainly because there is no long-term study that represents the estimate of the total sloth population to demonstrate cause of concern.  Air pollution  In 2019, 37% of greenhouse gases generated in Colombia came from transportation, and only 1.2% of the quarter-million new vehicles registered that year were electric or hybrids. Bogotá Colombia's capital city, Bogotá, is the country's largest population center. With over 7 million people, it is also one of the biggest cities in Latin America. Bogotá also has the highest rate of air pollution in Colombia and it has surged most recently as a result of the expansion of cars in the city.Air Pollution in Bogotá, Colombia: A Concentration-Response Approach.: Start Your Search! http://eds.a.ebscohost.com Air pollution has been monitored in Bogotá since 1967, but it was not until 1990 that monitors were widely spread through the city. A study conducted by the Secretary of Health of the District in collaboration with the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) concluded that 70% of air pollution is attributed to vehicles, it was also identified that bricks, battery plants and others were crucial pollution sources as well. This study concluded a nexus between air pollution and respiratory health by relating air pollutants with the number of daily respiratory admissions. Statistics from the Secretary of Health demonstrated that between 1998 and 1999 about 9.6% of visits to hospitals were related to respiratory issues this percentage was higher for infant visits to the doctor associated to Acute Respiratory Illnesses 24.3%. Monitoring stations reveal that half of the areas with monitoring stations are surpass emission limits considered safe by the WHO, Particulate Matter (PM10) and ozone levels are the leading problem. Medellin Medellin is the second city in Colombia with the worst air quality, and within the city, Downtown Medellin is one of the most contaminated areas by car emissions. Low quality gasoline and diesel are considered a main source of air pollutants. Medellin's shift toward urbanization, has increased the number of vehicles and thus extended the use of fossil fuels. Areas known for heavy traffic are monitored by meters that measure the amount of air pollution some of the sectors that have been recognized with the highest levels of pollution within the metropolitan area are: Itagüí-Ditaires, Politécnico Jaime Isaza-Cadavid, and Downtown Medellín (particularly the Miguel de Aguinaga building and San Antonio Park). Downtown Medellin's pollution rates exceed the norm established by the WHO of being a risk to human health.  Water pollution  Colombia is well endowed with rich water resources with a national average fresh water supply of more than 2,100 cubic kilometers.Sánchez-Triana, Ernesto; Ahmed, Kulsum; Awe, Yewande. 2007. Environmental Priorities and Poverty Reduction : A Country Environmental Analysis for Colombia. Washington, DC: World Bank. © World Bank. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6700 License: CC BY 3.0 IGO This is several times larger when compared to other Latin American countries like Argentina and Mexico. But Colombia is facing a serious problem of water pollution. This is limiting their use of abundant water resources for water supply, recreation and ecological benefits. Toxic and pathogenic pollution Rivers such as Bogotá, Cali, Combeima, Otún, Medellín, de Oro, Pamplonita, and Pasto which are one of the important water resources of Colombia are highly contaminated due to direct discharge of untreated effluents, pathogens and various other toxic substances primarily discharged by the agricultural sector, industrial sector and the mining sectors. These contaminants may result in cumulative and persistent consequences. Crude oil spills due to the acts of sabotage by leftist guerrilla squads, have become another cause of water pollution in the country. Mining sector Colombia is one of the largest producers of gold in Latin America. It has recently increased its production, especially in the Departments of Antioquia, Chocó, Bolívar and Córdoba, which in 2014 produced 90% of Colombia's gold. Most of this production comes from artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM). The artisanal gold mining sector in Colombia has 200,000 miners officially producing 30 tons Au/a. The impact of gold mining on the environment mainly depends on the location of the metal and the methods used to extract it. Gold mining activities require high volumes of water to obtain the metal and this leads to an alteration in surface and underground water bodies. Rivers are affected as many local mines discharge untreated waters and tailings directly to waterways. When rivers like Magdalena and Cauca reach Antioquia, they receive polluted loads caused by mining activity from tributaries from the Northeast and Bajo Cauca regions. In addition to the local mines, informal mining operations add to the water pollution by directly discharging many pollutants like suspended sediment, organic matter, acid drainage, metals, grease, oils and fuels into the waterways.A. Navarro, H. Biester, J. Mendoza and E. Cardellach, Mercury Speciation and Mobilization in Contaminated Soils of the Valle del Azogue Hg mine (SE, Spain), Environ. Geol., vol. 49, pp. 1089–1101, 2006. The major health risk from artisanal mining is mercury exposure.Sieber, N., Brain, J. (2014, Winter 2014). Health Impact of Artisanal Gold Mining in Latin America. ReVista: Harvard Review of Latin America. https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/book/health-impact-artisanal-gold-mining- latin-america Among the emissions from artisanal mining, two thirds are released locally into soil and water near mining operations, and a third is released into the atmosphere, where it can potentially attack people far from mining sites too. Artisanal mining is the largest single source of atmospheric mercury. Pollution due to Mercury can occur in two ways- a) through Air and b) through Water. Mercury vapors in the air around amalgam burning sites can be alarmingly high and almost always exceed the WHO limit for public exposure of 1,000 nanogram/cubic meter. This risks the health of workers but also those in the communities surrounding the processing centers. Exposure to levels of mercury vapors above 1,200,000 nanogram/cubic meter can be fatal. Water pollution due to mercury has become one of the biggest concerns in recent years. Artisanal and small-scale gold miners use mercury to extract gold in developing nations worldwide, contributing an estimated 30% of global mercury emissions annually. Colombia is the world's highest per capita mercury polluter. The total mercury release/emissions to the Colombian environment can be as high as 150 tons/a. In the case of Antioquia, the total amount of mercury used in the Northeast and Bajo Cauca regions is around 93.4 tons/annum. Water pollution due to mercury contamination Studies conducted in the Department of Cordoba showed that mercury levels in fish species in the basin of San Jorge river exceed the specified threshold (200 ng/g) for populations at risk established by World Health Organization.J.

Few other studies show mercury contamination in plants, fish and sediments in some water bodies in the region of Mojana.J. Olivero, B. Johnson and E.

In the region of Ayapel, significant concentrations of mercury in water, plants, fish and sediments swamp was found.J. Marrugo, J. Pinedo and S. Díez, Geochemistry of Mercury in Tropical Swamps Impacted by Gold Mining, Chemosphere, vol. 134, pp. 44–51, 2015. Sources suggest that all the metal contaminations can be attributed to the mining activities on the main gold zone of Colombia and San Jorge River basin. Human exposure and risk assessment In placer mining, mercury is added to the material extracted from the alluvial deposits. Excess mercury is discharged into adjacent waterways along with other residues of the ore which enters into the local ecosystem. Mercury grows into a greater threat to health as it moves through the aquatic food chain. In the aquatic environment, the elemental “quicksilver” form of mercury is taken by the bacteria and algae and is converted into the far more dangerous methylmercury. As methylmercury travels up the food chain, from algae to plankton to small fish to big fish, it becomes progressively more concentrated. When humans consume fish that contains methyl mercury, it is absorbed into the human body through gastrointestinal system. Mercury can enter the brain and cross the placenta. Once methylmercury enters the human body, it is relatively difficult to eliminate methylmercury from the body as it is bound to proteins. The effects of methylmercury on developing fetus were tragically demonstrated in Minimata, Japan. Children born to mothers who consumed mercury-contaminated fish suffered devastating birth defects, particularly those affecting the nervous system. When humans consume contaminated fish, they suffer neurological damage and autoimmune disorders. In addition, methylmercury can cause IQ loss, delayed speech and other neuro- developmental deficits among children when exposed. Early life exposures are the most harmful as they can damage the whole brain. Later life exposures may result in localized damage to the cerebellum, visual cortex, and motor strip. In adults, these exposures can lead to visuospatial problems and effects on executive functioning, memory and mood.Klaassen CD, Watkins JB, eds. Casarett & Doull’s Essentials of Toxicology, 2nd Edition. New York, NY:McGraw Hill (2010) Prevention Colombian government has been putting effort to reduce mercury usage levels. The adoption in July 2013 of Law 1658 to reduce and eliminate mercury use is an important step. It aims to phase out the use of mercury in all production processes within ten years and in mining within five years. Awareness has to be brought in miners regarding the risks involved in using mercury. In addition to the awareness, miners should be introduced to new techniques that minimize mercury use or provided with safer alternatives that can replace mercury amalgamation. According to Sam Spiegel, a lecturer in international development at the University of Edinburgh, “efforts to lower mercury emissions should aim to support miners and their livelihoods by supplying access to better technology’’. This does not mean completely eliminating mercury but rather using it more efficiently. A practical guide published by ASGM in 2011 on how to reduce mercury uses, UNEP recommends limiting mercury use with improved practices and moving towards mercury-free technologies that either boost or maintain miner income while protecting the health and the environment.UNEP Global Mercury Partn, & Artisanal Gold Council. (2012). A PRACTICAL GUIDE: REDUCING MERCURY USE IN ARTISANAL AND SMALL-SCALE GOLD MINING. Retrieved from United Nations Environment Program website: https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/11524/UNEP_Tech_Doc_APRIL_2012_120619_with_links_web.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y The economic interests of the miners should also be safeguarded while protecting health and environment. Currently, the Government of Antioquia, Corantioquia, Universidad Nacional de Colombia and BioRedd are developing programs to help informal miners to improve their mining circuit and are introducing technologies that avoid mercury use in their process. They presented a proposed plant design that eliminates the use of mercury by replacing gravity concentration processes taking advantage of the characteristics of the treated material. Recently, many companies have started re-evaluating gravity systems as they are relatively simple and that they produce little environmental pollution and also due to the increased costs of flotation reagents. They proved to be effective as they significantly reduce mercury use. They are proving to miners that with technical support and using alternatives to mercury they are able to recover more valuable material than they do at present.O. Garcia, O. Restrepo and D. Chaverra, Plant Design for Gold to Reduce the Use of Mercury in Artisanal Mining in Segovia Region in the NE of Colombia, in SME Annual Meet. Exhib., Salt Lake City, USA, 2014, pp. 143–145.  Government response  New environmental protection legislation was enacted in 1991, including the creation of specially protected zones, of which more than 200 were created in the early 1990s, mostly in forest areas and national parks. As a result of this charter, the Ministry of the Environment was established in 1993, merging with the housing and drinking water division of the Ministry of Economic Development, Housing, and Potable Water in 2003. As of April 5, 2018, Colombia's highest court has declared that the government of Colombia is responsible and must take urgent action to protect its Amazon Rainforest. This 4-3 ruling has also recognized the Amazon as an \\"entity subject of rights\\", which means the Amazon Rainforest has the same legal rights as a human being. The court ordered the local and national government, the environment and agriculture ministries and environmental authorities to come up with action plans within four months to combat deforestation in the Amazon. In 2019, however, the government spent 21% less on environmental protection than it had the previous year. This was one of the conclusions of a 333-page report, \\"Estado de los recursos naturales y del ambiente,\\" released by the government's Contraloría General in 2020. On November 24, 2016, FARC and the Colombian government signed a peace agreement. This was expected to give the government more control to regulate illegal logging and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, allowing the government to avoid expenses caused by environmental degradation. The savings were estimated at about COP $7.1 billones annually (US $2.4 billion at the exchange rate at that time). The government of Colombia has launched the Amazon Vision Project. The Project, with the financial backing of Norway, Germany, and the United Kingdom, aims to completely eradicate deforestation of Colombia's Amazon by 2020. In the Climate Summit of 2015, Colombia, Germany, Norway, and the United Kingdom signed a Joint Declaration to strengthen collaboration on the climate and forests in Colombia. Norway has committed to a total of 1.8 billion Norwegian crones to Colombia within 2020. The project has been adopted as a national policy and priority in the new National Development Plan 2014-2018. The inclusion of the Program in this PND meant that for the first time in the country there is a framework for development policy that promotes green growth strategies with concrete goals of education of consequences of deforestation and goals of conservation and sustainable use for the Amazon region, offering the opportunity to influence national policies by inserting specificities of the Amazon region that help the region reduce deforestation. The project aims to improve forest governance, plan a sustainable sector development, begin environmental governance with indigenous people and enable conditions for the environment to thrive.

Hoad Monument (proper name: the Sir John Barrow Monument) is a 100 ft (30.5 m) tower at the top of Hoad Hill (436 ft/133 m), to the north-east of Ulverston in the Furness area of north-west England. Paid for mainly by public subscription, the monument was erected in 1850 at a cost of £1250. It commemorates Sir John Barrow who was born in Ulverston in 1764. Sir John was a founder member of the Royal Geographical Society, and held various government posts in the 19th century becoming the Second Secretary to the Admiralty. The monument is not a lighthouse: it has never had a functional light. However, it was designed to resemble one, and is similar to the Third Eddystone Lighthouse (Smeaton's Tower).http://www.ulverstoncouncil.org.uk/education/john-barrow-monument/ It is a Grade II* listed building, meaning that it is of more than local interest, and the monument stands as one of the iconic symbols of the Northwest of England. It is built of limestone quarried locally at Birkrigg Common. Due to its elevated and exposed position, it is one of the most prominent landmarks in Cumbria. The hollow tower can be ascended via a spiral stone staircase of 112 steps. At the top, eight apertures provide a 360-degree panorama of the Furness Peninsula, Morecambe Bay and the southern Lake District. In recent times the formerly open apertures have been glazed. Sometimes simply known as \\"Hoad\\", the tower is also occasionally referred to as \\"the pepper pot\\". This epithet was famously used by Lord Haw-Haw during one of his propaganda broadcasts of World War II when he warned the residents of Ulverston that the German Air Force would bomb their pepper pot. Hoad Monument is normally open during the summer months when a flag is flying outside the monument. Ulverston Towns Lands Trust owns both the monument and Hoad Hill. Restoration In 2009/2010 the monument underwent a £1.2 million restoration. The majority of funding came in the form of a £891,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund with the Friends of the Sir John Barrow Monument collecting grants and donations for the rest. The restoration included a series of structural improvements to make the monument watertight, the most noticeable of these being the addition of a copper roof covering the stone dome, which was itself removed and rebuilt. The official reopening was on Sunday 22 August 2010 and was marked by a gala at Ford Park, barn dance and firework display. Leven Estuary.

The website was founded by Jay \\"Jayski\\" Adamczyk in 1996 after he had difficulty finding news regarding the Melling Racing team, and subsequently worked to get all NASCAR news grouped together on the site. The site was purchased from Adamczyk by ESPN in 2007; after ESPN shut the site down in January 2019, Adamczyk reacquired the rights to Jayski-related properties in April 2019 and rolled out a limited version of the new website with a full launch occurring on May 13, 2019. The term silly season refers to the period near and after the end of the annual NASCAR season when many teams seek to make changes to prepare for next season. Website The name for Jayski's Silly Season Site is a reference to the midpoint of the NASCAR season when rumors within the sport most often circulate. The main feature of the site is a \\"News and Rumors\\" page for the major three NASCAR series. The sites also hosts pictures of the paint schemes used by teams throughout that year, television schedules and tributes to deceased drivers. The site also lists series statistics and external links to teams and drivers.  History  Adamczyk founded the site in 1996 and used his moniker from his time in the military, Jayski, to brand the site. On December 3, 1999, Adamczyk quit his job as a computer programmer for the Federal Aviation Administration to work on the site full-time. Two years later, Jayski's content began to be featured on Knight Ridder's racing website, That's Racin'. That freed Adamczyk from several business commitments (such as advertising), and enabled him to focus solely on creating content, and hosting external links to newspaper and magazine stories on the NASCAR world. In January 2004, sports network ESPN began to host Jayski. In early April 2007, as part of its renewed interest in NASCAR following re-acquisition of broadcasting rights, ESPN purchased Jayski.com. Jayski underwent a stylistic overhaul in August 2009. The site was redesigned in early 2017, becoming part of ESPN.com, but Adamczyk continues to operate the site on a daily basis with a staff of two. Jayski's Silly Season Site was featured in Time's The 50 Best Websites of 2011. Jayski ran a podcast until 2013. Adamzcyk had later expanded the Jayski staff to include two other employees to compile information about NASCAR. On January 28, 2019, ESPN ceased operations of Jayski. The move was part of a wider exodus from NASCAR for ESPN, which also let go of reporters Ricky Craven and Bob Pockrass over the 2019 offseason. Many within the NASCAR community expressed gratitude for the two-plus decades that Jayski ran online. The domain of jayski.com was acquired back from ESPN in April 2019, and a partial site was rolled out while the search for a new web host partner began. A full site was revealed on May 12, 2019.

PSL was inspired by its predecessor, Standard Lisp and the Portable Lisp Compiler. It is tail-recursive, late binding (or dynamically bound), and was developed by researchers at the University of Utah in 1980, which released PSL 3.1; development was handed over to developers at Hewlett- Packard in 1982 who released PSL 3.3 and up. Portable Standard Lisp was available as a kit containing a screen editor, a compiler, and an interpreter for several hardware and operating system computing platforms, including Motorola 68000 series, DECSYSTEM-20s, Cray-1s, VAX, and many others. Today, PSL is mainly developed by and available from Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin (ZIB). Its main modern use is as the underlying language for implementations of Reduce. Like most older Lisps, in the first step, PSL compiles Lisp code to LAP code, which is another cross-platform language. However, where older lisps mostly compiled LAP directly to assembly language or some architecture dependent intermediate, PSL compiles the LAP to C code, which would run in a virtual machine language; so programs written in it are as portable as C in principle, which is very portable. The compiler was written in PSL or a more primitive dialect named System Lisp or SYSLISP as \\"... an experiment in writing a production-quality Lisp in Lisp itself as much as possible, with only minor amounts of code written by hand in assembly language or other systems languages.\\" so the whole ensemble could bootstrap itself, and improvements to the compiler improved the compiler. Some later releases had a compatibility package for Common Lisp, but this is not sustained in the modern versions. Criticism Portable Standard Lisp has fewer features than other Lisps, such as Common Lisp, and some people found it unpleasant to use. Richard P. Gabriel wrote in his popular essay Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big, \\"the third most standard Lisp was Portable Standard Lisp, which ran on many machines, but very few people wanted to use it;\\".

The seven most common elements include line, shape, texture, form, space, colour and value, with the additions of mark making, and materiality. When analyzing these intentionally utilized elements, the viewer is guided towards a deeper understanding of the work.  Line  Lines are marks moving in a space between two points whereby a viewer can visualize the stroke movement, direction and intention based on how the line is oriented. Lines describe an outline, capable of producing texture according to their length and curve. There are different types of lines artists may use, including, actual, implied, vertical, horizontal, diagonal and contour lines, which all have different functions. Lines are also situational elements, requiring the viewer to have knowledge of the physical world in order to understand their flexibility, rigidity, synthetic nature, or life.  Shape  A shape is a two-dimensional design encased by lines to signify its height and width structure, and can have different values of colour used within it to make it appear three-dimensional. In animation, shapes are used to give a character a distinct personality and features, with the animator manipulating the shapes to provide new life. There are different types of shapes an artist can use and fall under either geometrical, defined by mathematics, or organic shapes, created by the artist. Simplistic, geometrical shapes include circles, triangles and squares, and provide a symbolic and synthetic feeling, whereas acute angled shapes with sharp points are perceived as dangerous shapes. Rectilinear shapes are viewed as dependable and more structurally sound, while curvilinear shapes are chaotic and adaptable.  Form  Form is a three- dimensional object with volume of height, width and depth. These objects include cubes, spheres and cylinders. Form is often used when referring to physical works of art, like sculptures, as form is connected most closely with three-dimensional works..  Color  Color is an element consisting of hues, of which there are three properties: hue, chroma or intensity, and value. Color is present when light strikes an object and it is reflected back into the eye, a reaction to a hue arising in the optic nerve. The first of the properties is hue, which is the distinguishable color, like red, blue or yellow. The next property is value, meaning the lightness or darkness of the hue. The last is chroma or intensity, distinguishing between strong and weak colors. A visual representation of chromatic scale is observable through the color wheel that uses the primary colors.  Space  Space refers to the perspective (distance between and around) and proportion (size) between shapes and objects and how their relationship with the foreground or background is perceived. There are different types of spaces an artist can achieve for different effect. Positive space refers to the areas of the work with a subject, while negative space is the space without a subject. Open and closed space coincides with three-dimensional art, like sculptures, where open spaces are empty, and closed spaces contain physical sculptural elements. Texture Texture is used to describe the surface quality of the work, referencing the types of lines the artist created. The surface quality can either be tactile (real) or strictly visual (implied). Tactile surface quality is mainly seen through three-dimensional works, like sculptures, as the viewer can see and/or feel the different textures present, while visual surface quality describes how the eye perceives the texture based on visual cues.  Value  The scale between dark (black) and light (white) values. Value refers to the degree of perceivable lightness of tones within an image. The element of value is compatible with the term luminosity, and can be \\"measured in various units designating electromagnetic radiation\\". The difference in values is often called contrast, and references the lightest (white) and darkest (black) tones of a work of art, with an infinite number of grey variants in between. While it is most relative to the greyscale, though, it is also exemplified within coloured images.  Mark Making and Materiality  Mark making is the interaction between the artist and the materials they are using. It provides the viewer of the work with an image of what the artist had done to create the mark, reliving what the artist had done at the time. Materiality is the choice of materials used and how it impacts the work of art and how the viewer perceives it.

The theater showed films from its opening in 1942 until 1978. Its longtime manager, Ben Barenholtz, invented midnight movie programming for the theater. Following a gut renovation, the building reopened in 1982 as the Joyce Theater, a 472-seat dance theater. History Theater programming until 1977 The theater opened in 1942. It was designed in the Art Moderne style by Simon Zelnik and had seating for 600. The Elgin opened as a first-run cinema. In the 1950s through 1965 it presented Spanish-language cinema. In 1968, Ben Barenholtz assumed management of the theater and converted it to a repertory and art film house. The Elgin soon became noted for the innovation and variety of its programming, which ranged from revivals of classic Hollywood films; experimental works by Jonas Mekas, Kenneth Anger, and Andy Warhol; and films by then-emerging directors such as Jonathan Demme and Martin Scorsese. Around 1975, Steve Gould and Chuck Zlatkin took over management of the theater in partnership with Barenholtz and continued similar programming. With the midnight screening of Alejandro Jodorowsky's surrealist western El Topo on December 18, 1970, the Elgin became the first theater to show midnight movies. Barenholtz recalled, \\"I was told by the experts: 'Who's going to come see a film at midnight? You're out of your mind.' But within two years, there wasn't a city in the country that didn't have a midnight movie going.\\" El Topo premiered at The Elgin on December 17, 1970 and ran continuously seven days a week until the end of June 1971. Author Gary Lachman claims that the film Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969) \\"inaugurat[ed] the midnight movie cult at the theater.\\"Lachman, Gary (2001). Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius (New York: Disinformation). , p. 305. The theater was part of an efflorescence of revival cinema in New York City during this period. The New York Times film critic Vincent Canby observed, \\"There is a heaven for movie buffs and it could be here and now thanks to The Elgin, The Thalia, The Symphony and all those other houses that occasionally recall the past.\\" In May 1977, while continuing to present film, the theater began to mount programs of rock music and allied acts. These two-set evenings were produced by Bleu Ocean. There were local objections to noise from the concerts. Gay pornography controversy On March 20, 1977, Roger Euster, the owner of the Elgin, evicted his tenants, Gould and Zlatkin, for non-payment of rent totaling $21,393. He immediately signed a lease with Tel-a-Gay, a producer and exhibitor of gay films, who launched an all-gay-pornography program on March 21. The change inspired immediate protests by local citizens groups and picketing in front of the theater. The theater shut its doors the following day. Later that week, Euster and Tel-a-Gay President William Perry met with the community groups. They agreed to return the theater to its previous programming format on a trial basis to see if the operation could be sustained on the income. Conversion to a dance theater By late 1978, the theater had stopped showing films and was for sale. It was purchased in early 1979 by the Eliot Feld Ballet with the intention of converting it to a theater for smaller dance companies. The building reopened in 1982 as the 472-seat Joyce Theater. Philanthropist LuEsther Mertz underwrote the purchase of the theater in 1979, at a cost of $225,000. The renovated facility was named for her daughter, Joyce, to honor this contribution.

Environmental issues include continued deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, overgrazing, and significant land loss as a result of the presence of hundreds of thousands of land mines. Additionally, there is heavy mining within the country for gold, copper, and zinc. For years, mining was the only major source of revenue for the country and so this was encouraged by the national government . Significant strides towards sustainability and environmental recovery had originally been made by the Government of Eritrea. Although, the Eritrean Government had embarked on a program to reforest Eritrea (which in 1900 was 30% forested land, despite heavy logging) and prevent wood from being used as a fuel source, plans have been hampered in recent years because of a mass exodus of working Eritreans from the country. The government of Eritrea, with the assistance of the UN Development Program had enacted a Coastal Marine and Island Biodiversity Conservation Project which was designed to protect the entire coastal zone of Eritrea. This is the first project of its kind in scope and magnitude in the world. This program is meant to create a sustainable environment for coming generations. In recent years, the project has been hampered by the Eritrean government's continual encouragement of mining within the country which has affected the environmental stability of both highland and coastal regions.

Retrieved on May 3, 2010. the Tennessee Department of Corrections supervised sixteen prisons (counting two women's prisons as distinct from the men's prisons on the same site), including four private prisons operated by CoreCivic. These facilities have a total of 24,069 beds and an operating capacity to house 23,202 imprisoned individuals. On that date, 20,965 people were held in Tennessee prisons. History In 1923, the Administrative Reorganization Act created the Department of Institutions, charged with the management of the Tennessee prison system. In 1933 the General Assembly passed legislation that created an Industrial Division within the Department of Institutions. In 1937, the name was changed to the Department of Institutions and Public Welfare, which had responsibility for a Confederate Soldier's Home, a School for the Blind, a School for the Deaf, a Tennessee Industrial School at the state penitentiary, the Blind Commission, the Clover Bottom Developmental Center, three regional psychiatric hospitals, and the Gailor Center. In 1939, the Department of Institutions and Public Welfare was divided into a Department of Institutions and a separate Department of Public Welfare. In 1953, the responsibility over mental health facilities was separated into the Department of Mental Health, and in 1955, the Department of Institutions arrived at its present name, the Department of Correction. In 1961, the state legislature established the Division of Adult Probation and Parole within the department. In 1963, an act created a Division of Youth Services and provided for an assistant commissioner. In 1970, a Division of Rehabilitative Services was created by the General Assembly. In that same year, an act passed that relieved the Commissioner of the Department of Correction of the position of Chairman of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, with the position now being elected by Board members. Central office The Department of Corrections Central Office was moved to the Andrew Jackson State Office Building. In 1972 an act reformulated the Board of Pardons and Paroles, with the board now consisting of three full-time professional members appointed by the governor, including the chairman. In 1973 the Department of Corrections Central Office was moved to the First American Center. In 1974 the Tennessee Corrections Institute was create to train employees of the department. In 1978 the Board of Paroles expanded its membership to five. In 1979 the Department of Correction Central Office was again moved to the State Office Building, an act made the Board of Pardons and Paroles separate from the Department of Correction, the Board of Paroles became an autonomous unit, and the Department of Correction Supervision and Rehabilitation Fund was established. In 1982 disbursement of funds for the fund was transferred from the Tennessee Department of Revenue to the Department of Correction. In the mid-1980s, the Department fell under federal oversight after a federal lawsuit was filed by inmates, who had complained of overcrowding and unfit conditions. In 1985, in a special session, the General Assembly funded over $320 million to improve the prison system as part of a Comprehensive Correction Improvement Act. In November 1994, Tennessee's prison systems were released from federal oversight. Organization of the department In 1989, Tennessee Department of Correction's facilities were organized into three regions, East, Middle, and West, with administrators appointed for each region. The Department of Youth Services was created, with all juvenile responsibilities and functions transferred from the Department of Correction. In March 1992 the operation of the South Central Correctional Center was contracted to the Corrections Corporation of America, with the facility being a test case of privatization of prison operations. In 1994 the department's final two institutions passed American Correctional Association accreditation audits, making the department the first adult correctional system in the country to have all its programs nationally accredited. In 1995, the department was reorganized, and the regional concept was abolished. Recent legislation In 1997 legislation created the Sex Offender Treatment Board and Provider Network. DNA testing of all sex offenders required by legislation was begun. Legislation established the Tennessee Internet Crime Information Center, which provides online registries of sex offenders, missing children, and out-of-state parole and probation supervision. The departmental management system was restructured, and a programming planning section was created. Educational programming in institutions was also restructured. During the 100th Tennessee General Assembly, legislation was introduced to expand privatization of prison operations, but was deferred until the following session, when it was withdrawn from consideration. The General Assembly also passed a bill that allowed members of a victim's immediate family to watch an execution through a closed television circuit in an area separate from other witnesses. In 1998 the General Assembly established lethal injection as the method of execution for anyone that commits an offense on or after January 1, 1999. Legislation passed that transferred duties and responsibilities relating to probation services and community grant programs from the Department of Correction to the Board of Paroles, which had its name changed to the Board of Probation and Paroles. In 1999, the Department opened the first Security Threat Group in the Southeastern Tennessee State Regional Correctional Facility( Renamed Bledsoe County Correctional Complex ). In 2000, the Governor signed legislation making lethal injection, rather than electrocution, the standard method of execution for any person sentenced to death. Inmates sentenced to death for offenses committed prior to January 1, 1999 will be executed by lethal injection, or electrocution if the inmate requests it. Also becoming law in the year 2000 was a law that added a list of authorized witnesses for an execution. Additions may include one member of the defense counsel of the condemned as well as the Attorney General and the Reporter, or his or her designee. A Tennessee Volunteer Resource Board was created by the state legislature, which expanded the functions of the prior volunteer advisory board to include parolees as well as inmates and probationers. In 2001 a Director of Pre- Release Transition was appointed by the Commissioner of Correction to coordinate statewide pre-release programming, and a statewide contact to provide health care for the state's inmate population was added. On October 31, 2002, Tennessee's Felony Offender Information Lookup was launched, allowing the public to search for an inmate's location, inmate number, and early release date. In 2002 the state also launched the \\"Tennessee Bridges\\" program, with the Department of Correction and the Board of Probation and Parole receiving a 1 million dollar federal grant.

According to the state's Private Prison Contracting Act of 1986, which authorizes only one private prison for state inmates, Tennessee contracts directly with CCA for inmates held at South Central Correctional Facility. For the other three facilities the state circumvents the statute by contracting with the local county. In turn the county signs an agreement with CCA.

Geological issues The Main Ethiopian Rift is geologically active and susceptible to earthquakes. Hot springs and active volcanoes are found in its extreme east close to the Red Sea. Elsewhere, the land is subject to erosion, overgrazing, deforestation, and frequent droughts. Water shortages are common in some areas during the dry season. The causes of degradation are primarily the demand for more land for agriculture, fuel and construction as well as for grazing grounds. Endangered animals Ethiopian wolf The Ethiopian wolf is one of the rarest and most endangered of all canid species.

It was serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday between 1990 and 1996, and compiled into thirty-three tankōbon volumes. It was first adapted into two OVA series (and a single parody episode) produced by Pastel and released from 1992 to 1993. In 2015, an anime television series adaptation produced by MAPPA and Studio VOLN aired from July 2015 to June 2016. In North America, the OVA series has been licensed by ADV Films in 1998, and re- released in 2003, while the anime television series has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks in 2015. In 1992, Ushio and Tora won the 37th Shogakukan Manga Award for the shōnen category. As of 2015, the manga has over 30 million copies in circulation. Story Ushio and Tora centers around the travels and battles of Ushio Aotsuki, who is constantly being stalked and aided by a gigantic, supernatural, and sometimes invisible tiger-like monster named Tora. Ushio's family maintains a temple in Japan, where 500 years ago, his samurai ancestor battled that same monster to a standstill, and eventually trapped him against a rock using a cursed spear called the \\"Beast Spear\\", which grants strength, speed, and endurance to the wielder in exchange for his soul. Ushio accidentally unsealed the cave Tora was trapped in. Initially, Ushio refuses to remove the spear pinning Tora down (as Tora made the strategic blunder of mentioning that the first thing he would do upon being freed would be to devour Ushio), but Tora's unsealed presence attracts various monsters to the temple. Ushio is forced to free Tora, who would like to eat Ushio, but dares not since Ushio keeps the spear close by. The series focuses on their relationship, interspersed with battles against mythological foes, and with Tora's attempts to grapple with modern life. During the regular battles, Ushio slowly begins to notice that as much as Tora claims to be irredeemable, the demon takes to fighting evil and defending the innocent with more enthusiasm than he cares to admit. Media Manga Ushio and Tora, written and illustrated by Kazuhiro Fujita, was first serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday, from issue #6 of 1990, published on January 24, 1990 to issue #45 of 1996, published on October 23, 1996.

Plot The story revolves around Tazusa Sakurano, a Japanese Olympic figure skating candidate, and Pete Pumps, a Canadian stunt pilot. During a qualifying round in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Tazusa falls in the middle of a Triple Lutz and loses consciousness. At the same time, Pete dies mid-performance when his stunt plane crashes due to mechanical trouble. Unfortunately for Tazusa, Pete ends up involuntarily inhabiting her body for 100 days. During this time, Tazusa begins to develop romantic feelings for Pete, and falls in love with him. ; : :A Japanese figure skater known for her sharp tongue. She is on bad terms with the media and the public because of her cold attitude and string of bad luck in competitions. Her goal is to compete in the Winter Olympics in Torino (Turin, Italy). At the beginning of the series, she is possessed by the ghost of Pete Pumps and while she initially hated him, she gradually grew to accept his constant presence in her life and grew even more to love him. :While possessed, she picked up the habit of eating tomatoes, because her possessor Pete hates tomatoes, and using masochism, since Pete can share Tazusa's pain, to keep him in line. She has an unlucky tendency to fall asleep when she gets bored, but can never sleep the night before a competition. In the anime, she describes herself as \\"The 10 Billion Dollar Beauty.\\" :Initially Tazusa is portrayed as a bratty, cold girl. She doesn't have many friends and lives with her coach and sister. However after spending time with Pete, she slowly changes and opens her heart. Especially in school where Pete helps her through her exams. She also starts to express herself more during the skating routines which enable her to represent Japan in the Olympics. At the same time, Tazusa also falls in love with Pete and she finally realizes what is truly important to her. ; : :A Canadian stunt pilot who died when his stunt plane developed mechanical trouble and crashed in a fireball. As a ghost he needs to wait 100 days before he can go to Heaven (his date of ascension is February 23) and inadvertently ends up possessing Tazusa. :Pete likes Tazusa and tries to help her improve her public image and succeed in being selected for the Olympics. He even gets jealous of the reporter Kazuya Nitta, as Tazusa seems to have a crush on him. Though Tazusa at first doesn't agree with him and ignores him, he eventually wins her over and she starts to get to know him better, and he designs her \\"waitress on ice\\" performance. :Sometimes, as a way to punish him for annoying her or for any other reason, she will eat tomatoes which he has a strong hatred for. It is the only way she can torture him without having any physical or mental pain inflicted upon her as well (aside from the digestive problems that come when she eats too many, and the embarrassment resulting from this). :At the first stage of performing at the Olympics Pete kisses Tazusa then during their last performance, Pete kisses her in his ghost form and seems to love her in return. He bids her an emotional farewell as he finally departs. ; : :She is one of Tazusa's skating rivals. She is the preferred choice for the Japanese Olympic representative for Women's Figure Skating because she is closer to the Skating Federation's \\"ideal\\" and as such, she and Tazusa are quite competitive. She has a calm personality, and never likes to take risks. ; : :He is Tazusa's coach. He is an all-around nice guy, always seeing the good aspects in everyone. Tazusa and her younger sister live with him because of their parents' divorce. In the beginning of the series, he had believed that the reason why Tazusa was hitting and torturing herself (although it was to hit and torture Pete) was due to stress of having Japan's representative figure skater in the Olympics being chosen soon. He also believes that whenever she is insulting Pete, it is he who is the target of her nasty remarks and also considers this as part of her stress. He reveals Hitomi as his fiancée on Episode 9. ; : :He is a freelance reporter who has a secret crush on Kyōko and tries to help Tazusa in her battles with the mass media. He is a calm and collected figure who believes in and supports Tazusa. ; : :She is Tazusa's level-headed younger sister. She is often seen waking Tazusa up for breakfast and in her competition to cheer her as well. In the novel series, she also figure skates. ; : :She is Tazusa's quiet best friend and the designer of all of her skating outfits. A running gag in the anime consists of Tazusa yelling at Pete who is invisible to other people only to have Mika mistake the target of Tazusa's tirade as herself. Mika's voice actor also sings the ending theme of the anime series. ; : :She is an official from the Japan Skating Federation who claims that Tazusa has a \\"stone face.\\" In return Tazusa calls her Queen Nasty or Sarcastic the Third. However, she does believe that Tazusa has special potential, which is why she pushes her so hard. In the final episode she recognizes the changes in Tazusa's personality as she breaks her \\"stone face\\" in her final routine. She hints that there's more to come from Tazusa, she has only begun. ; : :She is an American figure skater and one of Tazusa's rivals. She is very antagonistic towards Tazusa. She is notable in the anime mainly because all of her lines were in (badly accented) English. ; : :She is a world-class Russian figure skater and the favorite to win gold in at the Winter Olympics. As such, she is Tazusa's strongest rival. She also used the same song as Tazusa in episode 6, prompting her to revise her short program and shift to free jazz. She is a very quiet but dedicated figure skater worthy of her title. Media Light novel The series was written by Rei Kaihara and illustrated by Hiro Suzuhira.

Household rubbish used to build a causeway in Cap-Haïtien. Environmental issues in Haiti include a historical deforestation problem, overpopulation, a lack of sanitation, natural disasters, and food insecurity. A major reason for these environmental issues is that there is not sufficient protection or management of the country's natural resources. Other environmental issues, such as decreases in precipitation and more severe natural disasters, will likely arise in Haiti as a result of climate change. Experts agree that Haiti needs to adopt new policies to address both the issues that already exist and to prepare for the effects of climate change.  Issues   Deforestation  A misleading satellite image of the border between the denuded landscape of Haiti (left) and the Dominican Republic (right). Deforestation in Haiti occurred primarily during the colonial period, and later after the Haitian revolution to pay a post-independence war indemnity to France. Deforestation has led to soil erosion by decreasing tree cover and leaving soil exposed. In the present era, arboreal fallow, or trees cleared for agricultural production, are then transformed into charcoal as a secondary agricultural by- product. Today, 'primary' forest cover in Haiti is estimated at less than 1% of all land area.Hedges SB, Cohen WB, Timyan J, Yang Z. 2018. Haiti's biodiversity threatened by nearly complete loss of primary forest. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA. 115(46):11850-11855 In an earlier study using the Food and Agricultural Organization (United Nations) global standard definition for 'forest', which includes areas that have been degraded by as much as 90% (10% canopy), approximately 30% of Haiti was estimated to be covered with trees and/or forests. However, because the United Nations definition does not distinguish between areas that have been previously deforested and those never deforested (primary forest), and the use of different canopy cover values can yield different per cent forest cover values, and because primary forest is the most important forest for the preservation of biodiversity,Giam X (2017) Global biodiversity loss from tropical deforestation. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 114:5775–5777Grosberg RK, Vermeij GJ, Wainwright PC (2012) Biodiversity in water and on land. Curr Biol 22:R900–R903Maxwell SL, Fuller RA, Brooks TM, Watson JE (2016) Biodiversity: The ravages of guns, nets and bulldozers. Nature 536:143–145 it is argued that only the value of <1% primary forest is relevant for environmental issues in Haiti because it addresses both deforestation and biodiversity. = Charcoal = Charcoal production and consumption in Haiti is a widely misunderstood phenomenon. Charcoal is the primary source of energy for Haitian residents. The UN reported that 92% of Haitian households rely on charcoal for cooking, and approximately 10,000 bags of charcoal are burned daily in Haiti. Media has popularly portrayed Haitians as engaged in a widespread and lucrative illegal market for charcoal in the neighbouring Dominican Republic. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti in 2014. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal. However new research and charcoal export data from the Dominican Republic indicate the flow of charcoal into Haiti has declined as Dominicans have found more lucrative charcoal markets in the United States and the Middle East. = Agriculture = It was once believed that Haiti's reliance on agriculture to support its economy is another primary reason for deforestation. 66.4% of the land in Haiti is used for agricultural purposes. Reallocating land for forest means a reduction in land available for cultivation of crops, and currently the land available is insufficient to keep pace with the growing population of Haiti. Additionally, insecure property rights discourage forest management; the possibility that tenants will reap the benefits of land conservation is reduced because it is possible that they may lose that property in the future. The Haitian government could encourage citizens to preserve forested land through the strengthening of property rights, as this would create greater responsibility of land use. Currently, there is a lack of off-farm opportunities; many rural residents depend on agriculture for their livelihood. An increase in off-farm employment could minimize deforestation, as this would potentially reduce the need for households to clear forest for crop.  Overpopulation  A dense slum in the capital Port-au-Prince. Early researchers claimed that an increasing Haitian population contributed to the degradation of the environment. However, recent research places Haiti as the country with the lowest per capita ecological footprint in the world. Haiti can be characterized as a low-income, high-density nation. As of 2012, Haiti's population count was at 10.6 million. The UN estimates that 52% of the population lived in urban areas in 2011, with an annual 3.9% annual increase in population in urban areas.Haiti. (n.d.). In T. Gall & D. Gleason (Eds.), Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations (pp. 315-329). Retrieved from Gale Virtual Reference Library database. Low-income individuals are largely concentrated in urban areas, especially Port-au-Prince, and are subject to poor environmental quality, human health, and quality of life.Josheph, M., Wang, F., & Wang, L. (n.d.). GIS-based assessment of urban environmental quality in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Habitat International. Retrieved from ScienceDirect database. Port-au-Prince's urban environmental quality is further reduced by its poor infrastructure, lack of government management, and its subjectivity to natural disasters, as a result of being located on the coast. As the population of urban areas in Haiti grows it is hard to update the already poor infrastructure to meet the needs of so many people. When an abundance of people doesn't have an adequate waste management system, it can have devastating effects on the environment through air and water pollution. Studies show that more than 60% of Haitians live in low environmental quality urban areas near the coast, such as Port-au-Prince. Environmental quality can be measured by assessing the domestic environment, public environment, physical environment and atmosphere. The areas with the lowest environmental quality have the highest population density and are subject to pollution and an array of natural hazards, which can destroy natural resources and cause environmental degradation. These individuals face a situation of environmental injustice. In rural areas, overpopulation causes over-cultivation of land and therefore soil erosion, as nutrients are quickly depleted from the soil. Although many Haitian farmers are aware of the effects of their practices on the soil, they are often reluctant to change their practices because political and economic factors, such as insecure property rights and high prices of capital, prohibit them from adopting proper technologies.  Lack of sanitation  The lack of sanitation and sewerage treatment in Haiti has led to an inadequate supply of safe drinking water. City sewerage systems are insufficient, and many citizens have to use septic tanks. Local drainage systems primarily consist of open channels dug along the side of the road. The densely populated capital of Port-au-Prince is especially at risk for water- borne diseases, with many of its citizens residing on flood plains in poorly constructed housing and a generally under-developed waste management system. Only 46% of the urban population has access to safe water, and in 2012 only 55% of people in urban areas had \\"improved sanitation\\", which consisted of using a latrine. Natural disasters make water sanitation even worse, as latrines and channels on the side of the road often overflow with large amounts of rain. A 2012 study after hurricane season found that less than 10% of households were drinking treated water a week after a storm.Kolbe, A., Puccio, M., & Muggah, R. (2012, December). After the storm: Haiti's coming food crisis. Retrieved from Eldis database. = Cholera = Cholera has become one of the leading issues facing Haiti, and its recurrence is largely due to Haiti's poor sanitation system. A Cholera epidemic was reported in Haiti in October 2010 after the infection was brought to the country by peacekeeping troops providing aid after a devastating earthquake struck the region. Infections have continued to occur since the initial epidemic, which raises questions as to whether there is an established environmental reservoir of Cholera in Haiti. Environmental reservoirs are environmental sources where the bacterium can survive between outbreaks of the disease. There is evidence that conditions are appropriate for Cholera to establish environmental reservoirs in the water of Haiti. The establishment of environmental reservoirs would make it nearly impossible to eradicate the disease from Haiti, and increase the chance of transmission of the disease neighbouring countries. Both improving sanitation and monitoring potential environmental reservoirs are necessary to reduce the spread of Cholera throughout Haiti.  Effects of climate change  Haiti's position as a Southern island nation makes it particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. Factors that make Haiti more vulnerable than other Caribbean nations, such as the Dominican Republic, are its higher population density, extensive deforestation, extreme soil erosion, and high income-inequality.Sheller, M., & Leon, Y. (n.d.). Uneven socio-ecologies of Hispaniola: Asymmetric capabilities for climate adaptation in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Geoforum. Retrieved from ScienceDirect database. Several effects of increased intensity of tropical storms, depleted coral reefs, and desertification. Since 1960 the mean annual rainfall has decreased by 5mm per month per decade, and mean temperatures have increased by .45 degrees Celsius. The combination of increased temperatures and decreased rainfall will likely lead to the intensification of drought conditions, especially in the centre of the country. According to the IPCC climate change predictions for 2050, more than 50% of Haiti will be in danger of desertification. The frequency of hot days and nights has increased, while the frequency of cold days and nights have steadily decreased. Sea-level rise is projected to rise between .13 and .56m by 2090. The US Climate Change Science program estimates that with each 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, hurricane rainfall will increase by 6-17% and hurricane wind speeds will increase by 1-8%. = Natural disasters = As a small Caribbean country, Haiti is often the victim of intense natural disasters such as hurricanes, tropical storms, and earthquakes, which have a large impact on both Haiti's environment and its citizens. The intensity of Atlantic hurricanes in Haiti has increased substantially since 1980. These storms frequently result in loss of human life, loss of livestock, destruction of agriculture, soil erosion, a spike in water-borne diseases, and decreased food security. Tropical storms often also lead to flooding, which is one of the leading causes of vulnerability in Haiti. Flooding often occurs in Haiti's most populous cities, which are located in valleys along the coast. Large amounts of rain, barren hills resulting from deforestation, and poor drainage infrastructure leave Haiti especially susceptible to flooding after tropical storms. Landslides also often result from the rain accompanying a tropical storm since much of the soil has eroded as a result of deforestation. From 1980-2009, Haiti had more deaths due to natural disasters than any other country in the insular Caribbean. The majority of deaths were caused by flooding or landslides, which resulted from the heavy rains of tropical storms combined with the unstable slopes left from deforestation. Poor infrastructure makes it difficult for people to cope with natural disasters on a basic level. A significant reason why other Caribbean countries experience lower death rates than Haiti is that their investment in physical infrastructure and human resources have led to risk reduction and successful disaster management. In Haiti, inability to evacuate leads to a much larger loss of life than a country with good public infrastructure and paved roads would experience in the same situation. Unfortunately, Haiti lacks both climate-resilient infrastructure and the funds to construct it. = Food insecurity = Roughly 40% of the total land in Haiti is farmed, with agriculture being the basis of the country's economy. Given agriculture's high dependence on natural ecosystem services, farming systems are at high risk to be negatively affected by climate change and climate-induced shocks. Food security is poor in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters, and more erratic and unpredictable rainfall will place strain on the agriculture industry in the future. Following the hurricanes of 2012, about 70% of Haitian residents reported suffering from moderate or severe hunger, and more than two-thirds of farmers reported having crops destroyed, losing materials to plant new crops, and/or losing farming equipment. A warning system to aid farmers in preparing for these natural disasters would be an efficient way to reduce the impact of storms on the agricultural system. The farming sector will also have to build resilience against drought and water scarcity as rainfall patterns change. Drought particularly affects the Northwest, Artibonite, and Centre departments of Haiti. Erratic rainfall patterns and poor water management infrastructure cause droughts, which destroy crops, reduce agricultural production, and decrease food security. Improved infrastructure could play a role in increasing food security, as Haiti largely relies on small rural farms and struggles to transport enough food from the countryside to village markets and urban centres. Specific improvements needed to aid the Haitian food system are improved public infrastructure and more paved roads.

It was officially established in 1862, but was used as a burial ground as early as 1844. The cemetery is the resting place of eight Medal of Honor recipients, but most are the less famous casualties of war. It was named for Brigadier General Henry Leavenworth, who was re-interred there in 1902 from Woodland Cemetery in Delhi, New York. Administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, it occupies approximately and was site to 22,679 interments, as of the end of 2005. It is maintained by Leavenworth National Cemetery. History On July 17, 1862, Congress enacted legislation that authorized the purchase of cemetery grounds to be used \\"for soldiers who shall have died in the service of the country\\". By 1870, the remains of nearly 300,000 Union dead had been buried in 73 national cemeteries. Most of the cemeteries were located near former battlefields or what were once war time camps. Fort Leavenworth National cemetery was one of the largest, at 36.1 acres. The Leavenworth cemetery was also closely associated with the Western Branch National Military Home, \\"old soldiers' home\\" (now VA Eisenhower Medical Center) and became a National Cemetery in 1973.United States Department of Veterans Affairs, \\"Cemeteries – Leavenworth National Cemetery\\" at http://www.cem.va.gov/cems/nchp/leavenworth.asp (accessed January 3, 2010). Due to military tradition, the cemetery was originally divided into burial areas for enlisted personnel and a separate area for officers, but in 1858 the remains were re-interred into a single site. In the years following the Civil War, the bodies of Union soldiers from Kansas City, Kansas and Independence, Missouri, were re-interred at Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery. In addition, the cemetery was used as the burial ground for soldiers who served at frontier posts of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming. By 1870, there were more than 1,000 Union soldiers interred at Fort Leavenworth, along with approximately 170 civilians and 7 Confederate prisoners of war. After the Indian Wars, between 1885 and 1907 many of the western Army outposts were vacated and as many as 2,000 remains were re-interred at Fort Leavenworth. Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 15, 1999.

Life Scholder was the son of Erlangen professor of Chemistry Rudolf Scholder. After his high school graduation, he studied Germanistics and Theology at the University of Tübingen and at Göttingen. After his academic promotion and his ordination as an evangelical pastor, he worked for the FDP's Bundestag faction. In 1958 he took up a post with the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg and at first was a parish steward at Bad Überkingen, only to move on to the Evangelical Priory of Tübingen in 1959. After his habilitation he worked as a private docent at the University of Tübingen and in 1968 received a professorship for Ecclesiastic Order. His work focussed on the Kirchenkampf, the intra-confessional struggle of German Christians during Hitler's Third Reich, on which he wrote Die Kirchen und das Dritte Reich (The Churches and the Third Reich). The two volumes are still considered a standard on the topic in Germany. A third volume was completed posthumously in 2001 by his student Gerhard Besier, now Director of the Hannah Arendt Institute for Research into Totalitarianism in Dresden. Political activities Influenced by Karl Georg Pfleiderer, Scholder joined the FDP/DVP. He was a major contributor to the cultural and religious points of view in the FDP's \\"Berlin Agenda\\" of 1957. In the late 1960s he was chairman of the FDP/DVP Tübingen District Association.

In pre- colonial times, its distribution was limited to the Old Continent and Africa; though it was established in most of Europe, it was not present in Finland, Ireland, or the northernmost reaches of Scotland, in spite of the fact that these countries feature climatic regions favorable to this plant and are in proximity to countries where the species is native, such as Russia, Estonia, Lithuania and England. It has successfully migrated to the New Europes where it can be found growing in meadows, alongside roads, and in fields. The name \\"cotula\\" is from a Greek word for \\"small cup\\", describing the shape of the flowers; it was assigned by Carl Linnaeus in his work Species Plantarum in 1753. Anthemis cotula is also known by a wide variety of other names, including mather, dog- or hog's-fennel, dog-finkle, dog-daisy, pig-sty-daisy, chigger-weed, mayweed, Johnnyweed, maroute, Maruta cotula, Cotula Maruta foetida, Manzanilla loca, wild chamomile, Camomille puante. Foetid Chamomile, maithes, maithen, mathor mayweed chamomile, camomille des chiens, camomille puante, stinkende Hundskamille, camomila-de-cachorro, macéla-fétida, and manzanilla hedionda. Description The \\"stinking chamomile\\" Anthemis cotula is so-named for its resemblance to the true chamomile plant, Anthemis nobilis; both have branching upright stems each topped by a single large flower head, although the \\"stinking chamomile\\" is distinguished by lacking the membraneous scales underneath the flowers of the true chamomile, as well as by its characteristic strong odor. The leaves of Anthemis cotula have a similar appearance to those of the fennel plant (Foeniculum vulgare), from which the name \\"Dog's Fennel\\" is derived. Anthemis cotula is an annual glandular plant with a harsh taste and an acrid smell. Its height varies from 12 inches (28 centimeters) to 24 inches (56 centimeters). ;Leaves: The leaves of the plant sometimes have very fine and soft hairs on the upper surface, although the plant is mostly hairless. There is no leaf stalk; leaves grow immediately from the stems. The leaves are pinnate in shape, with many extremely thin lobes, and can be around long. ;Flowers: Each stem is topped by a single flower head which is usually around in diameter. The flower head is encompassed by between 10 and 18 white ray florets, each with a three-toothed shape; the florets tend to curve downwards around the edges and may occasionally have pistils, although these do not produce fruit. Beneath the flower proper, oval bracts of the plant form an involucre, with soft hairs on each; further bracts are bristled and sit at right angles to the flowers. ;Fruits: The fruits are achenes (with no pappus). They are wrinkled, ribbed with ten ridges, and have small glandular bumps across the surface. Toxicity Anthemis cotula is potentially toxic to dogs, cats, horses, and guinea pigs. Clinical signs include contact dermatitis, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, allergic reactions. Long term use can lead to bleeding tendencies.ASPCA - Pet Care - Mayweed The foliage may also cause skin irritation.

Dog-fennel already had a reputation for being an aggressive invasive, however, so Appleseed's practice invited controversy. Harper's New Monthly Magazine in 1871 gave Appleseed credit for the overabundance of dogfennel: > The consequence was that successive, flourishing crops of the weed spread > over the whole country and caused almost as much trouble as the disease it > was intended to ward off; and to this day the dog-fennel, introduced by > Johnny Appleseed, is one of the worst grievances of the Ohio farmers.

Issues   Oil spills  Numerous spills have resulted from damage to Iraq’s oil infrastructure, and the lack of water treatment facilities at Iraqi refineries has led to pollution from those installations. This has many concerns for the population of Iraq.  Sanitation  Because of infrastructure damage, significant parts of the population do not have adequate water supply or sanitation systems.  Unexploded ordnance  Military operations in three wars (Iran–Iraq War, Gulf War, and Iraq War) have left unexploded ordnance and land mines in exposed positions, killing or wounding an estimated 100,000 people in the early 2000s.  Pollution  Sites where municipal and medical wastes have accumulated carry the risk of disease epidemics. The wartime destruction of military and industrial infrastructure has released heavy metals and other hazardous substances into the air, soil, and groundwater. In June 2003, a fire at the Al-Mishraq state run sulfur plant near Mosul burned for 3 weeks and was the largest human-made release of sulfur dioxide ever recorded. As of 2017, Iraq was one of only 3 countries in the world with widespread use of leaded engine gasoline for automobiles, the others being Algeria and Yemen. Concerns over the toxicity of lead led to a ban on leaded automobile gasoline in most countries.  Land degradation  In the alluvial plain, soil quality has been damaged by the deposit of large amounts of salts, borne by irrigation overflows and wind and promoted by poor soil drainage. Desertification and erosion also have reduced arable land.  River basins  Marsh Arabs in the wetlands. Transboundary pollution and a lack of river basin management by the government have led to the degradation of Iraq's major waterways. Under Saddam Hussein, the government constructed the Glory Canal which drained the extensive marshes in the lower reaches of the alluvial plain, changing water circulation and wildlife patterns over a wide area. Beginning in 2004, some restoration has occurred. According to a 2001 United Nations Environmental Programme report, the projects resulted in: * The loss of a migration area for birds migrating from Eurasia to Africa, and consequent decrease in bird populations in areas such as the Ukraine and the Caucasus. * Probable extinction of several plant and animal species endemic to the Marshes. * Higher soil salinity in the Marshes and adjacent areas, resulting in loss of dairy production, fishing, and rice cultivation. * Desertification of over . * Saltwater intrusion and increased flow of pollutants into the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, causing disruption of fisheries in the Persian Gulf.  Government response  Although the interim government appointed in 2004 included a Ministry of Environment, long-term environmental crises such as the depletion of marshland in the Shatt al Arab have a low priority. The government has made numerous efforts to help the environment and the people of Iraq.

The Department of Conservation was first created in 1937 by the State Government Reorganization Act of 1937. All areas used for state parks, monuments, and recreation were brought under a Division of Parks within the department later that year. For a short while in the late 1950s and early 1960s the department existed as the Department of Conservation and Commerce, but it was soon split, with the Department of Conservation regaining its name. The modern TDEC was created in 1991, with programs in the Department of Health and Environment shifted into the new department. TDEC is legally responsible for the protection of Tennessee's air, water, and soil quality. As of 2006, the department had at least fourteen divisions: the Division of Air Pollution Control, the Division of Archaeology, the Division of Geology, the Division of Ground Water Protection, the Division of Internal Audit, the Division of Natural Heritage, the Division of Radiological Health, the Division of Remediation, the Division of Solid and Hazardous Waste Management, the Division of Underground Storage Tanks, the Division of Water Pollution Control, the Division of Water Supply, the Recreational Services Division, and the Department of Energy Oversight Division. The department also manages Tennessee's state parks and the Tennessee Historical Commission. According to the Gubernatorial Papers housed at the Tennessee State Library and Archives in Nashville, the Department once had a Hotel & Restaurant Division, which currently is managed by the Department of Tourist Development. The first commissioner of TDEC was J.W. Luna, who served under Governor Ned Ray McWherter. Don Dills and Milton H. Hamilton Jr. were commissioners during the administration of Governor Don Sundquist. Jim Fyke held the position under Governor Phil Bredesen. The current commissioner is David W. Salyers, who was appointed in 2019 by Governor Bill Lee.https://www.tn.gov/environment.html/ In 2016 the environmental watchdog group, the Tennessee Clean Water Network, published a press release directed at the department's Division of Water Resources, claiming that the division, under the direction of the state's governor, had shown a significant drop-off in the number of penalties for businesses committing clear acts of water pollution. The state issues a certain number of permits to businesses to pollute local water, and if those permit levels are exceeded, the state has the option to enforce a penalty, which it had largely decided not to do.

Venezuela ranks among the world's most ecologically diverse countries, having for example, numerous bird species (avian biodiversity).Countries with the most number of bird species However, it has suffered great environmental degradation. It has the third-highest deforestation rate in South America, at 2.1 percent. The Guri Dam, one of the world's largest, flooded a massive forested area and is now being filled with silt deposited by runoff from deforested areas. Environmental issues include sewage pollution into Valencia Lake, oil and urban pollution of Maracaibo Lake, deforestation, soil degradation, and urban and industrial pollution, especially along the Caribbean coast. Current concerns also include irresponsible mining operations that endanger the rain- forest ecosystem and indigenous peoples. Successive governments have attempted to develop environmental regulations. However, only 35 to 40 percent of Venezuela's land is regulated thus far, 29 percent as part of national parks. Venezuela has ratified 14 international conventions regarding environmental protection and sustainable development, while also taking forward-looking steps internally to protect and preserve the country's natural wealth. Venezuela has 43 national parks and 36 natural monuments, and is the country in Latin America with the largest proportion of protected lands, with over 55 percent of its total territory. (Parks and monuments are only 17 percent of that total; the remaining protected areas are outside those parks and monuments.) The nation was ranked second in South America and ninth in the world on the Happy Planet Index of 2012, with a score of 56.9.  Water pollution   Zulia-Falcón area  Countless sewage systems with not only human waste but also chemicals pour into the sea all along the coast.  Eastern Venezuela  Several recent oil spills have led to water pollution. In February 2012 a PDVSA pipeline ruptured next to the Guarapiche River and fouled it for many days. The technicians in charge refused to close down the pumping because they did not want to stop the process, and this led to massive pollution of the area. A dam providing water to Maturín was said to be polluted, even though the national government denied this. This has led to a rupture between the national government and the Monagas governor.  Valencia Lake and Valencia Basin  The Valencia Lake, formerly praised by Alexander von Humboldt for its beauty, is massively polluted due to the countless sewage systems pouring residuals.Jafé, Espiño, Benítez, Gardinali (1995): Pollution chronology of Lake Valencia, Venezuela. Springer Verlag. New York Inc. Pollution levels in the whole Carabobo area have increased over the years. After the Carabobo governor denounced tap water as no longer drinkable, Hugo Chávez said that was part of an agenda of fear and what the opposition governor said was 'nearly criminal'. The city of Valencia, Los Guayos, Guacara and many other locations get their water supply from the Pao-Cachinche dam to the south of Valencia. At the same time, this dam gets about 80% of the sewage systems from Valencia. The installations for water treatment, the responsibility of the national government centre Hidrocentro, are in disrepair. In 2007 the national government decided to pump water from the Valencia Lake - water unfit for human consumption - to the Pao-Cachinche dam. It installed a pumping plant in Los Guayos to do this.

It also provides transmission and technical support for all of the independent non- military broadcasting services funded by the (BBG). The IBB is located in Washington, D.C.  History  On April 30, 1994, President Clinton signed the International Broadcasting Act (Public Law 103-236). The legislation established the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) within the United States Information Agency (USIA), and created a Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) with oversight authority over all non-military U.S. government international broadcasting. The Voice of America, the oldest and best-known organization within the BBG, was the first broadcast news organization to offer continuously updated programming on the Internet.www.chriskern.net When USIA was disbanded in October 1999, the IBB and BBG were established as independent federal government entities, with the IBB as an administrative vehicle under the BBG containing VOA, Radio and TV Martí, the Office of Engineering and Technical Services, and a number of support services. Other international broadcasting services supervised by the BBG are constituted as private corporations and are not part of the IBB. These include: * Radio Sawa and Al Hurra television (Arabic), * Radio Farda (Persian to Iran), * Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) * Radio Free Asia (RFA). Currently, the VOA and the IBB continue to operate shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at one site in the United States, located near Greenville, North Carolina.  Director  The position of IBB Director was appointed by the president of the United States, with Senate confirmation. The last IBB Director was Richard M. Lobo. Mr. Lobo was appointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in September 2010. He retired in November 2013 being the longest-serving IBB Director. He had implemented a management restructuring plan under which the responsibilities of the IBB Director would be assumed by a new CEO of the BBG.

It was named for Illinois State Treasurer at the time of its establishment, William Butler. Administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, it occupies approximately , and is the site of 19,825 interments as of the end of 2005. Camp Butler National Cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.  History  During the Civil War, Camp Butler was the second largest military training camp in Illinois, second only to Camp Douglas in Chicago. After President Lincoln's call for troops in April, 1861, the U.S. War Department sent then Brigadier-General William T. Sherman to Springfield, Illinois, to meet with Governor Richard Yates for the purpose of selecting a suitable site for a training facility. Since Governor Yates was unfamiliar with the land around Springfield, the state capital of Illinois, he enlisted the aid of then-State Treasurer William Butler, who along with Oziah M. Hatch, Secretary of State of Illinois, took a carriage ride with William T. Sherman to examine land about 5 and 1/2 miles northeast of downtown Springfield. An area near Riverton, Illinois (then known as \\"Jimtown\\", short for Jamestown) was selected, and named in honor of William Butler. A Union training facility was officially established there on August 2, 1861. By the war's end, over 200,000 Union troops would pass through Camp Butler. Along with the soldiers who fought on both sides of the Civil War, veterans who lost their lives in the Spanish–American War, both World War I and World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War are also buried at Camp Butler. There are also German and Korean prisoners of war buried there, relocated from a cemetery near Indianapolis, Indiana. Civil War Originally the camp was designed to train and \\"muster-in\\" Illinois troops for the Civil War, it was quickly pressed into service to house the approximately 2,000 Confederate soldiers who had been taken prisoner at the surrender of Fort Donelson, in Tennessee on February 16, 1862. An area was set aside for the burial of Confederate prisoners of war who died at the camp. As many as 700 prisoners died in 1862 when smallpox and other diseases were rampant in the camp. The situation was aggravated by the poor living conditions the prisoners endured there, and they were interred in the cemetery in their own Confederate section. A total of 866 Confederate prisoner's graves can be found today in the National Cemetery. The Confederate graves are easily distinguishable by the pointed headstones, which were instituted under the superstition that it was a means of preventing the devil from sitting on their graves. They are buried side by side with 776 graves of Union soldiers and enlistees, making a total of 1,642 Civil War graves.  Notable interments  * Seaman John H.

Issues include large-scale deforestation (much of it illegal) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; over-exploitation of marine resources; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanisation and economic development, including air pollution, traffic congestion, garbage management, and reliable water and waste water services. Deforestation and the destruction of peatlands make Indonesia the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species, including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as threatened, and 15 identified as critically endangered, including the Sumatran orangutan. History and background postal stamp of Indonesia featuring air pollution For centuries, the geographical resources of the Indonesian archipelago have been exploited in ways that fall into consistent social and historical patterns. One cultural pattern consists of the formerly Indianized, rice-growing peasants in the valleys and plains of Sumatra, Java, and Bali; another cultural complex is composed of the largely Islamic coastal commercial sector; a third, more marginal sector consists of the upland forest farming communities which exist by means of subsistence swidden agriculture. To some degree, these patterns can be linked to the geographical resources themselves, with abundant shoreline, generally calm seas, and steady winds favouring the use of sailing vessels, and fertile valleys and plains—at least in the Greater Sunda Islands—permitting irrigated rice farming. The heavily forested, mountainous interior hinders overland communication by road or river, but fosters slash-and-burn agriculture. Each of these patterns of ecological and economic adaptation experienced tremendous pressures during the 1970s and 1980s, with rising population density, soil erosion, river-bed siltation, and water pollution from agricultural pesticides and off-shore oil drilling. Marine pollution postal stamp of Indonesia \\"save mangrove forests\\" In the coastal commercial sector, for instance, the livelihood of fishing people and those engaged in allied activities roughly 5.6 million people—began to be imperiled in the late 1970s by declining fish stocks brought about by the contamination of coastal waters. Fishermen in northern Java experienced marked declines in certain kinds of fish catches and by the mid-1980s saw the worst virtual disappearance of the fish in some areas. Effluent from fertiliser plants in Gresik in northern Java polluted ponds and killed milkfish fry and young shrimp. The pollution of the Strait of Malacca between Malaysia and Sumatra from oil leakage from the Japanese supertanker Showa Maru in January 1975 was a major environmental disaster for the fragile Sumatran coastline. The danger of supertanker accidents also increased in the heavily trafficked strait. The coastal commercial sector suffered from environmental pressures on the mainland, as well. Soil erosion from upland deforestation exacerbated the problem of siltation downstream and into the sea. Silt deposits covered and killed once-lively coral reefs, creating mangrove thickets and making harbour access increasingly difficult, if not impossible, without massive and expensive dredging operations. postal stamp of Indonesia featuring overfishing Although overfishing by Japanese and American \\"floating factory\\" fishing boats was officially restricted in Indonesia in 1982, the scarcity of fish in many formerly productive waters remained a matter of some concern in the early 1990s. As Indonesian fishermen improved their technological capacity to catch fish, they also threatened the total supply.  Water pollution  Indonesia holds at as much as 6% of global freshwater stock which thanks to its rich rainforest and tropical climate. However, Indonesia has been losing its forest every year where in 2018, 440,000 hectares of forest were lost although this figure is lower than 2017. Such deforestation is associated with the reduction of water catchment capacity, as studies have found. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS) reported that 96% of rivers in Jakarta have been polluted, making fresh, clean water even more scarce. Water pollution is caused by both industrial and domestic waste. Indonesian government has regulated industrial in which companies are required to meet the wastewater standard. Indonesia was also a pioneer in public disclosure of industrial pollution data through a program called Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating (PROPER)Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating (PROPER) which has been implemented since 1995. PROPER incentivizes industries to disclose their pollution data by giving a rating based on their performance, hence affecting their reputation. This program helps strengthen the existing regulations which require industries to comply with industrial waste management standard. On the other hand, domestic water pollution is produced by households who dump trash and wastewater from household activities, such as bathing, washing, open defecation, etc., to the surface water. These behaviours are not always realized as the problem will be more apparent when the domestic wastewater has accumulated from all households, and caused eutrophication. The Environment and Forestry Ministry has reported that domestic wastewater as the major river polluter. With a growing population and higher rate urbanization, domestic wastewater will contribute more to the overall water pollution in the country, even in the rural areas where the use of chemical detergents is increasing rapidly. Both sources of pollution do not only deplete surface water quality, but also the groundwater. The chemical compounds from both industrial and domestic waste can sneak through the soil and when the groundwater is relatively shallow, these contaminants will mix with the clean water. Unless the government regulates domestic wastewater management and ensures a strong law enforcement for industrial waste, the risk of pollution will remain. In addition, information dissemination related to water pollution, albeit required by law, is limited which makes communities vulnerable to the impacts of water pollution.  Air pollution  The 1997 Indonesian forest fires in Kalimantan and Sumatra caused the 1997 Southeast Asian haze. It was a large-scale air quality disaster. The total costs are estimated at US$9 billion to health care, air travel and business. In 2013, the air quality in Singapore sank to its lowest in 15 years due to smoke from Sumatran fires. Singapore urged Indonesia to do more to prevent illegal burning.\\"Singapore pollution soars as haze from Indonesia hits air quality,\\" The Guardian, 19 June 2012 Deforestation and agricultural pollution Deforestation of a peat swamp forest for palm oil production in Indonesia A different, but related, set of environmental pressures arose in the 1970s and 1980s among the rice-growing peasants living in the plains and valleys. Rising population densities and the consequent demand for arable land gave rise to serious soil erosion, deforestation due to the need for firewood, and depletion of soil nutrients. Runoff from pesticides polluted water supplies in some areas and poisoned fish ponds. Although national and local governments appeared to be aware of the problem, the need to balance environmental protection with pressing demands of a hungry population and an electorate eager for economic growth did not diminish. Major problems faced the mountainous interior regions of Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Sumatra. These problems included deforestation, soil erosion, massive forest fires, and even desertification resulting from intensive commercial logging—all these threatened to create environmental disasters. In 1983 some 30,000 km2 of prime tropical forest worth at least US$10 billion were destroyed in a fire in Kalimantan Timur Province. The disastrous scale of this fire was made possible by the piles of dead wood left behind by the timber industry. Even discounting the calamitous effects of the fire, in the mid-1980s Indonesia's deforestation rate was the highest in Southeast Asia, at 7,000 km2 per year and possibly as much as 10,000 km2 per year. Although additional deforestation came about as a result of the government-sponsored Transmigration Program (transmigrasi) in uninhabited woodlands, in some cases the effects of this process were mitigated by replacing the original forest cover with plantation trees, such as coffee, rubber, or palm. In many areas of Kalimantan large sections of forest were cleared, with little or no systematic effort at reforestation. Although reforestation laws existed, they were rarely or only selectively enforced, leaving the bare land exposed to heavy rainfall, leaching, and erosion. Because commercial logging permits were granted from Jakarta, the local inhabitants of the forests had little say about land use, but in the mid-1980s, the government, through the Department of Forestry, joined with the World Bank to develop a forestry management plan. The efforts resulted in the first forest inventory since colonial times, seminal forestry research, conservation and national parks programs, and development of a master plan by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The use of fires to clear land for agriculture has contributed to Indonesia being the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the United States.The Washington Post, 19 November 2009 Forest fires destroy carbon sinks in old-growth rainforests and peatlands. Efforts to curb carbon emissions, known as Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), include monitoring of the progression of deforestation in Indonesia and measures to increase incentives for national and local governments to halt it. One such monitoring system is the Center for Global Development's Forest Monitoring for Actionde Nevers, Michele. Forest Monitoring for Action. cgdev.org platform, which currently displays monthly-updating data on deforestation throughout Indonesia.  Emissions  Greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia result from seasonal fires, deforestation, and the burning of peat. Depending on the severity of seasonal fires, Indonesia may range from the third to the sixth largest annual emitters. Greenhouse gas emissions produced by Indonesia represent a significant fraction of the world total. Indonesia has been called the \\"most ignored emitter\\" that \\"could be the one that dooms the global climate.\\" It is \\"one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases\\" (GHG). 2013 measurements show Indonesia's total GHG emissions were 2161 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent which totaled 4.47 percent of the global total. In 2014, it was ranked eighth highest on the list of countries by greenhouse gas emissions. During the 21st century, an area of forest roughly equivalent to the size of the US state of Michigan (92,000 square miles) has been cut down, mainly in order to expand palm oil plantations. Indonesia plans to double its consumption of coal by 2027 in order to build new coal power plants.  2010 fires  The 2010 Southeast Asian haze was an air pollution crisis which affected many Southeast Asia countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore during the month of October in 2010. This occurred during the dry season in October when forest fires were being illegally set off by Indonesian smallholders residing in the districts of Dumai and Bengkalis, in the Riau province of Sumatra. These farmers use the slash and burn method to clear off land rapidly for future farming opportunities. The number of fires in Sumatra peaked on 18 October, with 358 hotspots.  2015 fires  In 2015, Indonesia had severe fires that lasted for almost two months. Peat was the main fuel source. An El Niño had caused a particularly dry season that worsened the situation. The fires released enough greenhouse gasses for Indonesia to produce more daily emissions than the United States for 38 days. Mining and the environment Buyat Bay was used by PT Newmont Minahasa Raya from 1996 to 2004 as a tailings dumping ground for its gold mining activities.Mamonto, PDL, Sompie, CED & Mekel, PA (2012) \\"Sustainable development for post-closure – a case study of PT Newmont Minahasa Raya\\", in AB Fourie & M Tibbett (eds), Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Mine Closure, Australian Centre for Geomechanics, Perth, pp. 279–293. Natural environmental hazards Natural hazards include occasional floods, severe droughts, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanoes and forest fires. Human activities can help cause or exacerbate these hazards. For Indonesia, coastal flooding and the rising sea level are viewed to be among the major risks posed by climate change.Overland, Indra et al.

Government policies  The Indonesian government has voluntarily committed to a minimum 26 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and by 29 percent by 2030.Indonesia pledges to cut carbon emissions 29% by 2030, The Guardian, 2 September 2015 However, Indonesia has been ineffective in implementing policies to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. As of 2018, government policies were increasing emissions. These policies include the construction of 100 coal-fired power plants, the expansion of palm oil production, and the increase of biofuel consumption. Indonesia developed climate policy related to land use and forestry emissions. A moratorium on clearing of primary forests and peat lands was extended from two to four years. The Indonesian government is seeking to reduce poverty by 4 percent by 2025, but strong climate policies could make this impossible to achieve. International assistance could enable Indonesia to reduce its emissions by an estimated 41 percent by 2030.

Conceptualized in the early 1960s by the Department of Forestry and Rural Development (later the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources), the CLI was a federal-provincial project that lasted from 1963 to 1995 and produced maps which indicated the capability of land to sustain agriculture, forestry, recreation and wildlife; its geographic extent was all of Canada except the North (i.e. below the tree line). CLI used a common classification scheme and common mapping scales (1:50K 1:250K and 1:1 million). Land capability for agriculture, forestry, land-use, recreation, wildlife (ungulates and waterfowl) were mapped The large amount of data generated by the CLI saw the early adoption of the world's first geographic information system (GIS), called the Canada Geographic Information System (CGIS). Current use Since 1995, the CLI agriculture data have been taken over by the Department of Agriculture to continue rating agricultural land capability. The CLI in this modified form consists of a soil survey with rankings from 1 to 7, with Class 1 soil having no limitations for arable crop production and Class 7 having no capability for agricultural activities. Classes 1-3 are considered prime agricultural land, and are protected by land use policies in certain provinces, including Ontario. Classes 2-6 have certain limitations for arable crop production, denoted by sub-classes which specify the limitations of the soil (for example, excessive water, adverse climate, stoniness). The results are mapped on 1:250,000 NTS grids.

Remoch was a medical doctor in Fraga, Spain in the 14th century. He had contact with prominent Jews of his day, such as Benveniste ibn Labi of Zaragoza. In 1391, Astruc Remoch was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, taking the name Francisco Dias-Carni. Following his conversion, Remoch's belief in the Catholic doctrine of Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus was so strong that he endangered his old Jewish friend En-Shealtiel Bonfos, (probably a son of the physician Isaac Bonfos born Shealtiel of Falces), in his efforts to get Bonfos to convert as well. Remoch (Francisco) wrote a letter to his friend in Hebrew, critical of Judaism and supportive of the beliefs of Christianity. In response, Remoch received two letters. Bonfos composed a careful response to what was a very delicate topic during the Inquisition, avoiding any statements that the Church might find offensive. The satirical poet Solomon ben Reuben Bonfed wrote his own much less careful reply to Remoch's arguments in a rhyming prose that attacked each of Remoch's arguments. Solomon first apologizes for his interference in matters that are none of his business, then insists that as a Jew he cannot remain silent amidst the argument, and continues to argue that the Christian belief system was unsupportable, stating, \\"You twist and distort the Bible text to establish the Trinity.\\"  Sources  * JewishEncyclopedia.com - RAIMUCH (REMOCH), ASTRUC * POLEMICS AND POLEMICAL LITERATURE (Jewish Encyclopedia) - BibleWiki Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Judaism Category:14th-century Sephardi Jews Category:Spanish Roman Catholics Category:Medieval Aragonese Jews Category:14th-century people from the Kingdom of Aragon Category:Medieval Spanish physicians Category:Medieval Jewish physicians of Spain Category:Spanish Jews Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:14th-century physicians ","title":"Astruc Remoch"},{"id":"4243335","text":"right Gabriel Antonio José Pereira Villagrán (Montevideo, 17 March 1794 - 14 April 1861) was a Uruguayan politician, son of Antonio Pereira, of Portuguese ancestry, and wife María de la Asunción Villagrán e Artigas.

Along with the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, enacted six days later, it formed an important part of the White Australia policy. In 1901, there were approximately 10,000 Pacific Islanders working in Australia, most in the sugar cane industry in Queensland and northern New South Wales, many working as indentured labourers. The Act ultimately resulted in the deportation of approximately 7,500 Pacific Islanders.  History of the Act  Beginning in the 1860s, tens of thousands of Pacific Islanders were brought to Australia as low-paid labourers. By the early 1890s, 46,000 labourers had arrived in Queensland, and up to 62,000 such labourers arrived in all. Many of these people had been forcibly removed from their homes, in a process called \\"blackbirding\\", by which Islanders were either kidnapped or deceived into traveling to Australia. They were brought in to meet the growing need for cheap labour in the sugar industry, since white labour was scarce and expensive. The majority of such labourers were employed under indentured labour arrangements, whereby they received either no pay or extremely small amounts of pay. By 1880, Queensland legislation prevented Pacific Islanders from working in higher paid jobs in sugar mills and other industrial areas, and limited them to manual agricultural labour.  Provisions of the Act  The Act prohibited any Pacific Islanders from entering Australia after 31 March 1904, and required all those entering before then to have a licence. During 1902, the maximum number of licences that could be issued was limited to three-quarters of the number of Pacific Islanders who left Australia in 1901. During 1903, this licence quota was lowered even further, to half of the total departures in 1902. Any person who brought a Pacific Islander into the country contrary to the Act could be fined £100. It was an offence to employ a Pacific Islander in any other way than an indentured labour agreement, punishable by a fine of £100. The most forcible component of the legislation was section 8. It provided that any Pacific Islander found in Australia after 31 December 1906 could be deported immediately by order of the Minister for External Affairs, and any Islander found in Australia before that date, who had not been employed under an indentured labour agreement at any time in the preceding month, could be deported immediately by order of a Magistrate in summary proceedings. Section 7 provided all labour agreements made with Pacific Islander labourers no longer remained in force from 31 December 1906. The practical effect of the legislation was that by this date, Pacific Islanders were legally barred from undertaking labour contracts in Australia and ultimately compelled to return to their country of origin. There were various grounds for exemption from deportation, including marriage to an Australian. The case of Robtelmes v Brennan (1906) 4 CLR 395, the first deportation case to come before the High Court of Australia, provides an illustration of the Act's operation..

Environmental issues in Kenya include deforestation, soil erosion, desertification, water shortage and degraded water quality, flooding, poaching, and domestic and industrial pollution. Water resources Water resources in Kenya are under pressure from agricultural chemicals and urban and industrial wastes, as well as from use for hydroelectric power. The anticipated water shortage is a potential problem for the future. For example, the damming of the Omo river by the Gilgel Gibe III Dam together with the plan to use 30% to 50% of the water for sugar plantations will create significant environmental problems. It is estimated that up to 50% of Lake Turkana's water capacity will be lost. Had there been no planning of the irrigation of sugar plantations, the dam itself might have had a net positive effect to the environment, due to the emission- less power generation of the dam.Jeppe Kolding  University of Bergen - Academia.edu Water-quality in Kenya has problems in lakes, (including water hyacinth infestation in Lake Victoria), have contributed to a substantial decline in fishing output and endangered fish species. Animal poaching An African elephant in Amboseli National Park, Kenya. There are a wide variety of wildlife species in Kenya, whose habitats are threatened by encroachment of man and the poachers that live in rural Kenya. Michael Werikhe aka Rhino Man, pioneered Kenyan wildlife conservation. Werikhe walked thousands of kilometres and raised millions of dollars to fund White Rhino conservation projects. The Blue Wildebeest is currently abundant, but like other more endangered species feels the pressure of habitat reduction. This wildlife consists of lions, elephants, gazelles, and rhinos. Between 1970 and 1977, Kenya lost more than half of its elephants. Though elephant hunting has been banned for 40-years in Kenya, poaching has not reduced. Given the poverty of many of the people, and the high value of elephant tusks, they are shipped overseas and sold on the black market. Although Kenya has many national parks and reserves protecting wildlife, elephant populations are still at risk, a problem which is made worse by corruption and some officials supplementing their income with permitting poaching. In 2020 February, Poachers in Kenya Killed two White Giraffes. The Female White Giraffe and her calf were found dead in Garrisa County which is the North east part of the country. This left the country and the world with only one white male giraffe. Recently, as the Chinese sales of projects in Africa increase at a high annual growth rate, their contractors are encountering new challenges regarding wildlife protection during project construction. Using the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway project constructed by the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Deforestation Forestry output has also declined because of resource degradation. Overexploitation over the past three decades has reduced the country's timber resources by one-half. At present only 2% of the land remains forested, and an estimated 50 square kilometres of forest are lost each year. This loss of forest aggravates erosion, the silting of dams and flooding, and the loss of biodiversity. Among the endangered forests are Kakamega Forest, Mau Forest and Karura Forest. In response to ecological disruption, activists have pressed with some success for policies that encourage sustainable resource use. The 2004 Nobel Peace Prize went to the Kenyan environmentalist, Wangari Maathai, best known for organizing a grassroots movement in which thousands of people were mobilized over the years to plant 30 million trees in Kenya and elsewhere and to protest forest clearance for luxury development. Imprisoned as an opponent of Moi, Maathai linked deforestation with the plight of rural women, who are forced to spend untold hours in search of scarce firewood and water. Widespread poverty in many parts of the country has greatly lead to over- exploitation of the limited resources in Kenya. Cutting down of trees to create more land for cultivation, charcoal burning business, quarrying among other social and occupational practices are the major threats of environmental degradation due to poverty in rural Kenya. Regions like Murang'a, Bondo and Meru are affected by this environmental issue.  Littering and solid waste collection  Collected solid waste that has spilled onto a road uwongooo. Littering and the illegal dumping of rubbish is a problem in both urban and rural Kenya. Almost all urban areas of Kenya have inadequate rubbish collection and disposal systems uwongooo. Flooding There is the risk of seasonal flooding during July to late August months. In September 2012, thousands of people were displaced in parts of Kenya's Rift Valley Province as floodwaters submerged houses and schools and destroyed crops. It was especially dangerous as the floods caused latrines to overflow, contaminating numerous water sources. The floods can also cause mudslides and two children were killed in September 2012 following a mudslide in the Baringo District, which also displaced 46 families.

Global environmental issues in Kyrgyzstan  Kyrgyzstan has a lot of problems including: Global climate change, ozone layer depletion, desertification, and biodiversity loss are among global environmental issues presently on the agenda in Kyrgyzstan. * Global climate change. Kyrgyzstan acknowledged the problem of global climate change and in 2003 ratified the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is estimated that the energy sector of the country is responsible for emissions of approximately two-thirds of its total carbon dioxide, and in absolute terms this amount will likely grow, even though with the increase in share of produced hydropower. Related to global climate change in Kyrgyzstan is a problem of deglaciation. The area occupied by glaciers has decreased by 20% lately and there are concerns that glaciers in the country can disappear by 2100.Стратегия Развития Страны на 2009-2011, пункт 758 * Ozone layer depletion. Kyrgyzstan acknowledged the global problem of ozone layer depletion and in 2000 it ratified the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. * Desertification. The country acknowledged the problem of desertification and in 1999 it acceded to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Desertification poses a real threat for Kyrgyzstan. According to the Country Development Strategy for 2009–2011, of 10.6 million hectares of total agricultural land more than 88% were found to be degraded and subject to desertification, areas of soil resalinization have increased and amounts to 75% of all arable land, and approximately half of all pasture lands are classified as degraded for both vegetation and soils.Стратегия Развития Страны на 2009-2011, пункт 118 * Biodiversity loss. In terms of biological diversity Kyrgyzstan holds a prominent place worldwide: it possess around 1% of all known species while its area makes up only 0.13% of world land. According to Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, the threats to biodiversity are related to anthropogenic activity and include habitat loss and alteration, fragmentation of natural communities due to overuse, over harvesting, direct mortality, introduction of non-native species, environmental pollution, and climate change.Kyrgyz Republic: Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan The Concept of Ecological Security states that among natural factors that affect biodiversity in Kyrgyzstan are desertification and climate change. Kyrgyzstan acknowledged the problem of biodiversity and in 1996 acceded to Convention on Biological Diversity. Regional environmental issues in Kyrgyzstan * Wastes of the mining industry. Waste of the mining industry poses a direct threat to the environment of both Kyrgyzstan and neighboring countries. Located at high elevations in a fragile mountain environment the mining industry has generated hundreds of millions of tons of waste rock and tailings in dumps and tailings ponds which serve as a source of permanent pollution of the environment by heavy metals, radioactive materials and cyanides. The bulk of the mining waste is located in river basins and since Kyrgyzstan belongs to those areas subjected to a great extent to natural disasters such as earthquakes and landslides, presents high risk of trans-boundary pollution. The potentially affected population in Kyrgyzstan, and near border areas of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan is estimated as of 5 million.Стратегия Развития Страны на 2009-2011, пункт 117 *Water pressures. Sharing of natural resources is a significant issue among the countries of Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have significant water resources originating from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, which in the Soviet Era was shared with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan in return for gas, oil, and electricity. However, modern damming projects, such as the Kambarata-1 Dam on the Naryn river and Toktogul Dam on the Syr Darya (both examples of Kyrgyz dams affecting regional water pressures), have caused Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to lose their surplus of electricity and thus their ability to barter for water with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. By the late 1990s the Soviet resource-sharing system had completely broken down, and a new system has yet to be put in place due to lack of political will and distrust between the Central Asian republics.International Crisis Group. \\"Water Pressures in Central Asia\\", CrisisGroup.org. 11 September 2014. Retrieved 7 October 2014. National environmental issues * Air pollution. The air pollution has increased as a serious problem in urban centers during the last years. The major sources of air pollution are energy and construction materials sectors, mining and processing industries, households using coal, and transport. Air quality deterioration is related to more extensive use of coal in combined heat power plants instead of natural gas, using low-grade fuels in households, and growing vehicle fleet that involves many old, poorly maintained vehicles.Концепция экологической безопасности Кыргызской Республики * Water pollution. The major sources of water pollution are industrial wastewater, wastewater from agriculture, household wastewater, landfill leachate, and mine drainage. Municipal wastewater collection systems collect only about 70% of all municipal wastewater. Only 20% of the total volume of wastewater are discharged into wastewater treatment plants.UNECE's 2nd Environmental Performance Review of Kyrgyzstan Another problem is low capacity of surface water monitoring network that substantially degraded during the last 20–25 years. * Degradation of mountain ecosystems. Kyrgyzstan is a mountainous country with 90% of its area located at altitudes of above 1,500 meters. Large-scale technological pressure on fragile mountain ecosystems by mining and infrastructure projects, and the agricultural sector served to disturb the balance and to accelerate of a number of natural hazards. * Solid waste management : Industrial waste. Management of industrial waste is an issue in Kyrgyzstan. Some 92 mining sites that contain 250 million cubic meters of toxic and radioactive waste are located in Kyrgyzstan. From 1999 to 2007, the area occupied by these sites has increased from 189.3 hectares to 381 hectares.Стратегия Развития Страны на 2009-2011, пункт 117 : Municipal solid waste. Management of household waste does not comply with sanitary and environmental requirements, there is no adequate waste utilization. For example, Bishkek municipal landfill designed for 3.3 million cubic meters presently contains 24 million cubic meters of household waste. : Agricultural waste. Agricultural waste is not managed in a proper way. Specifically, it relates to waste of large-scale farms. * Natural and man-made hazards. The area of Kyrgyzstan is a subject of more than 20 natural hazards including earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, flooding, mudflows, rock slides, etc. that pose a threat to people's health, and cause damage to property.  The role of non-profit organizations  Environmental NGOs in Kyrgyzstan constantly assess the environmental problems, and keep track of it on EKOIS , a Kyrgyz Environmental News Service.

Environmental issues   Water supply  Annual rainfall averages only between 200 and 600 millimeters in the most arable portions of Libya. The Great Manmade River Project, designed to bring water from fossil aquifers beneath the Sahara, has no long-term viability because of the finite nature of the fossil reserves. A major environmental concern in Libya is the depletion of underground water as a result of overuse in agricultural developments, causing salinity and sea-water penetration into the coastal aquifers. The Great Man-Made River Project, currently under development to transport water from large aquifers under the Sahara Desert to coastal cities, is the world's most extensive water supply project.  Pollution and desertification  Another significant environmental problem in Libya is water pollution. The combined impact of sewage, oil byproducts, and industrial waste threatens Libya's coast and the Mediterranean Sea generally. Libya has 0.8 cu km of renewable water resources with 87% used in farming activity and 4% for industrial purposes. Only about 68% of the people living in rural areas have pure drinking water. Libya's cities produce about 0.6 million tons of solid waste per year. The desertification of existing fertile areas is being combated by the planting of trees as windbreaks.  Endangered species  As of 2001, 11 of Libya's mammal species and 2 of its bird species were endangered. About 41 of its plant species were also endangered. Endangered species in Libya include the Mediterranean monk seal, the leopard, and the slender-horned gazelle. The Bubal hartebeest and Sahara oryx are extinct.

Background right Way was born in Portsmouth, England. Reverend James Way, his father, was a clergyman in the Bible Christian Church, who emigrated to Adelaide, South Australia in 1850 along with his wife and four younger children to establish a mission. Samuel, the eldest child, remained behind, studying at Shebbear College in Shebbear, a small village in North Devon, and later at a school in Chatham in Kent. He left England to rejoin his family at the end of 1852, arriving in Adelaide in March 1853. He was soon employed in the office of John Tuthill Bagot, at that time a barrister, and in 1856 became an articled clerk to Alfred Atkinson (c. 1825 – 4 June 1861), solicitor of King William Street. Legal and judicial career On 25 March 1861, Way was admitted to the South Australian Bar to practice law, and when Atkinson died shortly afterwards, Way inherited his practice. Way practised as a barrister and quickly became a leader among the legal community, and in 1868 joined a partnership with another barrister, James Brook. In September 1871, Way was made a Queen's Counsel, despite having been admitted to the bar only ten years earlier. When Brook died in 1872, a young Josiah Symon joined Way as partner. Way continued to be highly successful, travelling to London to argue a number of cases before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In 1874, Way was elected as a member of the council of the University of Adelaide, and was also appointed to the South Australian Board of Education. In 1875, Way was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as the member for Sturt, and on 3 June of that year joined the Boucaut government as Attorney-General of South Australia. He was only a politician for a short time, however, since in March 1876, at the age of just thirty-nine, he was appointed Chief Justice of South Australia following the death of Richard Hanson on 4 March. Since it is the role of the Attorney-General to recommend judicial candidates to the cabinet, it has been suggested that Way probably nominated himself to be Chief Justice. Way soon gained a reputation as an excellent lawyer, and it has been said that none of his decisions were ever successfully appealed to a higher court. Later in 1876 he was appointed as the vice-chancellor of the University of Adelaide, and in 1883 became the chancellor, a position he would hold until his death. Statue of Sir Samuel Way on North Terrace, Adelaide in front of the University of Adelaide. In 1877, Way was called upon to act as acting Governor of South Australia. In January 1891 he was appointed to the position of Lieutenant- Governor of South Australia, a position subordinate to the state Governor. In January 1897, Way became the first Australian to be appointed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In 1899 he was created a Baronet, of Montefiore, North Adelaide, and Kadlunga Mintaro, both in the Colony of South Australia. In October 1905, it was Way who publicly pronounced that Catherine Helen Spence, writer and suffragist, social worker and feminist was the most distinguished woman in Australia. Way was a Freemason and Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of South Australia and Northern Territory from 1884 to 1916, apart from the period 1889–95 when the position was occupied by the Governor, the Earl of Kintore.Past Grand Masters of The Grand Lodge of South Australia and Northern Territory Accessed 4 May 2015. Personal life Way married Mrs. Katherine Gollan Blue (née Gordon) on 11 April 1898. She was the widow of Dr. William Archibald Sinclair Blue (died 18 September 1896) of Strathalbyn. W. A. Blue was father of Shylie Katharine Blue (1882-1959) mother of Henry Way Rymill. The time and whereabouts of the wedding, which was the subject of great public interest, were a closely kept secret until well after the event. Easter view of Montefiore, residence of Sir Samuel Way at North Adelaide in approximately 1890. After his death the second storey was removed. Way became ill in 1914, and was diagnosed with cancer. He travelled to Sydney to have his arm amputated, in an attempt to delay the cancer. The operation failed to prevent his health from deteriorating, but he continued his work as Chief Justice until December 1915. He died early the following year in North Adelaide. Recognition Samuel Way Building on Victoria Square, Adelaide The baronetcy became extinct on his death. The geological feature Mount Sir Samuel and the town of Sir Samuel in the Goldfields region of Western Australia were named after him. A statue was unveiled on 17 November 1924, located on North Terrace, Adelaide, in front of the University of Adelaide. The Sir Samuel Way Building on Victoria Square, Adelaide, was originally a major retail outlet for Charles Moore and Co. In 1983 it became a facility of the City Courts and was named after him.

Passage The treaty was ratified by Colorado's legislature on February 21, 1939, then by Texas and New Mexico's legislatures on March 1. It was finally adopted on December 19, 1939 after passing through Congress (as Public Act No. 96, 76) and being signed into law on May 31, 1939. The act was amended at the thirteenth Annual Meeting, on February 25, 1952. Summary Colorado committed to deliver a certain amount of water to the New Mexico state line, based on water runoff as measured at four index stations located in the area of the Rio Grande's headwaters. The compact provides for an indexed schedule of required water deliveries from Colorado, based on gauged stream flows, and, under certain circumstances, a system of debits and credits in water deliveries that also permits water storage with the combined capacity of Elephant Butte and Caballo Reservoirs. The compact also sets a minimum quality standard, as in the event that Colorado was to construct water projects later for the purpose of delivering water into the Rio Grande from the Closed Basin, the state would not be credited with the water delivered unless the sodium ions in the water do not exceed 45% of the total positive ions when the total dissolved solids in the water exceeds 350ppm. Results Between 1939-1966, Colorado virtually ignored the compact. The result was that by 1966, due to Colorado's non-compliance with the Compact, Colorado owed New Mexico one-million acre feet (1.2 km³) of water, and New Mexico owed Texas . New Mexico and Texas collectively sued Colorado to try to force compliance, and between 1966–1967, the case progressed and was eventually heard by the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1985, after several affluent years of water flow from the Rio Grande, the Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs reached capacity, having received more water than they could hold. The terms of the Compact state that once the Elephant Butte reservoir is filled, New Mexico and Colorado are immediately released from any water debt they have accrued. Colorado's debt to New Mexico at the time, of water, was immediately cleared, settling the balance between the two states, but leaving New Mexico in an unfortunate position in its debt to Texas. In 1996, when the reservoir was again close to capacity, the New Mexico water districts below Elephant Butte authorized water from the reservoir to be pulled out and dumped in the New Mexico desert, to prevent the reservoir from spilling, and again clearing Colorado's water debt. The stress now is on New Mexico to meet its obligations to Texas. During dryer years, New Mexico will be short about in its obligations, partially due to partial evaporation of the reservoir water before New Mexico can absorb it. Compliance The Rio Grande Compact Commission, located in El Paso, Texas, administers the Rio Grande Compact. An employee of the USGS New Mexico Water Science Center serves as Secretary to the Compact. The principal duty of the Secretary is to compile streamflow and storage data used in the annual accounting computations performed by the Commission's Engineer Advisers. The Secretary also compiles provisional streamflow and storage data on a monthly basis that are distributed to interested parties, and compiles and publishes an annual data report for the Commission. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is Texas' representation to the Commission. Environmental issues During a 1999 United States House of Representatives investigation of inter-state water pacts, Bennett W. Raley offered testimony revealing that efforts to comply with the demands of the Compact could be threatening a critical habitat for the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow.

Most cars use leaded gas and lack emissions control equipment.Iran Daily – Domestic Economy – 07/01/07 Tehran is rated as one of the world's most polluted cities. However, buses and cars running on natural gas are planned to replace the existing public transportation fleet in the future. Also, energy prices are kept artificially low in Iran through heavy state subsidies, resulting in highly inefficient and polluting consumption patterns. Traffic management, vehicle inspection, general use of electric bicycles and electronic government are also part of the solution. A rising incidence of respiratory illnesses prompted the city governments of Tehran and Arak, southwest of the capital, to institute air pollution control programs. These programs aim to reduce gradually the amount of harmful chemicals released into the atmosphere. An Iranian cyclist in Zanjan Much of Iran’s territory suffers from overgrazing, desertification and/or deforestation. Industrial and urban wastewater runoff has contaminated rivers, coastal and underground waters. Wetlands and bodies of fresh water increasingly are being destroyed as industry and agriculture expand, and oil and chemical spills have harmed aquatic life in the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea. Iran contends that the international rush to develop oil and gas reserves in the Caspian Sea presents that region with a new set of environmental threats. Although a Department of Environment has existed since 1971, Iran has not yet developed a policy of sustainable development because short term economic goals have taken precedence. The World Bank estimates losses inflicted on Iran's economy as a result of deaths caused by air pollution at $640 million, which is equal to 5.1 trillion rials or 0.57 percent of GDP. Diseases resulting from air pollution are inflicting losses estimated at $260 million per year or 2.1 trillion rials or 0.23 percent of the GDP on Iran's economy. A report by the United Nations Environment Programme ranked Iran at 117th place among 133 countries in terms of environmental indexes.Iran Daily – Front Page – 03/06/07 80% of air pollution in Tehran is due to cars, the remaining 20% is due to factories and industry emissions.

In the 2016 census, the township had a population of 158. The town lies within the traditional lands of the Girai wurrung (Kirrae Wuurong) people. In the decades following European settlement in the 1840s, a general store, post office, hotel, school and Presbyterian church were established in Framlingham, as increasing numbers of graziers and dairy farmers settled the area. The Framlingham Aboriginal Reserve was established by the Board for the Protection of Aborigines between Purnim and the township of Framlingham in 1861, upon the request of an Anglican mission. It was located beside the Hopkins River, not far from the boundary with the Gunditjmara people. After various attempts at closure, the reserve operated until 1916, albeit with the land reduced in size. Much of the Aboriginal community continued to live there until the present time. Some of the land that was originally part of the reserve became Framlingham Forest, which is now part of the Framlingham Forest Indigenous Protected Area (IPA). History Kaawirn Kuunawarn (Hissing Swan), also known as King David, Chief of the Kirrae Wuurong, who lived in Framlingham from 1865 until his death in 1889. 1840s: White settlement European settlement began around 1840, the village beginning with the establishment of the Brefnay Hotel in about 1848. A store opened within the next decade, and a Presbyterian church in 1870. A great deal of land was cleared of trees in order to establish dairy farms and other forms of agriculture. 1861: Aboriginal reserve established The Church of England in Warnambool obtained of land for an Aboriginal mission station to \\"ameliorate the present wretched conditions of the Aborigines\\", and requested establishment of an Aboriginal reserve in the area. The Victorian Board for the Protection of Aborigines created Framlingham Aboriginal Reserve in response. The reserve was occupied in 1865 by many of the surviving members of the Kirrae Wuurong clans, who originally inhabited the area between Mount Emu Creek and the Hopkins River, and much of whose language was recorded by a Scottish squatter, James Dawson. Members of the Djargurd Wurrung from the Camperdown area and Gunditjmara people from Warrnambool were also relocated to Framlingham, but Gunditjmara from Portland and Lake Condah refused to settle here due to tension with the other clans, leading to the establishment of Lake Condah reserve in 1869.Ian D. Clark, pp12, Scars on the Landscape. A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803–1859, Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 In 1867 the reserve was closed by the Central Board appointed by the Government of Victoria and attempts were made to relocate the residents to Lake Condah Mission but in September 1868 the Kirrae Wuurong won the re- establishment of the reserve. Residents of Warrnambool campaigned from 1877 to 1890 to close the reserve and turn it into an experimental agricultural farm, and in 1894 the reserve was reduced to and the majority of the land given to the Council of Agricultural Education. However, the agricultural farm plans never eventuated, with this land becoming the Framlingham Forest. In 1889 the Board attempted to close the reserve again, but it finally agreed to reserve } for Aboriginal use. In 1916 the Government of Victoria decided to concentrate Aboriginal Victorians at Lake Tyers Mission in Gippsland. The reserve was eventually closed but some residents were allowed to remain, with the community being granted ownership in 1971 of the they held at that time.Ian D. Clark, pp125-133, Scars on the Landscape. A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803–1859, Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 In the 1930s, public concern over the conditions led the government to build extra housing and a school, and to provide rations. When the reserve was established, it was declared to be in area, although its actual size may have been closer to . As parts of the reserve were sold to private landowners, its size diminished, until only the remained when it was closed in 1971. Some of this land was also set aside as a State Forest. 1970-1987: Land rights In 1957 the Board for the Protection of Aborigines was abolished, and in 1970 the Aboriginal Lands Act 1970 was passed by the Parliament of Victoria. Under the provisions of that Act, ownership of Framlingham was handed over to a trust held by Aboriginal residents of the site, Framlingham Aboriginal Trust, on 1 July 1971. Along with Lake Tyers, in the eastern Gippsland region of the state, Framlingham was the last reserve to close in Victoria. In 1976 the Framlingham community began a campaign to regain rights to the Framlingham Forest, that had been excised from the original 1861 reserve in 1894. In April 1979 the community blockaded the road to the forest picnic ground. The Victorian Government proposed allowing Aboriginal management of the forest in 1980 but maintained that it would continue as crown land. The proposal was rejected by the community, who resumed the blockade.Kerry Wakefield, pp3, Warrnambool blacks had century of misery: report, The Age, 2 September 1980. Accessed from Google News Archive on 29 September 2009ABC News archival video, Framlingham Blockade, Koorie Heritage Trust. Retrieved 29 September 2009 In 1987, the Victorian Labor government under John Cain attempted to grant some of the Framlingham State Forest to the trust as inalienable title, but the legislation was blocked by the Liberal Party opposition in the Legislative Council. However, the federal Labor government under Bob Hawke intervened, passing the Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Act 1987, which gave of the Framlingham forest to the Framlingham trust. Although the title is essentially inalienable, in that it can only be transferred to another Indigenous land trust, the Framlingham trust has no rights to prevent mining on the land, unlike trusts or communities holding native title. The Kirrae Whurrong Aboriginal Corporation was established under the Aboriginal Lands Act 1970 in order to hold in trust \\"the land of the Framlingham Forest and Reserve returned to the Aboriginal community\\". 1983: Ash Wednesday On 16 February 1983, one of the Ash Wednesday fires started here and swept through the district killing nine people, destroying many homes, farm buildings and livestock. The cause was believed to be poorly maintained power lines. 2009: Framlingham Forest IPA In 2009, an Indigenous Protected Area was dedicated, known as the Framlingham Forest IPA, covering of native forests. It is the largest remnant of native forest containing the stringybark and manna gum savannah in the area. The Framlingham Aboriginal Trust manages the land. Traditional ownership The formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Framlingham sits are groups within the Eastern Maar peoples, who are represented by the Eastern Maar Aboriginal Corporation (EMAC). Post Offices Framlingham Post Office nearby opened on 1 March 1859 and closed in 1975. A Framlingham East Post Office was also open from 1925 until 1945. Description In the 2016 census, the township had a population of 158. The town has a hall and a public reserve with tennis court and barbecue facilities. The fire station was opened in 2015. The school, established in 1872, was closed in 1993.

Hein and two other youths who were present when the murder took place, as well as the actual killer, and were convicted under the felony murder rule because the murder was committed during the course of a felony – the attempted robbery of marijuana kept for sale by Farris's friend, Michael McLoren. Under the felony murder rule, any participant in a felony is criminally responsible for any death that occurs during its commission. In 2009, Hein's life sentence was commuted to 29 years to life. A documentary film called Reckless Indifference was made about the murder, trial and resulting prison sentences. Hein was the only defendant interviewed in the film and has received the bulk of media attention, while equally heavy sentences were handed out to other defendants. His conviction has courted much controversy, as some feel that the life sentence was overly harsh and politically motivated, while others feel that his involvement justified the sentence. On May 2, 2017, a book chronicling the Farris case, \\"One Cut\\" by Eve Porinchak, was released by Simon & Schuster.https://www.amazon.com/One-Cut- Simon-True-Porinchak/dp/1481481320 In October 2019, Hein was granted parole. He is expected to be released from prison by summer 2020.https://www.toacorn.com/articles/brandon-hein-granted-parole/ Teen convicted under felony murder rule granted parole at age 42 Fistfight and murder On May 22, 1995, five youths ranging in age from 15 to 18 were drinking alcohol and cruising in a pickup truck around Agoura Hills, a suburban town in Los Angeles County, California. Less than an hour before the stabbing, one of the five, Jason Holland, 18, grabbed a wallet from an unlocked vehicle in the parking lot of a public park, an act witnessed by the wallet's owner, a mother playing in the park with her children. Shortly thereafter, she recognized the truck and confronted the five, demanding and receiving her wallet back in the face of their threats and intimidation. This theft and intimidation was used to support the prosecution's contention that the five were still acting in concert at the time of the murder. Looking for marijuana, the five drove to the home of Michael McLoren, who was known to sell marijuana from a desk drawer in a ramshackle one-room \\"fort\\" in his backyard. A key factor in the murder trial was be whether the five intended to buy marijuana or to steal it. McLoren, 17, and his friend, Jimmy Farris, 16, were in the yard outside the fort when four of the five youths hopped the fence, with Micah Holland, 15, leading the way. Micah entered the fort and Anthony Miliotti, 17, physically the largest of the group, stood in the doorway. Their entry to the property drew an additional charge of burglary. Jason Holland testified he was drunk and lagging behind the others and did not see how the argument between his brother Micah and McLoren started. As he entered, the two dropped their heads and started fighting. Brandon Hein, 18, jumped into the fight, as did Jason, who says he was trying to get the bigger McLoren off his brother Micah's back. Jason opened a folding pocketknife and \\"pricked\\" McLoren twice in the back to get him off his brother, then stabbed him in the chest. When Farris entered the fort to help McLoren, Jason stabbed him twice and Hein punched him in the head and face. McLoren survived his wounds but Farris died in the emergency room. When Jason Holland learned from his mother that he was wanted for murder, he went into hiding but several weeks later voluntarily surrendered. The following description of the fight and stabbing is from the \\"Summary of Facts and Proceedings\\" in the January 29, 2001 California Court of Appeal findings.Appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (PDF, 33 pages), January 29, 2001 Note that the term \\"appellants\\" excludes Christopher Velardo, 17, owner of the pickup truck, who remained in the truck throughout the incident and was tried separately. > At approximately 7:00 p.m. McLoren and Farris were in the McLoren backyard > in the immediate vicinity of the fort.

Charges Christopher Velardo, 17, who remained outside in the truck throughout the incident, was charged and tried separately. Micah Holland, 15, Brandon Hein, 18, and Anthony Miliotti, 17, as well as the actual killer Jason Holland, 18, were charged with burglary, attempted robbery, and murder committed during the course of a burglary and an attempted robbery, and with attempted willful, deliberate, premeditated murder of McLoren. All four were charged with felony murder because the murder was committed during the course of a felony, the alleged attempted robbery of McLoren's marijuana. California law allows felony murder charges to be \\"enhanced\\" by special circumstances if the murder is committed during the commission of certain other crimes, among them robbery and burglary. The special circumstances of robbery and burglary were both alleged in this case. Murders under special circumstances require the imposition of the death penalty or life without possibility of parole.Chief Justice Rose Bird ProCon - Special Circumstances Trial The severity of the charges polarized the small town of Agoura Hills and attracted international attention. The case was heard in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County in Malibu, California, with Judge Lawrence Mira presiding. The issue of the defendants' intent when entering the McLoren property and during the events at the fort was critical and hotly contested throughout the trial. The defendants said they had gone to the fort to buy, not steal, marijuana that day, so there was no burglary or attempted robbery. McLoren, testifying as a prosecution witness under promise of immunity from prosecution on drug charges, said there had been no prior arrangement for the sale of marijuana. Testimony about the earlier wallet theft was introduced, with Judge Mira instructing the jury that it could be considered only to determine if it tended to show the criminal intent required for the offenses charged later that day. The prosecution said that both incidents were alike, in that they were theft-type offenses involving group action and intimidating conduct by members of the group. Extensive media coverage before the trial had suggested that the defendants were members of Gumbys, a local street gang. In pre-trial proceedings, Judge Mira found that there was insufficient evidence that the defendants were gang members and excluded any evidence of gang membership. Notwithstanding this ruling, during cross-examination the prosecution twice asked Jason Holland about Gumbys, including asking him if he was a member. Judge Mira instructed the jury to ignore these questions. During closing arguments, the prosecution again strongly suggested the existence of gang activity. These suggestions of gang activity were brought up in the defendants' later appeal as prejudicial misconduct that deprived them of their right to a fair trial. Jason Holland admitted stabbing both McLoren and Farris. On May 28, 1996 the jury found the four defendants guilty of burglary, attempted robbery, and murder committed during the course of a burglary and an attempted robbery, that is, felony murder. In addition, Jason Holland was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. The jury also found the allegations of special circumstances to be true, and found the murder, burglary and attempted robbery to be of the first degree. Sentences The four were sentenced to state prison as follows: *Jason Holland - life without possibility of parole plus eight years. *Brandon Hein - life without possibility of parole plus four years. *Tony Miliotti - life without possibility of parole plus four years. *Micah Holland - 29 years to life. Christopher Velardo pleaded guilty separately to voluntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit robbery and was sentenced to eleven years. Velardo was released from prison in 2000.Appeals underway in local murder case, The Acorn, December 14, 2000 Supporters The case attracted international attention and support, due largely to media coverage of the charges, the application of the felony murder rule, and the long sentences imposed. Director William Gazecki made a documentary film called Reckless Indifference about the murder, trial and resulting prison sentences. In his film, Gazecki argues that the defendants received an unfair trial and overly harsh sentences. A bill by former California state senator Tom Hayden to revise California's felony murder rule died in the Senate. Actor Charles Grodin wrote and directed a sympathetic play, The Prosecution of Brandon Hein. In 2005 Gazecki was a guest speaker at California State University Los Angeles, where his film was shown to Soren Kerk's sociology class with the question in mind, \\"What is Justice?\\"Reckless Indifference film site - discussion and trailer Detractors Although the crime occurred outside his jurisdiction (in Los Angeles County, not in the city of Los Angeles), Los Angeles police chief Willie Williams wrote to Judge Mira recommending the maximum punishment for all four defendants: life in prison without the possibility of parole.brandonhein.com - Willie Williams' sentencing recommendations In an interview with Farris' parents his mother asks, ”How much is too much time for killing someone? For taking away and changing our lives completely, forever?” Life In Prison: Felony Murder, CBS, Jan. 29, 2003 Controversy Supporters of the defendants as well as opponents of the felony murder rule have expressed various concerns and criticisms. Regarding the charges *According to William Gazecki and other critics, the prosecutor's office was spurred to lay the heaviest possible charges by the victim's father, an LAPD officer; and says that if the victim had not been a police officer's son the felony murder rule would never have been applied.DVDtalk review, Reckless Indifference In a CBS 60 Minutes II segment, a spokesman for the defendants' families charges that the boys were punished not for what they did, but for who was killed. The spokesman says, \\"It's about a police officer's son who died. And the only way they could convict all these kids was use the felony murder rule.\\" James Farris Sr., the victim's father, says \\"The fact that I'm a policeman has nothing to do with anything. I just happen to be a policeman whose son was murdered. That's it.\\" *The felony murder rule itself has been criticized as unjust and offensive to the basic notion of fairness, since all participants in the underlying felony are punished equally regardless of their role, or lack of a role, in the murder. Supporters of the rule regard it as an example of strict liability, whereby a person who chooses to commit a crime is considered absolutely responsible for all the possible consequences of that action. *The application of the felony murder rule in this case was also questioned by those who did not agree that an underlying felony, the attempted robbery of McLoren's marijuana, had actually taken place. Regarding the trial *Critics have accused the Los Angeles district attorney's office of being less interested in justice than in making up for their embarrassing high-visibility loss in the murder trial of O.

Simpson a few months earlier. *The fact that the victim's father was an LAPD officer also generated suspicions that the district attorney's office was pressured for convictions, with Farris Sr. supposedly enjoying extraordinary access to authorities and attorneys, and using his influence to gain favors for the prosecution.Variety.com review, Reckless Indifference Farris says in the film he never was present while prosecutors interviewed witnesses, while Deputy District Attorney Jeff Semow says that Farris \\"may have been present.\\" *To prove felony murder, the prosecution had to prove that an underlying felony had taken place, the attempted robbery of McLoren's marijuana. On the witness stand as a prosecution witness, McLoren testified that there had been no prior arrangement for the sale of marijuana. Before he testified, the prosecution had given him immunity from prosecution for selling drugs, a fact not known to the jury.Court: State’s Nondisclosure of Immunity Deal Not Prejudicial , Metropolitan News-Enterprise, April 13, 2010 *Extensive pre-trial media coverage available to the pool of potential jurors suggested that the defendants were gang members. Judge Mira found that there was insufficient evidence of gang membership, and ruled that no evidence of this type was allowed in the trial. Notwithstanding this ruling, the prosecution several times asked questions about gang membership or otherwise suggested to the jury the existence of gang activity. After each suggestion, the judge instructed the jury to ignore it, a process likened by some critics to \\"trying to unring a bell\\". Interviewed in Reckless Indifference, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz says the prosecutors \\"terrorized\\" the jury into believing the defendants were violent gang members. Regarding the sentences *The sentences – 29 years to life for Micah Holland, life without possibility of parole for Hein, Miliotti, and Jason Holland – have been widely criticised as out of proportion to the nature of the crimes. Dershowitz calls the sentence \\"disproportional, outrageous, unconstitutional and immoral.\\"New York Times review, Reckless Indifference Appeals State appeals An appeal of the convictions and sentences to the California Court of Appeal for the Second District charged prosecutors with misconduct and presenting inadmissible evidence, including alleging that the defendants belonged to the Gumbys street gang. Among other things, the appeal also alleged that it was improper to present the earlier wallet theft to the jury; that the prosecution engaged in egregious personal attacks on defense counsel; and that the verdicts were inconsistent. It further alleged juror misconduct, judicial bias, and faulty instructions to the jury. Defending the sentences, Deputy District Attorney Victoria Bedrossian argued that while only Jason Holland wielded the knife, the defendants acted \\"in concert.\\" \\"Each appellant was a major participant who acted with reckless indifference to Jimmy Farris' life,\\" Bedrossian said. \\"The sentences in this case do not offend fundamental notions of human dignity and the penalties in this case should not be changed.\\" On 29 January 2001 the California Court of Appeal ruled that \\"In order to warrant reversal, it must be determined that the alleged misconduct has prejudiced appellants’ right to a fair trial. In this case, the evidence against appellants was overwhelming.\\" The Court affirmed the convictions and sentencing of Jason Holland, Brandon Hein and Micah Holland. The special circumstance finding against Anthony Miliotti, who stood and watched, was struck from the record and his crime reduced to second-degree murder, and his case sent back to the trial court for resentencing, resulting in a new sentence of nineteen years to life. The California Supreme Court denied petitions for review on April 25, 2001.California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information - Supreme Court - Supreme Court Case: S095461 Hein filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which was denied on October 1, 2001.California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information - 2nd Appellate District - Court of Appeal Case: B106689 A petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the California Supreme Court was filed on September 23, 2002, which was summarily denied on May 12, 2004.California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information - Supreme Court - Supreme Court Case: S110116 Federal appeals Following exhaustion of their appeals in state court, Hein, Miliotti, Micah and Jason Holland filed individual Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in May and July 2004. The petitions raised identical, overlapping, and separate claims: Brady violations, prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, improper exclusion or admission of evidence, juror misconduct, judicial misconduct, cruel and unusual punishment, and arbitrary and capricious sentence reduction. On April 3, 2007, the United States Magistrate Judge assigned to the case filed a joint Report and Recommendation, recommending that the petitions be denied. All four appellants filed objections to the Magistrate's report, but the United States District Judge adopted the Report and Recommendation without modification. Each appellant then requested a Certificate of Appealability to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which were all granted in whole or in part by the District Court. On January 17, 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court granted a motion to consolidate the appeals of the four appellants.Administrative Office of the U. S.

The town derived its name from the Sierra de Aracena, which is part of the Sierra Morena system. Aracena is the largest town in the Parque Natural Sierra de Aracena y Picos de Aroche. In 2006, Aracena was named a Tourist Municipality of Andalucía and became the first town in the province of Huelva to achieve this status. Main sights Aracena Castle Prominent attractions in the town include Aracena Castle and the Priory Church, together known as the Castillo-Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de los Dolores, built between the 13th and 15th centuries over the ruins of an earlier castle. The oldest sections are of late Gothic-Mudéjar style. Aracena Castle was erected in the thirteenth century, during the Islamic period, and was itself built on the site of an ancient Moorish castle. The walled enclosure was partitioned inside, with the tower of homage, or castle keep, defending the barrier that divided its interior. The population of Aracena settled around this structure, giving rise to the current urban landscape. During the late Middle and Modern Ages, Aracena continued growing from the Cerro del Castillo [Castle Hill] into the valley, first as unattached land dependent on Seville and later, in the seventeenth century, as a feudal estate under the jurisdiction of the Count- Duke of Olivares. Still later, it was under the Count of Altamira, who carried the title of Prince of Aracena. The fortress consists of the alcazaba, or citadel, with its watch tower, cistern and walls; these are flanked by other towers, as well as a fence line that, in its interior, once accommodated medieval living quarters. Prioral Church When Aracena was ceded by the Crown of Castile to the Knights Templar, that Order authorized the raising of the current Moorish-style church, noted for the glazed clay sculptures of Pedro Vazquez and which takes its name from the local patron saint, Nuestra Señora del Mayor Dolor [Our Lady of the Greatest Suffering]. The church is emblematic of Aracena and is the oldest church in the town. It consists of three naves of equal height with its choir at the feet and a polygonal presbytery to which, on the side of the chapel, there is attached its Mudéjar- style tower. Also in the town is the church of Santa María de la Asunción, built in 1522. Groto of the Marvels Also located in the town is the Gruta de las Maravillas, one of the most spectacular cave systems in Spain. The caves are located below the hill on which stands Aracena Castle. Opened to the public in 1913, it includes a total of 2130 meters of subterranean passages. Several caverns and lakes are linked by these narrow passages. Coloured lighting adds to the effects of its unusual mineral formations. In the complex is a geological museum. The caves are said to have been found by a boy looking for a lost pig. Ham Museum El Museo del Jamón de Aracena (Ham Museum of Aracena) consists of 7 rooms which trace the history, cultures and traditions surrounding the famous Iberian pigs.

From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of Official Development Assistance (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49 percent, has been disbursed. In 2004 international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80 percent of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

History In the late 1970s, Vietnam relied on the assistance of West German, Italian, and Canadian companies for offshore oil exploration. This ended in 1981, but resumed subsequently with Soviet technical assistance. Aid from China, reportedly close to US$300 million in 1977 and 1978, dropped to zero in 1979, and Vietnamese recovery in coal production was profoundly affected by the accompanying loss of ethnic Chinese workers. In 1979 Japan suspended its Official Development Assistance funds (a mixture of grants and low-interest loans amounting to US$135 million) and made renewal contingent upon Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia. Loss of other Western aid in hard currencies crippled Vietnam's ability to continue importing needed modern machinery and technology from its West European trading partners. Following Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, only Sweden continued to provide any significant amount of economic help. Some multilateral assistance, such as that for development of the Mekong River, was made available by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, however. Western and multilateral assistance, therefore, did not stop entirely, although the yearly average of about US$100 million through 1986 provided only a fraction of the country's hard-currency needs. In 1986 Vietnam's current account deficit with major industrial countries was some US$221 million. The conflicts with Cambodia and China in 1978 and 1979 proved particularly costly in terms of continuing economic ties with Western and neighboring Asian countries. As a result, Hanoi was forced to rely even more heavily on Soviet-bloc assistance.Vietnam country study. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1987). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Soviet Union and other members of Comecon increased their aid commitments as their own planning became more closely coordinated with Vietnam's following Hanoi's entry into Comecon in June 1978. Soviet economic aid in 1978, estimated at between US$0.7 and 1.0 billion, was already higher than Western assistance. By 1982 it had increased to more than US$1 billion annually, close to US$3 million per day, and it remained at this level through the mid-1980s. The Soviet Union and other Comecon countries provided aid in all categories—project assistance, technical training, price subsidies, loans, and trade credits. Soviet publications emphasized the importance of project assistance to Vietnam's economic recovery, but about 75 percent of the value of aid disbursed during the Third Five-Year Plan was used to finance Vietnam's bilateral trade deficit with the Soviet Union, which averaged about US$896 million a year. Trade subsidies in the form of reduced prices for Soviet oil also declined sharply in the early 1980s as the Soviet Union brought Vietnam into the Comecon oil-pricing system based on world market values. Although the details of Comecon assistance to Vietnam since the 1970s had not been made public as of late 1987, Soviet sources gave some indications of the type of project assistance provided and were quick to claim credit for production increases attributable to Soviet technical and plant assistance. Soviet-aid goals from 1978 to 1981 included helping with balance-of-payments problems, assisting with key projects, introducing industrial cooperation, accelerating scientific and technical cooperation, and assisting with the improvement of Vietnamese professional skills. During this period, the Soviet Union also signed numerous agreements calling for financial and technical assistance in matters ranging from traffic-improvement programs for the railroad from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City to completing construction of the Thang Long Bridge over the Red River.

This group of mushrooms are noted for their brittle gills and bright colours. Taxonomy It was previously named in honour of French mycologist René Maire by Rolf Singer in 1929, but found to be the same taxon as the earlier 1920 Russula nobilis, which has naming priority. Description The cap is a red or rosy colour, 3–6 cm wide, convex to flat, or slightly depressed, and weakly sticky. It peels only to a third of its radius, which reveals pink flesh. The flesh is firm and white or sometimes yellowish, smells of coconut, and tastes peppery.https://www.monaconatureencyclopedia.com/russula-mairei/?lang=en It is often damaged by slugs. The stem is 2–5 cm long, 1–1.5 cm wide, cylindrical, (firmer than its conifer dwelling namesake, Russula emetica), and white. The gills are narrowly spaced, adnexed, rounded, and white, often with a faint blue-green sheen. The spore print is white. Distribution and habitat The species is mycorrhizal with beech (Fagus) in woodland areas. It is widespread and common in Europe, Asia, and North America, where these trees grow. Edibility Russula nobilis is inedible, and probably poisonous in quantity, but not deadly. Many bitter tasting red-capped species can cause problems if eaten raw; the symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature: diarrhoea, vomiting and colicky abdominal cramps. The active agent has not been identified but thought to be caused by chemical compounds known as sesquiterpenes, which have been isolated from the related genus Lactarius and from Russula sardonia.

According to the 2015 census, the city had a population of 20,357 inhabitants. Location and history The township of Ayamonte preserves its old medieval quarter in the central district of the town, with many very narrow streets and historical buildings; this central area is a designated car-free zone. For centuries the ferry link between Ayamonte and Vila Real de Santo António was the traditional crossing point between Spain and Portugal. A modern bridge over the Guadiana River has now been built to the north of the town, linking the motorway systems of the two countries, but the ferry still runs and provides an inexpensive mode of transport between the two countries. The beach area of Ayamonte is Isla Canela and is reached by a causeway across the Marismas del Guadiana; the marismas (salt marshes) are an important wildlife reserve, providing a home to many waterfowl, including herons and flamingos. Isla Canela is built along several kilometers of sandy beaches, and provides an ideal area for windsurfing, kitesurfing and sailing. There are a number of quality golf courses in and around the area, including one built into the Marismas itself. The city, is also famous for his local festivities, the \\"Fiestas de las Angústias\\" in honor of their patron \\"Nuestra Señora de las Angústias\\". The festivities in the beginning of September are a moment of celebration not only from the Ayamontin population, but also for many Andalucians, and Portuguese. The festivities are graced by the local band, \\"Banda Ciudad de Ayamonte\\" and the Portuguese \\"Banda da Sociedade Filarmónica Progresso e Labor Samouquense\\" from the Portuguese village of Samouco. The Costa Esuri development is just to the north of Ayamonte. It was an ambitious development built by the Galicia-based developer Martinsa-Fadesa that stalled as a result of the global financial crisis of 2007–08. Many properties were left unfinished, but because of the steep reduction in price, the development is starting to have the success that was always expected. The development features two golf courses, though only the west course is open. A hotel that was planned remains unfinished.

Being a country that lies in the Pacific Ring of Fire, it is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In addition, the country is surrounded by large bodies of water and facing the Pacific Ocean where 60% of the world's typhoons are made. One of the most devastating typhoons that hit the Philippines in 2013 was Typhoon Haiyan, or \\"Yolanda,\\" that killed over 10,000 people and destroyed over a trillion pesos worth of properties and damage to various sectors. Other environmental problems that the country is facing include pollution, illegal mining and logging, deforestation, dynamite fishing, landslides, coastal erosion, wildlife extinction, global warming and climate change. Water pollution Pasig River in Manila, one of the world's most polluted rivers., p. 4 Although water resources have become scarce in some regions and seasons, the Philippines as a whole has more than enough surface and groundwater. However, neglecting to have a coherent environmental policy has led to the contamination of 58% of the groundwater in the Philippines. The main source of pollution is untreated domestic and industrial wastewater. Only one third of Philippine river systems are considered suitable for public water supply. It is estimated that in 2025, water availability will be marginal in most major cities and in 8 of the 19 major river basins., p. 8 Besides severe health concerns, water pollution also leads to problems in the fishing and tourism industries., p. 18–19 The national government recognized the problem and since 2004 has sought to introduce sustainable water resources development management (see below)., p. 6 Only 5% of the total population is connected to a sewer network. The vast majority uses flush toilets connected to septic tanks. Since sludge treatment and disposal facilities are rare, most effluents are discharged without treatment., p. 107 According to the Asian Development Bank, the Pasig River is one of the world's most polluted rivers. In March 2008, Manila Water announced that a wastewater treatment plant will be constructed in Taguig. The first Philippine constructed wetland serving about 700 households was completed in 2006 in a peri-urban area of Bayawan City which has been used to resettle families that lived along the coast in informal settlements and had no access to safe water supply and sanitation facilities. Deforestation Over the course of the 20th century the forest cover of the Philippines dropped from 70 percent down to 20 percent. In total, 46 species are endangered, and 4 were already eradicated completely. 3.2 percent of total rainforest has been left. Based on an analysis of land use pattern maps and a road map an estimated 9.8 million acres of forests were lost in the Philippines from 1934 to 1988. Illegal logging occurs in the Philippines and intensify flood damage in some areas. According to scholar Jessica Mathews, short-sighted policies by the Filipino government have contributed to the high rate of deforestation: > The government regularly granted logging concessions of less than ten years. > Since it takes 30–35 years for a second-growth forest to mature, loggers had > no incentive to replant. Compounding the error, flat royalties encouraged > the loggers to remove only the most valuable species. A horrendous 40 > percent of the harvestable lumber never left the forests but, having been > damaged in the logging, rotted or was burned in place. The unsurprising > result of these and related policies is that out of 17 million hectares of > closed forests that flourished early in the century only 1.2 million remain > today. Air pollution Due to industrial waste and automobiles, Manila suffers from air pollution, affecting 98% of the population. Annually, the air pollution causes more than 4,000 deaths. Ermita is Manila's most air polluted district due to open dump sites and industrial waste. According to a report in 2003, The Pasig River is one of the most polluted rivers in the world with 150 tons of domestic waste and 75 tons of industrial waste dumped daily.  Climate change  One of the most pressing environmental issues impacting the Philippines is climate change. As an island country located in the Southeast Asia Pacific region, the Philippines is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Some of these impacts include increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, sea level rise, extreme rainfall, global warming, resource shortages, and environmental degradation. All of these impacts together have greatly affected the Philippines' agriculture, water, infrastructure, human health, and coastal ecosystems and they are projected to continue having devastating damages to the economy and society of the Philippines.  Greenhouse gas emissions  Philippines share in the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is at 0.31%. Nevertheless, the country is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. GHG emissions in the Philippines is rising. GHG is the leading cause of global climate change. As much a 41.8% of the country’s GHG emissions come from the burning of coal and fuel oil for electricity generation. The Philippines, a signatory of the Paris climate accord, aims to cut its emissions by 70% by 2030.  Impacts of global warming  = Climate history = Due to its geographical location, climate, and topography, the Philippines is ranked third on the World Risk Index for highest disaster risk and exposure to natural disasters. 16 of its provinces, including Manila, Benguet, and Batanes, are included in the top 50 most vulnerable places in Southeast Asia, with Manila being ranked 7th. Four cities in the Philippines, Manila, San Jose, Roxas, and Cotabato, are included in the top 10 cities most vulnerable to sea level rise in the East Asia and Pacific region. The country is consistently at risk from severe natural hazards including typhoons, floods, landslides, and drought. It is located within a region that experiences the highest rate of typhoons in the world, averaging 20 typhoons annually, with about 7–9 that actually make landfall. In 2009, the Philippines had the third highest number of casualties from natural disasters with the second most victims.World Health Organization. Climate change and health in the Western Pacific region: synthesis of evidence, profiles of selected countries and policy direction. Manila: WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific, 2015. Climate change has had and will continue to have drastic effects on the climate of the Philippines. From 1951–2010, the Philippines saw its average temperature rise by 0.65 degrees Celsius, with fewer recorded cold nights and more hot days. Since the 1970s, the number of typhoons during the El Niño season has increased. The Philippines has not only seen 0.15 meters of sea level rise since 1940, but also seen 0.6 to 1 degree Celsius increase in sea surface temperatures since 1910, and 0.09 degree c increase in ocean temperatures since 1950. During the time period from 1990 to 2006, the Philippines experienced a number of record-breaking weather events, including the strongest typhoon (wind speeds), the most destructive typhoons (damages), the deadliest storm (casualties), and the typhoon with the highest 24 hour rainfall on record. = Super typhoon Haiyan = Main Article: Typhoon Haiyan At 04:40 on November 8, 2013, Super Typhoon Haiyan, also known locally as “Yolanda”, made landfall in the Philippines in the Guiuan municipality. The category 5 typhoon continued to travel west, making landfall in several municipalities, and ultimately devastated enormous stretches of the Philippines islands of Samar, Leyte, Cebu, and the Visaya archipelago. Tied for being the strongest landfalling tropical typhoon on record, Typhoon Haiyan had wind speeds of over 300 km/h (almost 190 mph) which triggered major storm surges that wreaked havoc on many places in the country. Leaving over 6,300 dead, 28,688 injured, and 1062 missing, Typhoon Haiyan is the deadliest typhoon on record in the Philippines. More than 16 million people were affected by the storm, suffering from the storm surge, flash floods, landslides, and extreme winds and rainfall that took lives, destroyed homes, and devastated many. Typhoon Haiyan crucially damaged over 1.1 million houses across the country and displaced over 4.1 million people. According to the NDRRMC, the storm cost the Philippines about 3.64 billion US dollars. = Future projections = Future projections for the current trajectory of climate change predict that global warming is likely to exceed 3degrees Celsius, potentially 4degrees, by 2060. Specifically in the Philippines, average temperatures are “virtually certain” to see an increase of 1.8 to 2.2 degrees Celsius. This temperature increase will stratify the local climate and cause the wet and dry seasons to be wetter and drier, respectively. Most areas in the Philippines will see reduced rainfall from March to May, while Luzon and Visayas will see increased heavy rainfall. There will also be an increase in: the number of days that exceed 35degree C; that have less than 2.5 mm of rainfall; and that have more than 300mm of rainfall. Additionally, climate change will continue to increase the intensity of typhoons and tropical storms. Sea levels around the Philippines are projected to rise 0.48 to 0.65 meters by 2100, which exceeds the global average for rates of sea level rise.Kahana, Ron, et al. \\"Projections of mean sea level change for the Philippines.\\" (2016). Combined with sea level rise, this stratification into more extreme seasons and climates increases the frequency and severity of storm surge, floods, landslides, and droughts. These exacerbate risks to agriculture, energy, water, infrastructure, human health, and coastal ecosystems.  Vulnerabilities of different sectors  = Agriculture = Agriculture is one of the Philippines’ largest sectors and will continue to be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change. The agriculture sector employs 35% of the working population and generated 13% of the country's GDP in 2009.Crost, Benjamin, et al. \\"Climate Change, Agricultural Production and Civil Conflict: Evidence from the Philippines.\\" Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 88, March 1, 2018, pp. 379–395. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1016/j.jeem.2018.01.005. The two most important crops, rice and corn, account for 67% of the land under cultivation and stand to see reduced yields from heat and water stress. Rice, wheat, and corn crops are expected to see a 10% decrease in yield for every 1degree C increase over a 30dC average annual temperature. Increases in extreme weather events will have devastating affects on agriculture. Typhoons (high winds) and heavy rainfall contribute to the destruction of crops, reduced soil fertility, altered agricultural productivity through severe flooding, increased runoff, and soil erosion. Droughts and reduced rainfall leads to increased pest infestations that damage crops as well as an increased need for irrigation. Rising sea levels increases salinity which leads to a loss of arable land and irrigation water. All of these factors contribute to higher prices of food and an increased demand for imports, which hurts the general economy as well as individual livelihoods. From 2006 to 2013, the Philippines experienced a total of 75 disasters that cost the agricultural sector $3.8 billion in loss and damages. Typhoon Haiyan alone cost the Philippines' agricultural sector an estimated US$724 million after causing 1.1 million tonnes of crop loss and destroying 600,000 ha of farmland.Chandra, Alvin, et al. \\"Gendered vulnerabilities of smallholder farmers to climate change in conflict-prone areas: A case study from Mindanao, Philippines.\\" Journal of rural studies 50 (2017): 45–59. The agricultural sector is expected to see an estimated annual GDP loss of 2.2% by 2100 due to climate impacts on agriculture.  Agricultural production and civil conflict  In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with “more conflict related incidents and casualties”. The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food sources and employment. A poor rice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify the seasonal variation of rainfall in the Philippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country.  Gender disparities among farmers  Smallholder farmers in the Philippines are expected to be among the most vulnerable and impacted by the effects of climate change in the region. However, there are differences in how men and women experience these impacts and often lead to differences in farming patterns and coping strategies. Some of the problems caused by extreme climate events in agrarian areas that are prone to civil conflict that disproportionately affect women include loss of customary rights to land, forced migration, increased discrimination, resource poverty and food insecurity. The effect that the combination of severe climate events and civil conflict has on Filipino women is further exacerbated by discriminatory policies, belief and practices, and restricted access to resources. For example, climate change is linked to increase civil conflict in the Mindanao region which increases the number of casualties and deaths of young men in the area. This effectively widows women married to those men and leaves them on their own to take care of them and their children, even when the society and government makes it difficult for single mothers to succeed. Women are often relegated to be the caretakers of children which increases the burden and stress placed on them as well as inhibiting them from escaping from conflict ridden areas = Energy = Climate change could simultaneously reduce the Philippines’ supply of energy and increase its demand for energy. The increased chance of extreme weather events would reduce hydropower production, which accounts for 20% of the country's energy supply, as well as cause widespread damage to energy infrastructure and services. There will be more power outages on average in addition to an increased demand for power, specifically cooling. = Water = Several factors of climate change are impacting the availability of water in the Philippines. The increasing number of intense droughts are reducing water levels and river flows and thus creating a shortage in water. The floods and landslides caused by extreme rainfall degrade watershed health and water quality by increasing runoff and erosion that increases sedimentation in reservoirs. Many freshwater coastal aquifers have seen saltwater intrusion which reduces the amount of freshwater available for use. About 25% of coastal municipalities in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao are affected by this and the issue is expected to get worse with sea level rise. = Infrastructure = Rising sea levels, heavy rainfall and flooding, and strong typhoons pose an enormous risk to the Philippines’ infrastructure. 45% of Philippines’ urban population lives in informal settlements with already weak infrastructure and are extremely vulnerable to flooding and typhoons. A giant storm would wreak havoc on these informal settlements and cause the deaths and displacement of millions of people who inhabit 25 different coastline cities. These natural disasters will also cause millions of dollars in damages to urban infrastructure like bridges and roads. In 2009, Tropical Storm Ketsana cost the Philippines $33 million to repair damaged roads and bridges. Risk to \\"double exposure\\" Large cities in the Philippines such as Manila, Quezon City, Cebu, and Davao City see an increased risk from both climate change and globalization.Double exposure, infrastructure planning, and urban climate resilience in coastal megacities: A case study of Manilajournal=Environment and Planning. For example, in addition to being one of the world's most vulnerable cities to climate change due to geographical location, Manila has also been shaped by globalization and abides by many tenants of neoliberal urbanism, including \\"a strong focus on private sector led development, attracting global capital, market oriented policies and decentralization\\".These cities experience challenges to their own climate resilience due to this double exposure to climate change and globalization, where many cities are most at risk to climate events in addition to having a large percentage of the population live in informal settlements with weak infrastructure.Four million people, or about a third of Manila's population, lives in informal settlements which puts them at higher risk and danger from tropical storms and flooding, and they often have fewer resources available to recover from damages caused by environmental hazards. Several factors and governments in the history of the Philippines has contributed to a large focus on urban development and its connection to \\"globalized systems of material production and consumption. Spanish colonial rule from the 1500s to 1898, America's annexation from 1898 to 1946, Japanese occupation and bombing during World War ll, Ferdinand Marcos' authoritarian regime from 1965 till 1986, and more have all contributed to an urban development focused on globalization, market oriented development, privatization, and decentralization. = Human health = Climate change, heavy rains, and increased temperatures are linked with the increased transmission of vector and waterborne diseases like malaria, dengue, and diarrhea (who). The heavy rains and increased temperatures lead to increased humidity which increases the chance of mosquito breeding and survival. Increased natural disasters not only directly contribute to the loss of human life, but also indirectly through food insecurity and the destruction of health services. = Coastal ecosystems and fisheries = Climate change and global warming and the rising amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere has contributed to ocean warming and ocean acidification. The ocean has acted as a carbon sink for earth for millennia and is currently slowing the rate of global warming through the sequestration of carbon. This comes at a cost however as the oceans are becoming more and more acidic as they sequester more carbon dioxide. Ocean acidification has dire consequences as it causes coral bleaching and ultimately leads to the collapse of coral reefs (usaid). Rising sea levels cause increased salinity that can have damaging impacts on the country's extensive system of mangroves. Both coral reefs and mangroves help to reduce coastal erosion and supports water quality. This erosion from the loss of coral reefs and mangroves increase the chance of coastal flooding and the loss of land. Coral reefs and mangroves also act as important feeding and spawning areas for many fish species that many fisher folk depend on for survival. Over 60% of the coastal population depends on marine resources like coral reefs or mangroves for their contributions to fisheries, tourism, and storm protection.  Threats to environmentalists  The Philippines is sometimes considered the most dangerous country for environmental activists. According to environmental watchdog Global Witness, at least 30 land and environmental defenders were killed in the Philippines in 2018, many of whom were in conflict with private business groups. Kalikasan People's Network for the Environment recorded 46 deaths in 2019. The group said activists have also been harassed, vilified, \\"red-tagged,\\" and labeled as terrorists or \\"enemies of the state.\\" Environmental groups have asked Congress to pass a Human Rights Defenders Bill to help protect activists and their families.  Government policy   Sustainable development  Recognizing the need to tackle the environment issues as well as the need to sustain development and growth, the Philippines came up with the Sustainable Development Strategy. The nation for the Sustainable Development Strategy includes assimilating environmental considerations in administration, apposite pricing of natural resources, conservation of biodiversity, rehabilitation of ecosystems, control of population growth and human resources development, inducing growth in rural areas, promotion of environmental education, strengthening citizens’ participation, and promoting small to medium-sized enterprises and sustainable agricultural and forestry practices. One of the initiatives signed in part of the strategy was the 1992 Earth Summit. Upon signing the 1992 Earth Summit, the government of Philippines has been constantly looking into many different initiatives to improve the environmental aspects of the country.  Environmental protection  Currently, the Philippines' Department of Environment and Natural Resources has been busy tracking down illegal loggers and been spearheading projects to preserve the quality of many remaining rivers that are not yet polluted.

References Issues Paraguay Category:Environmental crime ","title":"Environmental issues in Paraguay"},{"id":"4243388","text":"Environmental issues in Pakistan include air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, climate change, pesticide misuse, soil erosion, natural disasters desertification flood warnings. According to the latest global environment performance index (EPI) ranking Pakistan is in the list of countries which suffer from poor air quality. The climatic changes and global warming are most alarming issues risking millions of life across country. The major reasons of these environmental issues are carbon emission, increasing populations, and deforestation. These are serious environmental problems that Pakistan is facing, and they are getting worse as the country's economy expands and the population grows. Although NGOs and government departments have taken initiatives to stop environmental degradation, Pakistan's environmental issues still remain.  Economic consequences of environmental degradation  The majority of Pakistan's industrial sectors, for example fishing and agriculture, which count for more than one fourth of the output and two fifths of employment in Pakistan, are highly dependent on the country's natural resources. Hence, in order to sustain economic growth there is a high demand on already scarce natural resources. However it is ironic that what the country depends on for its growth is also what threatens the future welfare and success of the country. According to the World Bank, 70% of Pakistan's population live in rural areas and are already stricken by high poverty levels. These people depend on natural resources to provide income and tend to overuse these resources. This leads to further degradation of the environment and subsequently increases poverty. This has led to what the World Bank refers to as a \\"vicious downward spiral of impoverishment and environmental degradation.\\"  Pollution  Trash thrown in an empty plot in Karachi, Pakistan. The World Bank report in 2013 stated that Pakistan's top environmental issues include air pollution, inadequate supply of uncontaminated drinking water, noise pollution and the health deterioration of urban and rural populations due to pollution. These environmental concerns not only harm Pakistani citizens but also pose a serious threat to the country's economy. The report also stated that the increase in industrialization, urbanization and motorization will inevitably worsen this problem.  Water pollution  Pakistan is classified as a water stressed nation by the World Bank. There are seven main rivers that enter Pakistan from upper riparian states, including the Kabul River that enters from Afghanistan, and the Indus River, Jhelum River, Chenab River, Ravi River, and Sutlej River that enter from India. Among these the Ravi and Sutlej are diverted in upstream India, for which consumptive use was awarded to India under the Indus Waters Treaty signed in 1960 by India and Pakistan. Canal networks from the Indus (main stem), Jhelum River, and Chenab River supply water throughout the agricultural plains in Punjab and in Sindh, while the rest of the country has very little access to other fresh water. Potential scarcity of water not only threatens Pakistan's economy but also poses a serious threat to the lives of millions of Pakistanis. Lower flows due to the Indus Waters Treaty, as well as diversion to canals, means that lower dilution flows are available within the rivers of Pakistan. On the other hand, water pollution generation is increasing largely due to the growing economy and population, and an almost complete lack of water treatment. The sources for water pollution include the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the dumping of industrial effluent into lakes and rivers, untreated sewage being dumped into rivers and the ocean, and contaminated pipelines being used to transport water. The contamination of fresh drinking water makes it harder for people to find clean water supplies and increases the prevalence of waterborne diseases. Consequently, most of the reported health problems in Pakistan are either a direct or indirect result of polluted water. 45% of infant deaths are due to diarrhea and 60% to overall waterborne diseases.  Noise pollution  The megacities of Pakistan, such as Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Rawalpindi, face the issue of noise pollution. The main source of this pollution is the traffic noise caused by buses, cars, trucks, rickshaws and water tankers. A study showed that on one of Karachi's main roads, the average noise level was around 90 dB and was capable of reaching about 110 dB. This is much higher than the ISO's noise level standard of 70 dB, which is not meant to be harmful to the human ear. However, the study also concluded that in Pakistan, \\"the traffic noise levels limit as laid down by National Environment Quality standards, Environmental Protection Agency is 85 dB\\". This high level of noise pollution can cause auditory and non-auditory health issues. Auditory issues include the loss of auditory sensory cells; non-auditory health issues include sleep disturbance, noise and cardiovascular disease, endocrine response to noise and psychiatric disorder. There are very few, vague laws and policies in regards to noise levels. There is no accountability, and while the federal and provincial environmental protection agencies receive dozens of complaints on noise pollution from the public, these agencies are unable to take action due to legal constraints and the absence of national noise level standards.  Air pollution  Air pollution is a growing environmental problem in most major cities of Pakistan. According to a World Bank report, \\"Karachi's urban air pollution is among the most severe in the world and it engenders significant damages to human health and the economy\\". The inefficient use of energy, an increase in the number of vehicles used daily, an increase in unregulated industrial emissions and the burning of garbage and plastic have contributed the most to air pollution in urban areas. According to a recent study, the Sindh Environment Protection Department claims that the average level of pollution in big cities is approximately four times higher than the World Health Organisation's limits. These emissions have detrimental effects, including \\"respiratory diseases, reduced visibility, loss of vegetation and an effect on the growth of plants.\\" One of the greatest contributors to air pollution is industrial activity. The inadequate air emission treatments and lack of regulatory control over industrial activity has contributed to the deterioration of ambient air quality in major cities. In addition, the common practice of burning massive amounts of solid waste, including plastic and rubber, on street corners by the public, releases toxic gases, which are extremely harmful for residents in the area. In 2018, a young entrepreneur in Karachi, Abid Omar, launched the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative to monitor air quality in Pakistan's big cities. The project aims to increase the availability of air quality data in Pakistan and make citizens more aware of the health impacts of air pollution.https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/pakistans- rising-air-pollution-crisis/ The US State Department has set up three high- quality air quality monitoring stations at three locations in Pakistan. Specifically, studies have revealed the negative consequences air pollution can have on the welfare of those impacted. Studies have revealed how the constant fluctuation of particulate matter poses a major threat to Pakistan's citizens who are frequently exposes to harmful levels of air pollution. Suspended Particulate Matter, which has been linked to respiratory illnesses has been found in harmful quantities in Pakistan's major urban areas. Some strategies that can be used to effectively manage Pakistan's urban air pollution problems include the advancements to road design and improvement of transport sustainability, increased use of abatement policy by the Pakistani government, and a conversion to clean fuel energy alternatives like CNG.  Climate change   Natural disasters  Due to Pakistan's diverse land and climatic conditions, it is prone to different forms of natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, droughts, cyclones and hurricanes. A disaster management report claims that the provinces of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), Balochistan and AJK are vulnerable seismic regions and hence highly susceptible to earthquakes, while Sindh and Punjab constantly suffer from floods because they are low-lying areas. Some of the worst natural disasters that Pakistan has faced include the 1935 Quetta earthquake when around 60,000 people were killed, the 1950 floods when an estimated 2900 people died and 900,000 people were left homeless, the 1974 Hunza earthquake where around 5300 people were killed, the 2005 Kashmir quake that killed at least 73,000 and affected more than 1.5 million people, and the Pakistan floods of 2010 where 20 million people were affected. Conservation efforts The government has expressed concern about environmental threats to economic growth and social development and since the early 1990s has addressed environmental concerns with new legislation and institutions such as the Pakistan Environment Protection Council. However, foreign lenders provide most environmental protection funds, and only 0.04 percent of the government's development budget goes to environmental protection. Thus, the government's ability to enforce environmental regulations is limited, and private industries often lack the funds to meet environmental standards established by international trade organizations. Government of Pakistan start new compagin with Clean and Green Pakistan to over come environmental issues.  Clean Green Champion Program  An initiative named Clean Green Pakistan was launched in 2019 by Government of Pakistan. The idea of initiative was to hold a competition between cities of Pakistan in Cleanliness and Greenery. A web portal was launched where citizens can get registered and report their activities to earn points. Citizens would also be awarded medals when they reach a certain threshold of points.  Billion Tree Tsunami  The Billion Tree Tsunami was launched in 2014, by the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan, as a response to the challenge of global warming. Pakistan's Billion Tree Tsunami restores 350,000 hectares of forests and degraded land to surpass its Bonn Challenge commitment. The project aimed at improving the ecosystems of classified forests, as well as privately owned waste and farm lands, and therefore entails working in close collaboration with concerned communities and stakeholders to ensure their meaningful participation through effectuating project promotion and extension services. In just a year it has added three- quarters of a billion new trees, as part of a “tree tsunami” aimed at reversing worsening forest loss. The projected was completed in August 2017, ahead of schedule. This remarkable initiative has been highly acknowledged by international media namely Washington Post, VOA News, The Hindu, REUTERS, AlJazeera and many others. Short film like \\"Green Election Compagin\\" and \\" Stop \\" is a part of Cean Green Pakistan Effort. National Conservation Strategy The Conservation Strategy Report has three explicit objectives: conservation of natural resources, promotion of sustainable development, and improvement of efficiency in the use and management of resources. It sees itself as a \\"call for action\\" addressed to central and provincial governments, businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local communities, and individuals. The primary agricultural nonpoint source pollutants are nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus), sediment, animal wastes, pesticides, and salts. Agricultural nonpoint sources enter surface water through direct surface runoff or through seepage to ground water that discharges to a surface water outlet. Various farming activities result in the erosion of soil particles. The sediment produced by erosion can damage fish habitat and wetlands, and often transports excess agricultural chemicals resulting in contaminated runoff. This runoff, in turn, affects changes to aquatic habitat such as temperature increases and decreased oxygen. The most common sources of excess nutrients in surface water from nonpoint sources are chemical fertilizers and manure from animal facilities. Such nutrients cause eutrophication in surface water. Pesticides used for pest control in agricultural operations can also contaminate surface as well as ground-water resources. Return flows, runoff, and leach ate from irrigated lands may transport sediment, nutrients, salts, and other materials. Finally, improper grazing practices in riparian areas, as well as upland areas, can also cause water quality degradation. The development of Pakistan is viewed as a multigenerational enterprise. In seeking to transform attitudes and practices, the National Conservation Strategy recognizes that two key changes in values are needed: the restoration of the conservation ethic derived from Islamic moral values, called Qantas, and the revival of community spirit and responsibility, Haqooq ul Ibad. The National Conservation Strategy Report recommends fourteen program areas for priority implementation: maintaining soils in croplands, increasing efficiency of irrigation, protecting watersheds, supporting forestry and plantations, restoring rangelands and improving livestock, protecting water bodies and sustaining fisheries, conserving biodiversity, increasing energy efficiency, developing and deploying renewable resources, preventing or decreasing pollution, managing urban wastes, supporting institutions to manage common resources, integrating population and environmental programs, and preserving the cultural heritage. It identifies sixty-eight specific programs in these areas, each with a long- term goal and expected outputs and physical investments required within ten years. Special attention has been paid to the potential roles of environmental NGOs, women's organizations, and international NGOs in working with the government in its conservation efforts. Recommendations from the National Conservation Strategy Report are incorporated in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1993–98). In a recent study conducted by the Global CLEAN campaign, it was found that the average temperature in Pakistan had risen by .2 degrees in only two years, This is a dramatic change and puts emphasis on climate change campaigns.

Environmental Health issues are major risk factors for the Global Burden of Diseases. The 3rd leading cause of death in low and middle-income countries is COPD, 5th leading cause is Lower Respiratory Infections and seventh is Diarrheal diseases. In Nepal, COPD is the second major cause of death after Ischemic Heart Diseases. Diarrhea and Lower Respiratory Infections are the 4th and 5th causes of death respectivelyhttps://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/. Non-timber forests are threatened by deforestation, habitat degradation and unsustainable harvesting. Major threats to some protected areas are grazing all year around, poaching for high value products, illegal timber harvesting and unsustainable tourism. Rangelands are suffering from an enormous grazing pressure and wetland biodiversity is threatened by encroachment of wetland habitat, unsustainable harvesting of wetland resources, industrial pollution, agricultural runoff, the introduction of exotic and invasive species into wetland ecosystems, and siltation. Mountain biodiversity is suffering due to ecological fragility and instability of high mountain environments, deforestation, poor management of natural resources, and inappropriate farming practices. Agrobiodiversity is under threat due to use of high yielding varieties, destruction of natural habitat, overgrazing, land fragmentation, commercialisation of agriculture and the extension of modern highyielding varieties, indiscriminate use of pesticides, population growth and urbanisation, and changes in farmer’s priorities (MFSC, 2000). More factors for loss of biodiversity include landslide and soil erosion, pollution, fire, overgrazing, illegal trade, hunting and smuggling.  Possible causes Mainly in rural and mountainous areas of the country, where people often have no ventilation in the home due to cold outdoor temperatures, they tend to use solid and biomass fuel. Almost 64% of indoor cooking is done with firewood, and 10% of households burn cow dung due to lack of improved stoves, gas for cooking, and better ventilation. This is a major problem to cause environmental health issues like conjunctivitis, upper respiratory irritation, and acute respiratory infection. In Kathmandu, ambient air pollution due to construction projects, the high population which results in an increased number of vehicles, and bad conditions of the road lead to hazardous pollution Skolnik, Richard. Global health 101. Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2011..  Major issue  Air pollution  The death rate from both indoor and outdoor air pollutions was 133.3 per 100,000 populations(2017) which is the second-highest death rate after due to Cardiovascular diseases in Nepal. There is no complete combust when coal and biomass fuels are burned. They leave some variety of chemicals and gases behind which are usually breathable and can be associated with long- term chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, cardiovascular disease, and adverse reproductive outcomes. The most vulnerable groups are women and children in household air pollution.

Unsafe water  In Nepal, Diarrhea is the 4th leading cause of death. There is still limited systemic monitoring of the water system and water quality https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/.  Unsafe hygiene  Although 48% of households are access to safe drinking water, 38% still do not have proper sanitation, and 15% practice open defecation or have a lack of sanitation facility. Due to the lack of toilet facilities, inadequate sanitation, and solid waste disposal, it results in children to suffer from diarrhea and vector-related diseases.

Action of plan Availability of improved stoves and gases for cooking in remote areas to reduce indoor pollution. Encouraging the city to use low- carbon emissions vehicles to reduce urban pollution. Proper housing and indoor environment. Recycling the waste to conserve natural resources. Health education and awareness program.  Environmental issues as of 2005 The US Library of Congress Federal Research Division reported the following issues as of 2005:  Water and air pollution  Sedimentation and discharge of industrial effluents are prominent sources of water pollution, and the burning of wood for fuel is a significant source of indoor air pollution and respiratory problems. Vehicular and industrial emissions increasingly have contributed to air pollution in urban areas.  Deforestation  Deforestation and land degradation appear to affect a far greater proportion of the population and have the worst consequences for economic growth and individuals’ livelihoods. Forest loss has contributed to floods, soil erosion, and stagnant agricultural output. Estimates suggest that from 1966 to 2000 forest cover declined from 45 to 29 percent of the total land area. Often cited causes of deforestation include population growth, high fuelwood consumption, infrastructure projects, and conversion of forests into grazing- and cropland. According to government estimates, 1.5 million tons of soil nutrients are lost annually, and by 2002 approximately 5 percent of agricultural holdings had been rendered uncultivable as a result of soil erosion and flooding. Land degradation is attributed to population growth, improper use of agro-chemicals, and overly intensive use of landholdings that are too small to provide most households with sufficient food. Since the late 1980s, government policies have attempted to address these numerous and related problems. Policies often are hampered by lack of funding, insufficient understanding of Nepal’s mountain ecosystems, bureaucratic inefficiency, and sometimes contentious relations between the central government and local communities.(MFSC, 2000)  Overpopulation  A major threat factor to the local environment is the growing Nepalese population. According to the 1991 census, the total population of Nepal was around 18.5 million. In 2000, the population was estimated to be 22 million (MFSC, 2000). More than half (53 per cent) of this population lies under the absolute poverty line and is about to double in the next 26 years (MoPE (a), 2000). Poverty has causal effects on population and vice versa, which contributes to environmental deterioration. Rapid population growth has led to an increase in demand for fuel wood, timber, fodder and land to grow more food (MFSC, 2000).

Two Romance languages are widely spoken and official in Galicia: the native Galician and Spanish. Etymology of the ethnonym Castro culture carved stones The ethnonym Galicians (Galegos) derives from the Latin Gallaeci or Callaeci, itself an adaptation of the name of a local Celtic tribe known to the Greeks as Καλλαϊκoί (Kallaikoí), who lived in what is now Galicia and northern Portugal, and who were conquered by the Roman General Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus in the 2nd century BCE. The Romans later applied this name to all the people who shared the same culture and language in the northwest, from the Douro River valley in the south to the Cantabrian Sea in the north and west to the Navia River, encompassing tribes as the Celtici, the Artabri, the Lemavi and the Albiones, among others. The etymology of the name has been studied since the 7th century by authors such as Isidore of Seville, who wrote that \\"Galicians are called so because of their fair skin, as the Gauls\\", relating the name to the Greek word for milk. However, modern scholars have derived the name of the ancient Callaeci either from Proto-Indo-European *kal-n-eH2 'hill', through a local relational suffix -aik-, so meaning 'the highlanders'; or either from Proto-Celtic *kallī- 'forest', so meaning 'the forest (people)'.Curchin, Leonard A. (2008) Estudios GallegosThe toponyms of the Roman Galicia: New Study. CUADERNOS DE ESTUDIOS GALLEGOS LV (121): 111. The most recent proposal comes from linguist Francesco Benozzo after identifying the root gall- / kall- in a number of Celtic words with the meaning \\"stone\\" or \\"rock\\", as follows: gall (old Irish), gal (Middle Welsh), gailleichan (Scottish Gaelic), kailhoù (Breton), galagh (Manx) and gall (Gaulish). Hence, Benozzo explains the name Callaecia and its ethnonym Callaeci as being \\"the stone people\\" or \\"the people of the stone\\" (\\"those who work with stones\\"), in reference to the ancient megaliths and stone formations so common in Galicia and Portugal.Benozzo, F.

Languages Galician A comparative map of Galicia showing speakers of Galician as first language in 2001 and 2011, Galician Institute of Statistics. Galician is a Romance language belonging to the Western Ibero-Romance branch; as such, it derives from Latin. It has official status in Galicia. Galician is also spoken in the neighbouring autonomous communities of Asturias and Castile and León, near their borders with Galicia. Medieval or Old Galician, also known by linguists as Galician- Portuguese, developed locally in the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula from Vulgar Latin, becoming the language spoken and written in the medieval kingdoms of Galicia (from 1230 united with the kingdoms of Leon and Castille under the same sovereign) and Portugal. The Galician-Portuguese language developed a rich literary tradition from the last years of the 12th century. During the 13th century it gradually substituted Latin as the language used in public and private charters, deeds, and legal documents, in Galicia, Portugal, and in the neighbouring regions in Asturias and Leon. Galician-Portuguese diverged into two linguistic varieties - Galician and Portuguese - from the 15th century on. Galician became a regional variety open to the influence of Castilian Spanish, while Portuguese became the international one, as language of the Portuguese Empire. The two varieties are still close together, and in particular northern Portuguese dialects share an important number of similarities with Galician ones. The official institution regulating the Galician language, backed by the Galician government and universities, the Royal Galician Academy, claims that modern Galician must be considered an independent Romance language belonging to the group of Ibero-Romance languages and having strong ties with Portuguese and its northern dialects. However, the Associaçom Galega da Língua (Galician Language Association) and Academia Galega da Língua Portuguesa (Galician Academy of the Portuguese Language), belonging to the Reintegrationist movement, support the idea that differences between Galician and Portuguese speech are not enough to justify considering them as separate languages: Galician is simply one variety of Galician- Portuguese, along with Brazilian Portuguese, African Portuguese, the Galician- Portuguese still spoken in Spanish Extremadura, (Fala), and other variations. Nowadays, despite the positive effects of official recognition of the Galician language, Galicia's socio-linguistic development has experienced the growing influence of Spanish due to the media as well as legal imposition of Spanish in learning. Galicia also boasts a rich oral tradition, in the form of songs, tales, and sayings, which has made a vital contribution to the spread and development of the Galician language. Still flourishing today, this tradition shares much with that of Portugal. Castilianization Many Galician surnames have become Castilianized over the centuries, most notably after the forced submission of the Galician nobility obtained by the Catholic Monarchs in the last years of the 15th century. This reflected the gradual spread of Spanish language, through the cities, in Santiago de Compostela, Lugo, A Coruña, Vigo and Ferrol, in the last case due to the establishment of an important base of the Spanish navy there in the 18th century. For example, surnames like Orxás, Veiga, Outeiro, became Orjales, Vega, Otero. Toponyms like Ourense, A Coruña, Fisterra became Orense, La Coruña, Finisterre. In many cases this linguistic assimilation created confusion, for example Niño da Aguia (Galician: Eagle's Nest) was translated into Spanish as Niño de la Guía (Spanish: the Guide's child) and Mesón do Bento (Galician: Benedict's house) was translated as Mesón del Viento (Spanish: House of Wind). Geography and demographics Galician bagpipers in New York. Ancient peoples of Galicia In pre-historic times Galicia was one of the primary foci of Atlantic European Megalithic Culture.Benozzo, F. (2018): \\"Uma paisagem atlântica pré-histórica. Etnogénese e etno-filologia paleo-mesolítica das tradições galega e portuguesa\\", in proceedings of Jornadas das Letras Galego- Portugesas 2015-2017. Università de Bologna, DTS and Academia Galega da Língua Portuguesa. pp. 159-170 Following on that, the gradual emergence of a Celtic cultureGalicia and North Portugal are the origin of European celticity, interview with Prof. Francesco Benozzo, 13/03/2016 gave way to a well established material Celtic civilization known as the Castro Culture. Galicia suffered a relatively late and weak Romanisation, although it was after this event when Latin, which is considered to be the main root of modern Galician, eventually replaced the old Gallaecian language. The decline of the Roman Empire was followed by the rule of Germanic tribes, namely the Suebi, who formed a separate Galician kingdom in 409, and the Visigoths. In 718 the area briefly came under the control of the Moors after their conquest and dismantling of the Visigothic Empire, but the Galicians successfully rebelled against Moorish rule in 739, establishing a renewed Kingdom of Galicia which would become totally stable after 813 with the medieval popularization of the \\"Way of St James\\". Political and administrative divisions The autonomous community (a concept established in the Spanish constitution of 1978) that is known as (a) Comunidade Autónoma Galega in Galician, and as (la) Comunidad Autónoma Gallega in Spanish (in English: Galician Autonomous Community), is composed of the four Spanish provinces of A Coruña, Lugo, Ourense, and Pontevedra. Population, main cities and languages The official Statistical body of Galicia is the Instituto Galego de Estatística (IGE). According to the IGE, Galicia's total population in 2008 was 2,783,100 (1,138,474 in A Coruña, 355.406 in Lugo, 336.002 in Ourense, and 953.218 in Pontevedra). The most important cities in this region, which serve as the provinces' administrative centres, are Vigo, Pontevedra (in Pontevedra), Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña, Ferrol (in A Coruña), Lugo (in Lugo), and Ourense (in Ourense). The official languages are Galician and Spanish. Knowledge of Spanish is compulsory according to the Spanish constitution and virtually universal. Knowledge of Galician, after declining for many years owing to the pressure of Spanish and official persecution, is again on the rise due to favorable official language policies and popular support. Currently about 82% of Galicia's population can speak Galician and about 61% has it as a mother tongue. Culture  Celtic revival and Celtic identity  La Romería (the pilgrimage), Sorolla, 1915 In the 19th century a group of Romantic and Nationalist writers and scholars, among them Eduardo Pondal and Manuel Murguía, led a \\"Celtic revival\\" initially based on the historical testimonies of ancient Roman and Greek authors (Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, Strabo and Ptolemy), who wrote about the Celtic peoples who inhabited Galicia; but they also based this revival in linguistic and onomastic data, and in the similarity of some aspects of the culture and the geography of Galicia with that of the Celtic countries in Ireland, Brittany and Britain. The similarities include legends and traditions, decorative and popular arts and music. It also included the green hilly landscape or the ubiquity of Iron Age hill-forts, Neolithic megaliths and Bronze Age cup and ring marks. During the late 19th and early 20th century this revival permeated Galician society: in 1916 Os Pinos, a poem by Eduardo Pondal, was chosen as the lyrics for the new Galician hymn. One of the strophes of the poem says: Galicians, be strong / ready to great deeds / align your breast / for a glorious end / sons of the noble Celts / strong and traveler / fight for the fate / of the homeland of Breogán.\\"Galegos, sede fortes / prontos a grandes feitos / aparellade os peitos / a glorioso afán / fillos dos nobres celtas / fortes e peregrinos / luitade plos destinos / dos eidos de Breogán\\" Cf. The Celtic past became an integral part of the self-perceived Galician identity: as a result an important number of cultural association and sport clubs received names related to the Celts, among them Celta de Vigo, Céltiga FC, or Fillos de Breogán. From the 1970s a series of Celtic music and cultural festivals were also popularized, being the most notable the Festival Internacional do Mundo Celta de Ortigueira, at the same time that Galician folk musical bands and interpreters became usual participants in Celtic festivals elsewhere, as in the Interceltic festival of Lorient, where Galicia sent its first delegation already in 1976.

A group that have become known as brittlegills. It has been commonly known as the Common Yellow Russula for some years, and latterly the Ochre Brittlegill. It is widespread, and common in mixed woodland. Taxonomy Russula ochroleuca was first noted and named as a species of Agaricus by the pioneering South African mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801.  Description The cap is dull yellow and wide, initially convex, later flat, or slightly depressed. The cap margin becomes furrowed when mature, and it is two-thirds peeling. The gills are white to greyish white, and are adnexed. The stipe is long, wide, cylindrical, white or later greyish. The taste is mild to moderately hot. It could be confused with the similar-looking and much better tasting Russula claroflava. Distribution and habitat Russula ochroleuca grows in deciduous and coniferous forest, where it (at least in Northwestern Europe) is very common. In the USA it is fairly common under conifers; birch, and aspen in the Northern States. Edibility Although considered edible, it is not known as particularly tasty. It is mild to moderately hot.

Their sense of identity and cohesion stems from their shared value system, expressed among the gitanos as the leyes gitanas (Gypsy laws). Traditionally, they maintain their social circles strictly within their patrigroups, as interaction between patrigroups increases the risk of feuding, which may result in fatalities. The emergence of Pentecostalism has impacted this practice, as the lifestyle of Pentecostal gitanos involves frequent contact with gitanos from outside their own patrigroups during church services and meetings. To varying degrees, they identify with Andalusian culture and music due to the large and culturally significant gitano population present in that region. Data on ethnicity is not collected in Spain, although the Government's statistical agency CIS estimated in 2007 that the number of Gitanos present in Spain is probably around one million. Name The term gitano evolved from the word egiptano (\\"Egyptian\\"), which was the Old Spanish demonym for someone from Egipto (Egypt). \\"Egiptano\\" was the regular adjective in Old Spanish for someone from Egypt, however, in Middle and Modern Spanish the irregular adjective egipcio supplanted egiptano to mean Egyptian, probably to differentiate Egyptians proper from Gypsys. Meanwhile, the term egiptano evolved through elision into egitano and finally into gitano, losing the meaning of Egyptian and carrying with it a specific meaning of Romanis in Spain. The two peoples are now unambiguously differentiated in modern Spanish, “egipcios” for Egyptians and “gitanos” for Roma in Spain, with “egiptano” being obsolete for either. Though etymologically the term gitano originally meant \\"Egyptian\\", the use itself of the Old Spanish word meaning \\"Egyptian\\" (egiptano) to refer to Romanis in Spain developed in the same way that the English word \\"Gypsy\\" also evolved from the English adjective \\"Egyptian\\" to refer to Romanis in Britain. Some Romanis, a people originating in the northern regions of the Indian Subcontinent, upon their first arrivals to Europe, either claimed to be Egyptians for a more favourable treatment by local Europeans, or were mistaken as Egyptians by local Europeans. While it is now widely known that Romanis are ultimately of northwestern Hindustani origin (an area today shared between India and Pakistan), and are unrelated to the Egyptian people proper, many Romanis did enter Europe via a generations-long migration which included Egypt as one of their last stops before their arrival into Europe. It is for this same reason that in the Albanian language variations of the Albanian term for \\"Egyptian\\" are still used to refer to a Romani people of Albania, which in English are also still ambiguously referred to as Balkan Egyptians. This group of Romanis in Albania are likewise of northwestern Hindustani origin, and are not related to the people of Egypt. Identity Gitano identity is particularly complex in Spain for a variety of reasons which are examined below. Nevertheless, it can be safely said that both from the perspective of gitano and non-gitano (payo) Spaniards, individuals generally considered to belong to this ethnicity are those of full or near-full gitano descent and who also self-identify. A confusing element is the thorough hybridization of Andalusian and Roma culture (and some would say identity) at a popular level. This has occurred to the point where Spaniards from other regions of Spain can commonly mistake elements of one for the other. The clearest example of this is flamenco music and Sevillanas, art forms that are Andalusian rather than gitano in origin but, having been strongly marked by gitanos in interpretative style, is now commonly associated to this ethnicity by many Spaniards. The fact that the largest population of gitanos is concentrated in Southern Spain has even led to a confusion between gitano accents and those typical of Southern Spain even though many Kale populations in the northern half of Spain (such as Galicia) do not speak Andalusian Spanish. Indeed, the boundaries among gitano and non-gitano ethnicities are so blurred by intermarriage and common cultural traits in the south of the country, that self-identification is on occasion the only real marker for ethnicity. Few Spaniards are aware, for example, that Andalusian singer and gitano popular icon Lola Flores was, in fact, not of gitano ethnicity and did not consider herself as such. The mistake can be commonly attributed to her being a Flamenco singer of humble origin, with a strong Andalusian accent, her vaguely South Asian features as well as to her having married into a Gitano family. The term \\"gitano\\" has also acquired among many a negative socio-economic connotation referring to the lowest strata of society, sometimes linking it to crime and marginality and even being used as a term of abuse. In this, one can be Gitano \\"by degree\\" according to how much one fits into pre-conceived stereotypes or social stigmas. On the other hand, the exaltation of Roma culture and heritage is a large element of wider Andalusian folklore and Spanish identity. Gitanos, rather than being considered a \\"foreign\\" or \\"alien\\" minority within the country are perceived as \\"deep\\" or \\"real Spain\\", as is expressed by the term \\"España Cañí\\" which means both \\"Gypsy Spain\\" and \\"Traditional\\" or \\"Folkloric Spain\\". This is largely the result of the period of romantic nationalism which followed the Spanish war of independence, during which the values of the Enlightenment arriving from Western Europe were rejected and Gypsies became the symbol of Spanish traditionalism, independence and racial consciousness. Origin The Romani people originate from northwestern Hindustan,Current Biology. presumably from the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan and the Punjab region shared between India and Pakistan. The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of Romani language lie in the Indian subcontinent: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indic languages and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts, daily routines and numerals. More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with Hindi and Punjabi. It shares many phonetic features with Marwari, while its grammar is closest to Bengali. Linguistic evaluation carried out in the nineteenth century by Pott (1845) and Miklosich (1882–1888) showed that the Romani language is to be classed as a New Indo-Aryan language (NIA), not a Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA), establishing that the ancestors of the Romani could not have left the Indian subcontinent significantly earlier than AD 1000, then finally reaching Europe several hundred years later. Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent and migrated as a group. According to a genetic study in 2012, the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of northern India, traditionally referred to collectively as the \\"Ḍoma\\", are the likely ancestral populations of modern \\"Roma\\" in Europe. Migration to Spain How and when the Romani arrived in the Iberian Peninsula from Northern India is a question whose consensus is far from being reached. A popular theory, although without any documentation, claims they came from North Africa, from where they would have crossed the Strait of Gibraltar to meet again in France with the northern migratory route.http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1110754&orden;=33593&info;=link Thus, gitanos would be a deformation of Latin Tingitani, that is, from Tingis, today Tangier. Another, more consistent theory, and well documented, is that they entered the Iberian Peninsula from France. Although, there is controversy of the date of the first arrival, since there is evidence of a safe conduct granted in Perpignan in 1415 by the infante Alfonso of Aragon to one Tomás, son of Bartolomé de Sanno, who is said to be \\"Indie Majoris\\". Or instead, could be the so-called Juan de Egipto Menor, who entered through France, who in 1425 Alfonso V granted him a letter of insurance, which is mostly accepted as the first gypsy to reach the peninsula. In 1435 they were seen in Santiago de Compostela, Gitanos were recorded in Barcelona and Zaragoza by 1447, and in 1462 they were received with honors in Jaén. Years later, to the gitanos, the grecianos, pilgrims who penetrated the Mediterranean shore in the 1480s, were added to them, probably because of the fall of Constantinople. Both of them continued to wander throughout the peninsula, being well received at least until 1493, year in which a group of gitanos arrived at Madrid, where the Council agreed to \\"... give alms to the gitanos because at the request of the City passed ahead, ten reales, to avoid the damages that could be done by three hundred people who came ... \\". In those years safe conducts were granted to supposedly noble gypsy pilgrims. The follow-up of these safe-conducts throughout Spain has provided some data to historians according to Teresa San Román: * The number of Romani that entered or inhabited the Peninsula in the 15th-century is estimated at approximately 3,000 individuals. * The Roma traveled in variable groups, of 80-150 people, led by a man. * Each autonomous group maintained relations at a distance with one of the others, there being perhaps relations of kinship among them (something common in today among Spanish Romani). * The separation between each group was variable and sometimes some followed the others at close range and by the same routes. * The most common survival strategy was to present as Christian pilgrims to seek the protection of a noble. * The way of life was nomadic and dedicated to divination and performance (spectacle). In 1492, gipsy auxiliaries helped the army of the Kingdom of Castile and León in the Reconquista in Granada ending the reign of muslims in Spain. Gitanos have a low and little politically committed role, with some particular exceptions, in Andalusian nationalism and identity, which is strongly based on a belief in the oriental basis of Andalusi heritage acted as a bridge between occidental-western and oriental- eastern Andalusian culture at a popular level. The father of such a movement, Blas Infante, in his book Orígenes de lo flamenco y secreto del cante jondo, etymologically, went as far as alleging that the word flamenco derives from Andalusian Arabic fellah mengu, supposedly meaning \\"escapee peasant\\". Infante believed that numerous Muslim Andalusians became Moriscos, who were obliged to convert, dispersed and eventually ordered to leave Spain stayed and mixed with the Romani newcomers instead of abandoning their land. These claims have been rejected by many historians and genetic research papers. Spanish Romani people. Yevgraf Sorokin, 1853. A Gypsy dance in the gardens of the Alcázar of Seville. For about 300 years, Romanies were subject to a number of laws and policies designed to eliminate them from Spain as an identifiable group: Romani settlements were broken up and the residents dispersed; sometimes, Romanies were required to marry non-Roma; they were prohibited from using their language and rituals, and were excluded from public office and from guild membership. In 1749 A major effort to get rid of the gypsy population in Spain was carried out through a raid organized by the government. It arrested all gypsies (Romani) in the realm, and imprisoned them in jails, eventually releasing them due to the widespread discontent that the measure caused. During the Spanish Civil War, gitanos were not persecuted for their ethnicity by either side. Under the regime of Francisco Franco, Gitanos were often harassed or simply ignored, although their children were educated, sometimes forcibly, much as all Spaniards are nowadays. On the other hand, Andalusian and gitano culture was instrumentalized in the country's tourist promotion strategy which focused on the south to exalt the uniqueness of Spanish culture. However, the country's industrialization negatively affected gitanos as the migration of rural Spaniards to major cities led to the growth of shanty towns around urban areas with a consequent explosion in birth rates and a drastic fall in the quality of living and an abandonment of traditional professions. Traditional Gitano neighbourhoods such as Triana in Seville became gentrified and gitanos were slowly pushed out to the periphery and these new shanty towns. In the post-Franco era, Spanish government policy has been much more sympathetic, especially in the area of social welfare and social services. In 1977, the last anti-Romani laws were repealed, an action promoted by Juan de Dios Ramírez Heredia, the first Romani deputy. Beginning in 1983, the government operated a special program of Compensatory Education to promote educational rights for the disadvantaged, including those in Romani communities. During the heroin epidemic that afflicted Spain in the 80s and 90s, Gitano shanty towns became central to the drug trade, a problem which afflicts Spain to this day. Although the size of shanty towns has been vastly reduced in Madrid, they remain significant in other major cities such as Seville, Huelva and Almería. Nevertheless, Spain is still considered a model for integration of gitano communities when compared to other countries with Romani populations in Eastern Europe. Language Historically, gitanos spoke Caló fluently, often alongside the language spoken in the region they inhabited. Caló is a type of para-Romani, combining the phonology and grammar of the Catalan or Castilian, with a lexicon derived from Romani. The para- Romani resulting from the combination of Basque and Romani is called Erromintxela. Very few gitanos maintain a comprehensive and functional knowledge of Caló. A study on the actual usage patterns of Caló among a group of mainly Andalusian gitanos concluded that the language currently consists of between 350 and 400 unique terms, the knowledge of which varies considerably among gitanos. This would exclude a similar number of Calo words which have entered mainstream Spanish slang. According to the authors of the study, the majority of gitanos acknowledge that the language is in a terminal state, with many asserting that the language is totally lost. Religion In Spain, gitanos were traditionally Roman Catholics who participated in four of the Church's sacraments (baptism, marriage, confirmation, and extreme unction). They are not regular churchgoers but follow traditions such as the cult of the Virgin of El Rocío. In 1997, Pope John Paul II beatified the Catholic gitano martyr Ceferino Giménez Malla, in a ceremony reportedly attended by some 3000 roma. Sara-la-Kali is the patron saint of Romani people. They rarely go to folk healers, and they participate fully in Spain's state-supported medical system. Gitanos have a special involvement with recently dead kin and visit their graves frequently. They spend more money than non-Gitanos of equivalent economic classes in adorning grave sites. The Spanish Evangelical Federation (mostly composed by members of the Assemblies of God and Pentecostal) claims that 150,000 Gitanos have joined their faith in Spain.\\"Evangelics fish faithful in catholic crisis\\"; FEREDE, October 2008 The Romani Evangelical Assembly is the only religious institution entirely led and composed by Roma. The gitano Evangelical church (Iglesia de Filadelfia) asserts the gitano people originate from a group of Jews who got lost during Moses' lifetime and eventually became the gitanos.Gay y Blasco 2002 p. 634 Marriage The traditional Spanish Romani place a high value on the extended family. Virginity is essential in unmarried women. Both men and women often marry young. A traditional gitano wedding requires a pedimiento (similar to an engagement party) followed by the casamiento (wedding ceremony), where el yeli must be sung to the bride to celebrate the virginity and honour of the bride (proven by the ritual of the pañuelo). In the pañuelo ritual, a group consisting of an ajuntaora (a professional who is skilled in performing the ritual and is paid by the family), along with the married women of the family, take the bride into a separate room during the wedding and examine her to ascertain that she is a virgin. The ajuntaora is the one who performs the ritual on the bride, as the other women watch to be witnesses that the bride is virgin. The ajuntaora wraps a white, decoratively embroidered cloth (the pañuelo) around her index finger and inserts it shallowly into the vaginal canal of the bride. During this process, the Bartholin's glands are depressed, causing them to secrete a liquid that stains the cloth. This action is repeated with three different sections of the cloth to produce three stains, known as \\"rosas\\". This process is conceived by the women as the retrieval of the bride's \\"honra\\", her honour, contained within a \\"grape\\" inside her genitals which is popped during the examination, and the spillage collected onto the pañuelo. When finished with the exam, the women come out of the room and sing el yeli to the couple. During this, the men at the wedding rip their shirts and lift the wife onto their shoulders and do the same with the husband, as they sing \\"el yeli\\" to them. Weddings can last very long; up to three days is usual in the Gitano culture. At weddings, \\"gitanos\\" invite everyone and anyone that they know of (especially other gitanos). On some occasions, payos (gadjos) may attend as well, although this is not common. Through the night, many bulerías are danced and especially sung. Today, rumba gitana or rumba flamenca are a usual party music fixture. Gitanos may also marry by elopement, an event that garners less approval than a wedding ceremony.Gay y Blasco 1997, p. 528 Crime issues According to the website of the Fundación Secretariado Gitano (\\"Gitano Secretariat Foundation\\"), in the Spanish prison system the Spanish Romani women represent 25% of the incarcerated female population, while Spanish Romani people represent 1.4% of the total Spanish population. 64% of the detentions of gitano people are drug trafficking-related. 93.2% of women inmates for drug trafficking are gitanas. 13.2% of the total drug trafficking-related inmates are of gitano ethnicity. Marginalisation The 2016 Pew Research poll found that 49% of Spaniards held unfavorable views of Roma.\\"Negative opinions about Roma, Muslims in several European nations\\". Pew Research Center. 11 July 2016. Gitanos continue to experience discrimination on an interpersonal level, such as by being refused entry to bars and clubs or losing their jobs if their ethnicity is made known to their employer. Marginalisation occurs on an institutional level; Gitano children are regularly segregated from their non-gitano peers and have poorer academic outcomes as a result. In 1978, 68% of adult gitanos were illiterate.Experiencias y trayectorias de éxito escolar de gitanas y gitanos en España, p. 100. Literacy has greatly improved over time, and approximately 10% of gitanos were illiterate as of 2006-2007 (with older gitanos much more likely than younger gitanos to be illiterate).Historias de éxito: Modelos para reducir el abandono escolar de la adolescencia gitana, p. 120. 98% of gitanos live below the poverty line.

Life and career Gorney was born Abraham Jacob Gornetzsky on December 12, 1896, in Białystok, Russia (now part of Poland), the son of Frieda (Perlstein) and Jacob Gornetzsky. His family was Jewish. In 1906, he witnessed the Bialystock pogrom, which forced his family into hiding for nearly two weeks, after which they fled to the United States arriving on 14 September 1906. His family settled in Detroit, Michigan where his father became an engineer at the newly formed Ford Motor Company. His mother bought a piano for her children. After two years of lessons, at age 14, Gorney was offered a job as a pianist at a local Nickelodeon. He worked his way through the University of Michigan (Class of 1917), and the University of Michigan Law School (Class of 1919), as a pianist. His studies were interrupted by World War I, during which he enlisted in the Navy. After graduating, he practiced law only briefly, then turned instead to his love of music, relocating with his wife to New York City, where he began his song writing career on Tin Pan Alley. He contributed numerous songs to musicals by the Shubert brothers. Later, Ira Gershwin introduced him to lyricist Yip Harburg, who became a frequent collaborator. The pair's most famous song was \\"Brother Can You Spare a Dime,\\" based on a lullaby that Gorney learned as a child in Russia. It first appeared in the 1932 Shubert production of New Americana and became the anthem of the Great Depression. The Gorney-Harburg partnership ended when Harburg hooked up with Gorney's wife, whom he subsequently married. Gorney is credited with bringing Shirley Temple to 20th Century-Fox (then known as Fox Films). It was while walking out the viewing of her last Frolics of Youth picture that Gorney saw her dancing in the movie theater lobby. Recognizing her from the screen, he arranged for her to have a tryout for the movie Stand Up and Cheer!, which he was working on as a songwriter. The role, which featured Temple singing Baby Take a Bow (which was co-written by Gorney) with James Dunn, turned out to be a breakthrough role for Temple. The song would become the title for Baby Take a Bow, the first film by Fox to feature Temple in a starring role.Shirley Temple Black, \\"Child Star: An Autobiography\\" (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1988), 32-36. Gorney's second marriage was to public relations consultant Sondra Karyl (Kattlove). Their daughter, Karen Lynn Gorney, is an actress and dancer who was in the original cast of All My Children, and starred opposite John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. Gorney has two sons, Dr. Roderic Gorney (with first wife Edelaine Roden) and Dan Gorney (with Sondra Karyl). Gorney's 2005 biography, Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?

It lies at the head of the Teign Estuary to the west of Teignmouth in the Teignbridge district. It is bypassed by the A380 and is also on the A383, A381, B3193 and B3195. Kingsteignton is currently represented in parliament by Anne Marie Morris, as part of the Newton Abbot Constituency.The local education centers (schools) include : Rydon Primary School, Teign School and Saint Michael's School Church of England School. Kingsteignton has a population of over 11,000. The threat of being incorporated into the nearby town of Newton Abbot prompted the parish council to change Kingsteignton's status to a town. The change took effect from 1 January 2009. The town has two electoral wards (east and west). Their combined populations at the 2011 census was 11,147 History Founded in the early 8th century by the kings of Wessex as the centre of a vast Saxon estate that extended from Teignmouth to Manaton, Kingsteignton was a key settlement in Saxon times and gave its name to the Saxon hundred of Teignton. The hundred moot or court was held in the village but it appears that by the time of the Domesday Survey the name of the hundred had been changed to Teignbridge, possibly indicating that the site of the court had been moved. As a royal vill Kingsteignton provided rich pickings for Danish raiders who plundered it in 1001. Medieval prosperity funded the rebuilding of the parish church (St Michaels) in the 15th century, its 85-foot tower being constructed in the 1480s. From the medieval period to the mid-19th century the parish church held an important position as the mother church of Highweek and Newton Bushell. The Fairwater Leat, fed by the springs at Rydon, superseded the Honeywell Spring as the established water supply in the Middle Ages and also supplied the power for three mills. A drought is said to have given rise to the annual Ram Roasting fair. According to legend there was insufficient water to baptise a child so a ram was sacrificed to the gods of the local spring. Water sprang forth and a ram has been roasted ever since at the fair, held nowadays on the late May bank holiday. Whit Tuesday was the traditional day for the fair but it was switched to Whit Monday in the early 1950s to fit in with school holidays and the later switch to the late May bank holiday was made for the same reason when the bank holiday was fixed as the last Monday in May. Until the 13th century the Manor of Kingsteignton was a crown demesne. In 1509 the manor passed to the Clifford family who still hold the title of Lord of the Manor today. The area gained minor publicity in July 2017, when local MP Anne Marie Morris used a racist remark in a speech concerning Brexit. She was subsequently suspended by the Conservative Party. Culture The local secondary school is Teign School, which also includes a 6th form college. Primary schools are St Michaels and Rydon. A third primary school has been built opposite Teign School called Kingsteignton School. The principal of the school is called Dr Penny Fitch. The town is twinned with Orbec, France. Geology Fine quality ball clay beds created some 30–40 million years ago during the Oligocene Period lie on the eastern edge of the Bovey Basin near Kingsteignton. The exploitation of these clays began in the late 17th century when it was discovered that their properties made them eminently suitable for pipe making. Their white firing properties attracted interest from potters looking for materials to improve their wares and their exploitation was boosted in 1791 when Josiah Wedgwood first purchased Kingsteignton clay. Over the past 200 years clay mining has brought continued employment and prosperity to Kingsteignton. Limestone has been extensively quarried at various times on either side of Golvers Hill at Rydon, Coombesend and Gildons. Kingsteignton Quarry at Rydon (now infilled) supplied stone for the building of Buckfast Abbey. Numerous limekilns, some still in existence, were found along the dry valley that extends from Rydon to Lindridge and along the Coombesend valley. The kiln at Kiln Forehead was demolished during the extension of Calvados Park whilst the kiln beside Rydon school was partly demolished and buried under an earth bank when the lane to Rydon Quarry was widened. Sand and gravel has also been extensively quarried at Babcombe Copse, Sands Copse and Heathfield, the latter becoming a large landfill site. Lysons' Magna Britannia mentions that the ancient Britons extracted alluvial tin from the gravels deposited by the river Teign. Historic estates The parish of Kingsteignton includes various historic estates including: *Whiteway, a Domesday Book manor and later a seat of the Yard family, today a farmhouse known as Whiteway Barton. Sport and leisure Newton Abbot RFC (established 1873) are based in Kingsteignton, playing home games at Rackerhayes.

Since 2000 the Government of Syria has significantly increased the expenditure on education 1 to 6. In 2002, elementary and primary education were combined into one basic education stage and education was made compulsory and free from grades 1 to 9. Education is free and compulsory from ages 7 to 15. Arabic is the medium of instruction in the Syrian Arab Republic. English is taught from grade 1, and French is taught from grade 7 in the basic learning stage as the primary second language. According to the 2007 census, 98 percent of schools in Syria are public (state run), 1.8 percent are private,http://www.open.edu/openlearn/society/international- development/international-studies/education-syria and 0.2 percent are United Nations Relief and Works Agency schools for children who are refugees. In 2007, there were 8 million students in the education system of Syria (4 million in basic education, 1.4 million in secondary and 2.3 million in tertiary). Given the current growth rate in the school age population, it is projected that by 2015, the education system in Syria will need to cater to an additional 1 million students in basic and secondary education. The school system in Syria is divided into basic and secondary education levels: * 1st to 6th grade: Primary Education Level. From 1st to 4th grade, it’s called the First Ring (; halaka oula) while 5th & 6th grade are called Second Ring (; halaka thania) * 7th to 9th grade: Pre-Secondary Education Level (; taelim 'edady ) * 10th to 12th grade: Upper Secondary Education (; taelim thanawi), which is the equivalent of High School. Baathism education The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party heavily influences the educational system in Syria, in which primary school students called “Al-Ba’ath Vanguards” (), elementary school students led by \\"Revolutionary Youth Union\\" (), and college students headed by “National Union of Students” (), are injected with Baathism ideology, Pan-Arabism and socialist beliefs. According to the Constitution of Syria of 1973, Chapter 3: Educational and Cultural Principles, Article 21, it is written: The article was later scrapped in the new Constitution of 2012. Nevertheless, the students are still being taught to Baathism through a subject known as \\"Political Arab Sociology\\". Early childhood care and education (ECCE) The Government of Syria is also taking charge of providing pre-primary or early childhood education. Up until the early 1990s, ECCE programs were provided by mostly non-governmental institutions, of which few belonged to the government sector, while others were either private or run by the Teacher's Syndicate, General Union of Workers (GUW) or the Women's Federation. In 1990 only 5 percent of the children between the ages of 3 and 5 were enrolled in 793 kindergartens. Ten years later 7.8 percent of that age group was enrolled. Furthermore, the data from the Syrian Ministry of Education shows an increase in the number of kindergartens from 1096 to 1475 in 2004.https://www.k12academics.com/Education%20Worldwide/education-syria Basic education The gross enrollment rate in primary education under basic education level in 2000 was 104.3 and it has been steadily rising, reaching to about 126.24 percent in 2007. Still, the enrollment of females is lower than males. The gender parity index, ratio of female enrollment to male enrollment, since 2006 was 0.955. The enrollment level in all programs at the lower secondary level has been rising significantly since early 2000, with the current gross enrollment rate of 95.3 percent. At the secondary lower level final exams of the 9th grade are carried out nationally at the same time. The result of these exams determines if the student goes to the \\"general\\" secondary schools or the technical secondary schools. Technical secondary schools include industrial and agricultural schools for male and female students, crafts school for female students, and commercial and computer science schools for both. It is mandatory for all Syrians to attend this basic level of education. Secondary education The Jules Jammal High School, Latakia, was a previous mandatory-era barracks. Syrian president Hafez al- Assad studied there The upper secondary education is for three years from grade 10 to grade 12. At the beginning of the 11th grade, those who go to \\"general\\" secondary school have to choose to continue their study in either the \\"literary branch\\" or the \\"scientific branch\\". The final exams of the 12th grade -commonly known as the Baccalauréat- are also carried out nationally and at the same time. The result of these exams determines which university, college and specialization the student attends. To do that, the student has to apply through a complicated system called \\"mufadalah\\" (). There are wide regional disparities in post-basic education. There are lower secondary and university enrollments in rural than urban areas. Even the higher income households in rural areas do not have access to post-secondary education opportunities. The secondary gross enrollment rate in 2007 stood at 72 percent, higher than the preceding years and one percentage point higher than the 2007 MENA regional gross enrollment rate at the secondary level. Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) At the secondary level, the education system also includes three years of general or vocational education. Syria has a relatively large proportion of secondary school students in vocational schools; about 36 percent of total secondary school students in 2004 are in vocational schools. According to UIS the total enrollment in technical and vocational education (both private and public) in 2007 decreased to 103 from 113,994 students in 2006. Out of the total number, 41898 are female students enrolled in TVET. In 1990s, the government aimed to increase TVET enrollment and at one time decided to allocate 70 percent of the lower secondary graduates to vocational schools, which meant doubling the share of TVET in total enrollment from 20 percent in 1990 to 40 percent in 2000. However, this later proved unsustainable. Then in 2000 a new policy stipulated 50:50 distributions of secondary students between general and vocational secondary education, and this was later decreased to 40 percent. Students enrolled in four main specializations:commercial,industrial, agricultural and handicrafts. The TVET system in Syria is very rigid with no options of reentering the formal school system. University education The earliest colleges founded in Syria were the School of Medicine (established 1903) and the Institute of Law (established 1913). The university education was founded in 1919 on a free of charge basis. Damascus University, known previously as the Syrian University, the oldest university in Syria The Ministry of Higher Education was established in 1966 to supervise the scientific and educational institutions, such as universities, academic councils, the Arabic Language Academy and educational hospitals. Most post- secondary education is state-provided, but legislation passed in 2001 allows the establishment of some private universities and colleges. Resources for education have risen in absolute terms over the past decade, but it is difficult to match the rate of population growth. Colleges charge modest fees ($10–20 a year) if the student achieves the sufficient marks in their Baccalaureate exams. If not, the student may opt to pay higher fees ($1500–3000) to enroll. There are some private schools and colleges but their fees are much higher. Domestic policies emphasize engineering and medicine in Syria’s universities, with less emphasis on the arts, law, and business. Most universities in Syria follow the French model of the high education, the university stages and the academic degrees are: First stage: the License awarded after four to six years depending on the field. Second stage: the DEA or DESS one to two years postgraduate degree equivalent to the master's degree in the American-English systems. Third stage: the doctorate three to five years after the DEA or an equivalent degree. 20 private universities have been given licenses, 14 of which have actually opened and 6 to be opened soon. Private universities will have an independent academic and management structure representing the owner and will be headed by the president of the university. There will also be a university board consisting of either: chancellor, faculty or division.

Higher technical institutes * Higher Institute of Marine Research * Higher Institute of Water Resource Management * Higher Institute of Business Administration Virtual university In September 2002, the first virtual university was founded. through which students can obtain degrees from international institutions.

Computer literacy This measure and others, such as making computer literacy mandatory at the high-school level and English- and French- language instruction compulsory in the elementary schools, have the goal of equipping students with computer and language skills in order to modernize the economy through the education system. Challenges Syria has shown great progress in providing access to basic education and to some extent, post basic education to the growing population. Still Syria has a long way to go to bring about a comprehensive change in the education system. Access to pre-primary level education is low in Syria when compared to other lower-middle income countries. The enrollment at the pre-primary level is 10 percent in Syria whereas it is 15.7 percent in the MENA region in 2007. The Government of Syria has to make substantial investments in infrastructure to improve access to preprimary education. The government needs to prioritize expansion of schools especially in underserved areas with vulnerable populations. According to research findings, children of disadvantaged backgrounds are the ones that benefit the most from early childhood programs by developing basic skills necessary for employment thereby moving them out of abject poverty. Currently, most of the Early Childhood Care and Education services in Syria are delivered through private kindergartens and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) based in urban areas. Despite increasing quantity of human capital through increasing access to education at all levels, the improvement of quality of the education and training system and consequently the quality of human capital is another challenge that Government of Syria needs to address. Weak growth in labor productivity over the past two decades has been associated with low quality and relevance of education in Syria. The results of International test scores TIMSS show that 44 percent of students who appeared in this international exam performed below the lowest international benchmark. Therefore, there is a greater need to improve the quality of overall education system. This also involves the need to incorporate the use of communication and technology to better prepare students to the demands of the globalised world. Currently, Syria’s computer and internet usage is very low compared to a number of neighboring countries and is much lower than the average for lower middle income countries. Syria also faces high repetition and dropout rates. The repetition rate at primary level has been very high, almost 12 percent in 2006 and has been steadily rising since 2003. At the secondary level, repetition rate has reached almost 20 percent. According to the latest data in 2004/05 the average repetition rate was 6 percent for grade 1-6, 13.3 percent for grades 7-9, and 7.3 percent for grades 10-12.Drop-out rates stood at 2.2 percent for grades 1-6, 8 percent for grades 7-9, and 7.3 percent for grades 10-12. Along with high repetition and dropout rates, a fairly low student–teacher ratio also signals internal inefficiency in the education system. The ratio in Syria is low due to the relatively high recruitment of teachers in comparison to the growth of students. The number of teachers grew at an annual rate of 7 percent between 2000 and 2006, which is almost twice the growth rate for students, which resulted in STR of 19:1 in basic education and 9:1 in secondary education. To increase the internal efficiency, the government should focus on hiring trained and competent teachers, reform the curriculum and develop testing, evaluation and measurement. Then the increasing unemployment rate, especially among youth, implies poor education quality along with lack of infrastructure to absorb the rising population. The youth unemployment rate in Syria stood at 19 percent in 2003. The current system is unable to provide with the skills and competencies demanded in the labor market. Therefore, there is a need to connect education institutions, especially higher education and vocational institutes, to the labor market and to align the curricula with skills that could increase employability of the graduates. Apart from improving the curriculum the government needs to make major infrastructure adjustments to absorb the rising population of the country into the already burdened education system. In 2007, the education system in Syria catered for about 8 million students. Given the current growth rate of 4.3 percent per annum of school age population, it is projected that by 2015, the education system in Syria will need to cater for an additional 1 million students in basic and secondary education.  Impact of the Syrian Civil War  The Syrian Civil War is a major barrier to quality education for all in Syria, reversing development gains in the country. In addition to causing widespread destruction of learning spaces, the crisis has forced more than 2.1 million children and youth out of school in Syria; an additional 3.3 million in Syria need educational assistance, and 1.4 million Syrian children and youth are refugees in the five main host countries (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey). In 2011, Syria had achieved universal primary enrolment and was near universal enrolment in lower secondary education. More concretely, 91% of primary school-aged children were in school in 2011, but by 2015 the rate had plummeted to 37%.

Early life Michael Nasser was born in Detroit, Michigan, U.S. His father was Adel Nasser a-Din, a Druze doctor of philosophy who worked most of his life in a Ford factory. His mother, Adele Ghazali, is a daughter to a Druze-Lebanese father and a Jewish- Lebanese mother who settled in New York in the 1920s. He contracted polio at the age of eight months which partially paralyzed his left hip and leg. After two years of medical treatment, he was sent with his mother and siblings to his father's Druze hometown, Dayr Qūbil in Lebanon. In 1967, at the age of 11, he returned to Detroit. In school, he became interested in comic book illustration and storytelling, and began developing skills as an artist. He used his art for a campaign that won him election of vice-president of his senior class in Redford High School, where he also gained the rank of lieutenant colonel in the JROTC program. During high school, Netzer met Greg Theakston, who introduced him to the world of professional comics art. He worked as a sign painter and graphic designer while attending Wayne State University in Michigan for two years. Theakston later introduced him to Neal Adams at the Detroit Triple Fan Fair comics convention in 1974. Adams took interest in Netzer's art and invited him to join Continuity Studios. Career Early comics Batman by Michael Netzer and inker Josef Rubinstein from DC Special Series #1 (Sept. 1977). In late 1975, Netzer was invited to join Arvell Jones and Keith Pollard for a drive to New York City, where the two artists shared an apartment. They offered Netzer accommodations while he tried to gain work in comics. He joined Continuity Studios, which became his base as a freelancer. He began work producing storyboards and advertising art for the studio, while procuring his first comics assignment, a two-part back-up story in Kamandi: \\"Tales of the Great Disaster\\". He gained quick recognition as an illustrator at DC Comics and Marvel Comics, producing art for Kobra, Challengers of the Unknown, Superboy and the Legion of Super- Heroes and Wonder Woman at DC, as well as various covers for Marvel. Other characters he became known for were the Martian Manhunter, Green Arrow and Black Canary, Batman, Black Lightning and Spider-Man. Netzer became active in efforts to form a Comics Creators Guild, that were based at Continuity. By late 1977, he was scheduled to pencil the new series John Carter, Warlord of Mars for editor Marv Wolfman at Marvel. Reconsidering the direction his life and career were taking, and the general conditions of the comics industry, Netzer declined the project and decided to take a break away from drawing comic books. In November 1977, Netzer left his career in New York and hitchhiked across the United States. Arriving in San Francisco, he contacted Star*Reach magazine publisher Mike Friedrich to decline a commitment he had made for the publication's first color installment. Friedrich asked Netzer to produce a story that would tell of his new-found aspirations, resulting in \\"The Old, New and Final Testaments\\", an eight-page vignette weaving socio- religious history with humanity's ambitions for the colonization of the solar system. Friedrich published the story in Star*Reach #12 (1977) and wrote about his meeting with Netzer in the editorial. For the next several years, Netzer produced sporadic comic book art for DC and Marvel, including a Batman story in DC Special Series, Black Lightning in World's Finest Comics, Spider-Man in Marvel Team-Up and numerous covers for Marvel. During this period, he traveled through the United States and promoted the idea of a new political hierarchy through the comic book medium. His colleagues described this activity as messianic and expressed concerns about his behavior. In a 1980 interview with Whizzard Magazine, editor Marty Klug noted: \\"Since 1977 his work, most notably in Star*Reach, has often professed a creative politico-religious theme derived from diverse sources ranging from superhero adventure to Biblical prophecy. Nasser's speculations—frequently intriguing, often controversial and, at times, somewhat outrageous—espouse a refreshing optimism rarely found in such works. Currently, he is assembling these perspectives in book form and may well be one of the first comic illustrators to branch off in such a unique direction.\\" Israel comics In September 1981, Netzer left the United States for Lebanon, and then settled in Israel in 1983. In 1984–1988, he contributed covers, accompanying illustrations and a comic strip, Milk and Honey, to Counterpoint, an Israeli English-language publication of Gush Emunim edited by Rachelle Katsman and Yisrael Medad. In 1987, he produced Israel's first Super Hero color comic book, with partners Jonathan Duitch and Yossi Halpern, \\"Uri-On\\", (אורי-און) under their Israel Comics imprint. This came at a time of a surge in comics activity in the country and was featured in an Israel Museum Comics Exhibit alongside the work of his national peers, Dudu Geva, Michel Kichka, Uri Fink and others. Michael's design of the Menorah symbol for Uri-On was featured in a later Israel Museum exhibit highlighting various Menorah designs through the ages. Netzer's prominence as a former American comic book artist and controversial choice of residence in the occupied West Bank, provided a platform for the artist to appear on local television talk shows, receive varied media coverage and give lectures on the comic book medium as a tool for advancing a peaceful solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict. Return to U.S. comics From \\"12 Parts\\" Hot Stuff #6 (1978), depicting the sharp departure from the artist's early career influences In 1991, Netzer returned to New York and Continuity Comics, where he produced art for several issues of Megalith. He and Neal Adams entered into a dispute over intellectual property rights to Ms. Mystic, a character they had worked on jointly in 1977, which Adams had published under the Pacific Comics and Continuity Comics imprints, leading to a lawsuit against Adams in New York Federal Court in 1993. The case was dismissed in 1995, citing the statute of limitations. Netzer left Continuity and produced a series of comic book projects during this period, including Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight Annual #2,Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dougall, p. 197: \\"Writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Michael Netzer decided to marry off Commissioner Gordon to his longtime love, Sarah Essen.\\" Detective Comics,Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dougall, p. 198 The Huntress,Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dougall, p. 208: \\"Helena Bertinelli, the Huntress, returned to star in her own title in this four-issue series written by Chuck Dixon and drawn in a moody, shadowy style by artist Michael Netzer.\\" Babylon 5, Team Titans, and Green ArrowManning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 271: \\"Writer Chuck Dixon and artists Michael Netzer, Jim Aparo, and Rodolfo Damaggio were putting longtime Green Arrow Oliver Queen through his paces.\\" for DC Comics, and Neil Gaiman's Lady Justice for Tekno Comix. His art in this period demonstrated a notable shift into a darker and moodier art style, such as in The Huntress mini-series, which merged his high-contrast style in the 1978 Hot Stuff with the dark noir art of the popular Frank Miller's Sin City series. In his Sin City: The Big Fat Kill #1 (1994) letter column, Miller criticized Netzer, along with artists Jim Lee and Tim Sale, who also produced dark noir art in that period, for drawing influence from Sin City. Miller also criticized Netzer's lawsuit against Adams for Ms. Mystic in the same letter column. In 2011, Netzer responded to Miller at CBR's Comics Should Be Good, saying he'd worked in a similar style before Miller became known for it. He added that no artist develops without visible influences, and that creators who preceded Miller were not known to criticize artists whom they inspired. In 1994 Netzer returned to Israel and slowly gravitated away from comics art. In 1998, he teamed up with Sofia Fedorov to establish a visual media production studio called Netzart Fedorov Media which allowed Netzer to develop his skills in computer-generated illustration, advertising and web design. In 2010, Netzer returned to mainstream comics, producing art for Kevin Smith's Green Hornet from Dynamite Entertainment, along with illustrating a chapter of Erich Origen and Gan Golan's The Adventures of Unemployed Man from Little, Brown, publishers of the satire Goodnight Bush by the same writers. Netzer also returned to producing collector art commissions, including a series of classic cover recreations with artist Gene Colan, represented by writer/agent Clifford Meth. In 2011, he produced three covers for Kfir from Israeli Zanzuria Comics. Web activism A 40-day retreat to the Dead Sea resort of Ein Gedi in February 2003 inspired Netzer to go back to his early spiritual themes and activism. In January 2004, Netzer launched his first web site, \\"The New Comic Book of Life\\", outlining his theories on superhero mythology and the role it plays in cultural evolution. On the site, Netzer revealed unpublished material espousing this manifesto from 1977 to 1981, which had never seen publication. He also apologized to colleague Neal Adams for his lawsuit against him in the previous decade. In November 2004, he launched a second web site, \\"The Comic Book Creator's Party\\", calling on comics creators to form a political union for participating in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, and quoting notable comics creators' references to the socio-political climate in America and abroad. Netzer has since launched several other web sites, including \\"The Comic Book Creators' Guild\\", \\"Growing Earth Consortium\\" and \\"Michael Netzer Online\\", the site-complex portal. While producing no mainstream comics art from the mid-1990s until 2010, Netzer maintained a web presence, speaking on comics community issues, including a campaign to bolster comic fandom's support for J'onn J'onzz The Martian Manhunter, facing a rumored demise in DC Comics Final Crisis crossover series. In early 2009, Netzer founded and launched Facebook Comic Con. Following his conviction that art should contribute towards the betterment of society, Netzer joined Comics For All in May 2010, a collective of Israeli comics artists that aims to promote the medium as a cultural and educational tool for aiding underprivileged children. The organization operates under the auspices of comic book retailer chain Comics N' Vegetables, and contributed to the retailer winning the Will Eisner Spirit of Comics Retailer Award in 2011. Netzer participates in various activities on a pro bono basis. Save the Comics campaign In early 2011 Netzer launched a campaign, Save the Comics, to bring public attention to the undercurrents of a decades-long sales slump for printed comic books. The initiative came on the heels of his participation in an industry-wide debate on a revolution in creator-owned properties. On 10 February 2011, Netzer lodged an online complaint at the Federal Trade Commission web site against DC Comics and Marvel Comics calling for industry leaders to turn their attention back to the business of comic book publishing. In June 2011, Netzer responded to the controversial story in Action Comics #900, where Superman is compelled to renounce his American citizenship after participating in an Iranian anti- government demonstration. He produced a two-page short satire, wherein Superman returns to Tehran with Batman and Wonder Woman, who all participate in an anti-American demonstration. An image of the three heroes burning American and Western Allies flags, drew sharp criticism from the Bleeding Cool audience. Netzer responded by burning the original art of the controversial image, and filming a video clip of it, to demonstrate the value of the satire. In May 2013, Netzer led a campaign on behalf of comics writer Don McGregor when Dynamite Entertainment promoted the revival of Lady Rawhide, created by McGregor and Mike Mayhew. Dynamite publisher Nick Barrucci responded in dismissal of McGregor's publicly aired frustration at hearing about his creation being revived in press releases, and that the creators' credits were omitted from the announcements. Netzer's campaign at Bleeding Cool, The Beat, Facebook and his own site led the publisher to appear at Netzer's Facebook profile and apologize to McGregor. The campaign received some criticism for its intensity but was also noted by others for helping bring the issue of creators' rights and their treatment by publishers to the forefront of industry dialogue. Personal life In September 1981, Netzer traveled to Lebanon to visit his father, intending to continue afterwards to Israel. When the Lebanon War broke out, he became stranded there until the fighting subsided. In August 1983, he hired a taxi that brought him to the Lebanon- Israel border, where he crossed into Israel. While settling in Israel, he studied the Hebrew language and the Jewish faith at several kibbutzim. Nezter then converted to Judaism, and changed his Arabic last name Nasser to the Hebrew name Netzer. In May 1985, he moved to Ofra, an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, where he currently resides. He is married to Elana Yosef and they have five children.

The second largest governmental spending in Saudi Arabia goes for education. Saudi Arabia spends 8.8 % of its gross domestic product on education, compared with the global average of 4.6%, which is nearly double the global average on education. Saudi education is centered around the study of Islam, but is becoming more diverse. Before 1957, when King Saud University was founded, many Saudi Arabians immigrated to other countries to attend universities. Background Saudi education is noted for its religious content. As of 2016, religious studies average a total of nine periods a week at the primary school level, compared to an average about 23 periods a week total for mathematics, science (physics, chemistry, biology and geology), social studies, Arabic language, English language and physical education. At the university level, nearly two-thirds of graduates are women. The education system was also criticized in the 1980s and 1990s for \\"poorly trained teachers, low retention rates, lack of rigorous standards, weak scientific and technical instruction\\", despite generous budgets, that have compelled the kingdom to depend on large numbers of expatriates workers to fill technical and administrative positions. Islamic theology has also historically held influence over women's education in Saudi Arabia as well. By 2019, however, the Saudi embassy in the U.S. noted that \\"While the study of Islam remains at its core, the modern Saudi educational system also provides quality instruction in diverse fields of arts and sciences.\\" Education management system Map of Saudi Arabia Education is free at all levels. The education system in Saudi Arabia is primarily under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation (TVTC). Other authorities such as the Ministry of Defense and Aviation, the Presidency of the National Guard, and the Ministry of the Interior provide their affiliates and children with education at all levels, consistent with Ministry of Education guidelines. The highest authority that supervises education in Saudi Arabia is the Supreme Committee for Educational Policy, established in 1963. According to the World Bank database, public spending on education is 6.8 percent of GDP, and public spending on education as a percentage of government expenditure was 27.6 percent in 2004. Education spending as a percentage of overall spending tripled from 1970 to 2000, and neither economic growth nor the price of oil had much impact on this trend. The Ministry of Education developed The Ministry of Education Ten–Year Plan 1425–1435,This figure is based on the Islamic calendar, the Gregorian calendar equivalent is 2004–2014. which set the following goals: * The education of 4- to 6-year-old children and the consideration of kindergarten as an independent stage as compared with other educational stages in terms of its buildings and syllabi * Accommodation of all age categories from 6 to 18 years old at various stages of education * Deepening the spirit of loyalty and pride of the country through intellectual awareness of Saudi Arabia's national issues * Preparing students academically and culturally at the local and international levels to be able to achieve advanced international posts in the fields of mathematics and science for various age categories, taking into account International tests' standards * Organization of girls' technical education * Development of an educational system for students with special needs * Development and growth of educational and administrative training for the Ministry's personnel * Improvement of internal and external sufficiency for the educational system * Development of syllabi based on Islamic values leading to the development of male and female students' personality and to their integration in society as well as to the achievement of scientific and thinking skills and life characteristics resulting in self-education and lifelong learning * To improve the quality of male and female teachers and to increase the citizens' rate in the education sector to achieve the full use of Saudi human resources * To develop the educational structure and to update the school map to meet the expected quantitative and qualitative changes in the next stage * To develop the infrastructure of information and communication technology and its employment in education and learning * To develop male and female adults' education and to eradicate illiteracy * The Ministry's comprehensive administrative development * Expansion of social participation in education * To establish integrated systems for accountability Pre-primary education In Saudi Arabia, children aged 3–5 years go to kindergarten. However, attendance of kindergartens is not a prerequisite for enrollment of first grade of primary education and kindergartens are not part of the official education ladder. Some private numbers have been established with technical and financial first aid-kit from the government. According to government data, 100,714 children (51,364 male and 49,350 female) were in pre-primary education in 2007. The gross enrollment percentage was 10.8%, for boys 11.1 percent and for girls 10.4 percent. Primary education Primary education in Saudi Arabia lasts six years, and children at the age of 6 enter the first grade of primary education. All national primary schools are day schools and are not co- educational. In order to move on to intermediate education, children must pass the examination at the end of Grade 6 of primary school and obtain the Elementary Education Certificate. According to government data, 2,442,482 students (1,255,117 male and 1,187,365 female) were in primary education in 2007 and the number of teachers totaled 217,555 (107,227 male and 110,328 female) in 2007. According to UNESCO, the gross enrollment ratio for boys was 99.9 percent, the gross enrollment ratio for girls was 96.3 percent, and the total gross enrollment ratio was 98.1 percent in 2007. Intermediate and secondary education Intermediate education in Saudi Arabia lasts three years. According to government data, 1,144,548 students (609,300 male and 535,248 female) were in intermediate education in 2007 and the number of teachers totaled 108,065 (54,034 male and 54,031 female) in 2007. According to gross enrollment the total rate was 95.9 percent in 2007. Secondary education in Saudi Arabia lasts three years and this is the final stage of general education. After the intermediate education, students have the opportunity for both general and specialized secondary education. Technical secondary institute which provide technical and vocational education and training programs lasts three years in the fields of industry, commerce and agriculture. According to government data, 1,013,074 students (541,849 male and 471,225 female) were in secondary education in 2007 and the number of teachers totaled 87,823 (41,108 male and 46,715 female) in 2007. As of 2007, gross enrollment rates were 91.8% in secondary education. Investment in higher education has outstripped the western world in some cases. Higher education in Saudi Arabia lasts four years in the field of humanities and social sciences, and five to six years in the field of medicine, engineering and pharmacy. The establishment of the King Saud University in 1957 was the starting point of the modern higher education system in Saudi Arabia. This was also the first university in all the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. There are 24 government universities in Saudi Arabia, established in a short span of time. Among them, Taibah University, Qassim University and Taif University were established under the Seventh Development Plan. The universities consists of colleges and departments that offer diplomas, and bachelor's, master's and PhD degrees in various scientific and humanities specializations. Some colleges and departments also provide distance learning. There also exist private colleges, community colleges affiliated to universities, and girls colleges, in addition to government agencies and institutions that provide specialist university-level education. According to a World Bank report, more than 70 percent of the students in Saudi Arabia are in the fields of humanities and social sciences, a figure similar to that of other Arab countries, like Djibouti, Egypt, Morocco, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and West Bank and Gaza According to government data, a total of 636,245 (268,080 male and 368,165 female) students were enrolled in higher education in 2006. Among them, 528,146 students (187,489 male and 340,657 female) were in Bachelor programs, 9,768 students (5,551 male and 4,217 female) were in Master programs, and 2,410 students (1,293 male and 1,117 female) were in Ph.D. programs. Another 93,968 students (72,199 male and 21,769 female) were in Intermediate Diploma courses and 1,953 students (1,548 male and 405 female) were in Higher Diploma course. According to the World Bank, in 2006 the gross enrollment ratio for females was 36.1 percent, the gross enrollment ratio for males was 24.7 percent, and the total gross enrollment ratio was 30.2 percent. In 2005, King Abdullah implemented a government scholarship program to send young Saudi nationals to Western universities for undergraduate and postgraduate studies. The program offers funds for tuition and living expenses for up to four years. An estimated 5,000 Saudi students received government scholarships to study abroad for the 2007/2008 academic year. Students mostly studied at universities in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, France, and Germany. The universities in the United Kingdom which provide distance learning in Saudi Arabia include the University of Leicester. It has ranked in the top 1% of universities in the world by THE World University Rankings. In the United Kingdom alone, more than 15,000 Saudi students, 25% of whom are women, attend universities. The large number of students also includes Saudis paying their own tuition. The large influx of Saudi students to the United Kingdom prompted the Saudi Ministry of Higher Education in 2010 to close access to the country for further study. Girls' and women's education In 1957, the Dar al-Hanan and Nassif private schools for girls opened in the city of Jeddah. The openings were prompted by Iffat, the wife of Faisal of Saudi Arabia. Afterwards the Saudi government began opening state-operated girls schools. Religious fundamentalists protested the openings of the schools. In 1963 King Faisal brought soldiers to control protesters when a girls' school opened in Buraydah. During Saudi Arabia's first oil boom many Saudi males who studied abroad brought foreign wives back to Saudi Arabia. This caused concern among Saudi fathers with daughters eligible for marriage.Mackey, p. 163. In the late 1970s the Saudi government greatly increased university spots for women as a way of slowly progressing and not to clash with traditional culture at the time.Mackey, p. 163-164. The General Administration of Girls' Education (also called the General Presidency for Girls' Education) was established independently from the Ministry of Education when girls education was started in Saudi Arabia 1960. Girls education was put under the control of a separate administration controlled by conservative clerics as \\"a compromise to calm public opposition to allowing (not requiring) girls to attend school\\". 60% of university students in Saudi Arabia are Saudi females. In Saudi Arabia, women in the labor force are mainly in the education sector.World Bank 2005 The first group of women graduated from a law program in 2008. On 6 October 2013, the first four women received their legal licences to practice law, not only as legal consultants but as lawyers in courtrooms and before the Saudi judiciary. According to the World Bank report, female students in higher education in Saudi Arabia outnumber those in Jordan, Tunisia and West Bank and Gaza. According to the World Bank, gross enrollment rate for female is 36.1 percent, gross enrollment rate for male is 24.7 percent, and gross enrollment rate for total was 30.2 percent in 2006. There are thousands of female professors throughout Saudi Arabia. Around 2009, an expert on girls' education became the first woman minister in Saudi Arabia. Nora bint Abdullah al-Fayez, a US- educated former teacher, was made deputy education minister in charge of a new department for female students. In addition, Saudi Arabia provides female students with one of the world's largest scholarship programs. By this program, thousands of women have earned doctorates from Western universities. The building of colleges and universities for women, which was recently announced by the government, is critically important. Women comprise 60% of Saudi Arabia's college students but only 21% of its labor force, much lower than in neighboring countries. 85% of employed Saudi women work in education, 6% in public health, and 95% in the public sector.

The General Department for Private Education at the Ministry of Education supervises private schools for boys and private schools for girls and government provides private schools with free textbooks and an annual financial aid. Government also appoints and pays for a qualified director in every private school. According to UNESCO, in 2007, 48.9 percent of children enrolled in pre-primary schools, and 8.2 percent of children enrolled in primary school. As for the intermediate education, 6.4 percent of students enrolled in general programs were in private schools and 70.3 percent of students enrolled in technical and vocational programs were in private schools. As for the secondary education, 13.4 percent of students enrolled in general programs were in private schools and 61.6 percent of students enrolled in technical and vocational programs were in private schools. According to the World Bank, in 2004, 7.4 percent of students in tertiary education enrolled in private schools. In respect of higher education, Saudi Arabia has 13 private universities, 7 of which are located in Riyadh. International education As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed Saudi Arabia as having 203 international schools. ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms \\"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\\" This definition is used by publications including The Economist. In Saudi Arabia some international schools are owned by communities of foreign nationals, while others are private schools owned by individuals with Saudi citizenship.Regis, Czarina Valerie A. and Allan B. de Guzman. \\"A system within a system: the Philippine schools overseas.\\" Educational Research for Policy and Practice.

The Saudi government limits community schools to one per locality or city per nationality; diplomatic missions either supervise or directly operate the community schools. These community schools are not required to separate male and female students into separate campuses and are allowed to host social activities with men and women mixed. They are not required to have Saudi citizens as sponsors since the Saudi authorities consider the schools to be under the sponsorship of the diplomatic missions.Regis, Czarina Valerie A. and Allan B. de Guzman. \\"A system within a system: the Philippine schools overseas.\\" Educational Research for Policy and Practice.

Over 80% of its students are British nationals, and the school follows the British curriculum. Philippine schools As of February 2006 about 75% of the Philippine international schools represented by the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) were located in Saudi Arabia. Community-owned Philippine schools, including the International Philippine School in Al Khobar (IPSA), the International Philippine School in Jeddah (IPSJ), and International Philippine School in Riyadh (IPSR), were by 2006 managed by independent school boards but were initially managed by the diplomatic missions themselves. As of 2006 Riyadh has 13 Philippine private schools and Jeddah has five Philippine private schools. Large numbers of Philippine children came to Saudi after many Filipino workers arrived in Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. The first Philippine school in Saudi Arabia, Philippine School in Jeddah was established after the Philippine Consulate in Jeddah began making efforts to start a school in 1983, and Philippine schools were later established in Riyadh and other Saudi cities. In 2000 Saudi Arabia had nine accredited Philippine schools. By 2005 Jeddah alone had four Philippine international schools, with two more scheduled to open shortly.Salud, Francis R. \\"2 More Filipino Schools to Open in Jeddah\\" (Archive). Arab News. Thursday 7 March 2005. Retrieved on 5 November 2015. By 2006 there were 21 Philippine schools recognized by the CFO, reflecting a 133% growth rate from 2000. Regis and Guzman stated that in private Philippine schools many Saudi rules that are not consistent with the culture of the Philippines are enforced. Literacy According to the results of the demographic survey conducted by the Department of Statistics and Information, Ministry of Economy and Planning in 2007 the incidence of illiteracy among the Saudi population was 13.7%. The illiteracy rate stood at 1.4% for the age group 10 to 14 years, while the highest level in the age group between the ages of 65 and more than 509,573 people to the rate of 73.9%. With regard to the spread of illiteracy among Saudi Administrative Regions, as the study showed a large disparity between the regions of the Kingdom, while the figure for both sexes was at its lowest level in the Riyadh region, at 9.9%, the highest level was found in the Jizan area at 23.5%, and the lowest rate of illiteracy among males was in Riyadh region, as the minimum rate of 5.1% and in Jizan higher rate of 14.8%, while the lowest rate of illiteracy of Saudi women was in the eastern region at 14.7% and the highest rate was in the region of Jizan at 31.6%. According to the World Bank, there is gender disparity in the literacy rate. In 2007, 85.0 percent of adult (people ages 15 and above) were literate and 98.1 percent of youth (people ages 15 – 24) were literate, 89.1 percent of male adults were literate and 79.4 percent of female adults were literate. As for youth literacy rate (people ages 15 – 24), 97.0 percent were literate, 98.1 percent of male youths were literate, and 95.9 percent of female youths were literate. One of the World Bank reports suggested the relatively high adult literacy rate of Saudi Arabia, considering the continued low level of primary enrollment, derived from the successful use of religious organizations, particularly local mosques and local religious institutions such as Koranic schools for the provision of ancillary educational services, which is a trend of particular note in the MENA region. King Abdullah Project for General Education Development The King Abdullah Project for General Education Development is a SR9 billion (US$2.4bn) project to be implemented over the next six years to create a skilled and work force for the future. A number of schools in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam have been selected for the implementation of this project. More than 400,000 teachers will be trained for the new program. In addition, this project will emphasize extracurricular activities for the purpose of developing intellectual, creative and communicative skills. Criticism of the Saudi education system and reform proposals The Saudi education system has been criticised. One observation was, \\"The country needs educated young Saudis with marketable skills and a capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship. That's not generally what Saudi Arabia's educational system delivers, steeped as it is in rote learning and religious instruction.\\"'Saudi Arabia's Education Reforms Emphasize Training for Jobs' The Chronicle of Higher Education, 3 October 2010; retrieved 16 January 2011 The study of Islam dominates the Saudi educational system. In particular, the memorization by rote of large parts of the Qu'ran, its interpretation and understanding (Tafsir) and the application of Islamic tradition to everyday life is at the core of the curriculum. Religion taught in this manner is also a compulsory subject for all university students.Education in Saudi Arabia World Education News and Reviews retrieved 16 January 2011 Saudi youth \\"generally lacks the education and technical skills the private sector needs\\".CIA World Factbook retrieved 16 January 2011 Indeed, such control has stifled critical thought, and as a result, the education system does not necessarily foster innovation and creativity, both of which are essential to development. Saudi education has also been strongly criticized for promoting intolerance, including anti- semitic views, anti-Christian rhetoric, and referring to non-Muslims as \\"infidels\\", enemies of God, and enemies of all Muslims. A further criticism of the religious focus of the Saudi education system is the nature of the Wahhabi-controlled curriculum. The curriculum also outright calls out Shias as Kuffar, which causes outrage in Shia-majority cities such as Qatif and Hofuf. The Islamic aspect of the Saudi national curriculum is examined in a 2006 report by Freedom House which concluded that \\"the Saudi public school religious curriculum continues to propagate an ideology of hate toward the 'unbeliever'.Press Release: The Saudi religious studies curriculum is taught outside the Kingdom in madrasah throughout the world. Critics have described the education system as 'medieval' and that its primary goal \\"is to maintain the rule of absolute monarchy by casting it as the ordained protector of the faith, and that Islam is at war with other faiths and cultures\\".'This medieval Saudi education system must be reformed' , The Guardian, 26 November 2010, retrieved 16 January 2011 the saudis have some 'splaining to do foreignpolicy.com May 2006 The consequence of this approach is considered by many, including perhaps the Saudi government itself, to have encouraged Islamist terrorism.Reforming Saudi Education Slate 7 September 2009; retrieved 16 January 2011 To tackle the twin problems of extremism and the inadequacy of the country's university education, the government is aiming to modernise the education system through the Tatweer reform program. The Tatweer program is reported to have a budget of approximately US$2 billion and focuses on moving teaching away from the traditional Saudi methods of memorization and rote learning towards encouraging students to analyze and problem-solve as well as creating a more secular and vocationally based education system.The Saudi Gazette retrieved 16 January 2011 A comprehensive Human Rights Watch review of the Education Ministry-produced school religion books for the 2016-17 school year found that some of the content that first provoked widespread controversy for violent and intolerant teachings in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks remains in the texts today, despite Saudi officials’ promises to eliminate the intolerant language. The texts disparage Sufi and Shia religious practices and label Jews and Christians “unbelievers” with whom Muslims should not associate.

It is located near the Greenlandic town of Ilulissat (colonial name in ) and ends at the sea in the Ilulissat Icefjord. Jakobshavn Glacier drains 6.5% of the Greenland ice sheet and produces around 10% of all Greenland icebergs. Some 35 billion tonnes of icebergs calve off and pass out of the fjord every year. Icebergs breaking from the glacier are often so large (up to 1 km in height) that they are too tall to float down the fjord and lie stuck on the bottom of its shallower areas, sometimes for years, until they are broken up by the force of the glacier and icebergs further up the fjord. Studied for over 250 years, the Jakobshavn Glacier has helped develop modern understanding of climate change and icecap glaciology. Ilulissat Icefjord () was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004. Name Jakobshavn has been a name used for this glacier in scientific literature since 1853 when Danish geologist Hinrich Johannes Rink referred to it as Jakobshavn Isstrøm (Danish for Jakobshavn Ice Stream). It is sometimes referred to in the international scientific literature (by glaciologists) as Jakobshavn Isbræ glacier. Isbræ is Danish for glacier. It is also commonly known by the anglicised version, Jakobshavn Glacier. The local name for this glacier is Sermeq Kujalleq, where \\"sermeq\\" is Greenlandic for 'glacier' and \\"kujalleq\\" means 'southern'. It lies south of the town Ilulissat (colonial name Jakobshavn). UNESCO's World Heritage Site website uses this name, in connection with mention of the Ilulissat Icefjord world heritage site, which includes the downstream end of the glacier. There is evidence that people have inhabited the area around the glacier for up to 4000 years. The recently abandoned settlement of Sermermiut (which means 'place of the glacier people') lies just to the north of the glacier, much nearer than Ilulissat. The glacier is sometimes referred to as Ilulissat Glacier. This form simply replaces Jakobshavn with Ilulissat because of the change in the name of the town. Acceleration and retreat Landsat image of Jakobshavn Glacier. The lines show the position of the calving front of the Jakobshavn Glacier since 1851. The date of this image is 2006 and the calving front of the glacier can be seen at the 2006 line. The area stretching from the calving front to the sea (towards the bottom left corner) is the Ilulissat icefjord. Courtesy of NASA Earth Observatory Jakobshavn is one of the fastest moving glaciers, flowing at its terminus at speeds that used to be around per day but are over 45 metres (150 ft) per day when averaged annually, with summer speeds even higher (as measured 2012-2013). The speed of Jakobshavn Glacier varied between per year between 1992 and 2003. The ice stream's speed-up and near-doubling of ice flow from land into the ocean has increased the rate of sea level rise by about per year, or roughly 4 percent of the 20th century rate of sea level rise. Jakobshavn Isbrae retreated from 1850–1964, followed by a stationary front for 35 years. Jakobshavn has the highest mass flux of any glacier draining the Greenland Ice Sheet. The glacier terminus region also had a consistent velocity of per day (maximum of per day in the glacier center), from season to season and year to year, the glacier seemed to be in balance from 1955–1985. The position of this terminus fluctuated by around its annual mean position between 1950 and 1996. After 1997 the glacier began to accelerate and thin rapidly, reaching an average velocity of per day in the terminus region. On Jakobshavn, the acceleration began at the calving front and spread up-glacier in 1997 and up to inland by 2003. In 2012 a significant acceleration of Jakobshavn was observed, with summer speeds up to 4 times its speed in the 1990s, and average annual speeds of 3 times its 1990s speed. Movement reached more than 17,000 metres per year. Jakobshavn has afterwards slowed to near its pre-1997 speed, with the terminus retreat still occurring until 2015. In 2016, researchers found the water temperatures in its fjord had dropped to levels as cool as those in the 1980s. Airborne altimetry and satellite imagery show that until early 2019, this temperature drop likely caused the glacier to re-advance, slow down, and thicken (by over 100 feet from 2016 to 2018). Large calving events where the glacier produces icebergs have also been found to trigger earthquakes due to ice-ice and ice-bottom of the fjord interactions. and from the longer-duration forces exerted on the solid Earth during the capsize of very large (e.g., > 1 km3) calved ice volumes. Especially large calving events at Jakobshavn have produced glacial earthquakes that are detectable on seismographs worldwide with moment magnitudes in excess of 5.0. A large calving of approximately 7 km² took place on 15 February 2015. On 16 August 2015 a calving was identified via satellite images as the largest ever recorded at Jakobshavn, with an area of 12.5 km². Mechanisms Landsat image of Jakobshavn Glacier. The lines show the position of the calving front of the Jakobshavn Glacier since 1851. The date of this image is 2006 and the calving front of the glacier can be seen at the 2006 line. The area stretching from the calving front to the sea (towards the bottom left corner) is the Ilulissat icefjord. Courtesy of NASA Earth Observatory The first mechanism for explaining the change in velocity is the \\"Zwally effect\\" and is not the main mechanism, this relies on meltwater reaching the glacier base and reducing the friction through a higher basal water pressure. A moulin is the conduit for the additional meltwater to reach the glacier base. This idea, proposed by Jay Zwally, was observed to be the cause of a brief seasonal acceleration of up to 20% on the Jakobshavns Glacier in 1998 and 1999 at Swiss Camp. The acceleration lasted 2–3 months and was less than 10% in 1996 and 1997 for example. They offered a conclusion that the \\"coupling between surface melting and ice-sheet flow provides a mechanism for rapid, large-scale, dynamic responses of ice sheets to climate warming\\". The acceleration of the three glaciers had not occurred at the time of this study and they were not concluding or implying that the meltwater increase was the cause of the aforementioned acceleration. Examination of rapid supra-glacial lake drainage documented short term velocity changes due to such events, but they had little significance to the annual flow of the large outlet glaciers. The second mechanism is a \\"Jakobshavn effect\\", coined by Terry Hughes, where a small imbalance of forces caused by some perturbation can cause a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at the calving front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, even becoming afloat at the calving front, and is responsive to tidal changes. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows for an increase in velocity. The reduced resistive force at the calving front is then propagated up glacier via longitudinal extension in what R. Thomas calls a backforce reduction. This mechanism is supported by the data indicating no significant seasonal velocity changes at the calving front and the acceleration propagating upglacier from the calving front. The cause of the thinning could be a combination of increased surface ablation and basal ablation as one report presents data that show a sudden increase in subsurface ocean temperature in 1997 along the entire west coast of Greenland, and suggests that the changes in Jakobshavn Glacier are due to the arrival of relatively warm water originating from the Irminger Sea near Iceland. Evidence also exists for a deep subglacial trench beneath the glacial outlet, identified through seismic reflection methods. There are theories that Greenland consists of three large islands under the ice sheet, separated at the coast by three narrow straits, one of them Jakobshavn Glacier.  Chasing Ice  In the 2012 documentary entitled Chasing Ice by cinematographer Jeff Orlowski, nature photographer James Balog and his Extreme Ice Survey (EIS) team, there is a 75-minute segment showing the Jakobshavn Glacier calving. Two EIS videographers waited several weeks in a small tent overlooking the glacier, and were finally able to witness of ice crashing off the glacier. It was the longest calving ever captured on film.

Since 2012, compulsory education includes two years of preschool education (usually starting around age 5), before children start primary school. Education is compulsory until age of 16. Education at state-owned schools is free of charge, except for the higher education schools, colleges and universities. In 1998 enrollment in the primary grades was 93 percent of eligible students, and enrollment in the secondary grades was 81 percent of eligible students. The ratio of females to males in primary schools was 0.97, and the ratio in secondary schools was 0.98. Because of Bulgaria’s low birthrate, total primary- and secondary-school enrollment has decreased in the post-communist era, causing reductions in teaching staff and facilities. At the same time, the number of private schools increased by 10 times during the 1990s. Bulgaria’s higher education system was fully reorganized in the mid-1990s. Between 1995 and 2002, the number of university graduates increased from 33,000 to 50,000. In 2002 some 42 institutions of higher learning were in operation, and 215,700 students were enrolled. In 2003 some 4.9 percent of Bulgaria’s national budget was devoted to education. History of Bulgarian education The first schools in Bulgaria were opened in the 9th century by the Tsar Simeon The Great. Two notable linguistic literary church schools that taught the Glagolitic and Cyrillic alphabets to the christianized Bulgarian slavs were also established in that period at Ohrid and Preslav, with the one in Ohrid having more than 3000 students at one point. Modern schools began opening in the early 19th century (during the National Revival) first for boys and then for girls. Those schools provided only basic education, such as reading, writing, and basic arithmetic. Students who wished to continue their education had to go study abroad. After Bulgaria overturned the Ottoman rule in 1878, it started laying the foundations of its educational system. In 1878 the government passed the Temporary Law on National Schools. This law stimulated the establishment of schools in villages. However, many peasants did not let their children attend school because they thought education was not relevant to peasant life. Furthermore, several universities were established in the period 1878 - 1918. Educational process in Bulgaria was disrupted during the Balkan Wars (1912 - 1913) and World War I. By the mid-1920s normal function of schools had been restored. During the communist era, the Soviet Union had a great impact on Bulgarian educational system. A new form of education was brought in. Emphasis on liberal arts was replaced by increased technical training. In 1979 Zhivkov created the Unified Secondary Polytechnical School, which was a twelve-grade program focusing mainly on technical subjects. After the end of the Zhivkov Era, the Bulgarian educational system was completely reconstructed. The government sought to depoliticize the system and take the opinions of others into consideration. Structure of the educational system The system consists of four levels: Pre-primary education Pre-primary education (preschool education) embraces children between 3 and 6/7 years old, who attend kindergarten optionally, with the requirement that prior to starting school, children must attend two years of pre-school education. These two years of mandatory pre- school education may be attended either at kindergarten or in preparatory groups at primary schools. During the school year 2007/2008, 74.8% of children aged 3–6 years were enrolled in kindergartens. Elementary education Elementary education (grades 1 - 7) includes primary school (grades 1 - 4) and junior high school/ middle school (grades 5 - 7). Children usually start primary education at age 7, but may be start from age 6 upon their parents' request. Certificate for Primary Education and Certificate for Elementary Education are obtained upon successful completion of grade 4 and 7 respectively. High schools use grades from the Certificate for Elementary Education as a major admissions criterion. Secondary education Secondary education comprises selective/comprehensive high schools and vocational school. The admission to comprehensive schools is based upon grades from entry exams, usually in literature and/or mathematics as well as grades in junior high school. Students can enroll in high school after the successful completion of grades 7 or 8. Usually, those who want to study languages, mathematics, or informatics in-depth apply to high school after 7th grade. Students graduating from high-school must take high school exit exams in Bulgarian language. Higher education The types of higher education institutions are Universities, Colleges and Specialized Higher Schools. Universities, as in most countries worldwide, have three stages: Bachelor's (undergraduate), Master's (graduate), and Doctoral degrees. Undergraduate stage lasts for at least four years and graduate stage lasts for five years after completion of secondary education or one year after obtaining a bachelor's degree. The third stage of higher education results in obtaining a Ph.D. Degree. Specialized higher schools offer degrees in one or more areas of science, arts, sports, and defense. Usually, the names of these institutions indicate the area of specialization. Colleges are former semi-higher institutes. Some of them are part of universities and use their equipment and facilities. Structure and curricula of the school year The curriculum of Bulgarian Educational system focuses on eight main subjects: Bulgarian language and literature, foreign languages, mathematics, information technologies, social sciences and civics, natural sciences and ecology, music and art, physical education and sports. The school year starts on September 15 and ends in May or June, depending on the grade level of the students. The school year is divided into two terms with Christmas, Easter and Summer holidays. Students usually spend half a day in school; with many schools operating in \\"shifts\\": either in the morning or in the afternoon, although younger students usually study in the morning. In some elementary schools there is the option of extended care, where students spend the other half of the day in school preparing their homework under the supervision of a teacher, upon the request of parents. Grading The grading system is based on numerals, where 6 is the highest and 2 is the lowest grade a student can obtain, where 6 is excellent, 5 is very good, 4 is good, 3 is satisfactory, and 2 is poor. The grades are divided into 100 points and any mark over .50 is considered part of the upper bracket. For example, 5.50 is excellent, 5.75 is also excellent but 5.25 is very good. 6.00 is the highest possible mark. Generally, anything under 3.00 is considered a fail. These points are mainly used when grading tests which give specific points per correct answer. Violence Following \\"numerous reports over the past decade about school violence\\", the Education Minister in 2009 introduced stricter regulations about student behaviour, including inappropriate dress, being drunk, and carrying mobile phones. Teachers were to be given new powers to punish disruptive students.Kostadinov, P. (2009, June 19). Little or nothing. Sofia Echo. Literacy In 2003 Bulgaria’s literacy rate was estimated at 98.6 percent, with approximately the same rate for both sexes. Bulgaria traditionally has had high educational standards. In the post-communist era, low funding and low teacher morale have damaged the system to some extent, particularly in vocational training. Adherence to classical teaching methods has handicapped development in some technical fields. The current system of education, introduced in 1998, has 12 school grades. In 2003, one year of preschool education was made mandatory, and in 2012 this was extended to two mandatory years of preschool education.

Afghanistan is going through a nationwide rebuilding process and, despite setbacks, institutions are established across the country. By 2013 there were 10.5 million students attending schools in Afghanistan, a country with a population of around 35.5 million people. History One of the oldest schools in Afghanistan is the Habibia High School in Kabul, which was built by King Habibullah Khan in 1903 to educate students from the nation's elite class. In the 1920s, the German-funded Amani High School opened in Kabul, and about a decade later two French lycées (secondary schools) began, the AEFE and the Lycée Esteqlal. The Kabul University was established in 1932.

During the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the government of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) reformed the education system; education was stressed for both sexes, and widespread literacy programmes were set up.WOMEN IN AFGHANISTAN: Pawns in men's power struggles By 1978, women made up 40 percent of the doctors and 60 percent of the teachers at Kabul University; 440,000 female students were enrolled in educational institutions and 80,000 more in literacy programs.Racist Scapegoating of Muslim Women – Down with Quebec's Niqab Ban!, Spartacist Canada, Summer 2010, No. 165 Despite improvements, a large percentage of the population remained illiterate. Beginning with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, successive wars virtually destroyed the nation's education system. Most teachers fled during the wars to neighboring countries. In the middle of the 1990s, about 650 schools were destroyed or used as bunkers. In 1996 the Taliban regime restricted education for females, and the madrassa (mosque school) became the main source of primary and secondary education. About 1.2 million students were enrolled in schools during the period of Taliban rule, with fewer than 50,000 of them girls. After the overthrow of the Taliban in late 2001, the Karzai administration received substantial international aid to restore the education system. Around 7,000 schools were operating in 20 of the 32 provinces by the end of 2003, with 27,000 teachers teaching 4.2 million children (including 1.2 million girls). Of that number, about 3.9 million were in primary schools. An estimated 57 percent of men and 86 percent of women were reported to be illiterate, and the lack of skilled and educated workers was a major economic disadvantage. When Kabul University reopened in 2002, some 24,000 male and female students enrolled for higher education. In the meantime, five other universities were being rehabilitated. Public school curricula have included religious subjects but detailed instruction is left to religious teachers. Students standing in front of the main campus of Herat University in western Afghanistan. Typical classroom in rural Afghanistan Anthony Wayne and Ghazni Provincial Governor Musa Khan Ahmadzai talk to students who use Afghanistan's newest Lincoln Learning Center in Ghazni City. By 2006, over 4 million male and female students were enrolled in schools throughout Afghanistan. At the same time school facilities or institutions were also being refurbished or improved, with more modern-style schools being built each year. The American University of Afghanistan (AUAF) in Kabul was established in 2006. Other universities were renovated or rebuilt, such as Kandahar University in the south, Nangarhar University and Khost University in the east, Herat University in the west and Balkh University in the north. Despite these achievements, there were still significant obstacles to education in Afghanistan, many of which stem from a lack of funding. Planning curricula and school programs is difficult for the Ministry of Education because a significant amount of the budget for education comes from external donors, making it difficult to predict the annual budget. The obstacles to education were even more numerous for Afghan girls. Afghanistan's then Education Minister, Mohammad Hanif Atmar, said in 2007 that 60% of students were studying in tents or other unprotected structures, and some parents refused to let their daughters attend schools in such conditions. A lack of women teachers was another issue that concerned some parents, especially in more conservative areas. Some parents were not allowing their daughters to be taught by men. But this often meant that girls were not allowed to attend school, as the international aid agency Oxfam reported in 2007 that about one quarter of Afghan teachers were women. In 2009, another concern was the destruction of schools by the Taliban, especially schools for females. Following the destruction of over 150 schools in a year, many parents had doubts about the government's ability to protect them. The following achievements were made in the first decade of the 2000s: * Between 2001 and 2016, primary school enrolment rose from around 1 million to 9.2 million (a ninefold increase in fifteen years) and the proportion of girls from virtually zero to 37%. * The number of teachers in general education has risen sevenfold, but their qualifications are low. About 31% are women. * Since 2003 until 2010, over 5,000 school buildings have been rehabilitated or newly constructed. Just over 50% of schools have usable buildings. Enrollment is low: The average is 1,983 students per institution; three institutions have fewer than 200 students. Furthermore, there is a deficiency of qualified faculty members: only 4.7% (166 of total 3,522) of the teaching staff held a Ph.D. In “addition to problems of inadequate resources, and lack of qualified teaching staff are issues of corruption.”Anthony Welch and Attaullah Wahidyar.

In 2010, the United States began establishing Lincoln Learning Centers in Afghanistan. They serve as programming platforms offering English language classes, library facilities, programming venues, Internet connectivity, educational and other counseling services. A goal of the program is to reach at least 4,000 Afghan citizens per month per location.https://photos.state.gov/libraries/afghanistan/231771/PDFs/RFP- Lincoln-Learning- Centers.pdfhttp://waronterrornews.typepad.com/home/2010/09/ghazni-gov-lincoln- learning-center.html According to the Human Development Index, in 2011, Afghanistan was the 15th least developed country in the world. In 2009 and 2010, a 5,000 OLPC – One Laptop Per Child schools deployment took place in Kandahar with funding from an anonymous foundation. The OLPC team seeks local support to undertake larger deployment. In June 2011, officials from the United States signed a joint statement with Education Minister Ghulam Farooq Wardak to expand opportunities for direct financial support from USAID to the Afghan Ministry of Education. In December 2011, the Baghch-e-Simsim (Afghan version of Sesame Street) children's television series was launched in Afghanistan. It is funded by the U.S. Department of State and is produced in consultation with Afghanistan's Ministry of Education. The project is designed to help educate Afghans from pre-school stage and onward. It was reported in May 2013 that there were 16,000 schools across Afghanistan, with 10.5 million students. Education Minister Wardak stated that 3 million children remained deprived of education and requested $3 billion to construct 8,000 additional schools over next two years. Afghanistan’s story in education is still confronted by major challenges. Three and a half million children – 75% of them girls – are still out of school. Poverty, the lack of qualified female teachers in rural schools (which is especially linked to girls' education), and substandard school facilities all account for low enrollment. Furthermore, nearly half of all schools do not have a building or facilities. In 2015 at Kabul University the first master's degree course in gender and women’s studies in Afghanistan began. Challenges to education development A school in Jalrez, in the Wardak province of Afghanistan is in the final stage of construction on September 30, 2009. Violence Afghanistan is one of the countries worst affected by violence against schools, with 770 incidents of attacks on education in 2008. Violence against students prevented nearly 5 million Afghan children from attending school in 2010. Afghanistan saw 439 teachers, education employees and students killed in 2006-9, one of the highest death rates in the world.Reuters. “Violence, tradition keep millions of Afghans from school” https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/01/us- afghanistan-education-idUSTRE7000P220110101 Retrieved 10 February 2012 Teacher credentials Since the Taliban regime was toppled in 2001, up to 6 million girls and boys started attending school.

He was born in Paris, the son of a barrister. During World War II he fought with the Algerian Tirailleurs. Laurent was elected to the Académie française in 1986. Laurent belonged to the literary group of the Hussards, and is known as a prolific historical novelist, essay writer, and screenwriter under the nom de plume of Cecil Saint-Laurent. The 1955 film Lola Montès, directed by Max Ophüls, was based on his historic novel based on the life of Lola Montez. He wrote Jean Aurel's Oscar-nominated 1963 World War I documentary, 14-18. He also directed the film Quarante-huit heures d'amour/48 Hours of Love (1969). Another noteworthy novel by Saint-Laurent was Darling Caroline (written in 1947), a powerful book set in the early days of the French Revolution. This also became a film. This was released in France in 1951, directed by Jean-Devaivre and starring Martine Carol in the title role. Saint-Laurent was one of the scriptwriters of the film. The 1961 \\"Les Passagers pour Alger\\" (translated to English as \\"Algerian Adventure\\") was a contemporary thriller,set against the background of the then raging Algerian War, and like many of his books written from the point of view of adventurous, daring young woman.

Offensive realism holds that the anarchic nature of the international system is responsible for the promotion of aggressive state behavior in international politics. It fundamentally differs from defensive realism by depicting great powers as power-maximizing revisionists privileging buck-passing and self- promotion over balancing strategies in their consistent aim to dominate the international system. The theory brings important alternative contributions for the study and understanding of international relations but remains nonetheless the subject of criticism. Theoretical origins Offensive realism is a prominent theory of international relations belonging to the realist school of thought, which includes various sub-trends characterised by the different perspectives of representative scholars such as Robert Gilpin, Randall Schweller, Eric J. Labs and Fareed Zakaria.Gerald Geunwook Lee, \\"To Be Long or Not to Be Long–That is the Question: The Contradiction of Time-Horizon in Offensive Realism\\", Security Studies 12:2 (2003): 196. Yet, to date, the most important variant of offensive neorealism is that of John J. Mearsheimer as fully developed in his book The Tragedy of Great Power Politics.John J. Mearsheimer, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (New York, NY: W.W. Norton, 2001). While Mearsheimer's offensive neorealism theory does reiterate and build on certain assumptions elaborated by classical realists, it departs completely from this branch by using positivism as a philosophy of science and by adding a system-centric approach to the study of state behaviour in international politics based on the structure of the international system.Glenn H. Snyder, \\"Mearsheimer's World—Offensive Realism and the Struggle for Security: A Review Essay\\", International Security 27:1 (2002): 151.Feng and Zheng, Typologies of Realism, 113–114. Accordingly, his offensive neorealism pertains to the sub-branch of neorealism alongside other structural theories such as defensive realism.Kenneth N. Waltz, \\"Realist Thought and Neorealist Theory\\", Journal of International Affairs 44:1 (1990): 34. Main tenets The theory is grounded on five central assumptions similar to the ones that lie at the core of Kenneth Waltz's defensive neorealism. These are:Mearsheimer, J. (2005). Structural Realism, in T. Dunne, M. Kurki & S. Smith, International Relations Theory: Discipline and Diversity. Oxford: Oxford University Press.Mearsheimer, John J. \\"The false promise of international institutions.\\" International Security 19, no. 3 (1994): 5–49. # Great powers are the main actors in world politics and the international system is anarchical # All states possess some offensive military capability # States can never be certain of the intentions of other states # States have survival as their primary goal # States are rational actors, capable of coming up with sound strategies that maximize their prospects for survival Like defensive neorealism, offensive realism posits an anarchic international system in which rational great powers uncertain of other states' intentions and capable of military offensive strive to survive.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 30–31.Eric J. Labs, \\"Beyond Victory: Offensive Realism and the Expansion of War Aims\\", Security Studies 6:4 (1997): 7–8. Although initially developed from similar propositions to those of defensive neorealism, Mearsheimer's offensive neorealism advances drastically different predictions regarding great power behaviour in international politics.Shiping Tang, \\"From Offensive to Defensive Realism: A Social Evolutionary Interpretation of China's Security Strategy\\", 148–149, in China's Ascent: Power, Security, and the Future of International Politics, edited by Robert Ross and Zhu Feng. (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008).Taliaferro, Security Seeking, 134. Mainly, it diverges from defensive neorealism in regards to the accumulation of power a state needs to possess to ensure its security and the issuing of strategy states pursue to meet this satisfactory level of security. Ultimately, Mearsheimer's offensive neorealism draws a much more pessimistic picture of international politics characterised by dangerous inter-state security competition likely leading to conflict and war.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 32–33.Snyder, Mearsheimer's World, 153. Status quo v. power-maximizing states John Mearsheimer's offensive neorealism intends to fix the \\"status quo bias\\" of Kenneth Waltz's defensive neorealism.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 20.Snyder, Mearsheimer's World,157–158. While both neorealist variants argue that states are primarily concerned with maximising their security, they disagree over the amount of power required in the process. To the contrary of defensive neorealism according to which states are status quo powers seeking only to preserve their respective positions in the international system by maintaining the prevailing balance of power,Kenneth N. Waltz, Theory of International Politics (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1979): 126.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 21. offensive neorealism claims that states are in fact power-maximising revisionists harbouring aggressive intentions. Indeed, in offensive neorealism, the international system provides great powers with strong incentives to resort to offensive action in order to increase their security and assure their survival.; Sten Rynning and Jens Ringsmose, \\"Why Are Revisionist States Revisionist? Reviving Classical Realism as an Approach to Understanding International Change\\", International Politics 45 (2008): 26. The international system characterised by anarchy (the absence of a central authority capable of enforcing rules and punishing aggressors) and uncertainty as to state intentions and available offensive military capabilities leads states to constantly fear each other and resort to self-help mechanisms to provide for their survival.John J. Mearsheimer, \\"China's Unpeaceful Rise\\", Current History 105: 690 (2006): 160. In order to alleviate this fear of aggression each holds of the other, states always seek to maximise their own relative power, defined in terms of material capabilities. As Mearsheimer puts it: \\"they look for opportunities to alter the balance of power by acquiring additional increments of power at the expense of potential rivals\\",Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 34. since \\"the greater the military advantage one state has over other states, the more secure it is\\".John J. Mearsheimer, \\"The False Promise of International Institutions\\", International Security 19:3 (1994–1995): 11–12. States seek to increase their military strength to the detriment of other states within the system with hegemony—being the only great power in the state system—as their ultimate goal.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 21 and 29. John Mearsheimer summed up this view as follows: \\"great powers recognize that the best way to ensure their security is to achieve hegemony now, thus eliminating any possibility of a challenge by another great power. Only a misguided state would pass up an opportunity to be the hegemon in the system because it thought it already had sufficient power to survive.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 35.\\" Accordingly, offensive neorealists such as Mearsheimer believe that a state's best strategy to increase its relative power to the point of achieving hegemony is to rely on offensive tactics. Provided that it is rational for them to act aggressively, great powers will likely pursue expansionist policies, which will bring them closer to hegemony. Since global hegemony is nearly impossible to attain due to the constraints of power projection across oceans and retaliation forces, the best end game status states can hope to reach is that of a regional hegemon dominating its own geographical area.Mearsheimer, China's Unpeaceful Rise, 160.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 141. This relentless quest for power inherently generates a state of \\"constant security competition, with the possibility of war always in the background\\".Mearsheimer, The False Promise, 12. Only once regional hegemony is attained do great powers become status quo states. Balancing v. buck-passing The emphasis offensive neorealism puts on hegemony as states' end aim stands in sharp contrast to defensive neorealism's belief that state survival can be guaranteed at some point well short of hegemony. In a defensive neorealist mindset, security increments by power accumulation end up experiencing diminishing marginal returns where costs eventually outweigh benefits.Snyder, Mearsheimer's World, 154. Defensive neorealism posits that under anarchy there is a strong propensity for states to engage in balancing—states shouldering direct responsibility to maintain the existing balance of power—against threatening power-seeking states, which may in turn succeed in \\"jeopardiz[ing] the very survival of the maximizing state\\".Peter Toft, \\"John J. Mearsheimer: An Offensive Realist Between Geopolitics and Power\\", Journal of International Relations and Development 8 (2005): 390. This argument also applies to state behavior towards the most powerful state in the international system, as defensive neorealists note that an excessive concentration of power is self-defeating, triggering balancing countermoves.Yuan-Kang Wang, \\"Offensive Realism and the Rise of China\\", Issues & Studies 40:1 (2004): 177.Snyder, Mearsheimer's World, 156.Labs, Beyond Victory, 10. Mearsheimer challenges these claims by making the argument that it is rather difficult to estimate when states have reached a satisfactory amount of power short of hegemony and costly to rely extensively on balancing as an efficient power-checking method due to collective action issues.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 34–35 and 156–157.Wang, Offensive Realism, 178. According to him, when a great power finds itself in a defensive posture trying to prevent rivals from gaining power at its expense, it can choose to engage in balancing or intervene by favoring buck- passing—transferring the responsibility to act onto other states while remaining on the sidelines. In order to determine the circumstances in which great powers behave according to one or the other, Mearsheimer builds on Waltz's defensive neorealism by including a second variable—geography—alongside the distribution of power. On one hand, the choice between balancing and buck-passing depends on whether the anarchic international system is of a bipolar, balanced, or unbalanced multipolar architecture. On another hand, state geographic location in terms of border sharing and stopping power of water also influences great powers' strategy preference. Combined together, these two variables allow him to establish that great powers tend to favor—to the contrary of defensive neorealism predictions—buck-passing over balancing in all instances of multipolarity except for those that include a potential hegemon.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 155, 160, 261 and 272.Wang, Offensive Realism, 179.Feng & Z Ruizhuan, Typologies of Realism, 124. Responding to defensive neorealists' posture on state behaviour towards the most powerful state in the international system, Mearsheimer believes that threatened states will reluctantly engage in balancing against potential hegemons but that balancing coalitions are unlikely to form against a great power that has achieved regional hegemony.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 271 and 345. This lack of balancing is best explained by the regional hegemon's newly acquired status quo stance, which follows from the geographical constraints on its power projection capability.Keir A. Lieber and Gerard Alexander, \\"Waiting for Balancing Why the World Is Not Pushing Back\\", International Security 30:1 (2005): 111–112.Jack S. Levy and William R. Thompson, \\"Balancing on Land and at Sea: Do States Ally Against the Leading Global Power?\\" International Security 35:1 (2010): 11. Instead of relying on offensive actions, a regional hegemon finds itself in a defensive position seeking to avert threats to its hegemonic status by preventing the rise of any peer competitors in other areas. As such it will behave as an offshore balancer, passing the buck to local neighbours of the potential hegemon and engaging in balancing only as a last resort. Contributions and criticism Mearsheimer's offensive neorealism represents an important contribution to international relations theory yet also generated important criticism. While the inputs and critics below provide a good sample of the theory's contributions and the kind of arguments that have been addressed against it, the listing should in no case be considered as exhaustive. Theoretical inputs Firstly, scholars believe that Mearsheimer's offensive neorealism provides an alternative complement to Waltz's defensive neorealism. The theory adds to defensive neorealists' argument that the structure of the international system constrains state behavior. Setting to rectify the status quo bias pertaining to defensive neorealism by arguing that anarchy can also generate incentives for states to maximize their share of power, offensive neorealism solves anomalies that Waltz's theory fails to explain. Mainly, the theory is able to provide an explanation for the amount of conflict occurring among states in the international system. As Snyder states, Mearsheimer's offensive neorealism \\"enlarges the scope of neorealist theory by providing a theoretical rationale for the behavior of revisionist states\\".Snyder, Mearsheimer's World, 158. Moreover, this complementarity could signify theoretical interrelation with the two theories working in alternation to explain state behavior, thereby allowing for a \\"more complete structural realist theory that can more accurately account for both defensive and offensive state behavior\\".Toft, John J. Mearsheimer, 403. Secondly, these scholars uphold the argument that Mearsheimer's offensive neorealism significantly contributes to foreign policy theory and alliance theory. More specifically, Mearsheimer's theory goes a step further than structural defensive realism by successfully theorising both international politics and foreign policy. Contrary to Waltz's rejection of defensive neorealism as a theory capable of explaining foreign policy on top of international politics,See Kenneth N. Waltz, \\"International Politics Is Not Foreign Policy\\", Security Studies 6:1 (1996): 54–57.Waltz, Theory of International Politics, 71–72 and 121–123. offensive neorealism includes explanations of both international outcomes pertaining to the systemic level of analysis and individual state behavior.Toft, John J. Mearsheimer, 389.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics, 422 note 60. Additionally, the inclusion of new variables such as geography alongside the distribution of power enhances offensive neorealism's potential to make specific assumptions about states' pursuit of aggressive actions and resort to balancing and buck- passing.Toft, John J. Mearsheimer, 401. Theoretical flaws To begin with, scholars have pointed out several logical issues within Mearsheimer's offensive neorealism. Snyder rejects Mearsheimer's view of the security dilemma as \\"a synoptic statement of offensive realism\\".Snyder, Mearsheimer's World, 155.Mearsheimer, Tragedy of Great Power Politics 35–36. He argues that offensive neorealism's positing of all states as revisionists removes the central proposition—uncertainty about other states' intentions—on which the whole concept of security dilemma is grounded. Aggressive great powers' measures to maximize their security threaten others which leads to an actual justified security competition between states rather than an unnecessary one based on hypothetical threats.Snyder, Mearsheimer's World, 155–156. Toft indicates flaws relating to offensive neorealism's level of analysis. According to him, the inclusion of the non-structural geography variable to explain great power behavior shifts the theory's focal point of analysis from system-wide dynamics to regional ones. Considering the theory's regional security analyses, he further argues that offensive neorealism fails to clearly define what constitutes a region with \\"entities like Europe or North- East Asia (taken) for granted\\", leaving room for scholarly disapproval.Toft, John J. Mearsheimer, 393. Christopher Layne further highlights problems associated with the geographic variable. He criticizes Mearsheimer's reasoning according to which the \\"stopping power of water\\" prevents a great power from achieving global hegemony as this constraint does not seem to apply to the case of an emerging rival's capacity to exercise influence beyond its own neighborhood. As Layne states, \\"apparently water stops the United States from imposing its powers on others in distant regions, but it does not stop them from threatening American primacy in the Western Hemisphere\\".Christopher Layne, \\"The Poster Child for Offensive Realism: America as a Global Hegemon\\", Security Studies 12:2 (2002/2003): 127. Moreover, he finds offensive realism's classification of regional hegemons as status quo powers difficult to reconcile with the theory's emphasis on great powers as relentless power- maximizers. In this sense, Layne questions the ability of the water constraint to transform a power-maximizing state into a status quo power and contradicts Mearsheimer by arguing that a regional hegemon remains subjected to the quest for security, thereby striving to attain global hegemony.Layne, The Poster Child for Offensive Realism, 129. A second group of criticism addresses the issue of offensive neorealism's restrictive focuses. Scholars have criticized Mearsheimer's theory for failing to take into account domestic politics. No attention is paid to a rising power's internal political functioning, its economy or society, which play a role in a state's decision-making process, in turn influencing its behavior in international politics.David C. Hendrickson, \\"The Lion and the Lamb: Realism and Liberalism Reconsidered\\", World Policy Journal 20:1 (2003): 97; Snyder, Mearsheimer's World, 172.Kagan, Why John J. Mearsheimer is Right. Moreover, Snyder argues that no consideration is given to transnational threats such as terrorism, and that Mearsheimer's emphasis on security makes him ignore states' non-security interests such as ideology, national unification and human rights as an essential aspect of international politics alongside power competition.Snyder, Mearsheimer's World, 171–172. Additionally, Toft points out that Mearsheimer's concentration on military capabilities and issuing state capacity for territorial conquest \\"implies a risk that his analyses miss a host of other ways of gaining and exercising influence\\".Toft, John J. Mearsheimer, 384. Similarly, political scientists whose primary focus is bargaining models of international conflict note that offensive neorealism ignores the fact that war is costly.On Bargaining Theory see David A. Lake, \\"Two Cheers for Bargaining Theory: Assessing Rationalist Explanations of the Iraq War,\\" International Security 35:3 (2010/11): 15. Since those costs in turn make war inefficient, states (even those who do not have hegemony) have incentive to construct bargained settlements. For instance, in a bipolar world with a 70%-to-30% power breakdown, states would prefer an analogously proportioned breakdown in resources rather than having some of those resources destroyed over the course of fighting. Due to this inefficiency—war's inefficiency puzzle—the constant fighting Mearsheimer proposes would actually make states less secure because the repeated costs of fighting eventually deplete all of that state's power. Most importantly, scholars have questioned the theory's empirical validity and prediction ability, which in turn can negatively affect the validity of offensive neorealism's prescriptions for state behavior in international politics. In addition to mentioning the theory's failure to account for Japan's 20th century territorial acquisitions, NATO's continuation or Germany's non- achievement of regional hegemony in the post-Cold war era,Toft, John J. Mearsheimer, 396–397. they have also expressed serious doubts regarding offensive neorealism views on China's rising power and U.S. regional hegemony. According to them, there is no reason to believe that China as a rational power wanting to ensure its survival will seek hegemony rather than rely on cooperative mechanisms.Jonathan Kirshner, \\"The Tragedy of Offensive Realism: Classical Realism and the Rise of China\\", European Journal of International Relations 18:1 (2010): 59–61.Toft, John J. Mearsheimer, 397. They similarly contradict Mearsheimer's arguments regarding the United States. Firstly, weak opposition or balancing inefficiencies rather than geographical constraints are taken as explanations for the uniqueness of the United States' regional hegemonic position.Colin Elman, \\"Extending Offensive Realism: The Louisiana Purchase and America's Rise to Regional Hegemony\\", American Political Science Review 98:4 (2004): 563.Snyder, Mearsheimer's World, 173. Toft and Layne go a step further by asserting that Mearsheimer misjudges the United States as a regional hegemon engaged in offshore balancing. Instead of being a regional hegemon with the strategic aim of dominating the Western hemisphere while preventing the rise of peer competitors in Europe and Northeast Asia, these scholars believe that empirical data points to the fact that the United States has sought and achieved global hegemony, which in turn biases Mearsheimer's predictions regarding future U.S. strategic behavior, mainly in terms of its military involvement overseas..Layne, The Poster Child for Offensive Realism, 162–163.Toft, John J. Mearsheimer, 397–399. More fundamental criticisms of offensive realism have come from Shiping Tang, \\"Fear in International Politics: Two Positions\\", International Studies Review 10 (2008): 451–71; and idem, \\"Social Evolution of International Politics: From Mearsheimer to Jervis\\", European Journal of International Relations 16, 1 (2010): 31–55. Tang's first article argues that Mearsheimer's logic is flawed because his five bedrock assumptions cannot lead to his conclusion. Tang's second article argues that because the international system has always been an evolutionary one, neither offensive realism nor defensive neorealism has a claim to be a theory for the whole of human history: the two realism are theories for different epochs of human history.

According to the State of the Environment 2001 published by the government, the main issues are land degradation, forest degradation, loss of biodiversity, water pollution, air pollution and solid waste management.State of the Environment 2001 More recently, climate change was added as a major concern because Vietnam is considered to be one of the most seriously impacted by climate change according to a World Bank study in 2007.Waibel, Michael. 2008. \\"Implications and Challenges of Climate Change for Vietnam,\\" Pacific News, 29, pp. 26-27, The Vietnam Environment Administration, a branch of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), is responsible for environmental issues in Vietnam. At the provincial level, the Departments of Natural Resources and the Environment (DONRE) bear responsibility. Non-governmental organizations, such as the Institute of Ecological Economics, also play a role. History Between 1961 and 1971, U.S military forces dispersed more than 19 million gallons of herbicidal agents over the Republic of Vietnam, including more than 12 million gallons of the dioxin-contaminant commonly known as Agent Orange. Research that studied subsequent effects of the contamination have been comparatively limited. Data from 2009 totalled the amount of arable land for total land use to be approximately 20 percent, while permanent crops that do not require replanting after harvest total approximately 7 percent of the entire available land. The people of Vietnam have shown significant growth in development through economic reform plans that were initiated in 1986, known as Doi Moi. The business and agricultural reforms successfully created more than 30,000 private businesses, and poverty declined from about 50 percent to 29 percent of the population from the early 1990s to 2005. However, reports have shown that due to the significant population growth, protected areas within the environmental sector are often overlooked when nearby land is developed, which creates conflict between area conservation plans versus land development and planning. Clean water accessibility Freshwater is accessible to 99% of the citizens in the range of one kilometer.World Bank, World Development Indicators 2011 In the urban water supply exists a big difference between large and small cities. Tap water is a readily available water supply in large cities such as Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, covering nearly the entire population, whereas, in smaller cities, there is a 60% variability.World Bank - Project Appraisal Document on a Proposed Credit to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for the Urban Water Supply and Wastewater Project - Report No: 59385 - VN (28.04.2011) In rural areas, freshwater within a one-kilometer range is accessible for 75% of the population, but only 51% of rural households have access to hygienic latrines.Vietnam Rural Water Supply and Sanitation National Target Programme, Joint Annual Review 2011 Around 60% of the Water Producing Companies (WPCs) are involved in the water market in urban areas. However, the supply so far is in the hands of the Government. The WPCs reduce their activities to the production of water. In rural areas, hand-dug wells remain the most important source of water as 39%-44% still rely on it. Only 10% of the rural population is supplied with piped water.Netherlands Development Organization - Study of Rural Water Supply Service Delivery Models in (2011) Water pollution causes the greatest damage in the Mekong Delta. The delta is considered Vietnam´s rice bowl. Water pollution caused by the rapid growing industry results in high rates of diarrhea since most people in this region depend on the surface water of the river. Common waterborne diseases in Vietnam are cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, bacterial diarrhea, and hepatitis A. In the case of cholera, even though the number of deaths caused by cholera hasn’t been more than 2 since 1996, the number of reported cases of cholera is still significantly high. Caused by drinking water contaminated by bacterium, the number of reported cholera is well above 500, reaching 1900 in 2007, and 600 in 2010. The fatality rate of cholera has been close to 0% since 1999. In 2009, the number of diarrhea diseases reported was 296000 in total.WHO, department of measurement and health information, 2009 February According to WHO, the number of water, sanitation, and hygiene attributable death in 2004 in Vietnam was 5938. A surprising fact was that out of 5938 deaths, 4905 were children under 5 years, which means that children were the main victims of the water, sanitation and hygiene problem.  Air pollution  Air pollution is becoming a big threat to socioeconomic development. Big cities such as Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City are now among the top polluted cites in South East Asia PM2.5 is a key air pollutant. The main causes include transport, poor urban planning, industrial activities, and solid fuel burning. Development of renewable energy such as solar and wind has potential to reduce air pollution.  Wetland degradation  The area of mangrove forest in the Mekong Delta has decreased by 80 per cent between 1943 and 2000, to 110,700 hectares in 2000. Wetland biodiversity has also decreased. Ad hoc dyke construction was among the key causes. Development planning needs to take into account costs and benefits to the whole society, including impacts on wetland values. Revising water management governance has contributed to recent wetland improvement.  Conservation of Hang Sơn Đoòng cave  Hang Sơn Đoòng cave, located in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park, is considered the world's largest cave (by volume).Guinness World Records 2013, Page 032. Plans are being considered to build a cable car through the cave. The proposed system would be long, and cost between $112 and $211 million. The plans are opposed by environmentalists.  2016 Vietnam marine life disaster  The 2016 Vietnam marine life disaster was a water pollution crisis which affected Hà Tĩnh, Quảng Bình, Quảng Trị and Thừa Thiên–Huế provinces in central Vietnam. Fish carcasses were reported to have washed up on the beaches of Hà Tĩnh province from at least 6 April 2016. Later, a large number of dead fish were found on the coast of Hà Tĩnh and three other provinces (Quảng Bình, Quảng Trị and Thừa Thiên–Huế) until 18 April 2016. Formosa Ha Tinh Steel, a steel plant built by the Taiwanese corporation Formosa Plastics, discharged toxic industrial waste illegally into the ocean through drainage pipes. After denying responsibility for months, Formosa accepted responsibility for the fish deaths on June 30, 2016.  Environmental issues and Free Trade  EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement commits Vietnam and EU to multilateral environmental agreements, including those on climate change and biodiversity. the EU's high environmental standards require Vietnamese businesses to improve environmental performance substantially. Regulations and enforcement on wildlife illegal trade and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing would need to be strengthened to enable Vietnam to fully reap potential benefits from the free trade.

A common fungus native to Eurasia, from the British Isles to Korea, it has been introduced widely elsewhere, including North and South America, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Commonly referred to as slippery jack or sticky bun in English-speaking countries, its names refer to the brown cap, which is characteristically slimy in wet conditions. The fungus, initially described as Boletus luteus by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, is now classified in a different family as well as genus. Suillus luteus is edible, though not as highly regarded as other bolete mushrooms, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, stews or fried dishes. The slime coating, however, may cause indigestion if not removed before eating. The fungus grows in coniferous forests in its native range, and pine plantations in countries where it has become naturalized. It forms symbiotic ectomycorrhizal associations with living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The fungus produces spore-bearing fruit bodies, often in large numbers, above ground in summer and autumn. The fruit body cap often has a distinctive conical shape before flattening with age, reaching up to in diameter. Like other boletes, it has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap, rather than gills; spores escape at maturity through the tube openings, or pores. The pore surface is yellow, and covered by a membranous partial veil when young. The pale stipe, or stem, measures up to 10 cm (4 in) tall and thick and bears small dots near the top. Unlike most other boletes, it bears a distinctive membranous ring that is tinged brown to violet on the underside. Taxonomy and naming The slippery jack was one of the many species first described in 1753 by the \\"father of taxonomy\\" Carl Linnaeus, who, in the second volume of his Species Plantarum, gave it the name Boletus luteus. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective lūtěus, meaning \\"yellow\\". The fungus was reclassified as (and became the type species of) the genus Suillus by French naturalist Henri François Anne de Roussel in 1796. Suillus is an ancient term for fungi, and is derived from swine. In addition to the British Mycological Society approved name \\"slippery jack\\", other common names for this bolete include \\"pine boletus\\" and \\"sticky bun\\"—the latter referring to its resemblance to the pastry. \\"Boletus luteus\\", illustrated by Christiaan Sepp German naturalist August Batsch described Boletus volvatus (the specific epithet derived from the Latin volva, meaning \\"sheath\\", \\"covering\\" or \\"womb\\") alongside B. luteus in his 1783 work Elenchus Fungorum. Batsch placed both of these species, along with B. bovinus and the now obsolete names Boletus mutabilis and B. canus, in a grouping of similar boletes he called \\"subordo Suilli\\". Boletus volvatus is now considered a synonym of Suillus luteus. Several authors have placed the slippery jack in other genera: Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten classified it as Cricunopus luteus in 1881—the genus Cricinopus defined by yellow adnate tubes; Lucien Quélet classified it as Viscipellis luteus in 1886, and Ixocomus luteus in 1888; and Paul Christoph Hennings placed it in the section Cricinopus of the genus Boletopsis in 1900. In works published before 1987, the slippery jack was written fully as , as the description by Linnaeus had been name sanctioned in 1821 by the \\"father of mycology\\", Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries. The starting date for all the mycota had been set by general agreement as 1 January 1821, the date of Fries's work. Furthermore, as Roussel's description of Suillus predated this as well, the authority for the genus was assigned to British botanist Samuel Frederick Gray in the first volume of his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants. The 1987 edition of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered valid as far back as 1 May 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's work. In 1986, a collection of fruit bodies from Sweden was designated as the neotype of Suillus luteus. In their 1964 monograph on North American Suillus species, Alexander H. Smith and Harry Delbert Thiers classified S. luteus in the series Suilli of the section Suillus in genus Suillus. This group is characterized by the presence of either a ring on the stipe, a partial veil adhering to the cap margin, or a \\"false veil\\" not attached to the stipe but initially covering the tube cavity. Species closely related to Suillus luteus include S. pseudobrevipes (a sister species), S. brevipes and S. weaverae (formerly Fuscoboletinus weaverae). A genetic study of nucleotide DNA reinforced the species' monophyly and low genetic divergence, with material of S. luteus from the United Kingdom, Austria, Germany and North America forming a clade, in contrast with some other species, such as S. granulatus, which were shown to be polyphyletic. Chemical analysis of pigments and chromogens showed that Suillus was more closely related to Gomphidius and Rhizopogon than to other boletes, and hence Suillus luteus and its allies were transferred from the Boletaceae to the newly circumscribed family Suillaceae in 1997. Molecular studies have reinforced how distantly related these fungi are from Boletus edulis and its allies. Description The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or dark brown in color and generally 4–10 cm (rarely to 20 cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like the skin of the cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh. Tubes comprising the hymenophore on the underside of the cap are deep, with an attachment to the stipe ranging from adnate to somewhat decurrent. The pores are tiny, numbering 3 per mm in young specimens and 1–2 per mm in maturity. The stipe is tall and wide. It is pale yellow and more or less cylindrical but may bear a swollen base. A membranous partial veil initially links the stipe with the edge of the cap. When it ruptures, it forms a membranous, hanging ring. The top side of the ring is whitish, while the underside is characteristically dark brown to violet. This species is one of the few members of the genus Suillus that have such a ring. Above the ring, the stipe features glandular dots—minute clumps of pigmented cells. Below the ring, the stipe is dingy white, sometimes streaked with brownish slime. In humid conditions, the ring has a gelatinous texture. The white flesh of the entire fungus does not discolour when damaged, and is soft—particularly in mature specimens. It has a \\"pleasant\\" taste and lacks any distinctive odour. The spore print is ochre or clay coloured, the elongated elliptical spores measuring 7–10 by 3–3.5 μm. Basidia (spore-producing cells) are four spored, with dimensions of 14–18 by 4–5 μm. Cystidia are present on both the tube faces (pleurocystidia) and edges (cheilocystidia), either scattered or, more rarely, as bundles. They measure 20–35 by 5–7 μm and have a narrow club shape. Clamp connections are not present in the hyphae of S. luteus. Similar species Good field characteristics for Suillus luteus include the slimy brown cap, glandular dots on the upper stipe, and prominent purplish ring. A frequent lookalike is Suillus granulatus, which is another common, widely distributed and edible species occurring in the same habitat. Suillus granulatus is yellow fleshed and exudes latex droplets when young, but most conspicuously bears neither a partial veil nor a ring. Other than that, Suillus luteus is unlikely to be confused with other mushrooms, especially if its preferred habitat under pine trees and the whitish partial veil are considered. In Europe, the related Suillus grevillei is found under larch and has a yellow cap, while immature fruit bodies of Gomphidius glutinosus may look comparable from above but have gills rather than pores underneath. In North America, Suillus borealis and S. pseudobrevipes also have partial veils, but lack the distinctive ring of S. luteus. S. cothurnatus forms a band-like ring on the stipe that tends to be brownish rather than purplish. In some specimens of S. luteus, the partial veil separates from the stipe (rather than the cap margin), leaving cottony patches of veil hanging from the cap margin. In this state, fruit bodies can be confused with those of S. albidipes. Unlike S. luteus, however, S. albidipes does not have glandular dots on its stipe. Distribution and habitat Growing under host tree, Finland Suillus luteus can be found all over the Northern Hemisphere. Native to Eurasia, it is widespread across the British Isles. To the east it has been recorded from Pakistan, where it was found along canals in Dashkin in the district of Astore, and as far east as South Korea. It has also been widely introduced elsewhere by way of pine plantations around the globe. It is very commonly found in Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) plantations, despite the tree being native to California and hence not in the fungus' native range. In North America it is found in the northeast, the Pacific Northwest and the southwestern United States. According to Ernst Both, it was Charles Horton Peck who first suggested in 1887 that the fungus was introduced to New York State on Pinus sylvestris. DNA studies show that the North American populations differ little genetically from European populations, supporting the idea that the fungus arrived to North America relatively recently as a result of human activity. Suillus luteus is found in coastal and mountainous pine forests and exhibits a tolerance of the northern latitudes. Southern Hemisphere locales where the slippery jack grow with plantation pines include South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In southwestern Australia, the bolete is limited to areas of greater than 1000 mm (40 in) annual rainfall. It has been recorded as far north as the Darling Downs and southern Queensland, and occasionally in Tasmania. The fungus fruits in spring, summer and fairly prolifically in autumn, following periods of wet weather. Mushrooms can appear in large troops or fairy rings. In Ecuador, Pinus radiata plantations were planted extensively around Cotopaxi National Park, and Suillus luteus boletes appear in abundance year-round. A 1985 field study estimated production to be 3000–6000 mushrooms per hectare—up to (dry weight) of mushrooms hectare per year. This continuous production contrasts with the bolete's seasonal appearance elsewhere. The fungus is not found in adjacent areas of native vegetation. The fruiting is so bountiful that the harvest of slippery jacks has become the main reason that pine plantations are established or maintained in parts of Ecuador. In southern Brazil, it has been recorded in plantations of slash pine (P. elliottii) in the municipalities of Pelotas, Nova Petrópolis and Canela in Rio Grande do Sul, and Colombo in Paraná. It is particularly common in plantations in Patagonia. Suillus luteus is the commonest bolete encountered in the Falkland Islands, where it is found in windbreaks and gardens. In South Africa, Suillus luteus has been occasionally recorded under pines in Bloemfontein, Johannesburg and Royal Natal National Park. Ecology Depicted on a 1964 Soviet Union postage stamp Suillus luteus is a pioneer species that typically establishes itself in the early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine, including Scots pine (P. sylvestris), black pine (P. nigra), and Macedonian pine (P. peuce) in Europe, and red pine (P. resinosa) and white pine (P. strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P. halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine (P. contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S. luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner. The ectomycorrhizae formed between the fungus and host plant can be influenced by soil microorganisms present in the mycorrhizosphere. For example, soil bacteria from the genera Paenibacillus and Burkholderia alter the branching structure of the root, whereas Bacillus species increase root growth and mycorrhizal colonization. The fungus does not require a specific soil but seems to prefer acidic and nutrient-deficient soil. Suillus luteus produces hydroxamic acid-based siderophores, which are compounds that can chelate iron and extract it from the soil in nutrient-poor conditions. Ignacio Chapela and colleagues analysed the carbon uptake of S. luteus in Ecuador, concluding pine plantations accompanied by S. luteus deplete carbon stored in the soil and raising concerns that these might not be a remedy for rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The fungus has been shown to provide a protective effect against heavy metal toxicity when associated with the host Pinus sylvestris, preventing copper accumulation in the needles, and protecting seedlings against cadmium toxicity. Owing to its frequent rate of sexual reproduction and the resulting extensive gene flow within populations, the fungus can rapidly evolve a trait to tolerate otherwise toxic levels of heavy metals in the environment. The genetic basis of this adaptation—intriguing to researchers investigating the bioremediation potential of metal-adapted plants and their fungal associates—are contained in the genome sequence of S. luteus, published in 2015. Suillus luteus fruit bodies are sometimes infested with larvae, though not nearly as often as S. granulatus or B. edulis. Damage from maggots is much more common in warmer months, and rare late in the season with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, researchers found that 70–95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were infested with larvae; the most common species were the flies Mycetophila fungorum, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica. In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of oxalic acid at the surface of its hyphae, a feature that is thought to help deter grazing by the springtail species Folsomia candida. Edibility 215x215px 215x215px Suillus luteus is an edible mushroom, but the slime must be removed. Although some authors regard it as one of low quality, and generally inferior to co-occurring species such as Boletus pinophilus, the species is considered a delicacy in Slavic cultures (known as maslyata in Russian or maślaki in Polish, deriving from words meaning \\"buttery\\"). It was highly regarded in Calabria, even more than Boletus edulis, until the 1940s when increased interest in the latter species eclipsed the former. Mushrooms conforming to Suillus luteus are exported from Chile to Italy, and, since the 1970s, the United States. As of 2002, harvesters in Chile were paid on average US$0.5 per kilogram of fruit bodies. In Burundi, Suillus luteus mushrooms are sold to Europeans as cepes in Bujumbura but not generally eaten by the Barundi. Based on samples collected from Chile, the boletes contain (as a percentage of dry weight) 20% protein, 57% carbohydrates, 6% fat, and 6% ash. Pinus radiata plantations in southeastern Australia have become tourist attractions as people flock to them in autumn to pick slippery jacks and saffron milk-caps (Lactarius deliciosus); Belanglo State Forest in particular has attracted large numbers of Polish foragers. Slippery jacks do not keep for long after picking, nor are they suitable for drying, as their water content is too high. They are suited for frying, or cooking in stews and soups, either alone or with other mushroom species. Puréeing the mushroom is not recommended, however: \\"We once made the mistake of running it through a blender to make a soup. The result was a substance recommending itself for use when hanging wallpaper.\\" S. luteus and other Suillus species may cause allergic reactions in some people or digestive problems that appear to result from consuming the slimy skin. The fungus is better cooked before eating, and some authors recommend discarding the glutinous cuticle and tubes before cooking. Moreover, the skin can spoil other fungi with which slippery jacks are collected. Inexpensive powdered S. luteus fruit bodies are sometimes added to the more expensive B. edulis mushroom soup powder, a fraudulent practice that is difficult to detect with microscopy because the tissues are no longer intact. This adulteration can be determined chemically, however, by testing for increased levels of the sugar alcohols arabitol and mannitol. The practice can also be determined with a DNA-based method that is sensitive enough to detect the addition of 1–2% of S. luteus to B. edulis powder.

The country faces problems with air, declining wildlife populations, deforestation, soil erosion, water scarcity, and waste issues. According to a 2004 indicator, the cost of air and water pollution for the country scales up to approximately 1.6–2.6% of GDP per year. As such, Thailand's economic growth has come at great cost in damage to its people and environment. Thailand's Twelfth National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017-2021) warns that, \\"At present the country's natural resources and environmental quality are deteriorating, and have become a weakness in maintaining the basis of production, services and sustainable living. A large volume of the natural resources stock has been utilized for development, resulting in their continuous degradation. The forests have been depleted, the soil has become infertile, and biodiversity has been threatened. While exhibiting a future risk of water shortages, the existing supply of water has not been able to meet the demands of the various sectors. Conflicts over the use of natural resources stem from the unfair allocation of access and exploitation. Moreover, environmental problems have risen along with economic growth and urbanization. All of these problems have affected the quality of life and have added greater economic costs.\\" Climate change Researchers have found that temperatures have increased in Thailand over the past half-century. There is some variability in their assessments. Thailand's Department of Meteorology reported that the annual mean temperature in Thailand rose by approximately one degree Celsius from 1981 to 2007. Another study found that average annual temperatures in Thailand increased by 0.95 °C between 1955 and 2009, more than the average world temperature increase of 0.69 °C. The annual highest temperature has increased by 0.86 °C and the annual lowest temperature has decreased by 1.45 °C over the past 55 years. From 1993 to 2008, the sea level in the Gulf of Thailand has risen 3–5 mm per year compared to the global average of 1.7 mm per year. Professor Danny Marks, a climate consultant for the Rockefeller Foundation, has warned that, \\"Climate change is set to drastically affect the world, and Thailand will likely be one of the most affected countries given its geography, economy and level of development.\\" The rising sea level, caused by climate change, is among the major threats to Thailand.Overland, Indra et al. (2017) Impact of Climate Change on ASEAN International Affairs: Risk and Opportunity Multiplier, Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) and Myanmar Institute of International and Strategic Studies (MISIS) Vulnerability and governmental response Wildfire warning signs in front of a recently burnt field Some tropical ecosystems are being decimated by climate change far faster than expected—bleaching of coral reefs is one example—while many more habitats may be damaged over time. Tropical ecosystems appear to be particularly vulnerable because tropical species have evolved within very specific, narrow temperature ranges. With escalating temperatures, they may simply not survive. According to one report, Thailand will likely be disproportionately affected by the consequences of climate change. Extreme heat in Southeast Asia today reduces working hours by 15–20%, and that figure could double by 2050 as climate change progresses, according to a paper published in Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health. The paper projects a loss of six percent of Thailand's GDP by 2030 due to a diminution of working hours caused by rising temperature. A paper published in Nature, by Mora, et al., forecasts that \\"...things will start going haywire in the tropics at around [sic] the year 2020,...\\" Some scientists project that by 2100, \\"...most of the low and mid latitudes will be uninhabitable because of heat stress or drought...\\" A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences examined how worst-case CO2 emissions would affect the human habitat: By the end of the century, the average human will experience a temperature increase of 7.5 °C when global temperatures increase 3 °C the study predicts. At that level, about 30% of the world's population would live in extreme heat, defined as an average temperature of 29 °C. In 2020, this temperature is rare outside the hottest parts of the Sahara desert. Thailand is among those geographies affected, with a projected 62 million Thais exposed to extreme heat. NASA reported that 2016 will be the hottest year ever recorded in 136 years of modern record keeping. Locally, the Thai Meteorological Department reported that the temperature in Mae Hong Son Province reached 44.6 °C on 28 April 2016, breaking Thailand's \\"hottest day\\" record. April in Thailand is typically hot, but 2016's hot weather set a record for the longest heat wave in at least 65 years. In its WMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2016, the World Meteorological Organization confirmed that 2016 was the hottest year in Thailand's history. The Climate Impact Group at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies analyzed climate data for major cities worldwide. It found that Bangkok in 1960 had 193 days at or above 32 °C. In 2018, Bangkok can expect 276 days at or above 32 °C. The group forecasts a rise by 2100 to, on average, 297 to 344 days at or above 32 °C. The FAO's The State of the World's Fisheries and Aquaculture 2016 reports that a recent study finds that climate change will affect food security in Asia by the middle of the 21st century. It counts Thailand's fisheries as among the most negatively impacted considering all environments—freshwater, brackish-water, and marine fisheries. Researchers at Stanford and the University of California, studying historical records of how temperature affects economies, predict that, given current trends, global income will be 23% less by the end of the century than it would be without climate change. The decline in income is not evenly distributed, with tropical regions hardest hit. The study estimates that Thailand's GDP will have declined by 90% in 2099 relative to GDP 2016. Even niche sectors of the economy could be affected: coral reef tourism worldwide—worth US$36 billion in 2019—may decline by 90% in Thailand and the other four leading reef tourism destinations by 2100. Thailand's CO2 emissions per capita rose from 0.14 tonnes in 1960 to 4.5 tonnes in 2013, while the population rose from 27 million to 67 million over the same period. The Thai government's Climate Change Master Plan, 2012-2050 foresees that \\"Thailand is able [sic] to continue its economic, social, and environmental developments in accordance with sufficiency economy philosophy and to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, without impeding the country's gross domestic product (GDP) or reducing its growth of developmental capability and competitiveness.\\" Paris climate agreement Thailand submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 1 October 2015. It pledged a 20–25% reduction in its emissions of greenhouse gases by 2030. Thailand sent 81 representatives, at a cost of 20 million baht, to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21 or CMP 11) in Paris, 30 November–11 December 2015. Thailand signed the Paris Climate Agreement on 22 April 2016 at the official signing ceremony, and ratified its adherence to the treaty on 21 September 2016. National pledges in Paris equate to a 3 °C increase in global temperatures according to climate scientists. Negotiators in Paris worked to bring this down to 2 °C, but even this lower number may be \\"... be catastrophic for Bangkok\\", forcing the abandonment of the city by 2200 at the latest and by 2045–2070 at the earliest. In a paper published on 1 March 2016, climate researchers James Hansen and Makiko Sato state that, \\"The tropics...in summer are in danger of becoming practically uninhabitable by the end of the century if business-as- usual fossil fuel emissions continue,...\\" In 2015, Bangkok averaged 29.6 °C, 1.6 °C higher than normal. In November 2019, the Fundación Ecológica Universal (FEU), a global environmental NGO based in Buenos Aires, published an assessment of national climate pledges. It judged Thailand's nationally determined contribution to be \\"insufficient\\". At the Paris Agreement, Thailand pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 20% below its projected \\"business as usual\\" (BAU) emissions, using 2005 emissions as a baseline, by 2030, plus an additional 5% decrease contingent on receiving help from developed nations. In contrast, FEU calculated that Thailand's 20% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 would amount to an increase in emissions of 39% more than 2013's emissions. The FEU assessment judged every ASEAN nation's pledges to be insufficient: Myanmar has set no emissions reduction target; Cambodia and Laos would not commit to any reductions unless international assistance is forthcoming; and Brunei and the Philippines had yet, as of 2019, to declare INDCs. The FEU report stood in sharp contrast to the narrative expressed by Thai premier and ASEAN Chair Prayut Chan-o-cha at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019, where he claimed that the region had reduced its use of energy by 22% compared to 2005. Rising sea level The Thai Government's Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMCR) has calculated that erosion causes the country to lose 30 km2 of coastal land every year. The Thai Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning predicts the sea level will rise one meter in the next 40 to 100 years, which impacts at least 3,200 km2 of coastal land at a potential cost to Thailand of three billion baht. Directly affected are 17% of Thailand's population, more than 11 million people. The ground under Bangkok is sinking around three centimeters per year. Built on an alluvial plain of soft clay, the subsidence is exacerbated by excessive pumping of groundwater by industry and by the weight of massive buildings. According to Thailand's National Reform Council (NRC), without urgent action, Bangkok could be under water by 2030 due to the combination of rising sea levels, groundwater extraction, and the weight of city buildings. Despite experts regularly warning the Thai government that coastal Thailand and Bangkok face catastrophic, perpetual flooding similar to the 2011 Thai floods, critics argue that the government is moving too slowly to address the impacts of climate change. Deforestation Forest cover in Thailand has been greatly reduced as people convert forested land to agriculture, or misappropriate public lands for private use, with related estimates varying. The Sueb Nakhasathien Foundation reports that 53% of Thailand was covered by forest in 1961, but that forested areas had shrunk to 31.6% in 2015. An estimate by the World Wildlife Fund concluded that between 1973 and 2009, Thailand's forests declined by 43%. During the period 2001–2012, Thailand lost one million hectares of forest, while restoring 499,000 hectares. Between 1990 and 2005, Thailand lost 9.1% of its forest cover, or around 1,445,000 hectares. , Thailand has an average annual deforestation rate of 0.72%. Wetlands have been converted to rice paddies and urban sprawl. With government measures in place to prohibit logging, deforestation rates have dropped, but the impacts of deforestation are still being felt. Thai government numbers show an increase in the extent of Thai forests. Figures from the Center for Agricultural Information of Thailand's Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives show an increase in the extent of Thailand's forested area over the period 2006-2015 (from 99 million rai to 103 million rai), with decreases in every other type of land use. In 2019, the Forest Department said that forest cover has steadily increased due to its anti-encroachment measures under the regime's reclaim forest land policy. According to the department, the country's forest areas in 2018 covered 102.4 million rai, a 330,000-rai increase from the previous year. The increase, equivalent to an area the size of Phuket, increases forest coverage to 31.58% of the country's total land. In early-2017, the government reaffirmed its 1975 commitment to increase its forest cover to 40% within 20 years. The aim was to have \\"conserved forests\\" blanket 25% of the nation and 15% blanketed by \\"commercial forests\\". To achieve this goal in 2018, Thailand would need to convert 27 million rai into forests. Thailand has three square meters of green area per capita. Singapore has 66 m2 per capita and Malaysia, 44 m2. In November 1988, heavy rains washed away the soil of newly deforested slopes, causing massive floods. Villages and agricultural land were swamped, and almost 400 people and thousands of domestic animals were killed. The Thai government banned logging on 14 January 1989, revoking all logging concessions. Consequences included the price of timber tripling in Bangkok, in turn increasing illegal logging. In June 2015, as a severe drought gripped northeastern Thailand, Prime Minister Prayut Chan- o-cha urged farmers to forgo a second rice crop in order to save water. He attributed the drought to massive deforestation. At least 26 million rai (4.2m ha) of forested land, especially forests in the mountainous north, had been denuded, according to the prime minister, who said that forests were needed for the generation of rainfall. In July 2015, a Bangkok Post editorial summed up Thailand's forestry issues: \\"Forests have rapidly declined under state policies over the past four decades. Factors include logging, mining, anti- insurgency strategies, promotion of cash crops on the highlands, construction of big dams and promotion of the tourism industry. Corruption is also deep- rooted in forestry bureaucracy.\\" Valuable hardwood tree species, such as Siamese Rosewood, are being extracted illegally for sale, mostly to the Chinese furniture market. These trees are so valuable that poachers are armed and are prepared fight forest rangers. Both rangers and poachers have been killed in gunfights. The rates of logging now threaten the Siamese Rosewood with extinction within 10 years, according to Al Jazeera in 2014. Mangroves and beach erosion Deforestation creates a host of environmental problems: soil erosion, sedimentation of rivers, and loss of natural habitat. Wetlands and mangroves in coastal areas have been seriously degraded by expansion of commercial fishing, shrimp aquaculture, industry, and tourism, causing much of Thailand's biodiversity losses. It is estimated that Thailand in 1961 had 3,500 km2 of mangrove forests. By 2004 that number was less than 2,000 km2 according to the Thai government. According to Thailand's deputy transport minister, some of Thailand's attractive beaches may be lost within ten years. \\"If we don't do anything, there will be no attractive beaches left\\", he said. The marine department, part of the transport ministry, manages Thailand's 3,000 km of shoreline in 23 coastal provinces. Some 670 km of shoreline exhibits severe erosion, with land being lost to the sea at a rate of more than five metres per year. To combat erosion, sections of Pattaya Beach in Chonburi Province are being topped up with more than 300,000 m3 of sand at a cost of 429 million baht. A two kilometer stretch of Chalatat Beach in Songkhla is being restored at a cost of 300 million baht. Air pollution Motorbikes, Nana intersection, Bangkok The World Bank estimates that deaths in Thailand attributable to air pollution have risen from 31,000 in 1990 to roughly 49,000 in 2013. Wildfires in the Khun Tan Range, Mae Tha District, Lamphun. Every year mountain forests are set on fire by farmers to increase the yield of the valuable fungus Astraeus odoratus Industrial growth has created high levels of air pollution in Thailand. Vehicles and factories contribute to air pollution, particularly in Bangkok, which experienced high levels of air pollution in the winter of 2019. Recent research (2019) points to agricultural burning as the root cause of PM 2.5 pollution in Thailand. PM 2.5 is a measurement of particulates in the atmosphere smaller than 2.5 microns. The Bangkok metropolitan region, which consists of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) and the four surrounding provinces (Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Nakhon Pathom, and Samut Prakan), holds about 20% of the national population and over half of the country's factories. Due to a lack of treatment facilities, increasing volumes of hazardous substances generated by industrial activities have caused serious dumping issues. Unless treatment facilities are built and institutions starts to regulate strictly, environmental contamination caused by hazardous waste threatens to become Thailand's worst environmental problem in the future. Thailand's Pollution Control Department (PCD) and other agencies have developed standards in order to reduce air pollution. The standards focus on shifting to lower-emissions vehicle engines and improving public transportation. In 1999, 80% of the motorcycles on the road in Bangkok had environmentally unfriendly two-stroke engines. Diesel trucks and buses also contribute many pollutants. In most areas of the country, air pollutants for vehicles are now within acceptable levels according to national standards. Factories and power plants have been required to reduce emissions. In 2002, Bangkok and the rest of the central region contributed between 60–70% of the country's industrial emissions. Most power plants rely on burning fossil fuels. Other sources of air pollution include garbage burning, open cooking, and agricultural burning practices, including deliberate forest fires. Agricultural burning in Southeast Asia often creates haze. In 2003 Thailand ratified the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution to reduce the haze from forest fires, but issues throughout the region are still common. Wildfires are started by local farmers during the dry season in northern Thailand for a variety of purposes, with February and March as the two months when conditions are at their worst. In research conducted between 2005 and 2009 in Chiang Mai, average PM10 rates during these months were found to be well above the country's safety level of 120 μg/m³ (microgrammes per cubic metre), peaking at 383 μg/m³ on 14 March 2007. They are the main cause of the intense air pollution in the Thai highlandsMushroom Research Center and contribute to the floods in the country by completely denuding forest undergrowth. The dry forest soil leads to lower water intake for trees to extract when the rains arrive. In February 2016, Director-General Chatchai Promlert of the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department, said that the haze affecting northern Thailand has reached levels that can be considered harmful to health. He said that the Pollution Control Department had reported that the levels of particulates measuring less than 10 micrometres—known as PM10—had crossed the prescribed safe threshold of 120 in four out of nine provinces where monitoring was conducted. The level of PM10 in the nine regions—Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Lampang, Lamphun, Mae Hong Son, Nan, Phrae, Phayao and Tak—was measured at between 68 and 160. The haze level was considered unhealthy in Chiang Mai, Lampang, Lamphun, and Phrae Provinces. During the burning season 2016 (February–April), air pollution has shown no improvement despite the government's purported efforts to ameliorate the burning. The Mae Sai District of Chiang Rai Province recorded a record 410 μg/m3 of harmful air particles in the early morning of 25 March 2016. From January–July 2016 the five Thai cities with the highest annual average concentrations of PM2.5 were Chiang Mai, Lampang (Mae Moh), Khon Kaen, Bangkok and Ratchaburi. Seven out of the eleven cities measured (63.6%) did not reach the National Ambient Air Quality Standard annual limit of 25 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and all 11 cities measured did not reach the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline annual limit of 25 μg/m3. Thailand's national air quality standards are weak when compared to WHO recommendations. In the first six months of 2017, Greenpeace Thailand monitored PM2.5 in 14 provinces, as they have done since 2015, and found that every station recorded levels higher than the WHO recommendation of less than 10 milligrams per cubic meter of air. PM2.5 refers to airborne particulates smaller than 2.5 microns, particles so small that they can be inhaled into the blood system and cause cancer and heart disease. Chiang Mai, Tak, Khon Kaen, Bangkok, and Saraburi were among the worst cities with the highest PM2.5 levels in 2017. In February 2018 and 2019, Bangkok suffered under a haze of smog and ultra-fine dust. The Pollution Control Department issued warnings that particulate levels had soared to 94 micrograms per cubic metre of air in some areas, almost double the safe limit of 50 mcg. Residents were urged to wear N95 or KN95 protective dust masks. Bangkok City Hall reassured residents that conditions will \\"permanently improve\\" in 11 years (2029) with the launch of many new and improved modes of public transport. Bangkok City Hall failed to mention that it is constructing 1,047 km of new roads due to be completed by 2029 or that in the decade 2008 to 2018 the number of cars registered in Bangkok rose from 5.9 million to 10.2 million. In January 2019, Bangkok authorities employed cloud seeding to ease air pollution in parts of the city. That month, high-pressure cannons were blasted around Bangkok's City Hall and other areas to combat the smog, leading to debate as to whether the method was effective at washing away the particularly harmful smaller particles. In January 2020, a National Institute for Development Administration survey showed that \\"81% of the 1,256 local residents questioned agreed that the [Thai] government\\" was ineffective at solving Bangkok's air pollution, with 2.7% of respondents approving the government's efforts. Field and forest burning Fires in Thailand fall into three main categories: forest fires, agricultural burning, and roadside burning. Forest fires are set deliberately, as they are thought to increase forest product yields, especially the earth star mushroom (Astraeus hygrometricus (Pers.) Morgan, or hed thob or hed phor in Thai), which has seasonal availability and a high market price. In order to collect these fungi, local farmers use fire either to clear the forest floor to make it easier to find the mushroom or because fire is thought to stimulate the growth of this mushroom. The burning of agricultural fields and forested areas in Southeast Asia is a yearly event, mainly during the \\"burning season\\", January through March. It is particularly widespread in the northern and northeastern provinces of Thailand. Northern Thailand has the highest rates of lung cancer in the country. The incidence of other chest diseases and cardiac conditions is also high. According to the Bangkok Post, corporations in the agricultural sector, not farmers, are the biggest contributors to smoke pollution. The main source of the fires is forested area being cleared to make room for new crops. The new crops to be planted after the smoke clears are not rice and vegetables to feed locals. A single crop is responsible: maize. The haze problem began in 2007 and has been traced at the local level and at the macro-market level to the growth of the animal feed business. \\"The true source of the haze...sits in the boardrooms of corporations eager to expand production and profits. A chart of Thailand's growth in world corn markets can be overlaid on a chart of the number of fires. It is no longer acceptable to scapegoat hill tribes and slash-and-burn agriculture for the severe health and economic damage caused by this annual pollution.\\" These data have been ignored by the government. The end is not in sight, as the number of fires has increased every year for a decade, and data show more pollution in late-February 2016 than in late- February 2015. Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group, Thailand's largest agro-industrial and food conglomerate, and the leading purchaser of northern maize, in March 2016 announced an \\"agricultural social enterprise\\" to steer Nan Province's Pua District villagers away from maize farming. CP Group has incurred criticism for the way it purchases maize harvests for animal feed from farmers in Nan and other provinces. Suphachai Chearavanont, vice-chairman of CP Group, said that corn planters will be encouraged to grow cash crops such as coffee, which requires less farmland and makes a higher profit than maize. Not only will this address deforestation, he said, but it will also help reduce the spring haze in the north which is caused by slash-and-burn practices to prepare land for the next maize season. Chearavanont said crops like coffee take about three-and-a-half years to show a yield, but stated that CP Group would stand by farmers and provide assistance in the meantime. The Thai government has encouraged farmers to abandon rice farming and cultivate sugarcane instead. As a consequence, fields planted in sugarcane have soared from 6.8 million rai in harvest year 2008-2009 to 11.5 million rai in 2017–2018. Sugarcane fields are a major locus of open fires. Despite anti-burning regulations, 66% of the sugarcane that entering processing mills in 2019 had been burned prior to harvesting. \\"Cheap and fast\\" is a shorthand explanation for the intentional use of fire to clear overgrown roadsides and open areas. Cattle herders also burn areas to stimulate the growth of Imperata grass which is able to quickly produce new leaves during the hot-dry season. New leaves produced on burnt areas have a higher nutrient value, which is perfect for cattle grazing. Roadside fires are set to clear vegetation from encroaching on roadways. Fires produce large amounts of smoke which stagnates low lying areas, causing eye irritation and respiratory ailments. Large areas of degraded forest are destroyed by fire each year. Fisheries Overfishing In 1950, the newly constituted Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimated that, globally, Thailand was catching about 20 million metric tons of fish (cod, mackerel, tuna) and invertebrates (lobster, squid, clams). That catch peaked at 90 million tons per year in the late-1980s, and it has been declining ever since. Thailand is no exception to this decline, despite having had 57,141 fishing vessels and more than 300,000 people employed by the fishing industry. According to the Thai Department of Fisheries, Thailand had 11,000 registered trawlers and \\"about\\" 2,000 illegal trawlers (2016). In 2018 Thailand completed its first-ever census of fishing boats permitted to catch fish in Thai waters: 10,743. The sheer number of Thai fishing vessels is a key contributor to overfishing. Even the president of the Thai Tuna Industry Association (TTIA), Chanintr Chalisarapong, acknowledges this. \\"You don't need to be a scientist to know that we're overfishing,...\\" said Chalisarapong. \\"We have to stop building new boats. Catch has to come from local fishermen using pole and line methods....We need to have less [sic] boats and less gear.\\" Thailand has made progress in this area: Thailand's fishing fleet numbers 38,956, down from 50,023 in 2015, a 22% reduction. Thailand is a peninsular country of 514,000 km2 with over 3,565 km of coastline, 2,700 km on the Gulf of Thailand and 865 km on the Andaman Sea. Its exclusive economic zone extends over 306,000 km2. Historically, fish from Thailand's off-shore waters have been a significant provider of protein to the population. In 2001, the average yearly fish consumption was 32.4 kg per capita and provided on average 10–14 grams of protein per capita per day. It provides 40.5% of animal protein sources and 17.6% of total protein. Consumption of fish is almost certainly higher than reported as many fish are caught by smallholders and consumed without passing through the marketplace. But numbers are dwindling: small-scale fishers were able to catch up to eight times as much fish in the 1980s than possible in the 2000s. Thailand's marine fish resources are over-exploited. Thailand's marine capture averaged 2,048,753 tonnes from 2003-2012; in 2014 the catch was 1,559,746 tonnes, a decrease of 23.9%. The catch per unit of effort (CPUE) has decreased markedly. Average catches in Thai waters have fallen by 86% since the industry's large expansion in the 1960s. In 2014, Thailand was 12th in the world (of 215 nations) (1=worst, 215=best) in terms of fish species at risk (96 species). The over-exploitation of fish stocks in Thailand has led to the creation of a huge aquaculture industry, human trafficking to man fishing vessels voyaging ever further out to sea, and the depletion of \\"trash fish\\" as well as marketable juvenile fish to feed the increasing demand for fish meal for farmed shrimp. The wisdom of using captured fish to feed domesticated fish is dubious, according to a researcher. \\"Using fishmeal in aquaculture,...is not ecologically sustainable because we are still relying on wild-caught fish as an input for farmed fish, so producing more farmed fish as a solution to food security does not lessen the pressure on wild-caught fish.\\" A twelve-month analysis of the catch composition, landing patterns, and biological aspects of sharks caught by Thai commercial fishing boats in the Andaman Sea off Thailand showed a significant difference from the results of a similar study done in 2004. Sixty-four species were observed in the 2004 study, but only 17 in the most recent. Largely absent were slow-growing, late–maturing, low-fecundity species. Their absence suggests that the populations of these groups of apex predators may be close to collapse. Thai surimi production has fallen from around 100,000 tonnes in 2012 to just over 52,000 tonnes in 2017. Fish prices for the species from which tropical surimi is typically made—itoyori, eso, flying fish, sea bream, and ribbonfish—are rising in spite of stable low wages. Surimi expert Jae Park of Oregon State University says of Thai surimi fish: \\"They're overharvested, they're really overharvested\\". One response of the government has been a program to buy back 1,300 sub-standard trawlers to reduce overfishing. Thailand has 10,500 registered commercial trawlers. The 1,300 boats to be purchased by the government failed licensing standards after the government imposed more stringent, environmentally friendly laws. The cabinet in December 2017 approved the buyback to pacify boat owners. Buyback costs are equivalent to 40,000 baht per gross ton, equating to 400,000 baht to 2.4 million baht per boat. the government has not disbursed buyback funds. The National Fisheries Association of Thailand says its members will stop fishing unless the government pays for the 1,300 decommissioned trawlers. On 3 August 2018, the Fisheries Department announced that it would buy-back 680 unlicensed fishing boats for three billion baht. Climate change poses a serious threat to the sustainability of the fisheries industry in the ASEAN region including Thailand.Indra Overland et al. (2017) Impact of Climate Change on ASEAN International Affairs: Risk and Opportunity Multiplier, Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) and Myanmar Institute of International and Strategic Studies (MISIS). Available at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320622312 Illegal fishing On 21 April 2015 the European Commission threatened Thailand, the third-largest seafood exporter in the world, with a trade ban if it did not take action on illegal fishing. The EU, the world's largest importer of fish products, since 2010 has taken action against countries that do not follow international overfishing regulations, such as policing their waters for unlicensed fishing vessels and imposing penalties to deter illegal fishing. Thailand has failed to certify the origin and legality of its fish exports to the EU and now has six months, until October 2015, to implement a satisfactory action plan to address the shortcomings. EU fisheries commissioner Karmenu Vella declared that, \\"Analyzing what is actually happening in Thailand, we noticed that there are no controls whatsoever, there are no efforts whatsoever.\\" The EU imported 145,907 tons of fish products worth €642 million from Thailand in 2014. In the view of the Bangkok Post, \\"The [Thai] fisheries bureaucracy's record is extremely shabby, resulting in a breakdown in state regulation of commercial trawlers. Fisheries officials are also known to have cozy relationships with trawler operators.\\" In a press release dated 21 April 2016, the European Commission updated its assessment of Thailand's progress, saying, \\"The dialogue is proving difficult and there remain serious concerns about the steps taken by Thailand to fight IUU [illegal, unreported and unregulated] fishing activities. This means that further action by the Commission cannot be ruled out. A meeting with the Thai authorities in May [2016] will be a new opportunity for them to show their good will and commitment.\\" In addition to Thailand's illegal fishing concerns, what is often overlooked are abusive labor practices. The labor abuses, often referred to as sea slavery, involve the trafficking of workers onto fishing boats quite frequently in the form of force, fraud, or coercion, including debt bondage. The problem of sea slavery is connected to environmental concerns in this and other fleets because overfishing of near-shore stocks have caused a collapse in the number of fish, resulting in fishing boats needing to go further out at sea to catch bare minimum quotas. The price of venturing further from shore has given rise to a dependence on forced debt bonded or captive labor as a cost-saving measure.Urbina, Ian. \\"'Sea Slaves': The Human Misery That Feeds Pets and Livestock.\\" www.nytimes.com The New York Times. Retrieved 27 July 2015 Fishing practices The Thai Department of Marine and Coastal Resources reported that the deaths of \\"400 rare marine animals\\" in 2017 were due to destructive fishing practices and equipment. Of the death toll, 57% were sea turtles, 38% dolphins and whales, and five percent dugongs. Fishing gear was the major cause, followed by disease and pollution. The death toll has hovered around 400 for three consecutive years and represents less than 10% of the 5,000 rare species found in Thailand's territorial waters. The department estimates that there are around 2,000 dolphins and whales, 3,000 sea turtles, and 250 dugongs living in Thai waters. All are protected as rare species. Sharks were once common in Thai waters. Marine scientists now say that they may be close to collapse. Researchers examined bycatch on returning fishing boats at several Thai ports over a year. They discovered a sharp decline in the shark population. They also noted shifts in population composition compared to a previous study in 2004. They managed to count 2,123 sharks, and recorded only 17 species, compared with 64 species reported in 2004. In Thailand, sharks are often caught as bycatch when other species are being targeted. Bycatch in Thailand is largely unregulated, leaving, for example, only about 100 whale sharks in Thai waters, according to the Department of Coastal and Marine Resources. Thailand has been attempting to protect the species following an international commitment, the \\"International Plan of Action for Conservation and Management of Sharks\\", initiated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). It has been developing the \\"National Plan of Action for Conservation and Management of Sharks\\", but it is not yet implemented as of 2018. The period from 2012–2016 saw Thailand export 22,467 tons of shark fins, the primary ingredient in shark fin soup—a Chinese dish signifying wealth and privilege—making it the world's leading exporter. , 52 nations have implemented some form of ban on shark finning or fishing. Twelve countries have banned shark fishing altogether. But Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand still permit shark fishing. A study commissioned by WildAid, found that 57% of urban Thais have consumed shark fin at some point and 61% plan to consume shark fin in the future. More than 100 Bangkok restaurants serve shark fin soup Waste management When Thailand was a rural, agrarian society, garbage was of no concern as everything was made of natural products such as banana leaves. Waste could be discarded to decompose naturally. Today, according to one observer, \\"...it would not be an exaggeration to say that every locality in the country is...mired in its own garbage.\\" Thailand's Pollution Control Department (PCD) estimates that each Thai produces a daily average of 1.15 kg of solid waste, amounting to over 73,000 tonnes daily nationwide. According to Interior Ministry statistics, refuse nationwide in 2016 amounted to 27 million tonnes, up about 0.7% from the previous year. Of this, 4.2 million tonnes was generated in Bangkok. Thailand had 2,490 dump sites in 2014, but only 466 of them were of sanitary landfill caliber. Twenty- eight million tonnes of waste were left unprocessed. Bangkok's canals are awash in sewage, but also serve as dump sites. After recent severe flooding, tonnes of refuse blocked water gates, preventing drainage. At one water gate, more than five tonnes of debris had accumulated, consisting of everything from everyday consumer product waste to large items such as mattresses and furniture. Organic waste The PCD estimates that in 2017 organic waste collected by municipalities across Thailand accounted for nearly two-thirds of the country's total waste output: a reported 7.6 million tonnes— 64%—of the refuse collected was organic waste. It is thought that a significant portion of this waste is not merely fruit and vegetable peelings, but edible surplus food. This in a nation where 400,000 to 600,000 children may be undernourished due to poverty, yet ten percent of all children are obese. Prevailing attitudes do not encompass composting or waste sorting: 64 percent of the Thai population do not sort their rubbish according to one study. Plastic waste , Thailand generated two million tonnes of plastic waste. One quarter of that (500,000 tonnes) is reused. Thais throw away 45 billion single-use plastic bags per year, 12% of all household waste. Wet markets are the source of 18 billion plastic bags. Grocery and department stores each account for 13.5 billion bags. Thailand's Pollution Control Department (PCD) estimates that plastic waste in the country is increasing at an annual rate of 12%, or around two million tonnes per year. And yet, Thailand imported 480,000 tonnes of plastic garbage from abroad in 2018, and is set to import an additional 220,000 tonnes before existing contracts expire in September 2020. Increasingly, plastic is the scourge of Bangkok's network of storm water pumping stations, clogging pumps during seasonal downpours and regularly turning thoroughfares into muddy rivers. Thailand is considered to be one of the world's largest consumers of plastic bags. Government figures suggest that the average Thai uses eight plastic bags a day. In contrast, the average person in France uses around 80 a year. In a 2015 report, the conservation group Ocean Conservancy estimated that just five countries—China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand—were responsible for over half of plastic waste dumped into the ocean. Mr Narong Ruengsri, head of Bangkok's drainage department, said removing plastic from the canals and drainage system is a constant battle. \\"Every day we go fish out around 2,000 tons of waste from the drainage channels,\\" he told AFP. Official figures show the 11,500 tonnes of garbage Bangkok produces each day, at least one tonne of which is plastic, is growing by 10% a year. Officially, only 16% is recycled. The PCD estimates that Thailand consumes 4.4 billion plastic water bottles per year. Sixty percent of containers are capped with plastic wrap covering the cap, an unnecessary feature in the eyes of the PCD and due to be phased out by 2019. The cap seals alone contribute 520 tonnes of plastic per year to the environment. In February 2018 the PCD reached agreement with five leading water bottlers to cease using plastic cap seals by 1 April 2018, with all other bottlers to follow by 2019. The Environment Ministry claims that Thailand's 24 coastal provinces produce 10 million tonnes of waste per year. Ten percent of that finds its way into the sea. In February 2017, a 10 kilometer-long patch of plastic refuse was found floating off Chumphon Province. The Thai Marine and Coastal Resources Department has noted that at least 300 sea animals on average—60 per cent of which are whales and dolphins—die from eating plastic fishing gear and trash each year. Filter feeding invertebrates tested off the coast of Chonburi Province showed high levels of microplastics, leading the authors to warn that, \\"Health risks are possible when people consume these contaminated marine organisms, particularly shellfish.\\" In May 2018 a juvenile pilot whale in southern Thailand beached and died. An autopsy revealed the creature had consumed 80 plastic bags weighing eight kilograms. A rescue attempt failed to save the whale. A marine biologist from Kasetsart University, said the bags made it impossible for the whale to eat any nutritious food. \\"If you have 80 plastic bags in your stomach, you die,\\" he said. At least 300 marine animals including pilot whales, sea turtles and dolphins perish each year in Thai waters after ingesting plastic. In June 2018, all Thai governmental agencies committed to reducing use of plastic. The move followed Prime Minister General Prayut Chan- o-cha's 17 April order for the Interior Ministry and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to mount a campaign for reduced use of plastic. Its goal is to halve the amount of plastic ocean waste Thailand produces by 2027. In 2017, the Thai government said that it might tax plastic bags. An \\"endless debate\\" ensued in government, but no action. Petrochemical firms maintain that plastic is not an issue if it is reused and recycled. Thai exports of polyethylene pellets and plastic goods amounted to 430 billion baht or five percent of total Thai exports in 2017 according to the Thai Plastic Industries Association. Finally, a ban on single-use plastic bags at major retailers was enacted to take effect on 1 January 2020. The ban exempts, until 2021, the 40% of total volume of single-use bags used at wet markets and restaurants. Bag manufacturers have cried foul, arguing that the solution to plastic pollution is proper disposal of bags and recycling. To make matters worse for the manufacturers, eight TV channels signed an agreement with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment on 2 January 2020 to blur images and footage of single-use plastic bags on-screen, as is done in Thailand for firearms, cigarettes, and alcohol. In 2018, the Thai government awakened fully to the dangers of plastic pollution. The Thai Cabinet banned the use of plastic bags and Styrofoam food containers on the premises of state agencies. Concurrently, the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation launched a program to ban plastic bags, Styrofoam containers, plastic cutlery, and plastic straws in Thailand's 154 national parks. Park vendors may not use plastics and park visitors will be prohibited from bringing single-use plastic items into the parks. In April 2019 the Thai Cabinet approved the \\"Plastic Waste Management Road Map 2018-2030\\". The plan prohibits the use of microbeads, cap seals, and OXO-degradable plastics by the end of 2019. Four single-use plastics to be prohibited by 2022 are lightweight plastic bags less than 36 microns thick, Styrofoam takeaway food containers, plastic cups, and plastic straws. All plastic used in Thailand by 2027 is to be recycled plastic. On World Environment Day 2019, 5 June, the Pollution Control Department (PCD) said that the first year of the country's effort to reduce plastic waste has been a success. It claimed an 80% reduction in the plastic wrap used to keep dust off plastic water bottle caps. The Environment Ministry has created a National Roadmap to Tackle Plastic Waste, 2018-2030. PCD data shows that 0.5 million tonnes of plastic waste in Thailand was recycled in 2018 of the total two million tonnes of plastic waste generated. In April 2019, Marium, an abandoned and ailing baby dugong washed up on a beach in southern Thailand. She was found to be suffering from an infection exacerbated by ingesting plastic waste. Overnight, she became the nation's sweetheart. Authorities did everything in their power to save her. In August, she died. Within a day the environment minister announced a national dugong conservation master plan named \\"Marium Action\\". Marium's body would be preserved for educational and awareness-raising purposes and 17 August was proposed as National Dugong Day. New dudong conservation zones were proposed. The prime minister pledged to \\"leave no one behind, including animals\\". In the same appearance, the prime minister delayed a ban on single-use plastic bags until 2022. Finally, a ban on single-use plastic bags at major retailers was enacted. taking effect on 1 January 2020. The ban exempts, until 2021, the 40% of total volume of single-use bags used at wet markets and restaurants. Bag manufacturers have cried foul, arguing that the solution to plastic pollution is proper disposal of bags and recycling. To make matters worse for the manufacturers, eight TV channels signed an agreement with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment on 2 January 2020 to blur images and footage of single-use plastic bags on-screen, as is done in Thailand for firearms, cigarettes, and alcohol. Concomitantly, Thailand imported 480,000 tonnes of plastic garbage from abroad in 2018, and is set to import an additional 220,000 tonnes before existing contracts expire in September 2020. Between 2014 and 2018 Thailand imported 906,521 tonnes of plastic from 81 countries, according to the Commerce Ministry. Plastic imports nearly doubled between 2018 and 2019 due to increased Chinese imports. Electronic waste Thailand is a signatory to the Basel Convention, which prohibits the transnational movement of hazardous waste. The Thai government—sometimes acting through free-trade agreements—circumvents the convention, using legal techniques to skirt the prohibition and instead import hazardous waste, mostly electronic waste. Thai agencies tasked with preventing negative environmental impacts from e-waste have failed to perform their regulatory missions. They have allowed operators of waste management plants to reduce operational costs by disposing of hazardous waste improperly. That has contributed to serious environmental degradation and degraded the health of locals. Thailand legally imports about 53,000 tonnes of e-waste annually. Thailand permits 1,761 factories to manage electronic waste. Five hundred thirty-nine are electronic waste recycling plants. Another 1,222 plants dispose of e-waste in land-fills or by incineration. Most of these plants are in Rayong Province, Chonburi Province, and Chachoengsao Province. In June 2018 Thailand banned all imports of foreign e-waste. China banned the import of foreign e-waste in 2018 also. Since the e-waste ban, 28 new recycling factories, most dealing with e-waste, have opened in Chachoengsao Province. In 2019, 14 businesses in Chachoengsao were granted licenses to process electronic waste, six of them in the Ko Khanun Subdistrict of Phanom Sarakham District. An official of the Basel Action Network, which campaigns against dumping waste in poor countries, said, \\"E-waste has to go somewhere, and the Chinese are simply moving their entire operations to Southeast Asia. The only way to make money is to get huge volume with cheap, illegal labour and pollute the hell out of the environment,\\" he added. Industrial water pollution Water pollution Thailand's Pollution Control Department reports divide the country into five main geographical regions: north, northeast, central, south, and east. In those regions, Thailand has a total of 25 river basins. Thailand's annual rainfall averages around 1,700 mm. Despite the annual southwest monsoon, Thailand is subject to drought, particularly the northeastern region. As of 2002, Thailand had less water available per person than any other country in Asia, and nearly one- third of its water was \\"unsuitable for human consumption.\\" According to the Department of Water Resources, national water demand averages 152 billion m3 per year against a supply of 112 m3. The agricultural sector accounts for 75% of demand, the industrial sector three percent, households four percent, and preserving ecological systems 18%. Dams and reservoirs supply 66% of water, 15% from surface water sources, and 13% is mined from underground. Non-potable water is a result of untreated domestic sewage, industrial waste water, and solid hazardous wastes. This is a critical environmental problem for Thailand. According to the Pollution Control Department, the agricultural sector is the largest polluter as the nation's farms discharged up to 39 million m3 of wastewater per day in 2016. The industrial sector ranked second, discharging 17.8 million m3 per day. The residential sector ranked third with 9.6 million m3 per day. Wastewater treatment processes in the residential sector were only 18% effective, while only 52% of wastewater was treated. Surface waters In 2003, Thailand's Pollution Control Department (PCD) monitored the quality of 49 rivers and four lakes in Thailand. Findings revealed that 68% of water bodies surveyed were suitable for agriculture and general consumption. Only less than 40% of Thailand's surface waters were in poor or very poor quality. According to the survey of major rivers and lakes by PCD, no surface water was categorized as \\"very good\\" quality (clean water suitable for aquatic animals and human consumption after normal treatment). Surface water quality varies widely in the different regions in Thailand. Surface water monitored in the northern, central, and southern regions appear to have poor quality, while water in the eastern region was fair. Compared to other regions, the rivers and lakes monitored in the northeastern region had good quality surface water. In terms of dissolved oxygen (DO), surface water in the northern region ranks the best, approximately 6 mg/L, followed by the northeastern region with DO concentrations of around 4 mg/L. The central, eastern, and central regions rank the lowest, about 2 mg/L. The highest concentration of total coliform bacteria (TCB), among surface waters monitored, was found in the central region with concentrations of TCB higher than 4,000MPN (most probable number)/100mL. Coastal waters In 2003, PCD set up 240 monitoring stations in Thailand's 23 coastal provinces and on significant islands. In 2003, monitoring results showed that coastal water of 68 percent of the stations were in \\"very good\\" and \\"good\\" quality. Thirty percent of the stations were in \\"fair\\" condition and only three percent were in \\"poor\\" quality. Compared with past data, coastal water quality was shown to have deteriorated, specifically in the areas into which four main rivers flow. The chief indicators of pollution were DO and TCB. Water quality in the inner Gulf of Thailand, into which the Chao Phraya, Tha Chin, Pak Panang, and Rayong Rivers and several canals discharge, revealed high concentrations of domestic pollutants. Very low DO levels (0.3, 1.8, 3.5 mg/L) were found in the areas of Klong 12 Thanwa, Mae Klong, and Tha Chin. Additionally, TCB and heavy metal levels appeared to be higher than allowable standards in the same areas. In Bang Pakong District the level of total suspended solids (TSS) appeared to be high. The western seaboard generally appeared to have \\"good\\" water quality. However, TCB levels in some areas where domestic waste water discharged into the sea without treatment exceeded the standard. Water quality in most areas of the eastern seaboard was in \\"good\\" condition, except for high levels of total suspended solids and TCB in the areas of Laem Chabang and Map Ta Phut. Despite rapid growth, overall coastal water quality in the Andaman Sea were still in \\"very good\\" condition, except for the few areas that revealed concerns of DO and TCB levels. Water pollution has become obvious in many areas. In 1997, hundreds of thousands of fish and other aquatic life in the Nam Phong River died as a result of industrial pollution. Large amounts of arsenic were found in the groundwater in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, a result of mining in the area. Pollution affects the marine environment. Red tides, caused by excessive algae growth and a result of pollution, oil spills, and invasive species are some of the factors that are affecting Thailand's marine biodiversity. Another major source of pollution are the heavy metals that have seeped into the rivers of Thailand. In the Chao Phraya estuary, mercury levels have far exceeded normal standards, and high concentrations of heavy metals on the river bed pose a serious threat to ecosystems. In March 2017 Associate Professor Thon Thamrongnawasawat, vice dean of the fisheries faculty of Kasetsart University, said, \\"... there is something terribly wrong with the Thai sea [Gulf of Thailand].\\" His observation followed on the deaths of two Bruda whales and two whale sharks in the Gulf of Thailand since the beginning of the year. The latest casualty is a 12-metre Bruda whale weighing about two tonnes. It washed ashore in Village Nine of Tambon Thongchai, Bang Saphan District, Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. Earlier, one six-month old Bruda whale was found dead on the beach of Ban Kung Tanod in Tambon Khao Daeng, Kui Buri District of Prachuap Khiri Khan. Two dead whale sharks that washed ashore in the past 70 days were entangled in ropes. there are only an estimated 100 whale sharks and about 50 Bruda whales remaining in the gulf. Thai coral reefs have been degraded by tourism, sediment from landfills in coastal areas, and polluted water released by beachfront hotels, resorts, and homes. Water contamination is the largest contributor to the degeneration of coral reefs in Thailand, as 70% of polluted water is returned to coastal waters untreated. The damage is exacerbated by plastic trash, which can infect coral and cause long-term harm. , 77% of a total of 107,800 rai of coral reefs in Thai seas is \\"in a sorry state\\". In 2008, the percentage of degraded reefs was 30%. Groundwaters The Thai governmental agency charged with responsibility for groundwater is the Department of Groundwater Resources, part of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. Groundwater is mainly recharged by rainfall and seepage streams. Aquifers yield a large amount of water throughout Thailand, with the exception of the eastern region. The largest source of groundwater is found in the lower central region, particularly in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) and surrounding provinces, and is being used to meet the growing water demand, growing at 10% annually. The depletion of the water table around Bangkok has led to land subsidence which has exacerbated flooding. Agricultural run-off, coastal aquaculture, industrial effluents, and domestic sewage are responsible for the pollution of groundwater in Thailand. Also, the lack of an appropriate pricing policy is leading to over-exploitation of groundwater beyond sustainable yield. There is limited information at the national level on groundwater extraction rates, or the extent of contamination. An on-going case of surface- and groundwater pollution has prompted one critic to charge that, \\"...Thai environmental protection mechanisms including environmental laws and law enforcement are not functioning.\\" He is referring to a case in Ratchaburi Province: there, since at least 2001, villagers of tambon Nam Pu have complained about toxic wastewater from an industrial waste treatment plant they suspected of contaminating their water. Wax Garbage Recycle Centre, an industrial waste treatment plant, began its operation in the upstream area of Nam Pu Creek about the same time as contamination became evident. The pollution spread to tambon Rang Bua of Chom Bueng District. Responding to complaints, the Thai Pollution Control Department tested creek water and groundwater. It found that levels of heavy metals (lead, nickel, and barium) exceeded their standards. They also found high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, benzene, 1,1,2-trichloromethane and Cis-1,2-dichloroethylene. The Department of Industrial Works and Ratchaburi's Industry Office, since 2002, have sent 19 letters ordering the plant to improve its operation, and at least six orders for the plant to shut down parts of its facility. Despite efforts by the authorities, the plant is still in operation and toxic wastewater contamination continues unabated. A failing of Thai environmental governance is the lack of balance in regulatory power among authorities. The Pollution Control Department, for instance, has no power to revoke the plant's operating licences. That power resides with the Department of Industrial Works, but state agencies place greater importance on industrial economics than the environment. Health effects Water pollution results in typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis, trachoma, hookworm, and diarrhea. In 1999, hospitalization rates were: * Typhoid: 4,000 hospitalizations * Dysentery: 7,000 hospitalizations * Diarrhea: 95,000 hospitalizations Exposure to toxins and heavy metals in water causes skin disease, liver cancer, and birth defects. Klity Creek in Kanchanaburi Province was found to carry dangerous levels of lead from a lead separation plant upstream. Lead levels are apparently the cause of many cases of Down syndrome in village children, unidentified illnesses in adults, and many cattle deaths. In 1998, the plant was closed and the creek dredged, although as of 2017 lead levels were still considered unsafe and clean-up efforts continued to be needed. Improvement efforts In 1992, the government passed several pieces of legislation to prevent water pollution. The laws primarily limit industrial water contamination: * Enhancement and Conservation of National Environment Quality Act (NEQA) of 1992 * Factories Act of 1992 * Navigation in Thai Waterways Act (Volume 14 ) as amended in 1992 * Public Health Act of 1992 * Cleanliness and Tidiness of the Country Act of 1992 The government continues to invest in wastewater treatment plants. In 2000, enough treated water was available to support 29% of the population, with more treatment plants under construction. Upon completion, treated water will support 65% of the population. The most common water treatments are inexpensive to build and maintain. They include oxidation ditches, aerated lagoons, and stabilization ponds. The government is also investigating more effective and modern techniques such as constructed wetlands. Wildlife Asian elephants Thailand's wildlife is threatened by poaching, habitat loss, and an industry that sells wild animals as pets. The elephant is Thailand's national symbol. Although there were 100,000 elephants in Thailand a century ago, the population of elephants in the wild has dropped to an estimated 2,000. Poachers have long hunted elephants for ivory, meat, and hides. Young elephants are often captured for use in tourist attractions or as work animals, although their use has declined since the government banned logging in 1989. There are now more elephants in captivity than in the wild, and environmental activists claim that elephants in captivity are often mistreated. Poaching of protected species remains a major problem. Hunters have decimated the populations of tigers, leopards, and other large cats for their valuable pelts. Many animals (including tigers, bears, crocodiles, and king cobras) are farmed or hunted for their meat, which is considered a delicacy, and for their supposed medicinal properties. Although such trade is illegal, the famous Bangkok market Chatuchak is still known for the sale of endangered species. The practice of keeping wild animals as pets threatens several species. Baby animals are typically captured and sold, which often requires killing the mother. Once in captivity and out of their natural habitat, many pets die or fail to reproduce. Affected populations include the Asiatic black bear, Malayan sun bear, white-handed lar, pileated gibbon and binturong. Large-scale deforestation and development have encroached on many former wildlife habitats, and pesticides in their food supply has reduced bird populations. Many species are listed as critically endangered because of habitat loss and over-exploitation. The World Bank estimates that, of 214 countries studied, Thailand ranks ninth (1=worst, 214=best) in the world in the number of mammal species (55 species) under threat. Despite Buddhism's professed reverence for life, even Thai clergy have been guilty of overt animal abuse. One such case, that of Kwan, a Malayan sun bear, egregiously mistreated at Wat Aungsuwan (aka Wat Nong Hoy) in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province has been thoroughly documented by the Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand (WFFT). First alerted to abuse at the temple in January 2012, it was not until three years later that Thai wildlife officials acted on behalf of the mistreated animals. In 2016, the body of the last known dugong in the Gulf of Thailand, identified by marine biologists as DU-391, was found off the coast of Rayong. Number 391 refers to it being the 391st dead dugong to be found there. The decline of vulnerable species in the gulf continued unabated, as 355 protected animals died since January 2016, a 10% increase over 2015. The 355 dead marine animals included 11 dugongs, 180 sea turtles, and 164 dolphins and whales. Conservation in theory Conservation bills passed by the government include: * 1960 Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act * 1961 National Park Act * 1964 National Forest Reserve Act * 1989 Logging ban in natural forests * 1992 Forest Plantation Act * 1992 Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act * 1992 Wild Animals Reservation and Protection Act (WARPA), which forbids or restricts the hunting, breeding, possession, and trade of fifteen reserved animal species and two classes of protected species. Until the acts of 1989–1992, conservation policies were difficult to enforce, and often took a back seat to economic development. These acts represented a major shift in Thai policy, and are part of the government's cooperation with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), an international wildlife protection agreement. The government now requires that at least 15% of its land area be protected as forest, and 22% is currently protected as wildlife sanctuaries or national parks. To enforce CITES, the government also maintains border checkpoints to prevent animal smuggling, and works to educate the public about wildlife preservation. Thailand's Buddhist culture, with its emphasis on respect for all life, has become a key component of the country's conservation efforts. Conservation in practice Current (2015) national law allows for ivory from domesticated Thai elephants to be sold legally. As an unintended consequence, large quantities of African ivory can be laundered through Thai shops. Only by closing the domestic trade in ivory can Thailand help eliminate the threat to African elephants. Thailand's ivory market is the largest in the world and trade is largely fuelled by ivory from poached African elephant's tusks that are smuggled into the country. In July 2014, at a CITES intercessional meeting, Thailand agreed to a strict timetable to address the illegal ivory trade or face the threat of trade sanctions. One week before the meeting, the TRAFFIC had released a survey of Bangkok that found significantly more retail shops and three times as much ivory on sale as in 2013. Thailand was given until 30 September 2014 to submit a revised national ivory action plan, to include a number of CITES specified measures. Thailand was to be next assessed by CITES on 31 March 2015. If found lacking, CITES will vote on whether trade sanctions should be imposed against the country. The impact of punitive sanctions on the national economy would be significant: all trade in CITES-listed species would be prohibited. The export of orchids by the country's horticultural sector, for example, would be stopped, resulting in a loss of more than US$80 million in annual sales based on the 2013 value of this trade. A study published in 2018 by USAID Wildlife Asia said about 500,000 Thais are believed to own ivory products, and 250,000 own artifacts made from tiger parts. At Kanchanaburi's infamous Tiger Temple, nine tiger fangs, more than 1,000 amulets containing tiger skin and dozens of jars filled with dead animals and animal parts were found in a pick-up truck driven out of the Tiger Temple by a monk and two disciples. The temple has profited handsomely from tourism while billing itself as a spiritual organization dedicated to wildlife conservation since it opened in 1994.  Domestic animal welfare  A monk walks a captive tiger at the Tiger Temple. Authorities seized protected birds from the temple in 2015. National Geographic alleged in 2016 that the Buddhist monks there are operating a for- profit breeding, selling, and exploitation business with the enslaved tigers. Thailand introduced its first animal welfare laws in 2014. The Prevention of Animal Cruelty and Provision of Animal Welfare Act came into being on 27 December 2014. The law protects animals \\"raised as pets, as animals for work, as beasts of burden, as friends, as livestock, as performing show animals, or for any other purpose, no matter with or without owners\\". Owners of animals are now required by law to \\"raise, nurture and keep the animals in appropriate conditions with good health and sanitation and with sufficient food and water\\". Within the act, the term \\"owner\\" is deemed to cover all family members and domestic help, as well as any friends assigned to take care of a pet. Menus featuring live vertebrates are now illegal in Thailand. Trading in and consuming dog and cat meat is now illegal in Thailand under the 2014 act. Feeding live prey to snakes, crocodiles or other animals is also prohibited. The act prohibits neglect, torture, or uncaring transport of live animals. Neglect includes improper housing and transportation of animals. An infraction is punishable by law, which may impose a two-year prison term and a fine of up to 40,000 baht (US$1,663), or both. Persons who dump unwanted pets at temples can now be charged with abandoning and endangering the animal. Governmental indifference The National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), the military junta that took power in Thailand in May 2014, has taken a cavalier attitude towards environmental concerns. In early-March 2016, the NCPO issued Order No. 9/2016, designed to cut short the process of conducting environmental impact assessments (EIA) on mega-projects. This makes it possible for state agencies to fast track public projects related to transportation, water management, public health, and prevention of public dangers. The order allows state projects to be proposed to the cabinet before a full EIA is completed. Junta order No.4/2016, signed on 20 March 2016 by Prime Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o- cha in his capacity as the chair of the Committee on National Energy Policy was published in the Royal Thai Gazette on 31 March 2016. It exempts 29 plants, 27 of them run by the state, from all laws related to city planning. The planned construction of coal-fired plants in Thepha District in Songkhla Province and in Nuea Khlong District of Krabi Province have both met with strong opposition from locals who are concerned about their environmental impact. On 22 October 2019, the 26-member National Hazardous Substances Committee (NHSC) changed the hazardous agricultural chemicals paraquat, glyphosate, and chlorpyrifos from Type 3 toxic substances to Type 4, effectively prohibiting their production, import, export, or possession. Their use will be prohibited as of 1 December 2019. On 27 November 2019, the NHSC amended that timetable, moving the date for the ban of paraquat and chlorpyrifos to 1 June 2020. They lifted the ban on glyphosate, albeit with restrictions on usage: glyphosate will be used only on six major crops: corn, cassava, sugarcane, rubber, oil palms, and fruit. It is not permitted in watershed areas and other sensitive environment zones, and farmers must submit proof of use including the type of crops and the size of their farms when purchasing glyphosate. Industry Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit, who chairs the NHSC, said the committee reached its decision after reviewing information provided by the Department of Agriculture and the Ministry of Public Health. NCHS member Jirapon Limpananon, chair of the Pharmacy Council of Thailand, announced her resignation from the NCHS Wednesday night following the meeting. The government's u-turn on the ban of dangerous chemicals prompted a columnist at the Bangkok Post to fume that, \\"...no further proof is required to show how some unscrupulous Thai mandarins are being held hostage by the agro monsters. With a wishy-washy prime minister, who clearly has no political will to make the right decision on this matter, we are indeed in a helpless situation.\\" Intimidation of environmental activists In November 2016, the UN's regional human rights office (OHCHR) condemned Thailand for a series of murders of land activists which have gone unpunished, drawing attention to the kingdom's poor record in solving such killings. The office said it was compelled to speak out after an appeals court in Thailand's south upheld the acquittal of the sole suspect in the murder of an activist in 2015. Thailand has long been a dangerous place in which to take on powerful interest groups. A 2014 report by Global Witness said Thailand was the eighth most dangerous country in the world to be a land rights activist, the second most dangerous in Asia after the Philippines. Rights groups say between 50-60 rights defenders have been murdered in the last 20 years. There are also at least 81 open cases of enforced disappearance dating back as far the mid-1990s, according to the Asian Federation Against Involuntary Disappearances. * On 21 June 2004, Charoen Wat-aksorn was assassinated as he alighted from a bus returning to Prachuap Khiri Khan after he gave testimony about environmental destruction in Bo Nok and Ban Krut to the Senate in Bangkok. Charoen was a human rights defender and leader of the Love Bo Nok group who fought for over ten years until his death against coal-fired power, large-scale shrimp farming, and other environmental destruction in Prachuap Khiri Khan. * Porlajee Rakchongcharoen, known as \\"Billy\\", a Karen environmental activist, was reportedly arrested on 17 April 2014, in Kaeng Krachan National Park in Phetchaburi Province by a park superintendent and four other park officers. He was detained because he was found with a protected wild bee honeycomb and six bottles of honey. He has not been seen since. It is feared that he was murdered because of his activism. Billy's disappearance came three years after he assisted Karen villagers of Pong Luk Bang Kloy to file a lawsuit against the superintendent for ordering the eviction and burning of the village in May 2011. On 30 January 2017, Thailand's Department of Special Investigation (DSI) said that it would not investigate his disappearance, leaving it in the hands of the regular police despite three years of no progress in the case. However, after continued pressure from the Karen community, and especially Billy's wife Pinnapa Prueksapan, the DSI took on the case in April 2019. Possibly their late willingness to investigate was influenced by UNESCO turning down Thailand's application for Kaeng Krachan to be declared a world heritage site due to ongoing conflicts with the indigenous Karen communities. In September 2019 the DSI announced they had found an oil drum containing burned human remains, in a dam near to the area where Billy was last seen. DNA evidence matched Billy's mother and the case was re-classsifed as a murder investigation. * The NGO Global Witness reports that in 2014, four Thai environmental activists were murdered due to their work on local environmental issues. From 2002-2014, Global Witness estimates the total to be 21 deaths. * South Thailand's \\"Southern Peasants Federation\\" (SPF) names four of its members who were murdered between 2010–2015. * The New York Times reports that \\"Thailand is among the world's most dangerous countries in which to oppose powerful interests that profit from coal plants, toxic waste dumping, land grabs or illegal logging. Some 60 people who spoke out on these issues have been killed over the past 20 years,...\\" * On 5 August 2019, a prominent human rights activist, Eakachai Itsaratha, was abducted by ten men as he was entering a mosque to attend a public hearing on a rock quarry project planned for Phatthalung Province. He was taken to a hotel and held against his will until the completion of the hearing. Upon being released he was threatened. He was told not to return to the quarry site in Tamot District again, saying that his activities had adversely affected the quarry project and the process of obtaining permission from the government. Eakachai is secretary-general of Thailand's Non-Governmental Organizations Coordinating Committee on Development for the southern region (NGO COD-South), as well as the former deputy leader of the grassroots-based Commoner Party.

Andalusia's statute of autonomy defines Andalusians as the Spanish citizens who reside in any of the municipalities of Andalusia, as well as those Spaniards who reside abroad and had their last Spanish residence in Andalusia, and their descendants.Wikisource) Article 5 of the 2007 Statute of Autonomy (full text in] Since reform in 2007, the statute identifies the region as a \\"historic nationality\\" in the preamble. The Spanish Language Academy recognizes Andalusian Spanish as a set of diverse dialects. History and culture Arabic influence in Andalucia. Córdoba. The genesis of modern Andalusian culture can be traced to the incorporation of the territory to the Crown of Castile during the Middle Ages at the end of the Reconquista, which brought about a heavily re-settled territory by Castilians, Leonese and others from central and northern regions of Spain and the implementation of Castillian institutions and culture. It also coincides with the arrival of the Romani people in the mid 15th century who also contributed to the culture of modern Andalusia. Subsequently the region was influenced and protagonist of the Columbian exchange and global trade where Seville and Cadiz took a fundamental part. In fact, Blas Infante, the creator of Andalusian regionalism, drew heavily from the Regenerationism movement in Spain after the loss of Spain's last territories in the Caribbean and Asia in the Spanish–American War conflict. There is a binomial denomination of Andalusia as High and Low, where High refers to the territory in the Baetic system and Low to the valley of the Guadalquivir river (that descends from the Baetic system to the Atlantic Ocean). The autonomous community institutions are in a good part in Low Andalusia (Seville). When that has been seen as a source of centrism there have been groups formed to make the problems visible. An example was the lack of a Spanish high speed train to Granada. The service has since launched, starting in 2019. The Andalusians have a rich traditional culture which includes Flamenco style of music and dance developed in Andalusia and the Americas in the 19th and 20th centuries. Another example of traditional culture is the Holy Week (\\"Semana Santa\\"), shared with other hispanic countries in America or Philippines (see Holy Week in Spain, Holy Week observances and Holy Week in the Philippines). Spanish catholic cults constitute a traditional vehicle of Andalusian cultural cohesion and the levels of participation seems to be independent of political preferences and orthodoxy.  Geographical location and population  Andalusian people live mainly in Spain's eight southernmost provinces: Almería, Cádiz, Córdoba, Granada, Huelva, Jaén, Málaga, and Sevilla, which all are part of the region and modern Autonomous Community of Andalucía. In January 2006 the total population of this region stood at 7,849,799; Andalucía is the most populous region of Spain. Instituto de Estadística de Andalucía (2006): Andalucía. Datos básicos 2006. Consejería de Economía y Hacienda, Junta de Andalucía. Page 13 In comparison with the rest of Spain, Andalusia population growth has been slower and it continues to be sparsely populated in some rural areas (averaging just 84 inh. per km2). Since 1960, the region's share of total population has declined, despite birth rates being about 40 percent higher than the Spanish average during past decades (currently it is only 13% higher.) Between 1951 and 1975, over 1.7 million Andalusian people emigrated out of the region to other areas of Spain. This figure was approximately a 24% of the population of Andalusia as a whole, mostly hitting the countryside areas. The main recipients of this migration were Catalonia (989,256 people of Andalusian origin in 1975), Madrid (330,479) and Valencia (217,636), and to a lesser level, the Basque Country and Balearics. During 1962 to 1974, around 700,000 people — almost all of them male — moved abroad for economic reasons, mainly originating from the provinces of Granada, Jaén and Córdoba. Their preferred destinations were France, West Germany and Switzerland, followed by the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Belgium. There are no official recorded figures for previous decades.http://www.ahimsav.com/149-nov_archivos/page0006.htm \\"El boom migratorio exterior\\" In South America in the last twenty years of 19th century, over 150,000 Andalusians emigrated to the Americas as a result of crop failures caused by the Phylloxera plague.De Mateo Aviles, Elias (1993): La Emigración Andaluza a América (1850–1936). Editorial Arguval. Málaga, Spain Many Andalusian peasants moved to Brazil to work in the coffee plantations, mainly in rural areas of São Paulo State. Spanish immigrants to Hawai'i who were solicited to work in the sugar industry, arrived in October 1898, numbering 7,735 men, women and children by 1913. Most of them came from Andalusia, home of Don Marin. However, unlike other plantation immigrant groups, the Spanish moved on, and by 1930 only 1,219 remained, including a scant eight children born in Hawai'i. Most Spanish people left for the promising fields of California to make higher wages and live among relatives and friends who had settled in greater numbers there. Additionally, Andalusians formed the major component of Spanish immigration to certain parts of Spain's American and Asian empire and the largest group to participate in the colonisation of the Canary Islands. Principally, Andalusians and their descendants predominate in the Canary Islands (Spain), the Caribbean islands (Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Cuba), and the circum-Caribbean area (Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, the Caribbean coast of Colombia, and in Venezuela). They were also predominant in the Rio de la Plata region of Argentina and Uruguay and in the coastal areas of Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. In Asia, Andalusians predominated in the Spanish population of the Philippines as evidenced by the strong Andalusian character of the former Spanish in the Philippines and Spanish-based creoles, despite the fact that the Philippines were under the colonial supervision of the Vice-royalty of New Spain (Mexico).  Migration Rationale  Some descriptions of the south of Spain highlights the landownership system, in the past often formed by large states called latifundios, as a relevant force in shaping the region and migratory past dynamics. These wide expanses of land have their origins in landowning patterns that stretch back to Roman times; in grants of land made to the nobility, to the military orders, and to the church during the Reconquest (Reconquista) as well as in laws of the nineteenth century by which church and common lands were sold in large tracts to the urban upper middle class. The workers of this land, called jornaleros (peasants without land), were themselves landless. This economic and cultural system produced a distinctive perspective, involving class consciousness and class conflicts as well as significant emigration. In contrast to the much smaller farm towns and villages of northern Spain, where the land was worked by its owners, class distinctions in the agro-towns of Andalusia stood out. The families of the landless farmers lived at, or near, the poverty level, and their relations with the landed gentry were marked by conflict at times. Conditions were often improved by the opportunities to migrate to other parts of Spain, or to other countries in Western Europe. Some of this migration was seasonal; in 1972, for example, 80,000 farmers, mostly Andalusians, migrated to France for the wine harvest. Part of the migration consisted of entire families who intended to remain in their new home for longer periods, once the head of the family group had settled down. Economic growth and social mobility, although dispersed and not homogeneous in the region, fundamentally started in the 1960s, increased in the 1970s and were intensified by the development of agroindustrial, tourism, and services sectors during democracy in the 1980s. Since 1990 Andalusia and other regions followed a dynamic convergence process and has moved closer in development to the most advanced regions in Europe; more and more it comes closer to overcome the average of European living standards. This has caused that some provinces areas are, in the last decades, net immigration recipients as well.

The war, by some seen as the start of World War II, ended when the Empire of Japan surrendered to the Allies in August 1945. By the end of July 1937, fighting had escalated into a full-scale war and both countries deployed their air forces, ground troops, and warships into combat. Japanese heavy bombers also extensively bombed Chinese factories, airfields and conducted the first major air-raids against civilian targets in the war. At the outset of war, China primarily relied on foreign countries for its military aircraft, but did produce about 100 Hawk II/III fighter-bombers at the Hangzhou-based CAMCO plant. 15 Chinese-American pilots formed the first unofficial volunteer group of pilots and joined front-line air units in China beginning as early as 1932 in anticipation of imminent war with Imperial Japan. These volunteers included future ace-fighter pilots Art Chin, Xinrui \\"Buffalo\\" Huang and John Wong.https://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=947https://acesofww2.com/china/aces/wong/ Both the Soviet Union and the United States came to China's aid by supplying aircraft and providing training to Chinese pilots. Volunteers from the United States and the Soviet Union participated in China's war against Japan, the best known in the West being the American Volunteer Group, better known as the Flying Tigers, which under General Chennault achieved considerable success against the Japanese from late 1941 to mid-1942. 1937 At the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, the Chinese Air Force had 645 combat aircraft, of which about 300 were fighter planes. Japan had 1,530 army and navy aircraft, of which about 400 were deployed in China.Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia Vol. 1, 2000, edited by Walter J. Boyne, (e-book), pp.125-127.Air Warfare: From 1941, many Chinese combat aircraft were US models, and the Chinese pilots were mostly trained by US or US trained aviators. Most of the Chinese fighter squadrons were equipped with the Curtiss BF2C Goshawk (Hawk III) and Curtiss F11C Goshawk (Hawk II), some were equipped with Boeing 281 P-26 Peashooter, British Gloster Gladiator and Italian Fiat CR.32. The air war in China had become a test area for the latest biplane fighter designs confronting the new generation of monoplane fighter and bomber aircraft designs; the world's first aerial combat and kills between modern monoplane fighter would occur in the skies of China. In August 1937 Claire Lee Chennault accepted the offer to become \\"air adviser\\"Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia Vol. 1, 2002, edited by Walter J. Boyne, (e-book), Chennault, p.124.Air Warfare: to Chiang Kai-shek, and to train fighter pilots for the Chinese Air Force. Curtiss F11C Goshawk (Hawk II) in a test flight, 1932 On 14 August 1937 the Chinese Air Force fighter squadrons sortied for the defense of Shanghai and Nanjing, capital of the Republic of China. In the afternoon of 14 August 1937, two groups of nine Japanese Mitsubishi G3M long- range bombers were launched from Japanese-occupied Taiwan on a mission to bomb Jianqiao Airfield in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and Guangde Airfield in Anhui. The 21st and 23rd Squadrons, led by Kao Chih-hang, the Group Commander of the Chinese 4th Pursuit Group, took off from Jianqiao Airfield to intercept the Japanese bombers, despite the fact that some of the fighters had just flown in from Zhoukou and had not been refueled. Kao attacked a G3M bomber and scored a direct hit sending it plummeting to the ground in flames, and he also damaged another G3M bomber; it was the first air-to-air victory for the Chinese Air Force. Meanwhile, three other Hawk IIIs attacked a third G3M bomber and shot it down. The second group of Japanese G3M bombers attacking Guangde Airfield was intercepted by the 22nd Squadron of the 4th Pursuit Group and the 34th Squadron. Squadron Commander Cheng Hsiao-yu of the 22nd Squadron shot up the right engine and the wing fuel tank of one G3M bomber, forcing it to ditch before returning to its air base. The aerial battles in the afternoon of 14 August were a resounding victory for the Chinese Air Force, in which the Chinese Hawk III fighters destroyed four Japanese G3M long-range bombers without losing a single plane to the Japanese. In addition, two G3Ms were also shot down by ground anti-aircraft fire.Sino-Japanese Air War 1937-1945.Operations 1937 On the following day at dawn 15 August, 12 Japanese Type 89 torpedo bombers were intercepted over Hangzhou by 21 Hawk IIIs of the Chinese 4th Pursuit Group led by Group Commander Kao Chi-hang. The Chinese shot down eight bombers. In the afternoon 20 Japanese G3M bombers on a raid to Nanjing were intercepted by 26 Chinese fighters from the 8th, 17th, 28th and 34th Squadrons flying eight Boeing 281 P-26 Peashooters, five Gloster Gladiators, 13 Hawk IIIs and Hawk IIs. The Chinese shot down four and damaged six Japanese G3M bombers. On 16 August, the Japanese launched two raids with a total of 11 Japanese G3M bombers on the airfield near Nanjing; they were intercepted by five Chinese fighters from the 17th and 28th Squadrons. The Chinese shot down three Japanese bombers, and lost three fighters. On 17 August Chinese Hawk III fighters flew 17 sorties shooting down one Japanese bomber; the Chinese lost two aircraft. From 20 August to the end of the month, daily aerial engagements took place between the Chinese and Japanese planes, and the Japanese facing unexpected tenacity from the Chinese pilots, suffered prohibitive losses made worse by the sacrifice of armored protection in exchange for supposed-advantage of lighter-weight and higher-performance of the newer Japanese aircraft designs. In that period the Chinese shot down 24 Japanese planes and lost 11 aircraft. While seeking to better compete against the highly-advanced Mitsubishi A5M fighters of the IJNAF, Colonel Kao Chih- hang on a morale-boosting shakedown of his men and performance-boosting of his machines, had his maintenance crews remove the bomb-racks, fuel tank cowlings, landing lights, etc, to save weight and reduce drag off the Hawks, and on October 12, 1937, he led an aggressive seek-and-destroy mission consisting of six Hawk IIIs, two Boeing P-26/281 \\"Peashooters\\", and a Fiat CR.32 in the opportunity to engage any approaching Japanese fighter aircraft. A group of Mitsubishi A5Ms soon appeared on approach to Nanking and Col. Kao led his group into a melee, where Maj. John Wong Pan-Yang, a Chinese-American volunteer pilot from Seattle flying one of two P-26 \\"Peashooters\\", drew first blood shooting down the A5M piloted by PO1c Mazazumi Ino. Capt. Liu Cuigang shot down another A5M that was sent crashing down into a \\"Mr. Yang's residence in southern Nanking\\", and Colonel Gao scored a double-kill against the A5Ms, including that of shotai leader WO Torakuma, all before jubilant spectators of the city of Nanking.http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_chui-kang.htm This was a monumental moment of air-superiority exhibited by the Chinese pilots due to the great experience of Col. Gao, Maj. Wong and Capt. Liu in particular, as they were outnumbered and yet so convincingly defeated the Japanese fighter group flying the far-more advanced Mitsubishi A5M \\"Claudes\\". http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_wong1.htm In the first four months of the war from July to November 1937, the Chinese Air Force flew 137 sorties, attacking Japanese army positions, and engaged in 57 air battles with Japanese airplanes; the Chinese Air Force shot down 94 Japanese planes and damaged 52 on the ground, but lost 131 aircraft.China and the United States: a new Cold War History, 1998, p.264, edited by Xiaobing Li, Hongshan Li, University Press of America, The Chinese Air Force pilots fought well despite their airfields being under constant Japanese air attacks.

In this initial phase of the war, the outnumbered Chinese had no replacements for their lost planes and experienced pilots killed in action, and began turning to the Soviet Union for new aircraft, while the Japanese were able to replace their lost planes with even more advanced aircraft, and continued to train new pilots.http://www.knowledge-daily.com/view?id=176680 1938-1940 Soviet I-16 fighter plane with Chinese insignia, used by the Chinese Air Force and Soviet volunteers In the period from the end of 1937 to 1940, support from the Americans was in decline, while the Soviet Union became the primary supplier of military aircraft to the Chinese Air Force, supplying 563 fighter planes and 322 bombers. Some of the planes were flown by Soviet volunteer military pilots sent to China. Aircraft provided by the Soviet Union included Tupolev SB twin-engine and Tupolev TB-3 4-engine bombers, and their latest Polikarpov I-15 biplane fighters and Polikarpov I-16 monoplane fighters.Soviet Fighters in the Sky of China (1937-1940), by Anatolii Demin and A.

Together with the US and other foreign planes, the Chinese Air Force had a total of 602 aircraft. By the beginning of 1939, according to Chinese information, the Chinese Air Force had less than 100 aircraft of various types. A new group of 30 USSR I-15s arrived in Lanzhou on 18 July, while 30 USSR I-16s arrived on 3 August 1939. The Chinese Air Force deployed two Martin B-10 bombers led by pilots Capt. Hsu Huan-sheng and 1Lt. Teng Yan-po on 19 May 1938 in an infiltration mission over into Japan for the \\"leaflet bombing\\" of Nagasaki, Fukuoka, Saga, and other cities in the effort to solicit Japanese citizen's moral anti-war solidarity against Imperial Japan's violent aggressions and war crimes in China.https://www.warbirdforum.com/elusive.htm From mid-1938 to mid-1939, Japanese forces intensified their attacks on the front near Lanzhou. The Japanese air units were operating from airfields in Shanxi at the margin of the operating range of their fighters, and their bombers were often not escorted by fighter planes. On 20 February 1939, thirty Japanese bombers flying in 3 formations were intercepted over Lanzhou by 40 USSR volunteer and Chinese fighters taking off in small groups at 5-minute intervals. In the ensuing battle, nine Japanese bombers were shot down, killing 63 crew members, and one USSR pilot was wounded. Three days later on 23 February, the USSR fighters intercepted 57 Japanese bombers on bombing raids to the city and airfield of Lanzhou; the USSR fighters shot down six Japanese bombers and forced the Japanese to abandon the airfield target. In the battles of February, the Chinese pilots of the 17th Squadron fought alongside the USSR volunteers. In March 1939, the Chinese 4th Air Group, comprising 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 24th squadrons, was transferred to the airbase at Guangyangba for the defense of Chongqing. On 3 May, the 4th Air Group led by Group Commander Dong Mingde intercepted 54 Japanese bombers on their bombing raid to Chongqing, and shot down 7 Japanese bombers; deputy squadron commander Zhang Mingsheng (plane R-7153) was shot down and later died of his wounds. On 11 July, Chongqing was bombed by 27 Japanese bombers, which were met by eight I-15s led by Squadron Commander Zheng Shaoyu; Zheng's I-15 (No. 2310) had 38 bullets holes and I-15 (No. 2307) flown by pilot Liang Tianchen was shot down in flames. In December 1939, the USSR fighter group, up to 50 planes under the command of S. P. Suprun was transferred to south Yunnan where Japanese air attacks on communications lines along the Chinese portion of the Burma Road had become more intense. Suprun's group participated in the Battle of South Guangxi, flying missions together with Chinese I-15 fighters from the 4th Air Group, the 27th and 29th Squadrons from the 3rd Air Group, part of the 18th Squadron with Curtiss Hawk 75, and even the 32nd Squadron with the ancient Douglas O-2MC scout/light bombers. The USSR volunteer squadrons often flew their missions together with Chinese squadrons. From the beginning of 1938 to May 1940, USSR squadrons participated in more than 50 major air battles and together with Chinese squadrons shot down 81 Japanese aircraft, damaged 114 and 14 Japanese warships. In the summer of 1940, the USSR withdrew their volunteer pilots, leaving only a small number of advisers and technical personnel in China. They continued to supply aircraft to China until June 1941 when Germany invaded the Soviet UnionArmy Air Forces in WW II: Vol. I, edited by W.F. Craven & J.L. Cate, chapter 14.HyperWar 14 Curtiss Hawk 75, a U.S.-built fighter aircraft of the 1930s Curtiss Hawk 75, a new version of the Curtiss P-36 Hawk flown by Chinese pilots also took an active part in combat but did not achieve any special success. The Chinese 25th Squadron was the first unit to receive the new Hawk 75 and began to train in July 1938 under the direction of Claire Lee Chennault. On 18 August 1938, Squadron Commander Tang Pu-sheng led three Hawk 75s and 7 Polikarpov I-15s to intercept 27 Japanese planes over Hengyang; the Hawk 75s shot down one enemy plane and damaged another. Tang was shot down and killed; the other two Hawk 75s crashed during landing. The 16th Squadron of the 6th Bomber Air Group, having earlier flown the V-92 Corsair light bombers, was changed to a fighter squadron on 1 October 1938 and was sent to Zhiqiang, Hunan, to take possession of nine Hawk 75s. The pilots retrained under the direction of Chennault. At the end of the year, they were redeployed to Yibin, Sichuan, for air defense of the Chinese wartime capital of Chongqing. In January 1939, the squadron flew to Kunming, Yunnan, where it was disbanded in August the same year. Prior to 1 November 1938, the 18th Squadron was also included in the 6th Bomber Air Group, flying the Douglas O-2MC scout/light bombers; it was re-equipped with nine Hawk 75 fighters, and independently began retraining with its Squadron Commander Yang YibaiSino-Japanese Air War 1937-1945.Operations 1939 in Yibin. Douglas O-2, a 1920s American observation and light bomber aircraft In January 1939 the 18th Squadron relocated to Kunming to defend the city from air attacks. On 1 August the squadron was rebased to Chongqing, and in December took part in the Battle of South Guangxi. At the beginning of 1940 it moved to Yunnan for defense of the Kunming-Mengzi railroad, which was subjected to massive air attacks. At the end of May the squadron returned to Chonqing; it did not have enough serviceable Hawk 75s, and was supplemented with nine old Hawk III biplanes from the 22nd Squadron. On 8 February 1940, 27 Japanese planes heading for Mengzi were intercepted at 3.05 pm by three Hawk 75s of the 18th Squadron taking off from Kunming. In the ensuing dogfight, one Hawk 75 (No. 5024) was damaged and forced to crash land; its pilot Yang Tzu-fan was injured. On 13 February 1940 three Hawk 75s of the 18th Squadron intercepted 27 Japanese bombers which were on their way to bomb the bridge near Siulungtam. The Hawk 75s hit one Japanese bomber and were later joined by three I-15 biplane fighters. Together they made many passes at the damaged bomber, killing the upper gunner. The Chinese claimed to have finally shot down the hapless plane. Several of the Chinese planes were slightly damaged and one pilot, Tseng Pei- fu, was injured.Sino-Japanese Air War 1937-1945.Operations 1940 Japanese A6M5 Type 0 Model 52 While the Mitsubishi A5M was the most-advanced fighter in the Chinese theatre since September of 1937, the Japanese were soon to introduce the world's most advanced fighter aircraft into China in the summer of 1940; the Mitsubishi A6M \\"Zero\\". The new Zero was far superior to the A5M predecessor, the Soviet I-16 and American Hawk 75 fighter planes. The Chinese Air Force issued a general directive to its air units to adopt an \\"air dispersal tactics\\", and to avoid direct confrontation with Japanese fighters whenever possible. On 4 October 1940 six Hawk 75s of the 18th Squadron were following the order to disperse to Guanxian when 27 Japanese Mitsubishi G3M bombers escorted by eight Japanese A6M Zeros led by Lieutenant Tamotsu Yokoyama on a bombing raid to Chengdu. The Japanese Zeros caught up with the Hawk 75s and shot one down, wounding the pilots of another two and forcing them to crash land, and set two Hawk 75s on fire on the ground while refueling.Unceretain Wings: Curtiss Hawk 75 in China, 2008, by Richard L. Dunn, (It gives a slightly different account of 4 Oct).Uncertain Wings: By December 1940 the 18th Squadron had ceased to exist in reality, and was disbanded in January 1941. The Hawk 75 fighters in the Chinese Air Force were later replaced by the American Curtiss P-40. 1941 After withdrawing its volunteer pilots from China in the summer of 1940, the Soviet Union continued to supply aircraft to China until June 1941. Fighting continued on the northern front near Lanzhou, which was the Chinese terminus of the Chinese- Soviet transportation route. Chinese pilots were left to defend the northern front against Japanese air attacks. On 21 May 1941 eight I-15s of the 21st Squadron and one I-15 from the 29th Squadron flying in 2 formations on patrol encountered 27 Japanese bombers over Lanzhou. The first group of I-15s led by Squadron Commander Chen Sheng-hsing shot down one of the Japanese Mitsubishi G3M long range bombers and damaged another.Sino-Japanese Air War 1937-1945 Operations 1941 On 22 May, 25 Japanese G3M bombers from the unit of Mihoro Kōkūtai were on a morning raid on Lanzhou. Seven Chinese I-16s of the 24th Pursuit Squadron and one Tupolev SB bomber of the 9th Bomb Squadron were ordered to disperse. Due to bad weather, the I-16s landed at Chung Chuan Chun Airfield just north of Lanzhou. As the Japanese bombers were sighted overhead, one of the I-16s flown by Kao You-hsing having just landed with the engine still running, took off to attack the Japanese planes, and shot down a G3M bomber flown by Lieutenant Shin-Taro Hashimoto and damaged another. The remaining six I-16s were able to take off and dispersed. On 26 May, Japanese fighters encountered 18 I-15s from the 29th Pursuit Squadron flying from Gansucheng to Lanzhou; two I-16s were shot down, both pilots bailing out, and the other 16 I-16s were destroyed on the ground when they landed for refuelling. Lin Heng (a brother of Lin Huiyin) was KIA along with ace pilots Capt Shen Tse-Liu and Maj Wong Sun-Shui in an air battle over Chengdu in 1941.https://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=947 Since World War II erupted in Europe on 1 September 1939 after Nazi Germany invaded Poland, the United States had maintained its neutrality until the unannounced Japanese air attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.Pearl Harbour Attack on Pearl Harbor In October 1940, China appealed to American president Franklin D. Roosevelt to allow the sale of military aircraft to China and the recruitment of American pilots for the resistance war against the Japanese invasion. In December, Washington approved China's request to recruit American pilots who would resign from U.S. military services and volunteer to serve in the Chinese Air Force. On 11 March 1941, the U.S. passed the Lend-Lease Act,Lend-Lease Act Lend-Lease which permitted the U.S. government to provide war equipment and material to Britain, France and other allied countries. In April, this policy was extended to China as well. Lockheed Hudson Mk V In August 1941, American Lockheed Hudson A-29 bombers arrived in China (22 planes turned over to Chinese Air Force). The Chinese 9th and 30th Bomber Squadrons were re-equipped with the Hudson A-29. In October 1941 the 9th Bomber Squadron was combat ready and flew bombing missions on Yuncheng, Shanxi, Hankou and other Japanese-occupied cities in China. The American Volunteer Group, better known as the Flying Tigers, was officially formed on 1 July 1941, consisting of three squadrons of 30 planes each under the direct control and command of Claire Lee Chennault. In August, through the efforts of Chennault, 100 American volunteer pilots and about 200 mechanics and ground personnel were recruited. Curtiss-Wright Company also agreed to provide China 100 Curtiss Tomahawk P-40Bs, which had previously been rejected by Britain and later allocated to Sweden. Curtiss P-40E at the National Museum of the United States Air Force The Flying Tigers began to train in September 1941 in Taungoo, Burma, and with the help of the high speed and heavy armament (six 12.7mm machine guns) of the P-40 Warhawks and dissimilar air combat tactics against the dangerously nimble, though lightly armored Japanese fighters, the Flying Tigers saw immediate success. On 12 December 1941 the 3rd Squadron stationed in Rangoon joined the British Royal Air Force in defense of Rangoon. The 1st and 2nd Squadrons were sent to Kunming on 18 December, guarding Kunming and the Chinese section of the Burma Road against Japanese air attacks. On 20 December, the Flying Tigers saw their first actionThe Flying Tigers – A Brief History with Recollections and Comments by General Claire L. Chennault The Flying Tigers in the skies of Kunming when the 1st and 2nd Squadrons intercepted a formation of Japanese planes on a bombing raid; the Flying Tigers shot down nine of ten Japanese bombers and lost one P-40. Three days later, the Flying Tigers' 3rd Squadron inflicted comparable damage on a formation of Japanese planes on a bombing raid to Rangoon. For the next six months, the aerial battles of the Flying Tigers' P-40s with Japanese fighter and bomber aircraft were regular sights in the skies over south Yunnan and Burma. When Rangoon fell to Japanese forces in early March 1942, Chennault withdrew all Flying Tigers squadrons to the base at Kunming. The Japanese fighter aircraft were more maneuverable as compared to the Flying Tigers's P-40. However, the Flying Tigers' pilots were able to take advantage of the fast diving speed and heavy firepower of their P-40s to gain an advantage over the lighter Japanese fighters. The American Volunteer Group was officially disbanded on 4 July 1942 when its one-year contract expired. The Group celebrated its final day by shooting down five Japanese fighters over Hengyang and escorting B-25 bombers of the United States Army Air Forces to bomb the Japanese air base at Guangzhou. In the short period of some six months from 20 December 1941 to the beginning of July 1942, the Flying Tigers had flown on more than 50 combat missions, destroying 299 Japanese planes including bombers, Nakajima Ki-43 fighters, and 153 probables; the Flying Tigers lost 12 planes in air battles and 61 on the ground; 13 pilots were killed and three were captured as prisoners of war. Those were incredible records in aerial combat. However, the Japanese immediate voiced their discontent with the American tactics through their English-language propaganda broadcasts by Tokyo Rose, who called the Americans \\"cowards\\", and continuously challenged the American pilots to \\"stop running away\\" (to the general amusement of the American pilots who tuned in to her broadcasts). 1942 By the time the American Volunteer Group was officially disbanded on 4 July 1942, the United States had been a combatant in World War II for nearly seven months. Chennault was recalled to active duty in the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF); he was promoted to brigadier general to take command of the China Air Task Force (CATF), which was established on 14 July 1942 as a part of the 10th Air Force of USAAF. The 10th Air Force was activated on 12 February 1942 for operations in the China-Burma-India theatre of the war. Later in June 1942, Chennault was given the command of the 10th Air Force after the transfer of Commanding General Lewis Brereton to Egypt on 6 June 1942. The CATF included the four squadrons of P-40s of the 23rd Fighter Group and the 11th Bomber Group of B-25 Mitchells. Many of the fighter pilots in the CATF were former pilots of the Flying Tigers. USAAF Republic P-43 Lancer One of the aircraft contracts to be funded by the American Lend-Lease was to supply China with 125 P-43 Lancer fighter planes.Republic P-43 Lancer in Chinese service P-43 Lancer In early 1942, shipments began of the P-43s in crates to China via Karachi, India, and they included some Vultee P-66 Vanguard fighters. The 4th Air Group of the Chinese Air Force was selected to receive and ferry the P-43s from India to Kunming. Many were lost in test flights and ferrying accidents. By August 1941, according to Chinese sources, the Chinese Air Forces received 41 operable P-43s. The 4th Air Group was sent to Chengdu to train on the new P-43s, and joined in the defense of Chengdu with the I-15s of the 17th Squadron and I-16s of the 29th Squadron. During the first half of 1942, there were few combat operations by pilots of the Chinese Air Force. As of 13 August 1942, Chennault's CATF had also received five P-43s with five more promised. At this time, the CAFT consisted of 56 operational fighters, including P-40Bs, P-40Es and a few P-43s in four squadrons (the 16th, 74th, 75th and 76th) and eight B-25Cs of the 11th Bomb Squadron at Kunming, Guilin, Hengyang and Yunnan. On 3 September, a P-43 flown by Lieutenant Martin Cluck of the 75th Squadron had to abort a reconnaissance mission due to mechanical trouble, Japanese fighters attacked him at low altitude near the air base and riddled his P-43. Cluck landed safely and escaped from his aircraft, but the P-43 was destroyed by Japanese strafing. One P-40 was also destroyed on the ground. On 27 October 1942, 12 P-43s of the Chinese Air Force flying from Taipingsi, Sichuan, escorted nine A-29 Hudsons in a raid on Yungcheng, Shanxi. They destroyed one Japanese aircraft on the ground without suffering losses. In November, a mission of A-29 Hudsons was flown with escorts of P-66 Vanguards. In November, another bombing mission were flown escorted by P-43s. On 27 November, a bombing mission of A-29s was joined by Soviet SB bombers; in this mission one A-29 and three SB bombers were lost due to bad weather. On 30 December, three P-43s and six P-40s from the CATF flew an escort mission to Lashio, Burma; the P-43s provided top cover to the P-40s, enabling the P-40s to claim one of the six Japanese fighters encountered. 1943 On 10 March 1943, Claire Lee Chennault was promoted to Major General, taking command also of the 14th Air Force, that was newly formed on 5 March 1943. On 19 March 1943, the CATF was incorporated into the United States Army as the 14th Air Force. The 10th and 14th Air Forces became the major American combat forces in the China-Burma-India theatre. The 14th Air Force took on the name of Flying Tigers. In the eight-month operations of the CATF from July 1942 to March 1943, they shot down 145 Japanese planes and 85 probables, and flew 65 bombing missions; they lost 16 P-40s and one B-25 Mitchell bomber. USAAF P-47D \\"Razorback\\" a vast improvement over the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, its predecessor In May 1943, the Japanese launched a ground offensive advancing into the area of Dongting Lake in northeastern Hunan and the region of the Yangtze River feeding to the lake. The objectives of the offensive were to secure the communication line and capture the fertile Chinese \\"Rice Bowl\\" region. To counter the Japanese offensive, both the 14th Air Force and the Chinese Air Force's 4th Air Group flying P-40s and P-43s provided air support to the Chinese ground troops. The 4th Group went into action on 19 May with 8 P-40Es and 4 P-43s escorting A-29 Hudson bombers over the enemy positions. On this mission, the Deputy Group Commander Xu Baoyun, flying a P-40E, was shot down by anti-aircraft gunfire. On 31 May Lieutenant-Colonel John Alison, an American ace and two USAAF wingmen led seven P-40s from the 4th Air Group escorting nine B-24 bombers to Yichang; Alison's P-40 was badly shot up by Captain Ohtsubo Yasuto, leader of the 1st Chutai (squadron) of the 33rd FR. Lieutenant Tsang Hsu-Lan, nicknamed \\"Bulldog\\" (plane No. 2304) of the 4th Group shot down Ohtsubo, saving Alison's life. Tsang was awarded the American Silver Star as well as China's highest decoration. On 6 June, eight Japanese light bombers escorted by 14 fighters were on a raid on Liangshan. 13 P-40s from the Chinese Air Force led by Colonel Li Hsiang-yang were returning to Liangshan from a mission. Having just landed, Captain Chow Chin-kai, commander of the 23rd Squadron and veteran of many years combat ran from his P-40 to a P-66 parked nearby, and took off to attack the Japanese formation. While the Japanese fighters were strafing the airfield, Chow attacked the bombers and destroyed three. Despite Chow's heroic act, 12 P-40s and one fleet trainer were destroyed on the ground. Chow received the Blue-Sky-White-Sun (Chinese Nationalist emblem) award personally from Chiang Kai-shek. A Soviet Tupolev SB-2 bomber of the Finnish Air Force By June 1943, the ground operations on the front of the \\"Rice Bowl\\" campaign were stabilized. In that campaign from 19 May to 6 June 1943, the Chinese Air Force flew on 336 fighter sorties and 88 bombing missions. The \\"Rice Bowl\\" campaign took its toll on the Chinese Air Force, which suffered heavy losses in combat and on the ground. At the end of the campaign the Chinese Air Force units numbered no more than a total of 77 combat aircraft, including seven A-29s, ten SBs, five P-40Es, nine P-43s and 46 P-66s, and of the total only 59 were serviceable. In May, the 14th Air Force received about 50 new P-40K, P-40M and P-40A fighters, and high-altitude Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters in July, phasing out the old P-40s. From July to September 1943, Japanese air units carried out concentrated attacks in three consecutive phases each targeting on a different area. The first phase from 22 July to 22 August concentrated on American air bases centered on Guilin, resulting in 50 American planes destroyed by the Japanese. The second phase began on 23 August, in which they targeted their attacks on Chongqing, Chengdu and eastern China air bases. At dawn on 23 August, 21 bombers escorted by 17 fighters took off from Hankou and were joined en route by another 14 fighters to strike an arsenal just to the west of Chongqing. A total of 29 fighters including ten P-40s, eight P-43s and 11 P-66s of the Chinese Air Force from the 4th and 11th Group at Peishiyi Airfield scrambled and took to the air to intercept. A flight of American fighters also scrambled from a distant air base but was too far to intercept. In the ensuing battle, the Japanese shot down two P-66s, one each of the P-40s and P-43s, and lost one bomber. The Chinese reported to have shot down three Japanese fighters and five bomber probables. In the third phase beginning in September, the Japanese resumed their attacks on targets in Guilin and Yunnan. North American B-25 Mitchell Medium bomber As a part of the 14th Air Force, Chennault created a special unit known as the Chinese-American Composite Wing (CACW) under his command. The CACW comprised the 1st Bomber Group, and the 3rd and 5th Fighter Groups with American pilots, and Chinese pilots from the Chinese Air Force, as well as American and Chinese ground crews. Since many of the Chinese pilots were young pilots of the Chinese Air Force, who had recently returned after completion of their training in the United States, lacking any combat experience, the unit was under an American commander, assisted by a staff of Chinese officers. The CACW was officially formed on 31 July 1943, and activated on 1 October 1943.CBI Order of Battle 14th AF Units CACW The newly formed CACW were sent to Karachi, India, where they were re-equipped with B-25s and new P-40Ns, and trained under American supervision. On 25 November 1943, six B-25s from the 2nd Bomber Squadron of the CACW took off from Guilin at 6 am and staged through Suichwan, where they were refueled and joined by eight B-25s of the 11th Bomber Squadron and 16 fighter escorts of P-38s and P-51s from the 23rd Fighter Group of the 14th Air Force to attack Japan's largest air base in Taiwan, hitting a parking area, hangars, barracks, and buildings. The formation crossed the Taiwan Strait, flying at low altitude and caught the Japanese unprepared. 32 Japanese planes were destroyed in the air and on the ground while the Chinese did not lose a single plane. Seeing no opposing interceptors and only minimum anti-aircraft gun fire, Lieutenant Colonel Irving Branch of the CACW led his flight of bombers on a sweep down low strafing the airfield. The raid was the most successful thus far in the history of the 14th Air Force. Branch was awarded a Distinguish Flying Cross.Sino-Japanese Air War 1937-1945 Operations 1943 1944 From late 1943 to the end of the war in August 1945, operations of the combined forces of the American and Chinese air units began to shift increasingly from defensive to offensive, and they eventually achieved air supremacy in China over Japanese air forces. It was made possible by the Americans' continuous supply of the latest war planes, fuel and material to China, and more importantly, the activation of the CACW as a unique Chinese component of the U.S. 14th Air Force, which was deployed in the China-Burma-India theatre, as well as the training by Americans of young Chinese pilots in the United States. From 1944 onward, the CACW and other units of the Fourteenth Air Force were able to mount attacks against Japanese forces on all fronts in China, military installations, airbase in Taiwan, vital terminals of Japanese supply lines, which included Japanese-occupied river ports along the lower Yangtze River and Yellow River, seaports in southern China including Hong Kong and Hainan. A U.S. formation of P-38 Lightnings Separate missions were often flown daily by the CACW and other units of the 14th Air Force from different airbases with B-25 and B-24 bombers, P-40, P-38 and P-51 fighters. The following are some of the notable bombing missions and air combat on records during 1944.Sino- Japanese Air War 1937-1945.Operations 1944 USAF in WWII: Combat Chronology USAF WWII Combat On 11 February, six B-25 bombers escorted by 20 P-40 and P-51 fighters from the 14th Air Force including Chinese P-40s from the 32nd Fighter Squadron of the CACW bombed the storage area at Kai Tak Airfield, Hong Kong. The incoming formation encountered Japanese fighters from the 85th Sentai patrolling the area. In the ensuing air engagement the P-40s shot down five Japanese fighters and one probable, while the Japanese shot down one B-25, four P-40s and two P-51s and two probable fighters. On 9 March, 18 CACW B-25s escorted by 24 P-40s bombed a foundry and floating docks at Huangshi in Hubei. They were intercepted by Japanese fighters from the 25th and 9th Sentai and lost 2 P-40s. On 10 March, 2 bombers from the 2nd Bomber Squadron of the CACW bombed Japanese ships on the lower Yangtze; on returning flight one B-25 ran out of fuel and crash-landed killing its crew. On the same day, B-25s of the 14th Air Force escorted by P-38s attacked the river port at Anqing in Anhui. They sank a motor launch, damaged two cargo vessels and a barge; one of the Japanese intercepting fighters from the 25th Sentai flown by Moritsugu Kanai shot down one P-38. On 29 March, 12 P-40s and three P-51s from the 14th Air Force attacked the railroad station area at Nanchang, and strafed the airfield and attacked a nearby bridge. Corporal Yasuzo Tanaka (Ki-44 Shoki-11) of the 25th Sentai was killed in Nanchang. A Japanese Ki-43-IIa Army Type 1 fighter On 5 April, 26 Japanese A6Ms from the Sanya and Kaiko Kōkūtai took off from Hainan and carried out a major attack on Nanning in Guangxi; they destroyed two B-25s and three P-40s on the ground, and shot down nine P-40s (two unconfirmed), while eight A6Ms were shot down and their pilots killed. By mid April, various Japanese air units had suffered heavy losses and had been replenished. The 25th Sentai was brought up to full strength with young pilots from Japan. On 28 April, 26 B-24s from the 14th Air Force escorted by ten P-51 fighters carried out a bombing mission on the storage area north of Zhengzhou at the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The Japanese warning radar at Kaifeng was out of order, and the 9th Sentai stationed at Xinxiang with 10 Ki-44s failed to intercept. The B-24s pounded the storage area and damaged the Bawangcheng Bridge and another bridge on Yellow River. On 3 May, seven B-25s of the CACW bombed Mihsien and hit numerous vehicles and Japanese troops northeast of Mihsien near Yueyang in northeastern Hunan, and strafed the town of Hsiangcheng. On the same day, ten CACW P-40s hit and damaged a bridge on the Yellow River northwest of Chenghsien near Luoyang, and destroyed 15 trucks and many troops. On 2 June in a battle at China's Central Plain, seven P-40Ns from the 7th fighter Squadron of the CACW made an attack on an airfield at Zhengzhou where a Japanese air transport unit was based. Seven Japanese K-44 fighters of the 9th Sentai led by Captain Kobayashi intercepted the Chinese P-40Ns, and shot down five, including the one flown by the Flight Commander Zhang Lemin. The 9th Sentai lost one flown by Sergeant Fumio Oguri over Bawangcheng. A U.S. fighter formation of P-51 Mustangs On 12 June, about 100 P-40s and P-51s from the 14th Air Force attacked numerous supply boats and other river and lake traffic in the Dongting Lake area, and hit docks and warehouses at Yuanjiang, and also villages and troops in Changsha. On 28 August, 32 P-40s from the 14th Air Force, including 11 from the 5th Fighter Squadron of the CACW, attacked the Japanese air base at Pailuchi and targets of opportunity at Hengyang. They were intercepted by Japanese K-43s from the 48th Sentai and Ki-84s from the 22nd Sentai. In the air battle, the Japanese destroyed one Chinese and three American P-40s while the CACW shot down six enemy planes; one of the pilots from the 49th Sentai reportedly parachuted from his burning Ki-84 but drowned in the Yangtze River. On 29 August, 13 P-40s from the 3rd Fighter Group of the CACW bombed and strafed shipping and dock facilities at Shayang in Hubei. After the attack, they were intercepted by 21 Japanese fighters near Jiayu. The CACW claimed a total of seven victories with Group Commander Lieutenant Colonel Bill Reed and his wingman Lieutenant Tan Kun each shooting down one Ki-43, and the other Chinese P-40s claiming five Japanese fighters. Commander Meng Shao-yi of the 28th Squadron of the CACW was shot down and killed. On 29 August around 1 pm, 13 Japanese Ki-84s from the 22nd Sentai and 16 Ki-43s from the 25th Sentai, a total of 29 fighters engaged a large number of B-24s, P-40s and P-51s of the 14th Air Force near Yueyang in northeastern Hunan. The Japanese shot down four P-40s and one P-51, and damaged four B-24s, four P-40s and one P-51, and lost one Ki-43 and one Ki-84, and suffered damage on one Ki-84. Consolidated B-24D Liberator Heavy bomber On 12 September, two separate groups from the 5th Fighter Group of the CACW engaged in air battles over northeastern Hunan. First Lieutenant Phil Colman of the 26th Squadron claimed one damaged Ki-43, and his wingman Lieutenant Yang Shaohua claimed one Ki-43 shot down over Xiangtan; Colman further claimed one Ki-43, two damaged Ki-43s and a probable \\"Hamp\\" (A6M Type Zero) over Changsha. Another group of eight P-40s fought 12 Japanese fighters including six Ki-84s over Hengshan just south of Xiangtan; Captains Reynolds and Ramsey each claimed a damaged Japanese fighters, but Lieutenant Tom Brink was shot down while strafing, and one P-40 flown by Lieutenant Su Yinghai was badly damaged and written off after returning to base. On 26 October B-24s and B-25s of the 14th Air Force attacked shipping off the east Leizhou Peninsula situated opposite to Hainan in the South China Sea. Major Horace S. Carswell Jr. of the 308th Bomber Group was awarded the Medal of Honour for his action on that day when he attacked a Japanese convoy in the South China Sea under intense anti-aircraft fire. His B-24, No. 44-40825 (MARC 9612) was so badly damaged that when his plane reached over land, he ordered the crew to bail out. One crew member could not jump because his parachute had been ripped by flak, so Carswell remained with the aircraft to try to save the crew member by attempting to crash land. Before Carswell could attempt a crash landing, the bomber struck a mountainside and burned. By the end of 1944, the continued bombings and attacks on Japanese supply lines and storage facilities in Japanese-occupied China had caused a severe shortage of fuel greatly hampering the operations of Japanese air units. The American and Chinese air forces in China had inflicted heavy losses to the Japanese air forces operating in China, and forced the Japanese to adopt a defensive stance. 1945 On 28 January 1945, the Burma Road was fully restored as a land transport route for war material supplied to China by the Allies. It had been cut off when Japanese invaded Burma in 1942, leaving available only the air supply route over \\"The Hump\\", from Assam, India, over the eastern end of the Himalayas. The re-opening of the Burma Road greatly increased the supply of aircraft, spare parts, fuel and other war material as required for the successful prosecution of the war. In the beginning of 1945, the total numbers of the Chinese and American air forces exceeded 800 aircraft. During the concluding period of the war from January to June 1945, the Chinese pilots and their American counterparts participated actively in battles supporting ground forces on all fronts in central, southern and eastern China.Sino-Japanese Air War 1937-1945.Operations 1945 The CACW unofficial combat record in the time from its activation on 1 October 1943 to the end of the war in August 1945 included 190 Japanese aircraft destroyed in the air, 301 on the ground. At the same time, they lost 35 fighters and eight bombers to enemy ground fire, and 20 fighters to Japanese aircraft. However, not a single CACW bomber was lost to enemy fighters, a tribute to the abilities of the Wing's B-25 aircrews, and the quality of the escort protection provided by the Wing's fighter pilots. The CACW produced five American air aces and three Chinese air aces, and was disbanded on 19 September 1945. The following are some of the notable air operations in 1945. On 5 January a combined group of 28 P-40N and P-51D fighters from the 14th Air Force flew from Laohekou in Hubei to attack the Japanese airfield at Wuhan, destroying 50 Japanese aircraft in the air and on the ground. One Chinese pilot was shot down and killed in the air battle. On 9 March about 50 fighters and bombers from the 14th Air Force on armed reconnaissance attacked railroad targets, river and road traffic, bridges, gun positions, and troops at several locations, particularly around Guiyi, Hengyang, Nanjing and Xinyang. On 10 March about 60 fighters and bombers from the 14th Air Force hit targets in rivers, on roads and railroads, gun positions, warehouses, airstrips, and troops around Xinyang, Yiyang, Changsha, Qiyang, Yueyang, Hengyang in Hunan, and Hankou, and Wuchang in the neighboring Hubei province. On 16 March, 32 B-24s from the 14th Air Force escorted by 10 P-51s pounded the north railroad yards at Shijiazhuang. On 15 April, about 200 fighters and bombers from the 14th Air Force attacked Japanese targets in areas from southern China to the northern China plain hitting numerous targets including bridges, river shipping, town areas, trucks, railroad traffic, gun positions, storage areas, and general targets of opportunity. On 8 May, Japanese forces moved the bulk of their 5th Kokugun to Korea. It involved the relocation of some 10,000 ground support personnel, leaving a skeleton of air units in China. The move was completed by the end of the month with only minor losses. On 10 August, about 50 P-47s and P-51s from the 14th Air Force attacked river and railroad targets, troops, trucks, and bridges at several points in southern and eastern China. On 15 August, Japan's unconditional surrender was announced, and all offensive operations against Japan ended. On 18 August, the vice-commander of the 24th Pursuit Squadron from the Chinese Air Force, Guo Fengwu flew over Guisui (known as Hohhot after 1954) in Inner Mongolia to drop leaflets which contained the text of Japanese Emperor Hirohito's surrender decree.

It can be recognized by its distinctive pale green cap that measures up to in diameter, the surface of which is covered with darker green angular patches. It has crowded white gills, and a firm, white stipe that is up to tall and thick. Considered to be one of the best edible mushrooms of the genus Russula, it is especially popular in Spain and China. With a taste that is described variously as mild, nutty, fruity, or sweet, it is cooked by grilling, frying, sautéeing, or eaten raw. Mushrooms are rich in carbohydrates and proteins, with a low fat content. The species was described as new to science in 1774 by Jacob Christian Schaeffer. Its distribution encompasses Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America. Its presence in North America has not been clarified, due to confusion with the similar species Russula parvovirescens and R. crustosa. R. virescens fruits singly or scattered on the ground in both deciduous and mixed forests, forming mycorrhizal associations with broadleaf trees such as oak, European beech, and aspen. In Asia, it associates with several species of tropical lowland rainforest trees of the family Dipterocarpaceae. R. virescens has a ribonuclease enzyme with a biochemistry unique among edible mushrooms. It also has biologically active polysaccharides, and a laccase enzyme that can break down several dyes used in the laboratory and in the textile industry.  Taxonomy  1898 illustration by Louis Charles Christopher Krieger Russula virescens was first described by German polymath Jacob Christian Schaeffer in 1774 as Agaricus virescens. The species was subsequently transferred to the genus Russula by Elias Fries in 1836. According to the nomenclatural authority MycoBank, Russula furcata var. aeruginosa (published by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1796) and Agaricus caseosus (published by Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth in 1883) are synonyms of Russula virescens. The variety albidocitrina, defined by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1876, is no longer considered to have independent taxonomic significance. According to Rolf Singer's 1986 classification of Russula, R. virescens is the type species of subsection Virescentinae in section Rigidae, a grouping of mushrooms characterized by a cap surface that breaks into patches of bran-like (furfuraceous) particles. In a molecular phylogenetic analysis of European Russula, R. virescens formed a clade with R. mustelina; these two species were sister to a clade containing R. amoenicolor and R. violeipes. The specific epithet virescens is Latin for \\"becoming green\\". The characteristic pattern of the cap surface has earned the species common names such as the green-cracking russula, the quilted green russula, and the green brittlegill. In the mid- Atlantic United States, it is also known locally as the moldy russula.  Description  Described by mushroom enthusiast Antonio Carluccio as \\"not exactly nice to look at\\", the cap is at first dome or barrel-shaped, becoming convex and flattened with age with a diameter of up to . The cap center is often depressed. The cuticle of the cap is green, most profoundly in the center, with patches of the same color dispersed radially around the center in an areolate pattern. The color of the cuticle is often of variable shade, ranging from gray to verdigris to grass-green. The extent of the patching of the cuticle is also variable, giving specimens with limited patches a resemblance to other green-capped species of Russula, such as R. aeruginea. The green patches of the cap lie on a white to pale green background. The cap, while frequently round, may also exhibit irregular lobes and cracks. The cap cuticle is thin, and can be readily peeled off the surface to a distance of about halfway towards the cap center. The gills are white to cream colored, and fairly crowded together; they are mostly free from attachment to the stipe. Gills are interconnected at their bases by veins. The stipe is cylindrical, white, and of variable height, up to tall and wide; it is roughly the same thickness at both the top and the base. The top portion of the stipe may be farinose—covered with a white, mealy powder. It may turn slightly brown with age, or when it is injured or bruised from handling. Like other mushrooms in the Russulales, the flesh is brittle, owing to the sphaerocyst cytoarchitecture—cylindrical cells that contrast with the typical fibrous, filamentous hyphae present in other orders of the basidiomycota. Spores are translucent and warted. The spores of R. virescens are elliptical or ellipsoid with warts, translucent (hyaline), and produce a white, pale or pale yellow spore print; the spore dimensions are 6–9 by 5–7 µm. A partial reticulum (net- like pattern of ridges) interconnects the warts. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped and have dimensions of 24–33 by 6–7.5 µm; they are colorless, and each hold from two to four spores. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are 40–85 by 6–8 µm and end abruptly in a sharp point.  Similar species  Russula parvovirescens, found in the eastern United States, can be distinguished from R. virescens by its smaller stature, with caps measuring wide and stipe up to long by thick. Compared to R. virescens, it tends to be more bluish-green, the patches on its cap are larger, and it has a lined cap margin. Microscopically, the terminal cells in the cap cuticle of R. parvovirescens are more swollen than those of R. virescens, which has tapered and elongated terminal cells. Another green-capped Russula is R. aeruginea, but this species may be distinguished from R. virescens by its smaller size and smooth cap. Other green russulas with a smooth cap include R. heterophylla and R. cyanoxantha var. peltereaui. Russula crustosa, like R. virescens, also has an areolate cap, but the cap becomes sticky (viscid) when moist, and its color is more variable, as it may be reddish, yellowish, or brown. Also, the spore print of R. crustosa is a darker yellow than R. virescens. R. redolens has a cap that is \\"drab-green to blue-green\\", but unlike R. virescens, is smooth. R. redolens has an unpleasant taste and smells of parsley.  Edibility  Despite its \\"moldy\\" appearance, R. virescens is a good edible mushroom. Russula virescens is an edible mushroom considered to be one of the best of the genus Russula, and is popular in Europe, particularly in Spain. In an 1875 work on the uses of fungi, English mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke remarked about the mushroom that \\"the peasants about Milan are in the habit of putting [it] over wood embers to toast, and eating [it] afterwards with a little salt.\\" The mushroom is often sold as a dried product in Asia; in China, it can be found in roadside markets, and used in traditional herbal medicines.Ying, J., et al. \\"Icones of medicinal fungi from China, Yuehan X, trans.\\" (1987). Its smell is not distinctive, but its taste has been described as mild, nutty, fruity, or even sweet. Old specimens may smell of herrings. Drying the mushrooms enhances the nutty flavor. Mushrooms can be sautéed (the green color disappears with cooking), and young specimens that are prepared this way have a potato taste that pairs well with shallots. They are also fried or grilled, or used raw in salads. Young specimens are pale and can be hard to identify, but the characteristic pattern of older fruit bodies makes them hard to confuse with other species. When collecting R. virescens for consumption, caution is of vital importance to avoid confusion with the dangerously poisonous Amanita phalloides (better known as the death cap), a mushroom that can be most easily identified by its volva and ring. The nutritional components of R. virescens mushrooms have been characterized. Fresh mushrooms contain about 92.5% moisture. A sample of dried mushroom (100 g dw) has 365 kcal (1527 kilojoules). Carbohydrates make up the bulk of the fruit bodies, comprising 62% of the dry weight; 11.1% of the carbohydrates are sugars, the large majority of which (10.9%) is mannitol. The total lipid, or crude fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of fatty acids (expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids) are 28.78% saturated, 41.51% monounsaturated, and 29.71% polyunsaturated. The most prevalent fatty acids include: palmitic acid, 17.3% of total fatty acids; stearic acid, 7.16%; oleic acid, 40.27%; and linoleic acid, 29.18%. Several bioactive compounds are present in the mushroom. One hundred grams (dry weight) contains 49.3 micrograms (µg) of tocopherols (20.0 µg alpha, 21.3 µg beta, and 8.0 µg gamma) and 0.19 milligrams (mg) of the carotenoid pigment lycopene. There are 4.46 g of organic acids per 100 g of dry mushrooms, including oxalic acid (0.78 g), malic acid (2.71 g), citric acid (0.55 g), and fumaric acid (0.23 g). Mushrooms have 22.6 mg/100 g dw of the phenolic compound 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 15.8 mg/100 g dw of cinnamic acid.  Habitat and distribution  Young mushrooms with light green coloration Russula virescens can be found fruiting on soil in both deciduous forests and mixed forests, forming ectomycorrhizal symbiotic relationships with a variety of trees, including oaks (Quercus), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and aspen (Populus tremula). Preliminary investigations suggest that the fungus also associates with at least ten species of Dipterocarpaceae, an important tree family prevalent in the tropical lowland forests of Southeast Asia. Fruit bodies may appear singly or in groups, reappear in the same spots year after year, and are not common. In Europe, fruiting occurs mainly during the months of summer to early autumn. A Mexican study of the seasonal occurrence of several common mushroom species in subtropical forests in Xalapa showed that the fruiting period of R. virescens occurred in April, before the onset of the rainy season. The distribution of R. virescens in North America is subject to debate, where a number of similar species such as R. parvovirescens and R. crustosa are also recognized. One author even suggests that R. virescens \\"is strictly a European species\\", citing Buyck and collaborators (2006), who say \\"the virescens-crustosa group is much more complex than suspected and embraces at least a dozen taxa in the eastern US\\". As in Europe, Russula virescens has a widespread distribution in Asia, having been recorded from India, Malaysia, Korea, the Philippines, Nepal, China, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is also found in North Africa and Central America. Chemistry Russula virescens has a limited capacity to bioaccumulate the micronutrients iron, copper, and zinc from the soil. The concentration of these trace metals is slightly higher in the caps than the stipes. A meal of fresh mushroom caps would supply 16% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of copper for an adult male or female (ages 19–50); 16% or 7.3% of the RDA of iron for an adult male or female, respectively; and 16–22% of the adult RDA of zinc. The mushroom is a poor bioaccumulator of the toxic heavy metals arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and nickel. Biologically active mushroom polysaccharides have been a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol- lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R. virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water- insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity. Ribonucleases (or RNases) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of ribonucleic acid (RNA), and collectively they play a critical role in many biological processes. A RNase from R. virescens was shown to be biochemically unique amongst seven edible mushroom species in several ways: it has a co- specificity towards cleaving RNA at poly A and poly C, compared to the monospecific RNases of the others; it can be adsorbed on chromatography columns containing DEAE–cellulose as the adsorbent; it has a pH optimum of 4.5, lower than all other species; and, it has a \\"distinctly different\\" N-terminal amino acid sequence. The mushroom contains a unique laccase enzyme that can break down several dyes used in the laboratory and in the textile industry, such as bromothymol blue, eriochrome black T, malachite green, and reactive brilliant blue. Laccases are being used increasingly in the textile industry as environmental biocatalysts for the treatment of dye wastewater.

It was created as the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics at Colorado Springs in 1932 by businessman and economist Alfred Cowles. In 1939, the Cowles Commission moved to the University of Chicago under Theodore O. Yntema. Jacob Marschak directed it from 1943 until 1948, when Tjalling C. Koopmans assumed leadership. Increasing opposition to the Cowles Commission from the department of economics of the University of Chicago during the 1950s impelled Koopmans to persuade the Cowles family to move the commission to Yale University in 1955 where it became the Cowles Foundation.newschool.edu Archived April 30, 2011 As its motto Theory and Measurement implies, the Cowles Commission focuses on linking economic theory to mathematics and statistics. Its advances in economics involved the creation and integration of general equilibrium theory and econometrics. The thrust of the Cowles approach was a specific, probabilistic framework in estimating simultaneous equations to model an economy. Its ultimate goal in doing so was to gain policy insight. The Cowles approach structured its models from a priori economic theory. One of its main contributions was in exposing the bias of ordinary least squares regression in identifying coefficient estimates. Consequently, Cowles researchers developed new methods such as the indirect least squares, instrumental variable methods, the full information maximum likelihood method, and the limited information maximum likelihood method. All of these methods used theoretical, a priori restrictions. According to an article by Carl F. Christ, the Cowles approach was grounded on certain assumptions: :1. simultaneous economic behavior; :2. linear or logarithmic equations and disturbances; :3. systematic, observable variables without error; :4. discrete variable changes as opposed to continuous; :5. a priori determination of exogeneity and endogeneity; :6. the existence of a reduced form; :7. independence of the explanatory variables; :8. a priori identified structural equations; :9. normally distributed disturbances with zero means, finite and constant covariances, a nonsingular covariance matrix, and serial independence; :10. a dynamically stable system of equations. Several Cowles associates have won Nobel prizes for research done while at the Cowles Commission. These include Tjalling Koopmans, Kenneth Arrow, Gérard Debreu, James Tobin, Franco Modigliani, Herbert A. Simon, Joseph E. Stiglitz, Lawrence Klein, Trygve Haavelmo, Leonid Hurwicz and Harry Markowitz. The Cowles Foundation is located at 30 Hillhouse Avenue, New Haven, Connecticut.

It was founded in the mid 18th century by Lord Garlies, later 6th Earl of Galloway. Location and history The village lies northwest of Whithorn and a few miles north of Cruggleton Castle which was abandoned in the 17th century. The former seat of the Earls of Galloway, Galloway House, is situated on the edge of the village, with the settlement being planned along Georgian lines. The port became an important import point for goods being brought into the Machars throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1876 the Wigtownshire Railway was extended to the settlement and goods flowed regularly through the port, with the maritime industries of shipbuilding and associated activities taking place in the village. Location of Garlieston in SW Scotland Second World War During the Second World War the village became part of the secret Mulberry Harbour project. The profile of the beach and sea bed at Garlieston was similar to that of the proposed harbour points in Normandy and that, coupled with the remote nature of the locality, led to Garlieston and the surrounding area being selected as the development region for the harbours. Prototypes of three designs were trialled in Garlieston Harbour and at nearby Rigg Bay and Portyerrock. A fixed pierhead (Hippo) from the harbours could be seen in Cruggleton (or Rigg) Bay until it was destroyed by a storm on Sunday 12 March 2006. Remnants of the prototypes, in particular BEETLES that supported the floating roadway, can be seen at Eggerness, Portyerrock and Rigg Bay. The remains are now scheduled as national monuments by Historic Scotland. Currently Today the village is in general a quiet sleepy place, with much of the local industry and port activity having ceased over the past 50 years. A bowling green sits on the waterfront and the village caravan site attracts tourists, with the harbour providing berthing facilities for those who are touring by boat. Although Galloway House is privately owned, the gardens, managed separately by the Galloway House Gardens Trust are open to the public and pay and display parking provides easy access to the gardens and Rigg Bay.

The excavations also revealed remains of Roman buildings and several wells, apparently belonging to a medium scale settlement. The peasant society comprised probably three to four farmhouses with outbuildings, where 30 to 40 people have been living. Moreover, also remains of a medieval settlement were found. In total some 15,000 objects were unearthed, most of them from the period 1100 BC to 1100 AD. The finds indicate that the area was continuously inhabited from 1100 BC onwards. The objects include spearheads, fibulas and grave goods like small jars and colored plates and beakers, and a gold Ambiani stater, a coin minted around 50 BC.

As overseen by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, the area is used for hiking, picnicking, and winter sports by the public, while being actively managed to produce timber and other forest products. History The forest bears the name of the Mohawk Indians, although the tribe did not live in the area. Historians believe the Tunxis and Paugussett used the mountain peak for signal fires that warned neighboring communities further south that Mohawks were approaching from the northwest. Mohawk is the sixth oldest forest in the Connecticut state forest system. The forest's first five woodland acres were donated to the Connecticut State Park Commission by Andrew Clark in 1917 and were known as Mohawk Mountain Park until the 1920s. In 1921, Alain C. White donated another 250 acres with the White Memorial Foundation contributing a total of more than of land. Crews of Civilian Conservation Corps workers were active in the forest during the 1930s. Their work included the construction of roads that remain in use, the planting of hundreds of acres of trees, and the creation of breaks for fire control. Points of interest ;Black Spruce Bog One of the few bogs in the state, the 19-acre Black Spruce Bog is considered an outstanding example of a late stage peat bog.

The pond has a maximum depth of 26 feet (8 m), an average depth of 15 feet (4.5 m), and a boat launch on its southern shore. ;Red Mountain Accessible on foot via the blue-blazed Mohawk Trail (a former alignment of the Appalachian Trail), Red Mountain (elev. 1652 feet) occupies the northernmost section of Mohawk State Forest. Its eastern slope is the site of the Red Mountain Shelter, a log cabin built by CCC crews based in Housatonic State Forest. Due to the shallow bedrock of the peak, the higher elevations of the mountain sport shrubby oak trees and distant vistas. Activities and amenities The area offers hiking, picnicking, fishing and youth group camping, opportunities for leaf color viewing in fall, and cross-country skiing in winter. Skiers and snowboarders use the adjacent privately operated Mohawk Mountain Ski Area.

There are 10,028 inhabitants. The spoken language is Peellands (an East Brabantian dialect, which is very similar to colloquial Dutch). History The area of nowadays Beek en Donk has been inhabited for a long time. Tools of Stone Age nomadic people have been found. The first permanent inhabitants come around 700 AD. In the Middle Ages, the basis was made for the current towns. First Beek grew around the Oude Toren, and Heereind. In the 13th century, the role of Heereind was taken over by the expanding Donk. Heereind is noted in a document in 1314, where it was given the same importance as Aarle, Rixtel and Beek. On Saint Barbara day (December 4) in 1300, duke Jan II of Brabant gave the inhabitants of 'Rikestele, Arle ende Beke' (Rixtel, Aarle and Beek) the right to use common lands around the towns. In the 14th century, Beek en Donk got its first church. In 1809, it was demolished, but the tower remains, as the Oude Toren (old tower) During the reign of Johanna van Brabant, Beek was together with Aarle and Stiphout, was sold to Dirk de Roovere, for 1.700 gulden. In later ages, the area changed owners a few times, until in 1798 the feudal system was abolished, inspired by the French revolution. During the 80-year war, the town suffered from passing enemy armies. After the war, Beek en Donk remained poor. Only in the late 18th century, when there was more land cultivated, the situation slowly got better. In the 19th century, the town started to develop more. In 1836 the Zuid-Willemsvaart was dug by hand, and in 1880-1881, the steam tram between Den Bosch and Helmond was built, having a stop in Beek en Donk. The tram was broken up later; the canal still remains. In 1997, Beek en Donk, Lieshout, Aarle-Rixtel and Mariahout formed the municipality Laarbeek. The town hall of Beek en Donk serves as the town hall of the new municipality. In 2020, at a future construction site in Beek en Donk, phosphor was found in the ground at the site, dating back to explosives used by Germans during World War II. The construction was postponed.

Early life Joseph Getting McCoy was one of eleven children born to Mary (née Kirkpatrick) and David McCoy. He was born on 21 December 1837 in Sangamon County, Illinois. The McCoy family were farmers. Joseph went to school, including one year at Knox College. He went into business as a stockman, breeding and selling mules. A big financial break came for McCoy in 1861 when he sold a stockcar-load of mules in Kentucky. Delivery requiring transport over five different rail lines, the experience was also an important lesson in rail logistics that would serve him in his major career venture six years later. The venture sufficiently established him that he was able to propose to Sarah Epler, a neighbor. The earnings from the Kentucky sale allowed McCoy to expand both the diversity and the national reach of his livestock dealings. Transporting cattle Texas Longhorn In the 1860s, cattle ranchers in Texas faced difficulties getting their longhorn cattle to market. Kansas homesteaders objected to the cattle crossing their land because the cattle might carry ticks which could spread a disease called Texas Fever (or Spanish Fever) fatal to some types of cattle. The disease could make a Longhorn sick, but they were hardier stock than the northern cattle and Longhorns seldom died from the disease. McCoy himself said of the disease: > In 1868 a great number of cattle arrived in Kansas and the mid-west from > Texas; appx. 40,000. With them came a tick born disease called \\"Spanish > Fever\\". The local shorthorn breeds were seriously affected and in some towns > the loss of the cattle was almost 100%. The result was a great predice > against Texas cattle in Eastern Kansas and Missouri(although this may be > because the longhorns were already immune to the disease.) Joseph McCoy's Drover's Hotel, McCoy's Stock Yard, Abilene, Kansas, 1867 McCoy expected that the railroads companies were interested in expanding their freight operations and he saw this as a good business opportunity. McCoy built a hotel, stockyard, office and bank in a little village along the Kansas Pacific Railway (currently the Union Pacific). This village became known as Abilene, Kansas - one of the first cow towns. McCoy's plan was for cattle to be driven to Abilene from Texas and taken from there by rail to bigger cities in The Midwest and the East. Abilene sat near the end of the Chisholm Trail (named after Jesse Chisholm) established during the American Civil War for supplying the Confederate army. This trail ran to the west of the settled portion of Kansas, making it possible to use the trail without creating hostility from the Kansas homesteaders. McCoy advertised extensively throughout Texas to encourage cattle owners to drive their cattle to market in Abilene. By 1870 thousands of Texas longhorn cattle were being driven over the Chisholm Trail to the shipping center at Abilene. By 1871 as many as 5,000 cowboys were being paid off during a single day, and Abilene became known as a rough town in the Old West. Due to their long legs and hard hoofs, Longhorns were ideal trail cattle, even gaining weight on their way to market. One story says that McCoy bragged before leaving Chicago that he would bring 200,000 head in 10 years and actually brought two million head in 4 years, leading to the phrase \\"It's the Real McCoy\\" Later life McCoy was also the author of Historic Sketches of the Cattle Trade of the West and Southwest, which was published in 1874. Joseph McCoy died in Kansas City, Missouri on October 19, 1915. In 1967, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.

It is the fourth in his L.A. Quartet, preceded by The Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, and L.A. Confidential. James Ellroy dedicated White Jazz \\"TO Helen Knode.\\" The epigraph for White Jazz is \\"'In the end I possess my birthplace and I am possessed by its language.' -Ross MacDonald.\\" Lieutenant David Klein is a veteran policeman who moonlights as a hitman for organized crime. When he is assigned to investigate a robbery at the home of the Los Angeles Police Department's (LAPD) sanctioned heroin dealer, he uncovers a plot to bring the city's crime syndicates into collusion with the channels of justice. The stories of many characters that appeared in earlier L.A. Quartet novels, including Edmund Exley and Dudley Smith, have their ends tied up in White Jazz, which also introduces Pete Bondurant, one of the central characters in Ellroy's Underworld USA Trilogy.  Prologue  White Jazz's prologue is told by protagonist David Douglas Klein, years after the events have taken place: > All I have is the will to remember. Time revoked/fever dreams-I wake up > reaching, afraid I'll forget. Pictures keep the woman young. L.A., fall > 1958. Newsprint: link the dots. Names, events-so brutal they beg to be > connected. Years down-the story stays dispersed. The names are dead or too > guilty to tell. I'm old, afraid I'll forget: I killed innocent men. I > betrayed sacred oaths. I reaped profit from horror. Fever-that time burning. > I want to go with the music-spin, fall with it.  Plot  Dave Klein is a lieutenant in the LAPD's vice unit. He has a sister named Meg, with whom he shares an incestuous attraction, and performs contract killings for the mob to cover the costs for law school. Klein has committed several murders, including the unsolved killings of Tony Brancato and Tony Trombino, who were killed in revenge for hurting Meg. He seeks to get out of mob work and begs the dying Jack Dragna to let him go. When he refuses, Klein suffocates him. After setting up a raid on a bookmaking operation, Klein and his partner, George \\"Junior\\" Stemmons, are ordered to protect a witness in a probe into organized crime in boxing. Having been told by gangster Mickey Cohen that another crime figure, Sam Giancana, wants the witness dead, Klein throws the witness out of a high window and makes it look like an accident. Later that night, Captain Wilhite, of the corrupt Narcotics Squad, summons Klein to investigate a burglary at the home of J. C. Kafesjian, a drug dealer sanctioned by the LAPD. Klein gets a side job from Howard Hughes to obtain information on an actress named Glenda Bledsoe, that would violate the morality clause of her full-service contract. Klein learns through Cohen that Glenda has a \\"publicity date\\" with actor Rock Rockwell which violates the clause. During surveillance of Glenda, Klein finds out she, Rockwell, Touch Vecchio, and George Ainge are planning a fake kidnapping. Klein falls for Glenda and decides not to aid Hughes in getting her blacklisted by the film industry. He begins to aid Glenda as he continues investigating the Kafesjian burglary. Klein discovers that Edmund Exley is still trying to prosecute Dudley Smith and begins working with him. When he meets an undercover officer, Johnny Duhamel, Klein is shot up with drugs and kills him in an act caught on film. Klein is arrested by federal agents and becomes a witness, but is given forty-eight hours before he is taken into custody. Klein and Exley discover that Smith is selling heroin exclusively to the black population in the Southside to keep crime in that area \\"contained\\". The two track down the Kafesjians' burglar, Wylie Bullock. Finding himself grappling with all of his crimes and everything that is happening, Klein decides to meet Smith, who had earlier offered him a deal. Klein brings Bullock but is forced to shoot him when he attacks and maims Smith. Klein tries to flee but is soon caught. While in federal custody, Klein writes a full confession and has copies sent to various press outlets. Only the tabloid magazine Hush-Hush is willing to print it, but is prevented from doing so by an injunction. Klein manages to escape from custody and hide out with Pete Bondurant; Hughes has Bondurant beat him up, causing Klein to be hospitalized. Exley sends Klein a package in the hospital, which includes a blank passport and a silencer-fitted .38 revolver. In a note, Exley says he will allow Klein to kill Smith if he feels justice has not been absolute. Instead, Klein murders J. C. and Tommy Kafesjian. He spends one last night with Glenda, takes pictures to remember her by and flies to Rio de Janeiro. In the epilogue, set many years later, Klein plans to return to Los Angeles intending to destroy Exley's gubernatorial campaign, take revenge on Carlisle and Smith and find Glenda. Critical review The reviews for White Jazz were quite positive. \\"Blacker than noir... Makes most other crime novels seem naive.\\"--Publishers Weekly. \\"James Ellroy's latest book WHITE JAZZ makes previous detective fiction read like Dr. Seuss.\\"--San Francisco Examiner. \\"Ellroy's tenth novel burns with the memory of Rodney King in its descriptions of unimaginably cruel law officers who are not merely tainted by corruption on a vast scale but pursue conventional police work as a sideline to more lucrative illegal activities that burst into the public consciousness in violent frenzies.... An undeniably artful frenzy of violence, guilt and unappeased self-loathing. Ellroy's crime fiction represents a high mark in the genre.\\"--New York Newsday. In the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Wendy Lesser, reviewing the novel for The New York Times wrote: > What the real Los Angeles possesses, amid all its fiery disintegration, is > what Mr. Ellroy's latest novel keenly lacks: a coherent narrative line. We > may not have been pleased about what was happening this spring, but we knew > why it was happening. In White Jazz, I was lost by page 56--the page on > which the author explicitly reveals whatever plot the novel is going to > have. (\\"Instinct--call me bait--a bad cop sent out to draw heat,\\" Klein > correctly guesses.)

But we can't really begin to care about characters who never even get > to inhabit a complete sentence.  Efforts at a film adaptation  Various attempts at a film adaption of White Jazz have been under development since the 1990s. But as of 2009, Ellroy said that an adaptation of \\"White Jazz is dead. All movie adaptations of my books are dead.\\" History Ellroy completed a draft of a 131-page screenplay on October 31, 1997. In 1998, cinematographer Robert Richardson signed on for what would have been his directorial debut with Fine Line Features distributing. They put the project into turnaround in early 1999 due to budgetary concerns. In early December 2001, it was reported that \\"German- based VIF Intl. Films had come aboard to finance White Jazz, co-producing with Nick Nolte's Kingsgate Films and L.A.-based production company Interlight. Nolte and John Cusack were set to star in the film, with Winona Ryder reportedly in discussions to join them. Nolte was to play Klein, Cusack to play Junior Stemmons and Ryder to play Hollywood starlet Glenda. Uma Thurman was also attached to the project at one point and was to play Glenda. The screenplay was written by Ellroy and Christopher Cleveland. After the demise of the project, Richardson said \\"That's why directors go absolutely crazy – the development of a project is highly unpredictable and doesn't make tremendous sense. It may happen, but not in my time frame.\\" On November 30, 2006, it was reported that George Clooney was set to star in a newly green-lit film adaptation of the novel for Warner Independent Pictures. Clooney was also on board as producer along with his Smoke House partner Grant Heslov. The film was to be written by Matthew Michael Carnahan and directed by his brother Joe Carnahan. Both Jason Bateman and Peter Berg had signed on to appear in the film. The script changes the Armenian Kafesjian family in the novel to the Mexican Magdalena family. Joe Carnahan said this of his brother's script, \\"It's, to me, what that book always was – the point of departure from the Eisenhower '50s to the psychedelic freakshow, Manson '60s. It's a total combination of the two with a heavy, heavy voice-over narration, this kind of classic noir.\\" Carnahan had also confirmed that the characters of Ed Exley and Dudley Smith would not be in the film version despite their presence in the book, as Regency Productions has its own plans for a sequel to L.A. Confidential and asked the director to remove Exley from his screenplay as they own the rights to the character. Instead, the Carnahans had constructed a \\"doppelganger\\" for Exley, \\"giving him all of [his] traits and speech patterns.\\" Carnahan described his vision of White Jazz as reflecting the \\"kind of mid-century explosion of art and music, and really letting that be the kind of guiding force behind it, as opposed to making it like this ... all 'period suits'. I really want to try to make it as accurate a reflection of L.A. at that moment in time as I can.\\" He also commented on George Clooney's willingness to play an unlikable character for the first time. \\"He's made that very clear to me: 'I have no other desire than to play what's in that script.' And what's in that script is a pretty despicable guy at times, and pretty nefarious and nasty and selfish.\\" Carnahan also touched upon how he trimmed down the novel's numerous subplots because \\"I always thought that as much as I love White Jazz, it became almost unfilmable at some point, because there are so many strands, so much, and it became so psychotic ... that's what made it such a great book, but those things would not carry over into the filmic realm, I thought, with ease.\\" Clooney later dropped out of starring in the film due to scheduling conflicts with other projects. Chris Pine, who was also up for a role in the film, decided to take on the role of James T. Kirk in J. J. Abrams' 2009 Star Trek film. Having finished the last draft of the screenplay, Carnahan initially stated that he would still make the film and had \\"a couple of options in terms of other actors that I am completely over the moon for.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:Neo-noir novels Category:1992 American novels Category:Novels by James Ellroy Category:American crime novels Category:Novels set in California Category:Alfred A.

Developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the three individual small spacecraft were launched together from the belly of a Lockheed L-1011 aboard the Pegasus XL rocket, on 22 March 2006. One technology involved antennas that were designed by computers using an evolutionary AI system developed at NASA Ames Research Center. The ST5 on-board flight computer, the C&DH; (Command & Data Handling) system, was based on a Mongoose-V radiation-hardened microprocessor. On 30 June 2006 the satellites making up ST5 were shut down after successfully completing their technology validation mission. Mission objectives ST5's objective was to demonstrate and flight qualify several innovative technologies and concepts for application to future space missions. ; Communications Components for Small Spacecraft: The X-Band Transponder Communications System was provided by AeroAstro. The transponder system is a miniaturized digital communications transponder. It provides coherent uplink- to-downlink operation that provides a ground-to-space command capability, space-to-ground telemetry capability, and a radio frequency tracking capability. The X-Band weighs approximately 1/12 as much and is 1/9 the volume of communications systems now used in other missions. ; Evolved antenna: A supercomputer using an artificial evolution algorithm designed a very tiny, highly unlikely looking, but highly promising communication antenna for the ST5 spacecraft. The radiator was designed by NASA Ames and the antenna itself was implemented by the Physical Science Laboratory at New Mexico State University. (As a note, each spacecraft has two X-band antennas: an evolved (the solid black painted unit) and a quadrifilar helix antenna (the two-toned, black and white unit). The quadrifilar helix antennas were also developed at the NMSU Physical Science Laboratory.) ; Lithium-Ion Power System for Small Satellites: The Low-Voltage Power System uses a low-weight Li-Ion battery that can store up to four times as much energy as a Ni-Cad battery, charged by triple junction solar cells. The Li-Ion rechargeable battery has a longer life and exhibits no memory effect. ; Ultra Low-Power Demonstration: The CULPRiT is a new type of microelectronic device that allows circuits to operate at 0.5 Volts. The technology will greatly reduce power consumption while achieving a radiation tolerance of ~100 kRad total dose and latch-up immunity. ; Variable Emittance Coatings for Thermal Control: The Variable Emittance Coatings, provided by Sensortex, Inc. and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), are used for thermal control and consist of an electrically tunable coating that can change properties, from absorbing heat when cool to reflecting or emitting heat when in the Sun. The Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) chip is part of this technology. ; Propulsion Systems Components: A miniature microthruster that provides fine attitude adjustments on the spacecraft. The Cold Gas Microthruster (CGMT) is a tiny electromechanical system designed by Marotta Scientific Controls, Inc. to provide fine attitude adjustments on each of the micro-sats. It uses 1/8 the power and weighs only half as much as attitude control systems being used in other missions. ; Miniature magnetometer ; Miniature spinning sun sensor ; Spacecraft deployment mechanism ; Magnetometer deployment boom ; Nutation dampe See also * List of spaceflights (2006) References  External links * Space Technology 5 JPL NMP page * Space Technology 5 NASA page Category:Earth observation satellites of the United States Category:New Millennium Program Category:NASA satellites Category:Spacecraft launched in 2006 Category:Spacecraft launched by Pegasus rockets ","title":"Space Technology 5"},{"id":"4243484","text":"Ivo Lill (24 June 1953 – 4 August 2019) was an Estonian glass artist.

They also form a strict hierarchy of importance, in line with the order of the courts in which they sit, so that judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales are generally given more weight than district judges sitting in county courts and magistrates' courts. On 31 March 2006 there were 1,825 judges in post in England and Wales, most of whom were circuit judges (626) or district judges (572). Some judges with United Kingdom-wide jurisdiction also sit in England and Wales, particularly Justices of the United Kingdom Supreme Court and members of the tribunals judiciary. By statute, judges are guaranteed continuing judicial independence.Constitutional Reform Act 2005, s.3 The following is a list of the various types of judges who sit in the Courts of England and Wales: Lord Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor Since 3 April 2006, the Lord Chief Justice has been the overall head of the judiciary. Previously they were second to the Lord Chancellor, but that office lost its judicial functions under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. The Lord Chief Justice is also the head of the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal. Historically they were also President of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, but on becoming head of the judiciary that responsibility was transferred to a new office. The Lord Chief Justice is responsible for arranging training for the judiciary, which is achieved through the Judicial College. Although the Lord Chancellor is no longer a judge, he still exercises disciplinary authority over the judges, jointly with the Lord Chief Justice. He also has a role in appointing judges, through control of the Judicial Appointments Commission. In law reports, the Lord Chief Justice is referred to as (for example) \\"Smith LCJ\\" or \\"Lord Smith CJ\\", and the Lord Chancellor as \\"Smith LC\\". In court, the Lord Chief Justice wears a black damask gown with gold lace along with a short wig during criminal cases and the black civil gown with gold tabs during civil cases. Ceremonially, the Lord Chief Justice wears the red robe with white trim along with a gold chain and full wig. The Lord Chancellor wears white winged shirt with ruffled collar, black waistcoat, and black coat underneath the black damask gown with gold lace, and black knee-length breeches with black silk stockings, and full-bottomed wig during ceremonial occasions. Heads of Division There are four Heads of Divisions aside from the Lord Chief Justice: the Master of the Rolls, the President of the Queen's Bench Division, the President of the Family Division and the Chancellor of the High Court.Chancellor of the High Court. The Master of the Rolls is head of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal. The other Heads are in charge of the three divisions of the High Court. The Chancellor of the High Court is President of the Chancery Division of the High Court. Until 2006 this role was nominally held by the Lord Chancellor, but was in practice delegated to the Vice-Chancellor. The Vice-Chancellor was renamed Chancellor of the High Court when the Lord Chancellor's judicial role was abolished. The Heads of Division are referred to in law reports as \\"Smith MR\\", \\"Smith P\\", \\"Smith P\\", and \\"Smith C\\" respectively. Vice-Chancellors from pre-2006 Chancery cases were referred to as \\"Smith VC\\". In court, the Heads of Division wear a black damask gown with gold lace along with a short wig during criminal cases and the black civil gown with gold tabs during civil cases. Ceremonially, the Heads of Division wear red gowns with white trim along with full wigs except for the Master of the Rolls who wears the black damask gown with gold lace and full wig. Court of Appeal Three Lords Justices in their ceremonial robes in procession at Llandaff Cathedral in 2013 Judges of the Court of Appeal are known as Lords Justices, and they too are Privy Counsellors. Before swearing in they may be addressed as The Honourable Lord Justice Smith, and after swearing in as the Right Honourable Lord Justice Smith. Female Lord Justices are known as Lady Justices. Addressed as \\"My Lord\\" or \\"My Lady\\". In law reports, referred to as \\"Smith LJ\\", and, for more than one judge, \\"Smith and Jones LJJ\\". Formerly, Lords Justices of Appeal could only be drawn from barristers of at least 10 years' standing.Supreme Court Act 1981, s.10(3)(b) In practice, much greater experience was necessary and, in 2004, calls for increased diversity among the judiciary were recognised and the qualification period was changed so that, as of 21 July 2008, a potential Lord Justice of Appeal must satisfy the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on a 7-year basis.Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, s.50/ Sch.10, Pt.1.13 The Lord Justices wear black silk gowns and court coats (or bar jackets) and short wigs during criminal cases and the black civil robe with gold tabs for civil cases. For ceremonial occasions, they wear the full wig and black damask gown with gold lace. High Court Justices, Masters and Insolvency and Companies Court Judges High Court justices are not normally Privy Counsellors and are therefore referred to as the Honourable Mr/Mrs Justice Smith. Addressed as \\"My Lord\\" or \\"My Lady\\". In law reports they are referred to as \\"Smith J\\", and, for more than one judge, \\"Smith and Jones JJ\\". High Court justices normally wear a short wig along with red and black gowns for criminal cases, and a civil robe with red tabs without wig for civil cases and, when in open court, family cases. Judges of the Family Division sitting in private wear formal suits. Ceremonially, all High Court justices wear the red gown with white trim along with a full wig. A Master is a level of judge in the High Court whose decisions are of equal standing to that of a High Court judge at first instance. They are mainly responsible for trials and case management pre-trial in exclusively civil cases in London. They wear dark blue gowns with pink tabs in court and are addressed as 'Master', regardless of gender. Ceremonially, they wear a full-bottomed wig, court coat, jabot and black silk gown. Each division has a senior Master and each division has a different title: *Queen's Bench Division – Senior Master *Chancery Division – Chief Chancery Master *Costs Office – Senior Costs Judge *Admiralty Court – Admiralty Registrar The Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division also holds the ancient judicial post of Queen's Remembrancer (King's Remembrancer when the monarch is male), and is also the Registrar of Election petitions and Foreign judgements as well as being the designated authority for the Hague Service Convention and Hague Evidence Convention and receiving agency under the EU Service Regulation – Council Regulation (EC) No. 1348/2000 and EU Taking of Evidence Regulation – Council Regulation (EC) No. 1206/2001. The Senior Master is assisted in this role as Central Authority by the Foreign Process Section of the Queen's Bench Action Department at the Royal Courts of Justice. The six Insolvency and Companies Court Judges, one of whom is the Chief Insolvency and Companies Court Judge, hear and dispose of much of the High Court insolvency (both personal and corporate) and pure company law cases in London, including trials (i.e. cases arising under the Insolvency Act 1986, the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, the Companies Acts and related legislation). They also hear appeals from district judges of the County Court in the south east region in company and corporate insolvency matters. For convenience, their title is often abbreviated to \\"ICC Judge\\". They wear a dark blue gown with pink tabs in court (but no longer wear wigs) and are addressed as 'Judge'. Ceremonially, they wear a full-bottomed wig, court coat, jabot and black silk gown. As judges exercising the jurisdiction of the High Court their decisions are of equal standing to that of a High Court justice at first instance. Masters and ICC Judges are not referred to with a post-nominal abbreviation in the law reports, and appear as \\"Master Smith\\" or \\"ICC Judge Smith\\". Formerly, Masters and ICC Judges could only be drawn from barristers and solicitors of at least seven years' standing. However, in 2004, calls for increased diversity among the judiciary were recognised and the qualification period was changed so that, as of 21 July 2008, a potential Master or ICC Judge must satisfy the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on a five-year basis. Circuit judges Circuit judges are referred to as His/Her Honour Judge {surname} e.g. His/Her Honour Judge Smith. If a circuit judge is appointed who has the same surname as another serving circuit judge, he (she) will be referred to as His (Her) Honour Judge {first name} {surname}. e.g. His Honour Judge John Smith. Circuit judges are addressed as \\"Your Honour\\", unless sitting in the Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey), in which case addressed as \\"My Lord (Lady)\\". Senior circuit judges who sit as the honorary recorder of a borough or city are also entitled to be addressed in court as \\"my lord/lady.\\" In law reports, circuit judges are referred to as \\"HHJ Smith\\", or simply, \\"Judge Smith.\\" Formerly, circuit judges could only be drawn from barristers of at least ten years' standing.Courts Act 1971, s.16(3)(a) However, in 2004, calls for increased diversity among the judiciary were recognised and the qualification period was changed so that, as of 21 July 2008, a potential circuit judge must satisfy the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on a seven-year basis. For criminal cases, circuit judges wear a violet and purple gown with a red sash and short wig and for civil cases exchange the red sash for a lilac one. Circuit judges sitting in civil proceedings no longer wear wigs, wing collars, or bands. Ceremonially, they wear purple robes with a purple trim and a full wig. Recorders A recorder is a part-time circuit judge, usually a practising barrister, solicitor or a member of the courts or tribunal judiciary who is not a full- time circuit judge. Recorders are addressed in court in the same way as circuit judges (as 'Your Honour'). There is no formal abbreviation for the position and recorders are referred to as 'Mr/Mrs Recorder Smith' (as opposed to circuit judges, who can be referred to as 'HHJ Smith' in judgements, law reports or other legal documents). Formerly, recorders could only be drawn from barristers of at least 10 years' standing.Courts Act 1971, s.21(2) However, in 2004, calls for increased diversity among the judiciary were recognised and the qualification period was changed so that, as of 21 July 2008, a potential recorder must satisfy the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on a seven-year basis. The senior circuit judge in a metropolitan area will often be given the honorary title of the recorder of the city - e.g. the Recorder of Manchester. Despite still being circuit judges, these recorders are addressed in court as 'My Lord/Lady' as if they were High Court judges. District judges District judge is the title given to two different categories of judges. One group of district judges sit in the county courts and have jurisdiction in High Court cases, having previously been known as registrars until the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. The other group sit in the magistrates' courts and were formerly known as stipendiary magistrates until the Access to Justice Act 1999. Members of this latter group are more formally known as \\"district judge (magistrates' courts)\\" (see the Courts Act 2003). Judges in both groups are addressed as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Madam\\". In law reports, they are referred to as \\"DJ Smith\\". Formerly, district judges could only be drawn from barristers and solicitors of at least seven years' standing. However, in 2004, calls for increased diversity among the judiciary were recognised and the qualification period was changed so that, since 21 July 2008, a potential district judge must satisfy the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on a five-year basis. From November 2010, other types of lawyer, such as legal executives (fellows of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives), also became eligible to be district judges. The senior district judge (magistrates' courts) is also known as the Chief Magistrate. Deputy district judges A solicitor or barrister who sits part-time as a district judge (who may be taking their first steps on the route to becoming a full- time district judge). Retired district judges sometimes sit as deputies. Addressed as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Madam\\". In law reports, referred to as \\"DDJ Smith\\". Formerly, deputy district judges could only be drawn from barristers and solicitors of at least seven years' standing. However, in 2004, calls for increased diversity among the judiciary were recognised and the qualification period was changed so that, since 21 July 2008, a potential deputy district judge must satisfy the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on a five- year basis and so that other types of lawyer, such as legal executives (ILEX Fellows), would be eligible. In August 2010, Ian Ashley-Smith became the first CILEx Fellow to be directly appointed as a deputy district judge (civil). Magistrates Laymen drawn from the community who generally sit in threes in order to give judgment in magistrates' courts and youth courts. The chair is addressed as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Madam\\" or the bench is addressed as \\"Your Worships\\". Individual magistrates are permitted to use the postnominal \\"JP\\" e.g. \\"John Smith JP\\" (for Justice of the Peace). Judicial salaries There are nine pay points for judges in the United Kingdom (including England and Wales). The following is a simplified list of annual judicial salaries from 1 April 2019 (as applied to various judicial offices from 1 October 2019), showing only the most widely-held grades and some of the best known specific appointments.

The administrative body of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is classified as a non-ministerial department. The Supreme Court is independent of the government of the UK, of Parliament, and of the court services of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It takes appeals from the Appeals Courts of England and Wales and of Northern Ireland, and Scotland's High Court of the Judiciary. The President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is paid at Group 1.1, while the Deputy President and the other ten members of the Supreme Court are paid at Group 2.

History  The first store was opened at 1569 Grand Avenue in St. Paul,About Us  Dunn Bros Coffee Shop Franchises after the Dunn brothers had driven an old Dodge van loaded with their belongings from Portland, Oregon, to Minnesota in search of a good, underserved location for a coffee business. They found a refurbished 1950s Probat roaster in Cincinnati, Ohio, and used it to set up that first store. The second location opened in Uptown Minneapolis in 1991 (and was temporarily the only location while the Grand Avenue store was rebuilt following a 1991 fire). The Grand Avenue store still exists as \\"Dunn Bros Coffee\\" but is not part of the Dunn Brothers Coffee franchise. Franchise The store's locations are primarily in the American Midwest, especially Minnesota, where there are 60 locations. In the last few years stores have also opened in Texas, Tennessee, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Iowa. Dunn Bros Coffee is a franchise, and most stores are locally owned and operated.

The New Jersey Constitution of 1947 establishes the power of the New Jersey courts.Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 7:1-1 Under the State Constitution, \\"'judicial power shall be vested in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, County Courts and inferior courts of limited jurisdiction.'\\"Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 4:1-1 The Superior Court has three divisions: the Appellate Division is essentially an intermediate appellate court while the Law and Chancery Divisions function as trial courts. The State Constitution renders the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division the intermediate appellate court, and \\"[a]ppeals may be taken to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court from the law and chancery divisions of the Superior Court and in such other causes as may be provided by law.\\" Each division is in turn divided into various parts. \\"The trial divisions of the Superior Court are the principal trial courts of New Jersey. They are located within the State's various judicial geographic units, called 'vicinages,' R. 1:33-2(a), and are organized into two basic divisions: the Chancery Division and the Law Division\\".Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:3-1 Like justices of the New Jersey Supreme Court, judges of the Superior Court are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate for initial terms of seven years. If reappointed before the expiration of the initial term, the judge is said to have tenure and can serve until the mandatory judicial retirement age of 70. Retired judges may be recalled to serve in courts other than the Supreme Court. Judges are assigned to the court's divisions and parts (and in the case of the Law and Chancery Divisions, to a particular vicinage) by the Supreme Court. Appellate Division \\"[T]he State Constitution established the Appellate Division as the upper tier of the Superior Court.\\" \\"The Appellate Division was created as part of the judicial revision that took place as a result of the 1947 Constitution. Prior to 1947, the structure of the judiciary in New Jersey was extremely complex, including 'a court of errors and appeals in the last resort in all causes . . .; a court for the trial of impeachments; a court of chancery; a prerogative court; a supreme court; circuit courts, and such inferior courts as now exist, and as may be hereafter ordained and established by law . . .'\\" The Appellate Division hears appeals from the Law and Chancery Divisions and final decisions of State administrative agencies. There are eight parts, designated \\"A\\" through \\"H,\\" and each part has three or four judges. \\"The Appellate Division shall consist of such parts with such number of judges as the Chief Justice shall from time to time designate.\\"Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 7:2-2 Judges are rotated among the parts on an annual basis. \\"Each Part is headed by a presiding judge, who is properly addressed as 'Presiding Judge, Appellate Division.' The most senior judges of the Appellate Division serve as presiding judges of the various Parts[.]\\" Unlike the federal and some other state appellate courts, appeals are not allocated among the parts on a territorial basis and Appellate Division precedent is equally binding statewide. One of the judges on each part is designated as the presiding judge and there is an overall presiding judge for administration. Appeals are decided by a panel of two or three judges from the part to which the appeal is assigned. If the Supreme Court has less than seven members available to hear a case, either because of vacancies or recusals, senior Appellate Division judges may be assigned to serve temporarily. The Appellate Division has a central clerk's office that processes the filing of notices of appeal, briefs, motions and other papers. An appeal of a final order in New Jersey must be filed within 45 days.Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 19:1-1 Appeals from interlocutory orders may be made at any time before final judgment.N.J. Ct. R. 2:5-6(a) Chancery Division The Chancery Division consists of the General Equity, Probate and Family Parts. Chancery cases deal with cases where equitable relief is sought: that is, cases where one of the parties desires an injunction or other order requiring the other party/parties to do something other than pay money. General Equity Part The General Equity Part handles civil cases where the primary relief sought is equitable in nature, although it may grant incidental relief at law (damages). In most vicinages, only one judge is assigned to the General Equity Part, although the Assignment Judge of the vicinage may also hear general equity cases. Probate Part The Probate Part handles contested probate matters, guardianships etc. Usually the General Equity judge handles the probate calendar on a weekly or less frequent basis. The county surrogate acts as the deputy clerk of the Superior Court for the Probate Part in the county. Family Part The Family Part was created when the State Constitution was amended to eliminate the juvenile and domestic relations courts in each county and so it has the distinction of being the only part specifically mandated by the constitution. The Family Part is responsible for all cases arising out of marriage (or marriage-like) relationships, cases about the parentage, custody, or support of children, juvenile matters and domestic violence cases. It is also the only Chancery Division part to hear appeals from the municipal courts; a party may appeal to the Family Part from the grant or denial of a temporary domestic-violence restraining order in the municipal courts. Law Division The Law Division consists of the Civil, Special Civil and Criminal Parts. Civil Part The Civil Part has jurisdiction over all civil cases where the principal relief requested is sought at law (i.e. in the form of money damages), and it may grant incidental equitable relief so that a case may be fully decided in one forum. Generally, civil actions are assigned by case type into one of four tracks. The four tracks range from Track I allowing 150 days for discovery to Track IV allowing 450 days for discovery and requiring active case management by an individual judge. Effective in 2015, the New Jersey Supreme Court added a Complex Business Litigation Program (CBLP) to the Law Division. The CBLP is a type of Business Court, falling within Track IV. It has a specially defined jurisdiction focusing on commercial disputes, with assignment to a single judge.Id. Special Civil Part The Special Civil Part essentially succeeded to the jurisdiction of the former county district courts. Cases may be filed in the Special Civil Part where the amount in controversy does not exceed $15,000 (or more if the plaintiff waives the excess). It also has a small claims section for cases involving less than $3000 and a landlord-tenant section to adjudicate summary dispossess actions. Natural persons may act pro se. Corporations and other business entities must hire an attorney except for cases cognizable in small claims, where an authorized nonlawyer officer or employee may generally appear.N.J. Ct. R. 6-11, available at https://njcourts.gov/attorneys/assets/rules/r6-11.pdf (\\"[A]ny authorized officer or employee may prosecute and defend on behalf of a party which is a business entity, whether formally incorporated or not, claims originating with and not held by transfer or assignment to that business entity. . .\\"). The Special Civil Part is designed to provide expedited and somewhat relaxed proceedings in smaller cases. The Special Civil Part has its own clerk in each county (rather than relying upon the Superior Court clerk's office) and many forms are available. Criminal Part The Criminal Part handles criminal cases for \\"crimes\\" or \\"indictable offenses\\" (what New Jersey terms offenses called felonies in other jurisdictions), which the New Jersey Constitution provides may only be brought by an indictment issued by a grand jury. The Criminal Part also hears appeals from the New Jersey municipal courts for convictions for disorderly persons offenses and petty disorderly persons offenses (what New Jersey terms offenses called misdemeanors in other jurisdictions, which do not require a grand jury indictment), as well as traffic offenses (including driving while intoxicated) and violations of municipal ordinances. Organization of Trial Parts The Clerk of the Superior Court is appointed by the Supreme Court and heads the centralized clerk's office; however, most pleadings are filed in the county in which the action is venued with the Deputy Clerk, Superior Court, for the county. For administrative purposes, the State is divided into fifteen numbered vicinages. Most vicinages comprise a single county, but there are two vicinages that consist of two counties (Atlantic & Cape May Counties and Morris & Sussex Counties) and two vicinages that consist of three counties (Somerset, Hunterdon & Warren Counties and Gloucester, Cumberland & Salem County). The head of judiciary in each county is the assignment judge. The General Equity, Family, Civil and Criminal Parts in each vicinage are headed by a presiding judge. Post-nominal letters The Rules Governing the Courts of New Jersey provide for the use of certain post-nominal letters after the names of judges. Superior Court judges for whom no other designation is provided use \\"J.S.C.\\" Appellate Division judges use the post-nominal letters \\"J.A.D.\\" (or \\"P.J.A.D.\\" in the case of a presiding judge). The Assignment Judge of a vicinage is designated \\"A.J.S.C.\\" Presiding judges of trial court parts use \\"P.J.Ch.\\" (General Equity), \\"P.J.F.P.\\" (Family), P.J.Cv.\\" (Civil) and \\"P.J.Cr.\\" (Criminal) as appropriate.

The notion that those people infected with cowpox, a relatively mild disease, were subsequently protected against smallpox was not an uncommon observation with country folk in the late 18th century, but Jesty was one of the first to intentionally administer the less virulent virus. He was one of the six English, Danish and German people who reportedly administered cowpox to artificially induce immunity against smallpox from 1770 to 1791; only Jobst Bose of Göttingen, Germany with his 1769 inoculations pre-dated Jesty's work. Unlike Edward Jenner, a medical doctor who is given broad credit for developing the smallpox vaccine in 1796, Jesty did not publicise his findings made some twenty years earlier in 1774. Early life Upbury Farm at Yetminster, home to the Jesty family at the time that the pioneering inoculations took place Jesty was born in Yetminster, Dorset, and baptized there on 19 August 1736, the youngest of at least four sons of Robert Jesty, who was a butcher. Little else is known of his early life. In March 1770 he married Elizabeth Notley (1740–1824) in Longburton, four miles north-east of Yetminster. The couple lived at Upbury Farm, next to Yetminster church, and the couple had four sons and three daughters. Jesty and smallpox During the eighteenth century smallpox was widespread throughout England, with frequent epidemics. It was known in the dairy-farming areas in the south-west of the country that the milkmaids and other workers who contracted cowpox from handling cows' udders, were afterwards immune to smallpox. Such people were able to nurse smallpox victims without fear of contracting the disease themselves. This folk-knowledge gradually became more widely disseminated amongst the medical community: in 1765 a Dr Fewster (possibly John Fewster) of Thornbury, Gloucestershire presented a paper to the Medical Society of London entitled \\"Cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox\\", and Dr. Rolph, another Gloucestershire physician, stated that all experienced physicians of the time were aware of this. Jesty and two of his female servants, Ann Notley and Mary Reade, had been infected with cowpox. When an epidemic of smallpox came to Yetminster in 1774, Jesty decided to try to give his wife Elizabeth and two eldest sons immunity by infecting them with cowpox. He took his family to a cow at a farm in nearby Chetnole that had the disease, and using a darning needle, transferred pustular material from the cow by scratching their arms. The boys had mild local reactions and quickly recovered but his wife's arm became very inflamed and for a time her condition gave cause for concern, although she too recovered fully in time. Blue plaque commemorating Jesty's pioneering work at Upbury Farm at Yetminster. Jesty's experiment was met with hostility by his neighbours. He was labelled inhuman, and was \\"hooted at, reviled and pelted whenever he attended markets in the neighbourhood'\\". The introduction of an animal disease into a human body was thought disgusting and some even \\"feared their metamorphosis into horned beasts\\". But the treatment's efficacy was several times demonstrated in the years which followed, when Jesty's two elder sons, exposed to smallpox, failed to catch the disease. Interest in the prophylactic powers of cowpox virus grew and in May 1796, over 20 years after Jesty had made his inoculations, Edward Jenner began his series of vaccination experiments. In about 1797 Jesty and his family moved from Yetminster, when Jesty took up the tenancy of Downshay Manor Farm in Worth Matravers near the Dorset coast. Here he came to the attention of Dr. Andrew Bell, rector of nearby Swanage who (possibly encouraged by Jesty's efforts) vaccinated over 200 of his parishioners in 1806. Recognition and final years In June 1802 Jenner was given a reward of £10,000 from the House of Commons for discovering and promoting vaccination, and another award of £20,000 followed in 1807. Before this first amount had been awarded, George Pearson, founder of the Original Vaccine Pock Institution, had brought evidence before the House of Commons of Jesty's work in 1774, work which pre- dated Jenner's by 22 years. Unfortunately, Jesty's well-documented case was weakened by his failure to petition in person, and Pearson's inclusion of other claimants whose evidence could not be validated, so no reward was forthcoming. Unaware of George Pearson's previous petitions to the Pitt Government about the Dorset farmer, the Reverend Dr. Andrew Bell, rector of Swanage near where Jesty later resided, prepared a paper dated 1 August 1803, proposing Jesty as the first vaccinator, and sent copies to the Original Vaccine Pock Institute and the member of parliament, George Rose. Bell wrote to the Institution again in 1804, having learned of Pearson's involvement. In 1805, at Pearson's instigation and the institution's invitation, Jesty gave his evidence before 12 medical officers of the institution at its base on the corner of Broadwick Street and Poland Street in Soho. Robert, Jesty's oldest son (by then 28 years old) also made the trip to London and agreed to be inoculated with smallpox again to prove that he still had immunity. After Jesty had been cross-examined, he was presented with a long testimonial and pair of gold mounted lancets. The verbal evidence of their examination was published in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal. > Report from the Original Vaccine Pock Institute, 1805 \\"That he was led to > undertake this novel practice in 1774 to counteract the small-pox, at that > time prevalent at Yetminster, where he then resided, from knowing the common > opinion of the country ever since he was a boy (now 60 years ago) that > persons who had gone through the cowpock naturally, ie by taking it from > cows, were insusceptible of the small-pox; by himself being incapable of > taking the small-pox, having gone through the cow-pock many years before; > from knowing many individuals, who, after the cowpock, could not have the > small-pox excited; from believing that the cow-pock was an affection free > from danger; and from his opinion that, by the cow-pock inoculation, he > should avoid ingrafting various diseases of the human constitution, such as > \\"the Evil (scrofula), madnes, lues (syphilis), and many bad humours,\\" as he > called them.\\" Graves of Benjamin (left) and Elizabeth (right) Jesty in the churchyard at Worth Matravers. For the event, Jesty's family had tried to persuade him to dress in a more up-to-date fashion, but he refused saying that \\"he did not see why he should dress better in London than in the country\\". Immediately after his interrogation, Jesty was taken round to the studio of the portrait painter Michael William Sharp in nearby Great Marlborough Street. Jesty proved an impatient sitter, and so Mrs Sharp played the piano to try to soothe him as Sharp painted. After a chequered history, the portrait is now owned by the Wellcome Trust and is on loan to the Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. On Sunday 15 July 1806, Bell preached the same sermon twice in honour of Jesty, \\"whose discovery of the efficacy of the cowpock against smallpox is so often forgotten by those who have heard of Dr Jenner\\". Jesty died in Worth Matravers on 16 April 1816 and was buried in a prominent position in the parish churchyard. His widow, Elizabeth, died on 8 January 1824 and was buried alongside him. Both headstones are listed structures, primarily due to their historic interest. The full text on Jesty's headstone reads: > (Sacred) To the Memory OF Benj.in.

The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music describes them as \\"quite possibly the most popular hard-punk act ever to arise within the Christian music scene.\\" They were known for their mischief and irreverence on-stage, as reflected even in their reunion at Cornerstone in 2000. Background The group evolved out of a street ministry led by Carey Womack, who was studying to become a Baptist minister at the time. Several other members also had a background in ministry; Brian Wheeler was an Assembly of God evangelist, and Paul Q-Pek had sung with The Continental Singers. The band originally formed for a one time only performance at a local Christian music festival held on Labor Day 1985. Although they have not released any full-length albums of new material since 1991, they have written new songs, and have not declared their band broken up yet. According to CCM Magazine a One Bad Pig show was \\"kind of like a carnival/revival run amok.\\" For instance, at Cornerstone 1990 they were reported to have leapt into water-filled plastic swimming pools and cut down a Christmas tree with a chainsaw. Often during the song \\"Smash The Guitar\\" the band would literally smash their guitars onto the stage. In contrast, each performance included an altar call where Carey Womack's preaching was said to have a \\"hometown passion.\\" The band also placed a heavy emphasis on personal accountability. Johnny Cash performed guest vocals on One Bad Pig's cover of his song \\"Man In Black\\", which One Bad Pig included on their 1991 album, I Scream Sunday. Bob Hartman performed as a guest guitarist on One Bad Pig's cover of his song \\"Judas Kiss\\" from his band Petra's More Power To Ya album. The band was subject to constant criticism from the anti-Christian Rock movement. They were critical of the group for its concert antics, lyrics, and even for their name. According to some their name evoked stereotypes of punk music and rebellion in a way that, according to some, was contrary to certain principles of Christianity. One critical group was Dial-the-Truth Ministries, which is affiliated with the King-James-Only Movement. Their widely distributed tract entitled Christian Rock: Blessing or Blasphemy? was critical of the above and their involvement with Johnny Cash, who was attacked separately. In 2016, One Bad Pig reunited for to record a new album and multiple concerts. Origin of name The origin of the bands' name was a picture of a pig in a local radio station's advertisement, which Carey commented was one \\"bad pig\\". The full story as related in an interview on the \\"Breakaway Show\\" (broadcast from radio station KCFV) was that while driving from Austin, Texas to the Cornerstone Festival in 1985, Carey and Paul stopped in Saint Louis, Missouri at a local Pizza Hut. At the time, local radio station KSHE was running a promotion in conjunction with Pizza Hut selling sunglasses with the Pizza Hut logo on one lens and the new KSHE logo on the other. As they were leaving the restaurant, Carey looked at Paul and said \\"That's one bad pig\\". Paul replied, \\"That would be a great name for a punk band! We should form one.\\" So, they did. The next year, One Bad Pig's first album was introduced at Cornerstone. Related activities Paul Q-Pek left the band in 1992 and moved to Nashville. In 1996 he released a solo project entitled Touch The Ground. It contained pop stylings similar to that of Peter Gabriel which were, in the words of the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, a \\"shocking departure from his previous porker rock.\\" The album contained several covers, one of Howard Jones's \\"Things Can Only Get Better\\", and Pat Terry's \\"Open the Door.\\" Original lyrics included political satire in \\"If I were President\\" and \\"Capitol Hill\\", which CCM commented was \\"less than successful.\\" The album did however, contain some songs which charted on Christian radio – \\"Touch the Ground\\" and \\"Things Can Only Get Better\\" each reached the No. 10 slot in 1995 and 1996 respectively, and \\"I (Surrender)\\" reached No. 6 in 1996. He returned to the band for their reunion show at the 2000 Cornerstone festival. Philip Owens and Paul Q-Pek were also in Lust Control, although their identities were anonymous for the band. This arrangement ended when One Bad Pig signed to Myrrh, as its members became contractually blocked from being in other bands.

Michael Straczynski. It was spun off from its un-moderated version, rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5, in 1996. The newsgroup counts Straczynski as a frequent contributor, and was among the first internet-based fora where fans interacted directly with a 'showrunner'. History In the early 1990s, several newsgroups were created that focused on the sci-fi show Babylon 5. One of these groups, rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5, gained notoriety for the participation of Babylon 5 creator and writer J. Michael Straczynski. Straczynski had long participated in many online forums since the 1980s, and is widely credited as being the first notable artist and celebrity to interact with fans online, even before the advent of the Internet as it is now known. Straczynski interacted with Babylon 5 fans on rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 and similar groups on GEnie and CompuServe, however rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 slowly turned into a morass of spam and 'flame wars' (usually perpetrated and carried forward by a rather small group of people). The more Babylon 5s ratings increased, and the more attention was drawn to Straczynski's involvement in the group, the more extensive and vitriolic the many flame wars got. By the end of 1995, Straczynski was also being 'net-stalked', and had to scrap a script in pre-production because fans were posting story ideas. Eventually, Straczynski left rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5, focusing on the moderated Internet based forums. A group of fans then proposed the creation of a moderated version of rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5. The resultant Request For Discussion became the most replied to RFD in the history of Usenet at the time (surpassed only by the rec.music.white-power newsgroup vote), and the proposal overwhelmingly passed, creating rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated. The majority of rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 contributors, as well as Straczynski and other Usenet personalities, flocked to the new group, essentially continuing rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 in a more controlled environment. Straczynski continues to post to rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated to this day, engaging in discussions with fans about many subjects in addition to answering questions about his works and using the group to make announcements about new projects. The various independent websites that archive his Usenet posts or the group itself are usually mis-cited in the media as being his official websites. The group is actively moderated on a volunteer basis by two Babylon 5 fans, and the computer equipment and bandwidth costs are supported by donations from other fans. Posts can be made through normal Usenet methods (via a newsreader or the World Wide Web through Google Groups), or via e-mail. Moderation Per the group's charter, no topic is \\"off topic\\". Most discussions at first naturally focused on Babylon 5, and since the show ended, on Straczynski's recent works in comics, film, radio and television. The group can be looked at as more of a general discussion group. The only things that are not allowed in the group are spam, trolling, story ideas about Babylon 5 or other projects Straczynski may be working on, and flame wars. Posts from new contributors or new threads go through the moderators for approval first (\\"hand moderation\\"). Posts to existing threads from experienced contributors are automatically allowed through by computer. Discussion threads on particularly heated subjects (usually politics) are continuously hand moderated to prevent flame wars from occurring, and if they do, the thread can be shut down. The system is not perfect: posts can be lost and the group can be down to new posts if the moderation computers are being moved or during power outages, etc. Appearance of new threads are dependent on the availability of the moderators, and may sometimes take more than a day to appear. Occasionally, complaints of censorship arise, though these complaints are often from people who were making posts that violated the clearly set rules. Nevertheless, the forum is still a popular discussion ground for Straczynski's fans, with the main selling point being the opportunity to interact with Straczynski. Jay Denebeim, a volunteer moderator for Rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated, was profiled in a Wall Street Journal article that covered the travails that beset the Usenet in the late 1990s. Legacy Straczynski's involvement with rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5 and its successor, rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated, has had great influence on his works, especially Babylon 5. Straczynski's involvement on these groups also paved the way for similar online discussion involvement by many artists and celebrities today. At the time, the word \\"blog\\" had not yet been coined, and yet Straczynski's discussion of every episode of the show prior to its airing remains a critical milestone in the history of production-related blogging. Straczynski's contributions Straczynski began his postings on GEnie with background information about the setting and history of the major races and station. By the time he began posting to Usenet, the pilot was over and episodes were in production. Discussion of upcoming projects was a frequent topic throughout, and began as early as July 1993 with information about upcoming comic book adaptations. Early in the first season, Straczynski began to divulge details of upcoming plot threads, though he did so sparingly. One such comment set up the homosexual themes that would not be revealed until the second season between two of the female characters (\\"Divided Loyalties\\"). This particular plot thread eventually led to one of the most discussed editing choices in the show's history. A kiss between the two women during the second season was edited in such a way that it was strongly suggestive, but not a definitive kiss. Religion played a large role in Babylon 5, and yet in many of his postings, Straczynski discussed his atheism. During the first season, he commented that In addition to his discussion of the show itself, Straczynski often fielded questions related to the writing process in general or regarding the business side of Babylon 5. Many posters asked about topics such as the demands of writing for a series, and how to break into the industry. As the seasons progressed, ratings were a frequent topic because of the concern surrounding seasonal renewal of the show. For similar reasons, awards such as Emmys that the show received were also discussed on a regular basis. Departures from the show were often highly emotional topics for the fans, and for Straczynski. The three primary departures which sparked the most commentary were those of Michael O'Hare (between seasons 1 and 2), Andrea Thompson (mid-season 2) and Claudia Christian (between seasons 4 and 5). These departures were also a great source of speculation which ignited strong responses from Straczynski. Straczynski shared information regarding the death of Richard Biggs and Andreas Katsulas. Details of production and business choices to which fans are not always privy were often shared. Some examples include: * The pre-filming of the last episode of the series during season 4, in case of cancellation. * The cancellation of Crusade and the notes process with TNT that lead up to it. * Negotiations to make a Babylon 5 film (Note: these were suspended after Richard Biggs' death.) * The start of production of the Babylon 5: The Lost Tales direct to DVD. * Announcement that he would adapt E.E. Doc Smith's Lensman series for Ron Howard. * Announcement that the only continuation of the Babylon 5 series will be as a feature film.

He's been struggling with fatigue and illness and as selfish and inconsiderate as it sounds, it's brought the spark back to his writing ... given the time to sink in, the album fits well in their canon.\\" The Guardian believed that with High \\"the emotional commitment of Peace at Last is combined with the observational detachment of the earlier work ... In pop, most people do their best work within five or six years. How extraordinary, then, that after more than two decades of activity, the Blue Nile remain on course, their range expanded, their focus more refined, unshaken in their determination to proceed at their own measured pace.\\" MusicOMH said \\"High is proof that they may have been away for a while, but they certainly haven't lost their touch ... Although some may call this album bland, that is to miss the point ... Buchanan's vocals are what raises most of the songs to another level—sometimes a gentle whisper, at other times an anguished cry, it's one of the great, if less celebrated voices in modern music. They may only appear at around the same frequency as Halley's Comet but it's records like High that remind you why The Blue Nile are so highly regarded.\\" BBC Music said \\"High manages to maintain the Blue Nile's impeccably tasteful standards while soaring blissfully over the rattle and hum of most contemporary music. Paul Buchanan still sings his songs of faded love affairs, broken dreams and squandered ambitions with almost painful emotional candor, while the musical backings are as lush and flowing as ever ... There are many recognizable Blue Nile motifs throughout—the imagery of rain, railway stations, traffic and rooftops will certainly be familiar—and the tempo barely rises above a stately shuffle, which for some might seem a missed opportunity for stylistic innovation. However, for those of us who've cherished the band's previous albums, High is like meeting a new friend, albeit one possessing a reassuring familiarity.\\" Other reviewers were less enthusiastic: Stylus Magazine said, \\"If you were hoping for something to stand above Hats as a late-night, solitary classic, then High will only get halfway there, because it sounds exactly as you would expect a fourth Blue Nile album to sound. Perhaps their best music has long since been made, but The Blue Nile still do what they do exquisitely well.\\" The Observer was disappointed, saying \\"the empty streets of provincial towns are the stock-in-trade landscapes of the Blue Nile, and it's one of the saddening facts about High that those landscapes have become a little predictable\\", while Uncut said that \\"Paul Buchanan revisits the same spot on the hillside overlooking the evening city lights, is still filled with the same surging, oblique melancholy and longing that has sustained The Blue Nile since 1984, is still crafting singularly mature MOR in a darker shade of turquoise all his own. This time, however, the overall return feels diminished in effect.\\" Track listing All songs written and composed by Paul Buchanan. #\\"The Days of Our Lives\\" – 3:32 #\\"I Would Never\\" – 4:26 #\\"Broken Loves\\" – 5:20 #\\"Because of Toledo\\" – 3:53 #\\"She Saw the World\\" – 3:36 #\\"High\\" – 3:46 #\\"Soul Boy\\" – 4:40 #\\"Everybody Else\\" – 3:50 #\\"Stay Close\\" – 7:46 2020 Remastered Collector's Edition CD bonus disc #\\"Wasted\\" (Previously unreleased) – 5:52 #\\"The Days of Our Lives\\" (Remix) – 5:13 #\\"She Saw the World\\" (Remix) – 3:52 #\\"I\\" (Previously unreleased) – 6:37 #\\"Big Town\\" (Previously unreleased) – 5:51 #\\"Here Come the Bluebirds\\" (Previously unreleased) – 4:51 Personnel ;The Blue Nile *Robert Bell – bass, synthesizers *Paul Buchanan – vocals, guitar, synthesizers *Paul Joseph Moore – keyboards, synthesizers ;Additional personnel *Calum Malcolm – engineer References External links * The Blue Nile official web site *The Blue Nile Fan pages Web site Category:The Blue Nile albums Category:2004 albums Category:Sanctuary Records albums ","title":"High (The Blue Nile album)"},{"id":"4243553","text":"Zaragoza station ( or Terminal Zaragoza) is a station on Line 2 of the Monterrey Metro.

History Early Years The station first signed on the air on December 9, 1959, as KCJC.Broadcasting Yearbook 1961-1962 page B-66 It was owned by Futura Music, Inc. and had studios on Rock Creek Lane in Mission, Kansas. In 1967, Starr Broadcasting acquired both KCJC and KUDL AM 1380 (now KCNW) in nearby Fairway, Kansas. KCJC began to simulcast the Top 40 format on KUDL and switched its call sign to KUDL-FM in 1971.Broadcasting Yearbook 1972 page B-80 The Top 40 hits gave way briefly to a progressive rock format. Then in 1972, the station became Kansas City's second FM station targeting the African-American community, after KPRS-FM, and aired an R&B;/soul music format. In 1973, KUDL switched back to a progressive rock format until 1975, when it reverted to Top 40. The following year, it began calling itself \\"Disco 98\\" with a disco music format. Final logo as KUDL Soft Rock KUDL In 1977, KUDL switched to their long running soft rock format. The format lasted through the 1980s and early 1990s, although modified to a soft adult contemporary format, which would later transition to a more upbeat direction by 2000. In 1978, KUDL and AM 1380, which aired an all-news format, would separate, as the latter was sold to new owners. In 1993, Apollo Broadcasting bought KUDL and WHB from Shamrock Broadcasting.Broadcasting Yearbook 1994 page B-142 Apollo then sold WHB to local broadcaster Kanza, Inc., on the same day. In June 1995, Regent Communications bought the station, then Jacor in October 1996, and finally to Entercom in October 1997.\\"KMXV and KUDL have new owners, but no changes in sight\\", The Kansas City Star, June 30, 1995.\\"Two KC stations to be sold; Jacor boosts radio holdings with deal to buy KMXV, KUDL\\", The Kansas City Star, October 10, 1996.Broadcasting Yearbook 1998 page D-170 In 2003, Entercom dropped the smooth jazz format of KCIY, moving that station to country music. However, KUDL continued airing Smooth Jazz on Sunday mornings, 7 to 11 a.m., hosted by Taylor Scott. In 2010, KUDL changed its positioning slogan from \\"98.1 KUDL\\" to \\"Soft Rock 98.1.\\" On November 1, 2006, KUDL switched over to the all-Christmas music, continuing through Christmas Day. In 2009, KUDL also was early in beginning its Christmas music, well before Thanksgiving Day. Switch to Talk On March 23, 2011, sister station KGEX flipped to a more modern-leaning Adult Contemporary format as \\"99-7 The Point\\" that contained some overlap with KUDL. One hour after \\"The Point\\" launched, KUDL shocked longtime listeners as they announced that they would terminate their adult contemporary format after 34 years and begin simulcasting sister station KMBZ, likely due to mediocre ratings, holding a relatively low 3.4 share in the most recent Kansas City Arbitron ratings report (February 2011), as well as a likely negative connection to the call letters KUDL, which likely turned away younger demographics. After the announcement was made, KUDL then began running liners redirecting listeners to 99.7. KUDL morning host Tanna Guthrie moved to afternoons on 99.7, and afternoon host Roger Carson moved to mornings on sister station WDAF-FM, where he replaced Blake Powers. The station held a two-hour farewell show on March 28, before KUDL closed out its heritage format at 8 a.m. that day with \\"Hold On to the Nights\\" by Richard Marx. Following the show, KUDL began simulcasting 99.7 for three days, as another way to redirect listeners to the frequency. On March 30, at 2 p.m., after playing \\"Something to Talk About\\" by Bonnie Raitt, KUDL broke from the simulcast and became KMBZ- FM.Aaron Barnhart, \\"Talk radio station KMBZ-AM to be simulcast on FM dial\\", The Kansas City Star, March 25, 2011. 98.1 KUDL Becomes NewsTalk KMBZ-FM In addition, KMBZ-FM replaced its classical music format on its HD2 subchannel.

He was born in Stonyford, Ireland in 1835 and came to Thorold in Upper Canada with his family the same year. He attended Victoria College in Cobourg, receiving an LLB in 1864. He was elected to the university's senate in the following year. He also worked with his father and brother in the timber trade. Their company operated a sawmill on the Seguin River at Parry Sound, primarily managed by William, and a steamship service between Collingwood, Parry Sound and Port Arthur/Fort William (Thunder Bay), mainly operated by his brother James Hughes. The firm set up a town at Parry Sound and William also served as a lay Methodist minister for the community. In 1867, he was unsuccessful in a bid to represent Algoma in the House of Commons of Canada, losing by 9 votes; he was elected to represent Welland in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario later that same year. He was not reelected in the next general election in 1871. Later that year, the operation in Parry Sound was sold and Beatty settled there. He bought out his brother and father's share in the town site and set up a general store there. With Beatty's support, a vote was taken to keep the township free of alcohol under the terms of the Dunkin Act. Up until 1950, anyone who bought land in the town had to sign an agreement not to sell alcohol on their premises. Over the years, Beatty operated a number of mills at Parry Sound. He also retained a share in the shipping operation. He operated a hotel located on the waterfront and helped establish a railway line to Parry Sound, which was later taken over by John Rudolphus Booth's Ottawa, Arnprior & Parry Sound Railway. He died at Parry Sound in 1898.

It is the largest and one of the most isolated cattle ranch in Guyana. Location Dadanawa Ranch is one of the most remote ranches in the world containing about 5,000 head of cattle. It is located on the Rupununi River in the South Rupununi savannahs, in the Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo Region of Guyana. Ranch workers or vaqueros, are local cowboys, who operate barefoot and are responsible for managing ranch livestock. The preferred means of travel to Dadanawa is by jeep. It takes about 3.5 hours to drive from Lethem to Dadanawa in the dry season, and as much as 3 days in the wet season. Tourists often stay at Dadanawa and use the ranch as a base for further journeys throughout the South Rupununi. History The name \\"Dadanawa\\" is a distortion of the local Wapishana Amerindian name of Dadinauwau, or \\"macaw spirit creek hill\\". Dadanawa started out as a trading post by a man of the name DeRooie about 1865 and was sold with 300 head of cattle in the late 1880s to H.P.C. Melville, a gold prospector from Barbados who found himself lost and near-dead of malaria in the area several years before. The ranch was sold to investors and established as the Rupununi Development Company in 1919. Workers Ranch cowboys are called \\"vaqueros\\", most of whom are Wapishana Amerindians. The ranch supports over 40 people in the main compound including the direct and extended families of the manager and staff, some of which extend for 3 generations. The ranch is now run by Duane de Freitas, his wife Sandie and son Justin along with his Irish partner, Erin Earl. They run an Ecotourism business from the ranch and visitors from all over the world come to birdwatch or go on river trips in the savannahs and Amazon rainforest. Duane and Justin have set up the Rupununi Conservation Society to protect the highly endangered Siskins and other bird and river turtle species. Harry E Turner Harry E Turner was an English ex-cavalry officer who said that he had ridden in the last British army cavalry charge in the Middle East during the First World War.

Biopsies of skin lesions, lymph nodes, and bone marrow demonstrate the presence of organisms on histopathology. Treatment  Talaromyces marneffei demonstrates in vitro susceptibility to multiple antifungal agents including ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, flucytosine, and amphotericin B.

The film is a dramatization of Norwegian author Oluf Falck-Ytter's book Haakon Haakonsen: En Norsk Robinson (Haakon Haakonsen: A Norwegian Robinson). The movie was produced by a consortium of Scandinavian companies and released in the US in an English- language version by Walt Disney Pictures. Plot Haakon Haakonsen (Stian Smestad), a young Norwegian boy in the 1850s, becomes the sole support of his family as a cabin boy on a ship after his father is injured. Jens (Trond Peter Stamsø Munch), a family friend and a fellow shipmate of Haakon's father, becomes an older brother to Haakon on their voyage. At first, Haakon has a difficult time adjusting to life at sea, but eventually earns the respect of his shipmates. After shore-leave in London, a British naval officer, supposedly known as Howell, joins the crew ostensibly to provide protection from pirates. Haakon learns that Howell has secretly brought guns onto the ship, and Howell attempts to persuade Haakon not to say anything about the guns to the captain. After the mysterious death of the admired captain (who had been poisoned by Howell's first mate), Howell assumes command. Upon arriving in Sydney, shore-leave is abruptly cancelled and a suspicious new batch of sailors come on board. After departing Australia, Haakon discovers a stowaway (Louisa Milwood-Haigh) named Mary who turns into a love interest. Work on board ship soon becomes terrible for Haakon, Jens, and the original sailors, which intensifies when the new captain finds Mary and demands whomever has been fraternizing with her to show his face. Haakon admits responsibility, and the captain sentences him to be lashed with the cat o'nine tails. Jens protests, saying that whipping Haakon would be an effective death penalty, to which Howell orders that Jens will administer the punishment to Haakon instead of Howell. However, the court martial is interrupted by a terrible storm that damages the mainmast, then sinks the ship. Haakon manages to rescue Mary from the brig but in the confusion is separated from the crew and wakes alone up on a deserted tropical island. After searching the island, Haakon discovers treasure as well as wanted posters for an English pirate named Merrick, who looks identical to Howell. (In the first scene of the film, the real Howell was murdered by Merrick, who then stole the identity as a doppelganger). Haakon discovers that the suspicious shipmates (i.e. the new batch of abusive shipmates who were brought on after Merrick's captaincy) are really pirates, who stored the treasure during a hot pursuit from naval forces, and will soon return to the island to extract their loot. Following a self-training with a sword and gun, Haakon manages to use a horn when a gorilla attacks. This makes the gorilla docile, who then starts to befriend Haakon, behaving like a pet. Haakon devises a set of booby traps anticipating that the pirates will soon return for their treasure. Although Haakon adjusts to the island, he misses Jens, and more so his family back in Norway. One day, Haakon sees smoke from a distant island and tries various attempts to get there on a raft of his own. Upon successfully arriving there, he finds a village of natives doing a night dance. Haakon encounters Mary in the middle of an altercation with several of the natives. Misinterpreting the situation, Haakon reveals himself and frightens the natives with a gunshot until he backs into Jens, who explains that the natives are peaceful and saved his and Mary's lives. The reunited trio happily depart for Haakon's island the next day. Shortly thereafter, the three friends witness the arrival of the pirates along with Berg and Steine (Knut Walle and Harald Brenna), two of Jens' friends who survived the sinking ship and are being held prisoner. After Haakon's traps fail to work, he quickly devises a plan to save their friends. At night, Mary sneaks aboard the ship and frees the remaining crew who manage to overpower their pirate guards and retake the ship. Meanwhile, on land, Haakon and Jens manage to distract the pirates long enough to free Berg and Steine and narrowly make it back to the ship, stranding the pirates on the island. Haakon, Jens, Mary and the liberated crew return to their native Norway. Each man keeps a small share of the treasure, with Haakon deciding to use his share to help his impoverished family. Back home in Norway, Haakon reunites with his family and introduces them to Mary. His parents agree to take her in until she can reestablish contact with her own relatives.

Production The original 1873 Norwegian novel, aimed at young readers, was inspired by another adventure classic, Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. The film was shot on location in Fiji, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom in July to October 1989. In the original version of the film, the Norwegian characters speaks Norwegian to each other and English to English characters, while the English characters speaks English only. In the international version, all lines in Norwegian are dubbed over in English, in most cases by the Norwegian actors themselves. Reception The film has received favorable reviews as a well-made adventure for families.

It was originally published in Battle Picture Weekly from January 1979 to October 1986. It later covered the Russian Civil War and, in episodes written by Scott Goodall, the early part of the Second World War. Publishing history Described by Andrew Harrison as \\"the greatest British comic strip ever created\\", Charley's War tells the story of an underage British soldier called Charley Bourne. Charley joins the British Army during World War I at the age of 16 (having lied about his age and told the recruiting officers that he was 18; they conveniently overlook the fact that Charley gives his date of birth on his application form as 1900), and is quickly thrust into the Battle of the Somme. The strip follows Charley's life in the trenches and his experiences during the war. Colquhoun put a meticulous level of research into the already well-researched scripts which Mills provided. The strip rarely flinched from providing an extremely frank portrayal of the horrors of war, so much so that in some later reprintings some of the artwork was censored. Mills added a political slant in the strip not seen in British war comics and avoided the standard heroics common in war comics generally. In addition to depicting Charley's own experiences of the war, the comic took the risk of going off on several tangents, temporarily shifting the focus to characters in different locations and time periods. The first and most successful tangent was the story of 'Blue', a British soldier in the French Foreign Legion who fought with them at Verdun in 1916 before deserting and making his way back to England (where he meets Charley). Another diversion was when the storyline turned to Charley's younger brother Wilf and his experiences as an observer/gunner in the Royal Flying Corps in early 1918. The final and least successful tangent was the story of Charley's cousin Jack Bourne, a sailor in the Royal Navy and the story of his ship HMS Kent and its participation in the Battle of the Falklands in 1914. Unlike the previous diversions, this new change of setting received poor feedback from readers and the editor of Battle ordered Mills to return the storyline to Charley in the trenches, much to Mills' disappointment who had originally planned to continue Jack's story on into the Battle of Jutland in 1916.Mills, Pat & Colquhoun, Joe. Charley's War: Volume 1. Titan Books, London. 2004. p6-8 The strip followed Charley through to the end of the war and through into the invasion of Russia in 1919. However, in January 1985, Mills quit the strip before being able to complete the story (he intended the story to end in 1933, with Charley on the dole as Hitler is made Chancellor of Germany) due to a dispute over his research budget. Mills was replaced by Scott Goodall and the story was moved to the Second World War and became a more conventional war adventure strip. However, the series ended in the early part of the Second World War after Charley is one of the lucky ones successfully evacuated from Dunkirk (along with his son), realising he is too old for soldiering any more. The story ends with him wondering how he came to become a soldier in the first place, leading into a re-run of the strip within Battle Picture Weekly until that comic folded. In reality, the ending of Charley's War was down to the poor health of Joe Colquhoun, which had already caused the strip to be delayed several weeks. Out of respect for Joe, there was no question of getting another artist to take over production, and it was felt best to simply draw it to a close. In 1988, Battle was folded into Eagle, which also began reprinting Charley's War, which became one of the mainstays of the title. By 1990, the storyline had reached 1917 and Charley's time as a stretcher bearer, but with the comic about to be revamped and most of the strips about to be dropped, the title skipped ahead to the conclusion of the First World War and the end of Charley's conflict with Captain Snell in order to give it some conclusion. Episodes of Charley's War were reprinted in the Judge Dredd Megazine (#211–244, in 2003–2006). The whole series was collected in ten graphic novels by Titan Books between 2004 and 2013. Rebellion's Treasury of British Comics imprint began a new series of graphic novels in 2018. Charley's War was featured in \\"Boys and Girls,\\" the second programme of Comics Britannia on BBC Four. Charley's War was the subject of a display dispersed around the Musée de la Grande Guerre du Pays de Meaux in France (from 16 October 2014 to 4 January 2015). Plot summary *June–December 1916. Sixteen-year-old Charley Bourne from London's East-End enlists in the British army. Arrives on the Western Front in France shortly before the beginning of the Battle of the Somme. His platoon is commanded by Lt Thomas and Sgt 'Ole Bill' Tozer and private Ginger Jones becomes Charley's best mate. Participates in the opening day of the Somme on 1 July. The platoon suffers heavy losses. Charley witnesses the last British Cavalry charge and takes part in the combat debut of the new Tanks. Guilt-strickened veteran Lonely sacrifices himself to expose the location of a German ambush. Lt Thomas saves the platoon by withdrawing without orders and he is arrested and executed for cowardice. Charley and Weeper Watkins endure harsh field punishment for refusing to join Thomas' firing squad. Ginger is killed by a random shell. Oiley Oliver arrives but does not last long, escaping via a self-inflicted injury. The German 'Judgement Troopers' led by the ruthless Colonel Ziess stage a counter-attack, penetrating deep into the British lines and nearly wiping out Charley's platoon but their success is halted by the German high command's refusal to give Ziess reinforcements. Charley is wounded by a stray shell. *January–March 1917. Charley recuperates in hospital and has a spell of leave in London. Discovers Oiley's criminal activities. Charley rescues his mother from a munitions factory during a Zeppelin raid. Encounters deserter Blue and aids his escape after the latter tells him of his experiences with the French Foreign Legion at the Battle of Verdun. *April–May 1917. Charley returns to the Western Front where Cpt Snell (who he encountered as a lieutenant during the Somme) is now his commander. Snell is a ruthless leader who does not care about the welfare of his men. Charley becomes Snell's batman for a short period. A burly veteran Grogan bullies a bookwormish newcomer Scholar and other conscripts. Charley intervenes and he and Grogan eventually fight but the latter is accidentally killed when a discarded shell he picked up to throw at Charley turns out to be live and explodes in his hand. Weeper is wounded and later deserts. During a march to the rear in fierce heat, Sgt Tozer passes out with exhaustion and Snell demotes him to private. *June–July 1917. Snell volunteers the platoon to become miners to plant underground explosives under the German trenches. One of the men, Budgie, is a conscientious objector and Charley defends him from abuse by others. Charley and several of his comrades narrowly survive a cave-in and they break into and destroy a German tunnel. An increasingly pompous Scholar wrangles a transfer away to officer training and Charley begins to regret having helped him. The huge mine that the platoon has set beneath the German lines fails to detonate and an enraged Snell accuses Budgie of sabotage and shoots him dead. Charley follows Snell into the tunnels, intending to kill the latter but another soldier with the same plan gets there before him. In the shootout that follows, Snell is struck in the head by a ricochet and sent away in a coma. * August–September 1917. Charley's unit takes part in the Battle of Third Ypres. Charley finds and rescues his wounded brother Wilf who has joined up under-age by assuming the identity of a deserter (in a scheme arranged by Oiley). The unit is sent to the training camp at Etaples to prepare for the next great offensive. The harsh and cruelly strict conditions enrage the veteran, war- weary soldiers, eventually igniting the Etaples Mutiny. Charley encounters Blue who is posing as a British officer whilst smuggling food to his gang of deserters hiding in nearby woods. Tozer is remade a Sergeant. Weeper who had been arrested for desertion is freed during the mutiny but is killed whilst saving Charley from a knife attack by another deserter. The mutiny is a success, improving conditions at the camp but Charley is then returned to the trenches. *October–December 1917. The muddy hell of Passchendaele. Sickened by the slaughter, Charley volunteers to be a stretcher-bearer, a duty he performs bravely but he is falsely accused of looting the dead and sacked. A massive British tank attack breaks the German line at Cambrai but the offensive is halted due to in-decision by the British commanders. Scholar returns from officer training. Charley is detailed to become a sniper and the platoon occupies a sector opposite the unit of Corporal Adolf Hitler. Charley and Hitler fight hand-to-hand during a trench raid, nearly killing each other. The two sides enjoy a Christmas truce but Hitler stays in his dugout, refusing to take part. * January–February 1918. Wilf has transferred to the RFC and is now an observer/gunner in a Bristol F2B squadron. He shoots down several German planes but narrowly avoids death when he is shot down and his pilot Captain Morgan is killed. Back in the trenches, Charley accidentally shoots himself in the foot and is accused of cowardice by the Scholar. Whilst in hospital he meets a nurse Kate and after a frosty start, the former realises Charley is no coward and the two begin a romantic relationship. A written statement from a dying officer saves Charley from a conviction and he and Kate go on leave in London. Snell, rendered psychotic by his head wound, attempts to murder Charley and Kate. *March–June 1918. Charley marries Kate. Whilst on their honeymoon, they receive the news that Wilf is dead, having been shot down after bringing down a German Zeppelin heavy bomber over London. Charley's cousin Jack, a sailor in the Royal Navy, tells of his experiences at the Battle of the Falklands in 1914. Charley, now a Lance-Corporal, returns to the Front, just in time for the massive and sudden German Spring Offensive. The German Stormtroopers attack Charley's sector and Scholar is set ablaze by a flame-thrower. Charley cannot bring himself to put the dying Scholar out of his agony but the deed is performed by newcomer Skin. Charley rallies a rag- tag group of stragglers and looters to mount a last-ditch defence of the town of Albert. Skin is seen talking to a German soldier who is revealed to be his brother but not before the latter is fatally shot by another Briton. During a battle against the new German tanks, Charley meets Snell, who has managed to secure a transfer back to the fighting, despite being virtually insane. Charley is promoted to full Corporal. Snell murders an African-American Doughboy named 'Pig-Iron' that Charley has befriended and then later kills a British officer who witnessed the earlier crime. *July–November 1918. After a battle against German commandoes, Charley is captured and sent to a POW camp where he meets his cousin Jack. After three attempts, the pair escape and Charley rejoins his unit. The platoon advances towards Germany during the final weeks of the war, taking part in the crossing of the St. Quentin Canal. Skin is shot dead by Snell after the former protests at the latter's execution of German prisoners. On 11 November, the final day of the war, Snell is determined to have the symbolic honour of reaching Mons, pointlessly expending his men's lives. After the platoon is wiped out only minutes before the 11am ceasefire, Snell and Charley have a final showdown. Snell is about to kill Charley but the former is drenched by an acid-sprayer wielded by a surviving German. Ignoring Snell's pleas to be put of his misery, Charley walks away leaving his nemesis to die slowly. Snell's final action had been to 'volunteer' Charley to join the British Expeditionary Force to the Russian Civil War. *January–October 1919. Charley and Bill Tozer head to Russia where they fight alongside the 'Whites'- pro-Monarchist Russians-against the Bolshevik Reds who are defending their Revolution, with Tozer serving as company sergeant major. Charley soon becomes disillusioned at the incompetence and cowardice amongst the Whites, some of whom change sides and join the Reds. Charley prevents rogue Bolshevik Colonel Spirodonov from capturing a White armoured train loaded with refugees and royal gold. *1933. The Great Depression and Charley is on the dole. News arrives that Hitler has seized power in Germany. At this point, writer Pat Mills ceased work on the comic and was replaced by Scott Goodall. *September 1939 – June 1940. Charley reluctantly enlists in the British Army again after learning his son Len has joined up. Joins the BEF in France and participates in the heavy fighting against the German Blitzkrieg and in the long and confused retreat to Dunkirk. Back in England, Ole Bill has joined the Home Guard. Charley's wife Kate is falsely arrested for black-marketeering as, unbeknown to her, Oiley has been stashing stolen goods in her home. Oiley tries to have Bill murdered but the attempt fails and Bill beats Oiley into confessing, freeing Kate from prison. Back in France, Charley finds his shell-shocked son Len at Dunkirk and they escape back to Britain together. Charley decides he has had enough of war. Major characters Charley Bourne- The central character and hero of the series. A working-class London lad from a close-knit family, he enlists in the British Army in 1916, age sixteen and arrives in the trenches on the Western Front shortly before the start of the Somme Campaign. Naive and not too bright, Bourne nonetheless gets much hard-earned worldly wisdom as he experiences and survives the horrors of the Great War for the next three years and beyond. Exceptionally brave, loyal to his comrades and quick to defend those who are suffering bullying or injustice, Bourne makes friends and enemies in equal numbers. His fundamental decency and conscientious sense of duty are sometimes at odds with his anger at the many injustices of military life and his growing disillusionment over the conduct of the war. Sergeant 'Ole Bill' Tozer- The veteran Platoon-Sgt, Ole Bill is one of the very few who makes it all the way through the war with Bourne more or less in one piece. An old pre-war Regular soldier, he was one of the BEF's 'Old Contemptibles' who fought at Mons in August 1914. Burly, loud, fond of a drink and seemingly indestructable, Bill's roaring voice and courage help Charley and his fellows out of trouble time and time again. Ginger Jones- Charley's best pal on the Somme in 1916. Never a natural-born soldier and always the first to complain, Ginger makes up for his lack of enthusiasm with his sense of humour and cunning. Despite himself, he survives numerous tight-spots alongside Charley in 1916. Lieutenant Thomas- Charley's first platoon commander and easily the best officer he serves under during the war. Public-schooled but enlightened, brave but never blood-thirsty, Thomas is a decent man who represents the best of his class. Lieutenant (later Captain) D'Arcy Snell- A vicious, pompous and war-loving officer, Snell treats the war as a marvellous sport and his men as expendable examples of the lower classes who must be kept in their place. Snell becomes Charley's platoon commander after the death of Thomas and he remains Charley's ultimate nemesis. Lonely- A traumatised veteran who was the sole survivor of his platoon when it was wiped out in 1915 due to a recklessly cruel act by Lt Snell. Wracked by guilt, he confides in Charley the truth of what happened. Blue- A British deserter from the French Foreign Legion, 'Blue' fled to England after surviving the hellish Battle of Verdun in 1916 in which most of his fellow Legionaries were slaughtered. Charley reluctantly helps Blue to avoid capture whilst in Britain and later encounters him again during the infamous Etaples Mutiny in 1917. Despite his misgivings over Blue's desertion, Charley cannot help but feel a kinship with him due to their common resentment of the military hierarchy and Charley's realisation that, with less fortunate circumstances, he could have easily ended up the same way. Weeper Watkins- Injured by poison gas that left his tear-ducts constantly running, Weeper is a cheeky rebel who hates the war and despises the army and he suffers badly for his insubordination. He eventually deserts but is recaptured in 1917. Ernie Stubbs- A short soldier who is one of the officers' servants during Charley's time as Snell's batman. He once served in the Bantams until his regiments was disbanded because of heavy casualties. Captured during a raid on the trench, he is killed by Adolf Hitler with a grenade when he tries to escape. The Scholar- Joining Charley's platoon as a young private after the Somme, the Scholar, a gentle & timid book-worm, is bullied viciously by a burly veteran named Grogan. Charley steps in to help, leading to a fight in which Grogan is accidentally killed. The Scholar soon turns out to be a two- faced cunning snob who wrangles a transfer to officer training and he later returns as the platoon-commander who thinly conceals his fear behind his pomposity and petty resentment of Charley. Earwig- A one-time crony of Grogan's and the regiment's barber. He holds a grudge against Charley for his role in Grogan's death and they often clash. He dies at the Third Battle of Ypres, after taking shelter in a shell hole full of mustard gas. Budgie- A conscientious objector who has been forced into the army through torture and intimidation and works as a miner alongside Charley in 1917 employed to lay explosive mines beneath the German lines. Budgie has swore never to kill a fellow human being. Sadders- A terminally pessimistic soldier with a morbid fear of being gassed. He becomes one of Charley's regular companions during Etaples and Passchendaele. He is later killed by a sniper. Wilfred Bourne- Charley's younger brother, 'Wilf' enters the army under-age by assuming the identity of a deserter. Injured on the Western Front in 1917, Wilf transfers to the Royal Flying Corps and serves as an observer/gunner in a two-seater Bristol squadron. Captain Morgan- Wilf's pilot & commander whose previous three observers have all been killed. Morgan is a tough, hard-bitten pilot who has no tolerance for shirkers nor for the chivalrous pretensions of his fellow officers. Jack Bourne- Charley's cousin and a sailor in the Royal Navy who fought at the Battle of the Falklands in 1914. He and Charley meet each other in a German POW camp in 1918. Oiley Oliver- Charley's brother-in-law, he arrives at the front as a private during the Somme Campaign and soon proves to be a snivelling coward. Escaping from the war with a self-inflicted injury, he returns to London to become a con-man, black marketeer and stand-over merchant. Smith 70 & Young Albert- Smith is the eccentric & cheerful machine- gunner who regards his work as both a science and an art-form and Albert is his injury-prone but un-complaining loader. Dr No- British Army doctor who treats wounded troops at a forward aid station. Known for his cold and callous attitudes towards the suffering of injured soldiers, refusing to allow even badly injured men to be sent to the rear, often dispensing the dreaded 'Number 9' pill, a strong laxative intended to 'cure' all ailments. Charley initially despises him but he later learns of the horrific conditions and immense pressures that the exhausted doctor works under. Kate- A young nurse who lost her fiance at Gallipoli in 1915 and who tends to Charley when he is hospitalised in early 1918 with an accidental self-inflicted wound. After a tense beginning, the relationship blossoms into romance and the pair eventually marry and after the war have a son, Len. Skin Skorczyk- British soldier whose parents were born in German-ruled Silesia and whose brother is in the German army. Corporal Pig-Iron- an African-American Doughboy of the 'Harlem's Hell-fighters'. Colonel Ziess- Tough, brave and ruthless German officer who commands the veteran 'Judgement Troopers' and launches a deadly counter-attack on the Somme against the sector where Charley's platoon is located. Having risen from humble origins, Ziess despises his more aristocratic peers and instead believes in the modern ideas of war- 'total' war to be waged without mercy. Corporal Adolf Hitler- In December 1917, Charley's unit is located in the sector opposite the regiment of the young Hitler who appears here as a short-tempered, idealistic, selfishly brave and somewhat pompous soldier who is tolerated, rather than liked, by his comrades. Unteroffizier 'Guts' Guttenheim- Sadistic German officer who runs the POW camp that Charley and Jack are confined in during the summer of 1918. Warrior- A British army horse that Charley, who grew up working with horses, saves the life of in 1916 and encounters several times during the rest of the war, the two sharing a certain bond. Colonel Spirodonov- Bolshevik officer in the Russian Civil War. A former soldier in the Czar's army, he suffered brutally in a penal battalion forced to build the so-called 'Death Railway' in Murmansk. Knowing the railway was commissioned and paid for by the British government, he has vowed revenge on all Englishmen. Len Bourne- Charley and Kate's son, who after a row with his parents joins the British Army. At one point Charley believes Len to have been killed only for them to reunite outside Dunkirk, although Len has severe Shell Shock and nearly causes the death of his father. Joe 'Wattsie' Watts- A former Jockey and member of Charley's section in France, 1940. Wattsie and Charley become best friends and manage to escape to the Dunkirk perimeter before Wattsie is seriously wounded. Sergeant Bert 'Ol Nick' Nickles- Charley's Platoon Sergeant in the B.E.F. and nemesis. Nickles, who is vicious and nasty, resents Charley's experience from the Great War. 'Ol Nick becomes more and more sadistic until he meets his match in Major Klaus Rimmer, also known as Atilla the Hun. Archie Bentall & Cyril 'Handy' Hordle- Cut off from their unit like Charley and Wattsie, they join up and escape the attacking German Army in a Bren Carrier they find in a barn. The four have various adventures during the retreat from Belgium until Wattsie is crippled by Panzer fire, and later Handy is killed and Charley wounded by German sniper Heinrich Horst.

He was one of the foremost virtuoso performers of his era and spent the vast majority of his career as the first violoncellist of the ″Veneranda Arca″ at the Basilica del Santo in Padua, where Tartini was first violinist and concertmaster. Upon the death of Tartini, he returned to Bologna, the city of his birth, where he died in 1778. Career Vandini was born in 1691 in Bologna, though we know next to nothing about his early life or musical training. His first documented playing position is at the church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Bergamo which he obtained in April of 1720. Concurrently he was also Maestro di violoncello at the Ospedale della Pietà in Venice. During this period he was almost certainly performing extensively throughout northern Italy. In June of 1721 he obtained the solo cello position in Padua which he would hold, with a few short hiatuses, for the rest of his career. In Padua he worked with a number of other notable musicians in addition to Tartini, including the Oboist Matteo Bissoli and the organist and Maestro di capella Antonio Vallotti. The principal players of the Veneranda Arca toured Italy regularly, making documented appearances in Assisi and Rome. His only prolonged absence was a three year period from 1723 to 1726 where Vandini, along with Tartini, left Padua to join the service of Count Kinsky in Prague. Playing Style The English traveler and musical critic Charles Burney attended a mass at the Basilica in Padua in 1770. He wrote the following about the orchestra there and Vandini in particular: ″I wanted much to hear [...] the famous old Antonio Vandini, on the violoncello, who, the Italians say, plays and expresses a parlare, that is, in such a manner as to make his instrument speak; but neither of these performers had solo parts. However, I give them credit for great abilities, as they are highly extolled by their countrymen, who must, by the frequent hearing of excellent performers of all kinds, insensibly become good judges of musical merit. [...] It was remarkable that Antonio [Vandini], and all the other violoncello players here, hold the bow in the old-fashioned way, with the hand under it.” Through Burney's anonymous informers it is clear that Vandini was well known for his expressive, rhetorical playing that evoked speech. By examining his seven surviving works and the concertos written for him by Tartini it is clear that he had formidable technical ability, being one of the first composers to write music requiring the use of thumb position. Works Vandini has seven surviving works, all of which are preserved in manuscript copies throughout Europe, namely in Venice, Berlin, Paris, and Schwerin. All of these pieces are written in the galant style, popular in Italy in the eighteenth century. Notably, the two short sonatas attributed to Vandini by Carl Schroeder in 1911 and published by Schott are completely spurious and do not represent his style. A full list of his works is below with the catalogue numbers proposed by Elinor Frey and Marc Vanscheeuwijk. Sonata à Violoncello solo del Signor D. Antonio Vandini, in C Major (1717, I-Vnm, Mss.

Shaw would make in excess of 400 appearances for United over the following sixteen years; however, he found first-team opportunities limited after 1965, and in 1967 moved to Doncaster Rovers. He stayed at Doncaster for one season before joining Scarborough as their player-manager. Shaw managed Scarborough for one season, leaving the club in 1969. Shaw died in 1998. He was the elder brother of Bernard Shaw, the Sheffield United, Wolves, and Sheffield Wednesday full back. International career At international level, Shaw won five caps for the England national side. His first cap came against the U.S.S.R. at Wembley on 22 October 1958, in a match England won 5–0. He made his last appearance for his country in 1962. Playing style Shaw was known as 'a calm, stylish player, who had pace and tackled well and could place his clearances'.

Background The band was originally formed in early 1985 by bassist Andy Robbins and guitarist Jamie Cramer. The band gained a strong local following before signing to A&M; Records in 1989. Holy Soldier was initially noted for their strong evangelical focus, although they regularly played to mainstream audiences. For a time they held one of the largest attendance records at Gazzarri's, a notable nightclub in the Hollywood circuit. In 1989 they signed to Myrrh Records, an imprint of Word/A&M;, as that label's first Hard Rock act. Their eponymous debut, produced by David Zaffiro, was released in 1990 to critical acclaim and moderate commercial success. The band garnered two Dove Awards in 1991, in the hard rock song and album of the year categories. After heavy touring the band lost two members - lead vocalist Steven Patrick, and guitarist Michael Cutting. The band replaced the members with Eric Wayne and Scott Soderstrom while continuing to tour. Wayne exited when Steven Patrick returned in 1991, but would again rejoin the group in 1995. Two years later, the band followed up their debut with Last Train. While praised, it was not a commercial success. Although Last Train charted, peaking at the No. 10 slot on Billboard's CCM chart, the album did not meet the sales expectations of the label, and the band was dropped from their roster. A review in CCM magazine found that although the band's sound had progressed, their lyrics had shifted from evangelicalism to a more ambiguous tone. Additionally, the band was criticised by some in Christian music for attempting to be a \\"crossover success\\" into the general market. The band experienced personnel changes when Steven Patrick again departed. The band again replaced Patrick with Seattle, WA vocalist Eric Wayne, who helped move the band into the current grunge sound seen in the marketplace. Wayne's lower vocal register caused Holy Soldier to be compared in the Alternative Hard Rock and Grunge market with the likes of Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Temple of the Dog, and Soundgarden. After Holy Soldier's reinvention and extensive touring, the band was signed to ForeFront Records in 1994. Once again recruiting the production skills of producer David Zaffiro, Holy Soldier released Promise Man in 1995. Promise Man returned the band to critical acclaim within Christian music circuit, again winning the band Dove Awards for in the hard rock song (for title track Promise Man) and album of the year categories. Despite the success of Promise Man, Holy Soldier was unhappy with the lack of support they received from their record label ForeFront Records and the band requested to be let out of their contract with their label. In 1997, after a short hiatus, bassist Andy Robbins independently produced on his own boutique label (Spaceport Records) a live retrospective album featuring both current frontman Eric Wayne and original vocalist Steven Patrick. After the release of Encore, Holy Soldier officially disbanded. In 2005, the original Holy Soldier line-up reunited in August for a benefit concert and possible studio album follow-up. But again, Steven Patrick's reunion with his former band members was extremely brief. Suddenly without its original lead vocalist for a third time, Holy Soldier recruited original drummer Terry Russell's brother, Don, to replace Patrick to perform for a string of festival dates in the summer of 2006.

The band was founded in 1987 in Sollentuna, Sweden. The band split up on September 20, 2014. Veni Domine combined down-tempo melodic heavy metal, symphonic metal and doom metal with occasional touches of gothic. Originally, the vocalist Fredrik Ohlsson represented operatic, high-pitched vocals but has since shifted to more lower vocal range during the years. Fall Babylon Fall and Material Sanctuary are the band's significant, acclaimed albums. During the time when these albums were released, Veni Domine was well known in the metal scene. However, as their later albums took longer time to be released and gained average reviews, Veni Domine was more or less forgotten in the metal mainstream. Currently Veni Domine is a cult band of a small audience.Kuusisto, Jari Veni Domine retrieved 2008-02-16 Veni Domine does not clearly fit into a specific category; According to the band, in doom metal festivals they are labeled as \\"power metal\\" and in power metal events as \\"doom metal\\". During the early years, the band's lyrics dealt with apocalyptic themes from Biblical point of view. Later their lyrics was more about personal topics.

Firth John Rupert Firth (June 17, 1890 in Keighley, Yorkshire – December 14, 1960 in Lindfield, West Sussex), commonly known as J. R. Firth, was an English linguist and a leading figure in British linguistics during the 1950s. He was Professor of English at the University of the Punjab from 1919–1928. He then worked in the phonetics department of University College London before moving to the School of Oriental and African Studies, where he became Professor of General Linguistics, a position he held until his retirement in 1956.John R. Firth. On Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013 Contributions to linguistics His work on prosody, which he emphasised at the expense of the phonemic principle, prefigured later work in autosegmental phonology. Firth is noted for drawing attention to the context-dependent nature of meaning with his notion of 'context of situation', and his work on collocational meaning is widely acknowledged in the field of distributional semantics. In particular, he is known for the famous quotation: : You shall know a word by the company it keeps (Firth, J. R. 1957:11) Firth developed a particular view of linguistics that has given rise to the adjective 'Firthian'. Central to this view is the idea of polysystematism. David Crystal describes this as: : an approach to linguistic analysis based on the view that language patterns cannot be accounted for in terms of a single system of analytic principles and categories ... but that different systems may need to be set up at different places within a given level of description. His approach can be considered as resuming that of Malinowski's anthropological semantics, and as a precursor of the approach of semiotic anthropology.Edwin Ardener (editor) (1971) Social anthropology and language, Milton B. Singer (1984) Man's glassy essence: explorations in semiotic anthropology Anthropological approaches to semantics are alternative to the three major types of semantics approaches: linguistic semantics, logical semantics, and General semantics.Winfried Nöth (1995) Handbook of semiotics p.103 Other independent approaches to semantics are philosophical semantics and psychological semantics. The 'London School' As a teacher in the University of London for more than 20 years, Firth influenced a generation of British linguists. The popularity of his ideas among contemporaries gave rise to what was known as the 'London School' of linguistics. Among Firth's students, the so-called neo-Firthians were exemplified by Michael Halliday, who was Professor of General Linguistics in the University of London from 1965 until 1971. Firth encouraged a number of his students, who later became well known linguists, to carry out research on a number of African and Oriental languages. T. F. Mitchell worked on Arabic and Berber, Frank R. Palmer on Ethiopian languages, including Tigre, and Michael Halliday on Chinese. Some other students whose native tongues were not English also worked with him and that enriched Firth's theory on prosodic analysis. Among his influential students were the Arab linguists Ibrahim Anis, Tammam Hassan and Kamal Bashir . Firth got many insights from work done by his students in Semitic and Oriental languages so he made a great departure from the linear analysis of phonology and morphology to a more of syntagmatic and paradigmatic analysis, where it is important to distinguish between the two levels of phonematic units (equivalent to phone) and prosodies (equivalent to features like \\"nasalization\\", \\"velarization\\" etc.). Prosodic analysis paved the way to autosegmental phonology, though many linguists, who do not have a good background on the history of phonology, do not acknowledge this.

It consists of a crane-like arm which picks up small objects by the user manipulating two attached joysticks. Its shape resembles industrial robots of the 1980s, though it is strictly user-controlled, with no automation built in. The arm has six degrees of freedom: wrist rotation (unlimited), vertical wrist flexing, horizontal elbow bending, shoulder horizontal rotation (unlimited), shoulder elevation, and the opening (releasing) and closing (grasping) of the two- fingered end-effector. The module pack of plastic items to be lifted and moved, consists of two stepped cones, two spheres, two cylinders, a flat base module, and a hinged lidded box module. The modules have molded positions for the six objects, with the spheres resting on top of the cones when they are on the box module. The user is challenged to use the arm to move the spheres and cones from the top of the box to their positions on the flat module, open the lid of the box, and then remove the cylinders from the box and place them in position on the flat module. It is possible to do all of this with the arm alone. The Armatron includes an \\"energy level\\" indicator, actually a countdown timer, above the joysticks. This can be set by the user to an initial level from 1 to 10 \\"energy\\" units and it will shut off the arm when the set time runs out. The challenge is to move the objects in limited time. Models with alternate decals or coloring were marketed under slightly different names, including the Super Armatron and the Armatron II. The original stationary version was succeeded by a mobile version with a wired remote. The arm is almost purely mechanical and with no electronic components. The only electrical components are the DC motor, switch contacts in the countdown timer, on/off switch, and the batteries. The two joysticks selectively engage or disengage gears on a set of rotating drums to control the arm's movement.

It provides advanced features such as a complex tire model (visible dirt, tire wear and flat spots, that influence the car's handling) and a fully interactive cockpit such as those seen in flight simulators. Version history Debut and Versions 1.0.x netKar Pro debuted at a fair held in Lanciano (Italy), February 24–26, 2006. Version 1.0 was released for download on April 10, 2006. Developers worked with companies involved in real car racing such as Sparco (design of steering wheels, helmets, and driving suits), AIM Sportline (official and fully functional AIM data acquisition systems are reproduced in netKar Pro), Cooper/AVON tires, Brembo (braking systems), Beta Tools; they worked also with a Formula Three team Target Racing, with the race engineer Andrea Quintarelli and the driver Riccardo Azzoli (Formula Gloria, Formula Renault and Formula Three). The success of its free predecessor netKar Namie and the anticipation created by previews of netKar Pro in the press led to high expectations from the sim racing community. However, this initial release and the subsequent patch were affected by many bugs hampering gameplay and therefore were received reluctantly by the sim racing community. In the summer of 2006, it was announced that netKar Pro and BallRacing Developments Ltd - developers of hardware and software for the professional race driver and sim racing community - have joined forces \\"to co-develop the next generation of motorsport simulation\\". BRD are using netKar Pro to help with the running of their Formula BMW team, as their version of netKar Pro has a Formula BMW car programmed in it, though it is unlikely the public will ever see this car. Also, they are running a version of the Osella PA-21 car and Hill Climb addon, which at some stage will be made available to the public. In October 2006, the netKar Pro development team released version 1.0.2, a patch that improved the multiplayer experience and fixed several other bugs present in the previous two versions. However, version 1.0.2 still had issues. The online racing community for netKar Pro is less active than other sim racing games, and contact with the developers has been sparse. Jaap Wagenvoort - a member of the online netKar Pro community - has been issuing Community Updates on many forums, trying to help improve communication problems between customers and Stefano Casillo, the game's main developer. Version 1.0.3 of the simulation was announced immediately after the release of 1.0.2, but its release was delayed multiple times due to other projects and technical problems during the development. The other projects also helped to improve netKar PRO as it allowed the development team to validate the simulation data with Formula One engineers. During the development of version 1.0.3, a lot of infrastructure- related problems were identified and required solving in order for version 1.0.3 to finally be what the simulation originally set out to be. On December 28, 2008, version 1.0.3 of netKar PRO was released, over two years after the previous release. This was a free upgrade for existing customers. Version 1.0.3 improved the multiplayer experience and increased the stability and performance. Also, new features were added like an anti-join-lag feature. Much to the pleasure of the community, flat-spotting was also reintroduced to the simulation. Version 1.0.3 was positively received by the sim racing community. Version 1.1 and the Public Beta During Summer 2009, Kunos Simulazioni announced that the next version of netKar Pro, dubbed 1.1, was to be released through a three-stage Public Beta in an effort to iron out all the bugs before reaching gold status, through the help of the community. A new bug reporting feature was added specifically for this purpose. This was meant to address concerns in the sim racing community that v1.1 might have seen the same fate of v1.0 which remained unplayable for a long time for many sim racers. Stefano Casillo also made it clear that a new course was about to start, with a more professional approach to developing software, abandoning the previous one-man- band nature of the project and forming a true, dedicated company (Kunos Simulazioni). The main goal for 1.1 was to attract new users and bring back longtime players that had lost interest in the project due to it being stagnant. This was to be accomplished by making netKar Pro more accessible without losing its commitment to realism and faithfulness, offering new content, and improving usability. A time-limited discounted offer was also made available. =Step 1/3= Beta 1/3 was released in August 2009, and featured: * A new, streamlined user interface, which included a wizard to make controller setup more straightforward. The redesigned UI abandoned standard Windows UI widgets for the most part and focused on ease of use and a sleek look. * Support for additional controllers (such as keyboards, mice, and gamepads), abandoning the previous hardcore approach of supporting only USB steering wheels. * A number of small usability features were introduced, such as automatically switching on the electric and electronic systems of the car upon entry, a step which in the past relied on the driver's intervention, and was known to be baffling for many newcomers, driving them away as a result. * Many details which made netKar Pro more faithful and realistic were removed, ultimately deemed as too hard on casual sim racers. * Reworked Force Feedback, improving realism and immersion. During the Beta 1 period, new netKar Pro licenses were sold at 19.90 € instead of the full price of 36 €. =Step 2/3= Beta 2/3 came in early September, bringing a new car, the Abarth 500 Assetto Corse, and a new fictional track called Aosta, while at the same time fixing many bugs that affected both the handling of some of the cars and the new UI. The 500 Assetto Corse received much praise from both users and professional reviewers, while Aosta, despite bringing variety to the set of existing tracks, attracted both praise and some criticism because of its high hardware requirements, and a bug that made parts of the grass appear black on a significant number of systems. As of December 2009, Kunos Simulazioni has not released a fix to this problem. During Beta 2 licenses were initially intended to be sold for 24.90 €, though at a later date Kunos Simulazioni cut the price back to 19.90 €, the same as Beta 1. =Step 3/3= Beta 3/3 was released on 16 January 2010. Although it was expected to only contain bugfixes and a revised replay interface, it contained other minor additions, such as audio level control, enhanced chat, tweaked differentials and coast torque, and many usability improvements. =1.1 Final= On April 4 a Release Candidate (1.1RC) was leaked to a German site, with the official release of 1.1 Final following on April 6. Reportedly there is no difference between 1.1RC and 1.1 Final. Even though an official changelog hasn't been released, 1.1 Final offers improved force feedback, tire model (which, according to some remarks Casillo made, is likely to be a revised version of the old 1.0.3 model) and also includes the new auto-updater system and KOF Lite, the track editor. =Beta 3/Final Delays and Controversies= Version 1.1 reignited interest in netKar Pro, but the hopes for a new course for netKar Pro started to dwindle in Autumn 2009 when Beta 3 failed to materialize. The community later independently discovered that Kunos Simulazioni had been busy preparing a free, modified version of the simulator containing only the 500 Assetto Corse, which was to be used in an online competition sponsored by MTV Italia. Marco Massarutto, Product Manager of netKar Pro, who acts as a spokesman for Kunos Simulazioni along with Casillo, replied claiming that the 500 in the MTV package was actually a dumbed-down version of netKar, only intended to be used within the boundaries of the promotional event. The netKar Pro community had to wait until January 16, 2010. Shortly afterwards Casillo announced on the public forum that \\"Full Mode\\", a gameplay mode which aims for maximum realism and is currently used by GPChampionship, the main organized racing event in the netKar Pro community, was going to be \\"deprecated\\", i.e. disappear from the GUI of netKar (thus forcing users to activate it through manually edits to the text configuration files) and eventually become unsupported. This caused concern in the community that netKar Pro will be abandoning its commitment to realism in the future and become less of a simulator and more of a video game. netKar Pro 1.1 Final was supposed to be ready within February, along with the anticipated Track Editor. Citing other work commitments, Casillo stopped posting from the official forum in March 2010. 1.1 Final eventually appeared on April 6, 2010, although without any official statements from Kunos Simulazioni. Version 1.2 The latest revision of netKar Pro is an incremental upgrade initially released to the public on November 12, 2010. Two patches, 1.2B and 1.2C followed shortly. At the time of this writing (December 2010), has brought: *A new car, the Formula KS2 based on the real-life Formula GP2. *Revised tire model. *Revised differential modeling. *Improved collision handling and sturdier cars. *Many usability improvements, minor bug fixes, and some optimizations. Version 1.3 On December 10, 2010, it was revealed that some of the announced planned developments would be released as netKar Pro v.1.3 on Christmas 2010. This update would contain: * A hill climb track (Trento-Bondone) and a new specific car, the Osella PA-21, which have been the object of much speculation since early 2007, was finally released to the public. Preview versions of this content have been around for a long time in the form of the Marangoni Simulator (which has been recently pulled off the tire manufacturer's site). This update was slated for release after 1.0.3 and subsequently delayed when 1.1 was announced. * A new car, the Shelby Daytona that was initially spotted on Marco Massarutto's YouTube channelhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qizgGDfTwD4 and subsequently announced in the same way.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_4GzjXwT90 * Support for rain, with puddles forming on the roadhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIS6U6K3-tM&feature;=player_embedded However, it was only on February 12, 2011, that a new Beta 1.3 release saw the light of the day. As of February 2011, v1.3 still hasn't been released. Planned developments Casillo has been quiet about further developments. He confirmed Kunos Simulazioni is committed to continuing development of the 1.x branch to avoid disappointing existing customers, while at the same time pointing out the shortcomings of the technology in the current netKar Pro, which would make it very hard to add new features. There have been earlier and repeated indications that Kunos Simulazioni has another, more modern and flexible engine in the workings, possibly already deployed in side projects such as a simulator developed for use in Italian driving licenses schools. However, it would seem this technology will not land in a netKar branded product any time soon. Other points worth noting are: * There are no plans to update the graphics engine in netKar. * 3D trees and real-time lighting are not technically feasible with the current technology. * An auto-banning feature may be implemented at a later stage; it is not clear which conditions would trigger it as Casillo stated things like detecting corner-cutting are too complicated problems to solve. Tracks The game comes bundled with 5 tracks, and a further 21 are available to download. Some are real, with the rest being fictional.

Early life and French Revolutionary Wars The son of a wax-maker, Louis enlisted in the Gardes Françaises in February 1781, at age 22. He rose to the rank of Corporal before leaving the service in 1787. With the outbreak of the French Revolution, Louis volunteered for the Garde Nationale of Paris in September 1789. He was elected lieutenant-colonel of the 9e Battalion de Paris in September 1792, leading that battalion on the German frontier under the Army of the Moselle until wounded in the left leg on 16 December 1793. Returning to action as colonel of the 181e Demi-Brigade in March 1794, Friant took part in the great victory of Fleurus (a stone's throw from the future battlefield of Ligny/St-Amand) on 26 June 1794. He was briefly acting- commander of a brigade (July 1794) and a division (August 1794). He served at the sieges of Maastricht (October 1794) and Luxemburg (April 1795). He was promoted to Général de Brigade on 13 June 1795. After a period as Military Governor of Luxemburg, Friant served with the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse in 1796 along the Rhine. In January 1797 he joined Bernadotte's Division of the Army of Italy. He served at the Battle of the Tagliamento (16 March 1797), and assumed command of the 5th Brigade, 3rd Division (30e and 55e Ligne) from June 1797. Napoleonic Wars Egypt General Louis Friant Friant commanded the 2nd Brigade (61e and 88e Ligne) of General Desaix's division in Egypt, taking part in the Battle of the Pyramids (21 July 1798), and in Desaix's brilliant campaign in Upper Egypt. He was provisionally promoted to Général de Division on 4 September 1799, and succeeded Desaix as commander in Upper Egypt after Desaix departed to play his decisive but fatal part in the Marengo campaign. Friant took a lead role in the suppression of the great revolt in Cairo in March–April 1800. Confirmed in the rank of Général de Division and named Governor of Alexandria in September 1800, he fought the British at the Second Battle of Aboukir (8 March 1801), and defended Alexandria through August 1801. Repatriated with the remnants of the Army of the Orient, Friant served as an inspector-general of infantry in 1801–03 before joining the Corps of his brother-in-law Davout at the Camp of Bruges. There, he molded the 2ème Division, III Corps into \\"what arguably became the finest line division on the face of the earth\\" (Bowden, Napoleon and Austerlitz). High days of the Empire In the Ulm-Austerlitz campaign of 1805, Friant's Division earned a reputation for rapid and effective marching. This quality was put to excellent use when the Division was summoned from Vienna to reinforce the Grande Armée at Austerlitz, marching 70 miles in 46 hours and arriving just in time to counterattack the Allies at Telnice and Sokolnice on the morning of 2 December 1805. In the ferocious fighting along the Goldbach stream, Friant had three horses killed under him. Friant was awarded the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor on 27 December 1805. In the 1806 campaign, at the Battle of Auerstädt (14 October 1806) in which Davout's III Corps of 26,000 men faced and defeated the Prussian main body of 63,000, Friant's Division advanced on the right, turning the Prussian left flank. The infantry of Friant and Gudin, standing in square, withstood and shattered a massive cavalry attack led by Blücher himself. In the Polish campaign, Friant's Division fought successfully at the forcing of the Ukra River on 24 December 1806. At the Battle of Eylau, Friant's Division arrived to reinforce the French right on the morning of 8 February 1807, helping to turn a near-defeat into a stalemate. Friant suffered a gunshot wound to his right side at Eylau. Friant was named Comte de l'Empire on 5 October 1808. In the 1809 campaign, Friant's Division fought with distinction at Teugen-Hausen (19 April), Abensberg (21 April), Eckmühl (22 April), and Ratisbon (23 April). At the Battle of Wagram on 6 July 1809, Friant was wounded in the shoulder by a shell fragment during the successful storming of the Square Tower at Markgrafneusiedl. Russia, Germany, France In the Russian campaign of 1812, Friant commanded the 2e Division of Davout's I Corps. In August 1812, after General Dorsenne's death, he was nominated as commander of the Grenadiers à Pied de la Vieille Garde. Friant remained at the head of his Division. He was wounded at the Battle of Smolensk (17 August) and severely wounded during the capture of Semenovskaya village at the Battle of Borodino (7 September 1812). Incapacitated and left behind at Gzhatsk, he was still there with his wounds unhealed when the retreating army returned to Gzhatsk at the end of October. Friant returned to France to recover from his wounds in January 1813. He returned to the front in June 1813, commanding the Old Guard Division at the Battles of Dresden (26 August), Leipzig (16–19 October), and Hanau (30 October 1813). In the 1814 campaign in France, Friant and his 1st Division of the Old Guard fought a successful defensive action against Gyulai's Austrians at Bar-sur-Aube on 24 January. Friant took part in Napoleon's surprise counter-offensive against Blücher's Army of Silesia, gaining victories at Montmirail (11 February), Château- Thierry (12 February), and Vauchamps (14 February 1814). Friant's Old Guard was the core and reserve of the Emperor's masse de manoeuvre. They were committed to battle in the bloody and indecisive clash at Craonne (7 March 1814), the reverse at Laon (9–10 March), the recapture of Reims (13 March), and the defeat at Arcis-sur-Aube, (20 March). Waterloo and final years His name is on the arc de triomphe in Paris During Napoleon's exile, Friant was retained as commander of the grenadiers à pied de France. In the campaign of the Hundred Days, he was Colonel-in-Chief of the Grenadiers à Pied de la Vieille Garde. His men made the final assault on Ligny as darkness fell on 16 June 1815. On 18 June, at Waterloo Friant led his Old Guard Grenadiers in the final, fateful attack on the Allied center, where he was wounded yet again. Friant retired in September 1815. He died on 24 June 1829, aged 70.

Daniel Dahm and Rudolf zur Lippe under the patronage of the Federation of German Scientists-VDW. It is the base – the “mother” of the abstract condensed version, the Potsdam Manifesto ‚We have to learn to think in a new way’ what was up to now signed by more than 130 scientists and personalities from all over the world. Both were presented to the public in Berlin in autumn 2005. The collapse of a course of action legitimised by the materialistic- deterministic world view of the classical physics is elucidated in several chapters. The \\"progressing uniformity of all ideas of value and affluence, habits of consumption and economic strategies on the pattern of a Western/American/European knowledge society\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift) and its hazards is accentuated and a rethinking towards a more holistic view and behaviour is claimed. Creativity, differentiation and connectedness are basic characteristics of life. The future is essentially open.  Process  For the initiation, scientific feedbacking in content and composition and for the multiplication of Potsdam Denkschrift & Potsdam Manifesto an intensive international scientific discourse was carried out since beginning of the Einstein-Year 2005. An interdisciplinary symposium in Potsdam to discuss a first draft of the “Denkschrift” (therefore Potsdam Denkschrift & Potsdam Manifesto) was carried out in June 2005. The resultant development of the critical and bracing symposium was the full backing of all participants, as well as the decision to publish a short Manifesto additionally to the “Denkschrift”. On October 14, 2005 both - the short Potsdam Manifesto 2005 \\"We have to learn to think in a new way\\" and the more explicit Potsdam Denkschrift 2005 - were presented to the public in Berlin. In the following months various international signees of the Potsdam Manifesto were contacted and successfully mobilized as supporters.  Background  Denkschrift and Manifesto connect to a central but not expanded appeal of the Russell–Einstein Manifesto of Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, published on the 9th of July 1955 in London: \\"We have to learn to think in a new way\\". The Russell–Einstein Manifesto was an ultimate calling for a new way of thinking that would guarantee war, in the future, to be completely banned as an instrument of politics and conflict resolution.  Starting situation  Following the basic ideas of Potsdam Denkschrift & Potsdam Manifesto the global situation at the beginning of the 21st century, 50 years after the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, confronts the humankind in an even more dangerous and more complex form. \\"Our deep worry that we, as members of the species homo sapiens, are increasingly reducing the living diversity of our earth and of our creative developmental possibilities, thus irreversibly endangering our survival in peace and our mutual exchange gives us the courage, and our awareness that we have to take new paths gives us the occasion, to compose this manifesto.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift) In this spirit it is not adequate just to answer - to give symptom remedies - to the diverse and escalating endangerments for humankind and more over for its carrying biosphere. It is urgent to detect the deeper causes covert behind these various crises syndromes. They have to be searched in the grave failures of the dominant strategies in our thinking and actions. It is obviously that the existence threatening problems of humankind are human-made too.  Re- orientations for Sustainable Development  In accordance Potsdam Denkschrift & Potsdam Manifesto enquire for the deeper sub-structures of the diverse crises symptoms. They show radical and deep going re-orientations for the sustainable development of humankind and for our thinking. \\"This wide variety of crises today confronting us and threatening to exceed our ability to cope are the expression of a mental crisis in the relation between us humans and our living world. They are symptoms of deeper causes that we have thus far neglected to seek and reveal. They are closely connected with the materialistic-mechanistic worldview favored all over the world today and with its prior history.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift) Potsdam Denkschrift & Potsdam Manifesto charge a unidirectional narrow-minded western- European-North American modelled way of thinking to stall the living co-action between humans and creatures and to hinder their viability via centralisation trends and averaging of living complexes from biosphere to anthroposphere.  Bridging Quantum Physics, Ecology and Philosophy  Via the linking up between quantum physics, ecology and philosophy Potsdam Denkschrift & Potsdam Manifesto are highlighting plurality, diversity and alteration as genuine in a living cosmos, as fundamental for a concerted evolution. The idea of a separated, fragmented reality dissolves in the micro physics and dynamically transforming and differentiating relations are taking the place of substantial segregations. The image of a world assembled from dead matter is superseded by a cosmology, what is based on an immaterial omni-connectedness and what is inherently “alive”. \\"Instead of the world assumed until now – a mechanical, temporally determined “reality” of objectifiable things, the real “Wirklichkeit” (a world that effects) turns out to be basically “potentiality”: an indivisible, immaterial, temporally essentially indeterminate and genuinely creative bonding of relations that determines only “can”-probabilities, a differentiated potential for a material-energetic realization. The Wirklichkeit’s fundamentally open, creative, immaterial omni- connectedness permits us to regard the inanimate and the animate world as merely different – statically stable respectively open and statically unstable, but dynamically stabilized – articulations of an all-embracing “pre- living” cosmos.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift) The dynamic processes of interaction and transformation within the relational webs of quantums exponentiates in a “higher” living what humans experience in the “mesosphere” of bio- and geo-ecological animated world. \\"Animate nature draws its ability for continued, creative differentiate and cooperative integration from its “pre-living” (microphysically recognizable) primordial ground, whose “information”, through instabilities, rises enhanced into the meso-sphere, where it unfolds in more intense and richer form. The “pre-living” realm thus organizes itself in the complex variety of our “higher” bio-ecological vibrancy, as we encounter it in everyday life. Cultural-ecological variety and its developmental forms, i.e., its processes of transformation and balance, ultimately also results from this context.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift) Determinisms and linear casualties are just of conditional guiltiness, are part of our instrumental knowledge. But they are not applicable to our patterns of thinking and to determine our imagined worlds via our orientation knowledge. The diverse processes and relations between individuals, cultures, organisms and ecological complexes are demanding within open systems different patterns of action and creations of strategies, than it is feasible within the old mechanistic constructions, theorems and predefinitions of the scientific description of “the” reality. \\"From this new viewpoint, the world – the Wirklichkeit – no longer appears as a theoretically closed system. This leads to an inherent indeterminism that results from the fundamental indivisibility and that is expressed in an inherent limitation of the “knowable”. Strictly speaking, we are thus forced to speak about the Wirklichkeit only in parables and analogies. There are in principle no longer answers to all the questions that, from a human standpoint, we believe we can pose, because the answers go nowhere.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift) With a “farewell” towards the old images of substance and its replacement by “relatedness” and “connectivity”, the borders between power of interpretations in-between natural sciences and humanities / cultural sciences are getting blurred. The theoretical fundamentals of verification and falsification of “reality” are - severely taken - dissolving. Also and particularly the fundamentals of our social, cultural, economical and political sciences and their traditions are put basically into question, since they constructed complex, but nevertheless deterministically closed theorems in their course of emancipation to the “hard” natural sciences. \\"The materialistic-mechanistic worldview of classical physics, with its rigid ideas and reductive way of thinking, became the supposedly scientifically legitimated ideology for vast areas of scientific and political-strategic thinking. The progressing uniformity of all ideas of value and affluence, habits of consumption and economic strategies on the pattern of a Western/North American/European knowledge society is still legitimated by a way of thinking that argues for a rational objectifiability of the Wirklichkeit on the basis of secured scientific foundations. Where conflicts arise, a lack of instrumental knowledge is diagnosed and compensatory delivery is prescribed. The foundations of this orientation are seldom questioned, though there is reason enough to do so.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift) Via those fundamental and inelastic world views economical, political and socio-cultural strategies and forms of organisation were legitimised above centuries, and, along that way, followed by increasing perils in an animated world. The recent crises scenarios are forcing up and unloading in all societal, economical, political and cultural as well as ecological levels.  Guiding to New Requirements  Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift are guiding to new requirements on our organisation and our handling within a multifarious living world. \\"Quantum physics – and not just it – challenges us to emancipate our thinking from rigid structures so that flexible relationships can take their place. It becomes possible to loosen and gently dissolve the monostructural, centralistic constructions, forms of expression preferred by the materialistic-mechanistic worldview.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift) The relief of narrow and mechanistic strategy-patterns, reductions and averaging forms a basic matter. \\"It is urgently necessary to enable an integrative cooperation among the diverse economic exchange strategies among people, communities, and their natural surroundings as well as among the patterns of distribution in production, use, and supply, in order to ensure the provision of the necessities of life and the structural and institutional prerequisites for socio-economic exchange. The development of new decentralized and polycentric structures of production, supply, and decision-making has special relevance – indeed priority.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift) Potsdam Denkschrift & Potsdam Manifesto identify necessary drastic changes concerning our future actions. They demand \\"... a strategic orientation toward the paradigm of what lives\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift). Because \\"if we continue to “tilt” our common playing field of life by unrestrainedly striving for power, so that the majority of humankind and a great part of all living creatures are slipping off, our problems will grow into a catastrophe.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift)  Appeal to Stop the Suppressing of the Potentials of Evolution  They close with the urgent appeal to stop the suppressing of the potentials of evolution via our mindset: \\"The confrontations and distortions we daily experience in our civilization should not allow ourselves to be led astray. Our existence as human beings today shows us that we, too, are the successful result of a similar development that has already gone on for billions of years.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift) Potsdam Denkschrift & Potsdam Manifest finalise with the position, that the humankind is not imprisoned in its self-constructed conditions, but - as result of an animated, basically cooperative embedding - is capable of acting and transformation: \\"For omni-connectedness, which we can also call love and from which life springs, is fundamentally inherent in us and in everything else.\\" (Potsdam Manifesto & Potsdam Denkschrift)  Signees  The Potsdam Manifesto was signed by more than 130 scientists and personalities from all over the world.

It is located in Pikesville, Maryland. The congregation's name comes from the Hebrew \\"Chizzuq 'Emunah\\", meaning \\"strengthening the faith\\". The word \\"Amuno\\" is a variant of the Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation of \\"'Emunah\\". Principles Chizuk Amuno, which defines itself as \\"a traditional, Conservative, egalitarian congregation\\" that strongly supports the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. Chizuk Amuno uses as its guiding principle the three pillars of world as stated in Pirkei Avoth 1:2, \\"Torah: Life-Long Learning,\\" \\"Avodah: Worship and Observance\\", and \\"Gemilut Hasadim: Acts of Loving Kindness.\\" Chizuk Amuno also seeks perform tikkun olam, repairing the world and encourages its congregants to lead an ethical, Jewish life.\\"History & Mission\\". Chizuk Amuno Congregation. History 19th century Chizuk Amuno descended from the \\"Green Street synagogue\\", founded by a small group of Jews on April 1, 1871, in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1876, the congregation moved into its first permanent home of distinctive Moorish design, the old Chizuk Amuno Synagogue on Lloyd Street across Watson Street to the south from the original historic Lloyd Street Synagogue designed in Greek Revival style by noted local architect Robert Cary Long, Jr. in 1845 for the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation in the east downtown Baltimore neighborhood of Jonestown, later known as Old Town. Former Chizuk Amuno Synagogue (1876-1895) Under the spiritual guidance of Rev. Dr. Henry W. Schneeberger, the \\"first American-born, ordained rabbi\\", the congregation grew greatly and soon moved in 1895 to nearby McCulloh Street in the Bolton Hill neighborhood (Md. Route 129) after selling its Lloyd Street building to the B'nai Israel (\\"Sons of Israel\\") congregation which had been founded 1873 by recently immigrated Russian Jews. The building is now next door to and part of the Herbert Bearman campus of the Jewish Historical Society of Maryland now known as the Jewish Museum of Maryland in 1985 along with the original Lloyd Street Synagogue, both of which are now on the National Register of Historic Places. The synagogue later split into the Shearith Israel Congregation, and the somewhat more liberal, though still strictly Orthodox, Chizuk Emunah Congregation, under the leadership of its president, Dr. Aaron Fredenwald. The synagogue was a supporter of the aforementioned JTS and the Jewish Publication Society (JPS) at their founding under Orthodox auspices, with Dr. Friedenwald being a Director, and Vice President, respectively of the two organizations. Friedenwald remained orthodox all his life, but after his death, JTS and JPS became affiliated with the nascent Conservative Judaism movement, and the synagogue became a founding member of USCJ. 20th century to the present The synagogue's entrance In 1920, the synagogue gained both a new rabbi, Rabbi Adolph Coblenz, and moved once again uptown to a building on Eutaw Place. After Rabbi Israel M. Goldman began his tenure at Chizuk Amuno in 1948, plans were begun to move the congregation to a \\"suburban campus...to house a Social Center, School Building, and Sanctuary.\\" The new synagogue was located on previously undeveloped land in the northwest suburb of Pikesville in Baltimore County and was in use by the 1960s. In 1980, Rabbi Joel H. Zaiman became the congregation's rabbi. Under Zaiman, both Chizuk Amuno's youth and adult education would be expanded and the congregation doubled in size to 1,400 families during the 23 years of his leadership. In 1981, a Solomon Schechter Day School (today called Krieger Schechter) was opened in conjunction with the congregation. In addition to founding schools, Chizuk Amuno also emphasized Gemilut Hasadim or \\"acts of loving kindness\\" in serving city communities during Zaiman's rabbinate. These programs, such as mentoring high school students, continue to the present day. Following Rabbi Zaiman's retirement, Rabbi Ronald J. Shulman was elected spiritual leader of Chizuk Amuno from 2004 -2017. The Congregation's current Senior Rabbi since July 2018 is Joshua Z. Gruenberg. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science from the State University of New York at Binghamton and was ordained as a Conservative rabbi by the Jewish Theological Seminary in 2002. Education Chizuk Amuno offers education centers for youth and adult education: * The Goldsmith Early Childhood Center (preschool) * Krieger Schechter Day School (K-8 day school, member of the Solomon Schechter Day School Association and accredited by the Association of Independent Maryland Schools) * The Rosenbloom Religious School (bi-weekly program for secular school students) * Netivon & Achshav (evening high school programs) * The Stulman Center for Adult Learning Activities Chizuk Amuno features many groups (Brotherhood, Sisterhood, Young Professionals, Young Families, and others) intended to enrich synagogue life and \\"promote the values and ideals of Conservative Judaism.\\" The congregation is administered by a number of committees over which its President and Board of Trustees presides. Chizuk Amuno also operates the Goldsmith Museum, which strives to preserve Jewish history through the visual arts. It also features an extensive interactive timeline of Jewish history and congregational archives.

By 1988, Bloodgood represented one of the four largest Christian metal bands (excluding the mainstream success of Stryper) alongside Barren Cross, Leviticus, and Whitecross. Bloodgood became known for their \\"go- for-broke attitude about showmanship\\", displaying attitudes and imagery that brought them into collision with some on the extreme Christian right. In a 1998 retrospective, Christian music critic Brian Quincy Newcomb would write that \\"Bloodgood's ministry and music was a vital stepping stone in the maturing process of Christian rock.\\" Background The band formed around the leadership of Michael Bloodgood, who had been active in the local music scene for some time. Directly prior to the formation of Bloodgood, Michael had been involved in a local effort, what he later described as \\"basic straight-ahead rock.\\" That effort had disbanded by mid-1984 as Michael Bloodgood felt called to build a Christian metal band. The Seattle area at that time was known for metal bands such as TKO, Queensrÿche, and Metal Church, but Bloodgood felt a need to represent Christ to that audience, and the band was the natural way to do so. In 1985, Bloodgood released a demo, Metal Missionaries, of which they sold over 5,000 copies at concerts. Their 1986 eponymous debut was produced by Darrell Mansfield. While Bloodgood was visually similar to other metal bands at the time, it was distinguished by three elements: the vocals of Les Carlsen, the songwriting of Michael Bloodgood, and the guitar techniques of David Zaffiro. The band's sound was in many ways typical of competent 1980s glam metal bands, but their lyrics were distinctly Christian. Themes often included Armageddon, hope and victory in Christ, and the Grace of living in God, with Biblical language throughout. When asked about the influence of Stryper upon the band, Michael Bloodgood told an interviewer that the band had formed before Stryper became well known, and so they were not a musical influence because they played different styles of metal. Their first major United States tour was in 1987 and was protested by groups on the extreme Christian right. The band was more popular in Europe than in the United States and they toured the United Kingdom in 1988. This tour featured lead vocalist Les Carlsen portraying Pontius Pilate during the song \\"Crucify,\\" as well as a graphic, live-action portrayal of Christ being crucified. The band's position on theatrics, as summed up by Carlsen: \\"Heavy metal lends itself to visuals and drama... They come naturally from the music we write.\\" Present After five studio albums and three live releases, the group officially disbanded in 1994. The group reformed in 2006 and have been performing several times a year since in the U.S. and Europe. They are currently working with Oz Fox from Stryper in this newly formed lineup. Michael Bloodgood, the group's bass player and namesake, also released a comparatively mellow worship solo album, The Cross Changes Everything, in early 2008, under the name \\"Michael Bloodgood and Friends\\", featuring the guest talents of other musicians, including bandmates Les Carlsen, Oz Fox, Paul Jackson, Mark Welling, and Michael's son, Paul Michael Bloodgood on drums and vocals. Bloodgood was a 2010 Inductee into the Christian Music Hall of Fame. In 2010, HM Magazine listed Detonation No. 23 on its Top 100 Christian Rock Albums of All Time list stating that it has \\"quite an original metal sound\\". It singles-out \\"Crucify\\", \\"Messiah\\", \\"Self- Destruction\\" and the ballad \\"Alone in Suicide\\". Heaven's Metal fanzine ranked it No. 8 on its Top 100 Christian metal albums of all-time list. Michael Bloodgood is currently senior pastor of Calvary Chapel Redmond, Washington. where guest artists such as long time friend and lead singer, Les Carlsen came and performed, other artists such as Randy Stonehill, Buck Storm and Darrell Mansfield have also made appearances at CCR in Redmond, WA. Les Carlsen was the lead in the Broadway musical Hair. He performed as a guest vocalist with the American Christian metal band Tourniquet on Intense Live Series, Vol. 2 in 1993. Kevin Whisler was in a Tacoma-based Christian pop-metal band called \\"Watchmen\\" before joining Bloodgood. Watchmen released two albums: Fear No Evil in 1988 and Generation in 1990, both on Regency Records. A full-length documentary, Trenches of Rock is currently touring the film festival circuit. Produced by Bloodygood Pictures, the film features exclusive interviews, music and photos, and all of the controversy surrounding the band. Executive producer is James Moll. The official trailer was released in March 2017. A soundtrack is under way to coincide with the documentary's release in late 2017. On October 19, 2013, Bloodgood released the first video, Lamb of God, from Dangerously Close.

Blair's early development as a musician took place in his home state of Connecticut. His focus on technical ability with the guitar quickly saw him gaining a reputation locally with his early band, Run 21. This band played small club dates in the Tri-State area (NY, NJ, CT) and recorded some original material during that time. One of the songs, \\"Baby It's Your Face\\" was recorded at Presence Studios in Weston, ConnecticutPresence Studios - Clients and released on the Metalstorm compilation produced by Jamie Bircumshaw and Tom Boyd in 1985. This early Doug Blair band, Run 21 also included Stet Howland on drums who would later join W.A.S.P., as would Blair. Run 21 was especially known for its outlandish show (compared to other Connecticut acts) that would see Blair jumping up on the bar and playing while running in between glasses and bottles. The act had an element of comedy with drummer Stet Howland's dialogue with the audience. This early \\"over the top\\" style of performance were precursors to what Blair and Howland would be doing with the internationally known W.A.S.P. He initially played in W.A.S.P. for a short time in 1992. During this time Blair authored a guitar column for Mixx Magazine (later known as Intermixx Webzine) where he gave instruction and advice on the general subject of guitar playing and guitar instruments which he was known to design. He was also a quick replacement during W.A.S.P.'s Unholy Terror Tour in 2001 on two festival gigs when Chris Holmes left the band. In 2006 he was hired by W.A.S.P. for the third time.W.A.S.P.

She is credited with the creation of American sportswear. Early life McCardell was the eldest of four children born to Eleanor and Adrian McCardell in Frederick, Maryland. Adrian was a Maryland state senator and president of the Frederick County National Bank. As a child, McCardell earned the nickname \\"Kick\\" for her ability to keep the boys from pushing her around. Fascinated by fashion from a young age, McCardell wanted to move to New York City to study fashion design at age 16. Unwilling to send a teenager so far away, McCardell's father convinced her to enroll in the home economics program at Hood College instead. After two years of study in Maryland, McCardell moved to New York and enrolled in Parsons (then known as the New York School of Fine and Applied Art). In 1927, McCardell went to Paris, continuing her studies at the Parsons branch school at the Place des Vosges. In Paris, McCardell and her classmates were able to purchases samples by couturiers such as Madeleine Vionnet that they took apart in order to study their structure. McCardell was graduated from Parsons with a certificate in costume design in 1923. After graduation, she worked odd jobs sketching at a fashionable dress shop, painting flowers on paper lamp shades, and acting as a fit model for B. Altman. Then she met designer Robert Turk. 1930s and 1940s Late in 1930, McCardell began working as an assistant designer for Robert Turk. Soon afterward, Turk moved to a larger company, Townley Frocks, and brought McCardell with him. In 1932, Turk drowned and Claire was asked to finish his fall line. The 27-year-old chief designer soon traveled to Paris for inspiration, as did most American designers. Not interested in copying European high fashion, McCardell searched for inspiration in art and street fashion. During the 1930s, began to show innovations such as sashes, spaghetti string ties, and the use of menswear details that would become part of her design signature. In 1938, she modernized the dirndl. She also pioneered matching separates. Beachwear designed by McCardell circa 1948 In 1938, Claire McCardell introduced the Monastic Dress, a bias-cut tentlike dress.Dickinson, Elizabeth Evitts, A Dress for Everyone, The Washington Post Magazine, December 12, 2018 It had no seamed waist and hung loosely, but with a versatile belt it could be adapted to hug a woman's curves gracefully. Best & Co. exclusively sold the dress for $29.95 and it sold out in a day. The \\"Monastic Dress\\" was widely copied and the cost of trying to stop knock-offs drove Townley Frocks out of business. After the closure of Townley Frocks, Hattie Carnegie hired McCardell to work for her famed dressmaking firm, but her designs were not successful with Carnegie's clients, who were in search of more elaborate merchandise. While working for Hattie Carnegie, McCardell met Diana Vreeland (then at Harper's Bazaar). She would become McCardell's lifelong friend and champion. In 1940, just before leaving Carnegie, McCardell attended her last Parisian fashion show, preferring from then on to avoid any French influence on her clothing. Townley Frocks reopened in 1940 under new management and McCardell returned to the brand. The company's labels then read, \\"Claire McCardell Clothes by Townley\\", making her one of the first American designers to have name recognition. World War II cut American designers off from European inspiration and limited the availability of some materials. McCardell flourished under these restrictions. Although many designers considered them too basic, McCardell already worked with fabrics such as denim, calico, and wool jersey that were easily available during the war. She popularized the ballet flat when, responding to the shortage of leather, McCardell commissioned Capezio to produce a range of ballet flats to match her designs. When the government announced a surplus of weather balloon cotton materials in 1944, McCardell quickly bought them up, using them to design clothes that patriotic American women wore with pride. In 1941, McCardell produced a line of separates that made nine outfits from five pieces. The pieces included a taffeta skirt, a jersey top, and a jersey jacket. That same year, she showed her first \\"Kitchen Dinner Dress\\". Made of cotton, the \\"Kitchen Dinner Dress\\" had a full skirt with an attached apron. In 1942, McCardell created her famed \\"Popover Dress\\". It was a response to a Harper's Bazaar challenge to create something fashionable one could wear to clean the house and then, wear to a cocktail party. The simple grey dress came with a matching potholder that fit into the dress pocket. The \\"Popover Dress\\" sold for $6.95 and more than 75,000 were sold in the first season alone. These dresses became a staple of McCardell collections and over time, she made versions in different lengths and fabrics. The \\"Popover Dress\\" received a citation from the American Fashion Critics Association and in 1943, McCardell won a Coty Award. Beginning in 1945, McCardell was featured as an \\"American Look\\" designer by Lord & Taylor's department store. In 1946, McCardell won the Best Sportswear Designer Award and in 1948 she won the Neiman-Marcus Award.  1950s  As McCardell's fame grew, her influence within Townley also rose. In 1952, she became a partner in the company. After the war, McCardell worked as a volunteer critic in the fashion design department at Parsons. In 1950, President Harry S. Truman, Bess Truman, and Margaret Truman presented McCardell with a Woman of the Year Award from the Women's National Press Club. This was the award McCardell cherished most. In April 1953, the Frank Perls Gallery in Beverly Hills launched a retrospective exhibition of twenty years of McCardell's garments. The exhibit included the \\"Monastic Dress\\", the \\"Diaper Bathing Suit\\", Capezio ballet flats, and work-wear-inspired pieces with rivets. In his introduction to the exhibit, retailer Stanley Marcus wrote, \\"...she is one of the truly creative designers this country has produced... She is to America what Vionnet was to France.\\" In 1954, she worked on an advisory panel formed by Time Inc. to create a new magazine that would become Sports Illustrated. McCardell published a book entitled What Shall I Wear? The What, Where, When, and How Much of Fashion in 1957. Personal life and death In 1943, McCardell married the Texas-born architect, Irving Drought Harris, who had two children by an earlier marriage, and established a home base in Manhattan. McCardell’s life and work were cut short by a diagnosis of terminal colon cancer in 1957. With the help of long-time friend and classmate, Mildred Orrick, McCardell completed her final collection from her hospital bed. She checked out of the hospital in order to make the introductions for her final runway show. McCardell died on March 22, 1958 at the age of 52. After her death, McCardell's family decided to close the label. Her brother explained, \\"It wasn't that difficult [to close the label]. Claire's ideas were always her own.\\" Legacy and influence In 1981, Lord & Taylor re-issued the \\"Popover Dress\\" as part of a McCardell retrospective at their Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan. Versions of the \\"Popover Dress\\" are held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Rhode Island School of Design, and the Museum at F.I.T. Versions of the \\"Monastic Dress\\" are held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and LACMA. In 1990, Life named McCardell one of the 100 most important Americans of the twentieth century. A year later, she was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame. In 1998, forty years after her death, three separate retrospectives of Claire McCardell's work were staged at Metropolitan Museum of Art, F.I.T., and the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore. Fashion designers such as Isaac Mizrahi, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Norma Kamali, and Cynthia Rowley all have been influenced by McCardell. Anna Sui's line of spring-summer 1999 was directly inspired by her work. Of McCardell's work Anna Sui said, \\"What I truly appreciate was her fabric sensibility, even with more constructed fabrics like denim. She made them all look so soft and drapy. The halters she did were so modern. The thing is, you look at some of the things she did, and you can't believe it was the 40s.

The organization was founded in the Ottoman Empire in 1868, partly in response to the experience of the Crimean War, in which disease overshadowed battle as the main cause of death and suffering among Turkish soldiers. It was the first Red Crescent society of its kind and one of the most important charity organizations in the Muslim world. The society is a not-for-profit, volunteer-based social service institution providing unconditional aid and service, and is a corporate body governed by special legal provisions.  History  Ottoman Red Crescent Society (Hilâl-i Ahmer Cemiyeti) Emblem. The organization was founded under the Ottoman Empire on 11 June 1868 and was named \\"Hilâl-i Ahmer Cemiyeti\\". It later took on the names: * \\"Ottoman Red Crescent Society” in 1877 * “Turkey’s Red Crescent Community” in 1923 * “Turkish Red Crescent Community” in 1935 * “Turkish Red Crescent Society” in 1947 It was renamed Kızılay by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1935, after the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923. Beginning with the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), the Turkish Red Crescent Society has provided medical relief to soldiers in all battlefields in which Turkey was present, through mobile and fixed hospitals, patient transportation services, hospital vessels, trained nurses and volunteers. It has provided humanitarian care regardless of nationality to all civilians affected by war. It has been involved in disaster relief and aid in natural disasters in Turkey. It has participated in international relief and response activities. Examples of disaster relief activities include: * 2003 Bam earthquake * 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami * 2005 Kashmir earthquake * 2006 Lebanon War * Syrian Civil War  Activities  * Disaster management: Operations in 78 different countries in natural and human related disasters in the last 10 years * Blood donations provided through 17 Regional Blood Centers, 65 Blood Donation Centers with more than 150 mobile blood donation vehicles Kinik, the head of the Turkish Red Crescent, said \\"Nearly 2.4 million people have donated blood to the Red Crescent in 2017, and there were 274,000 stem cell donations.\\" * International aid * Health care: Hospitals in Konya, Kayseri and medical centers throughout Turkey * First aid: 33 First aid centers throughout Turkey providing healthcare and first aid instruction. First aid training provided to a total of 100,000 people * Immigration and Refugee Services: Assists the relevant public authorities in meeting the needs of refugees in Turkey, including shelter, health, and education. Runs 23 camps for the Refugees of the Syrian Civil War * Youth & Educational Services: Projects aimed at youth to increase community awareness regarding disasters. Provides scholarships and runs youth camps * Nuclear weapons: During and after the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons the Turkish Red Crescent was an advocate, urging states to eliminate nuclear weapons * Operations overseas: The Turkish Red Crescent now has permanent representatives in Somalia, Iraq, Palestine, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Yemen in order to lend a helping hand to the vulnerable people of those war- torn countries.  Partnerships   Partnership with Qatar Charity  The Turkish Red Crescent has recently begun to partner with Qatar Charity (QC) on various humanitarian projects. In December 2016, the Turkish Red Crescent together with QC made a $10 million deal with the Turkish government to provide services for Syrian refugees in Turkey over the next five years. Kerem Kinik, head of the organization added “We have common areas of interest such as Palestine, Iraq and Somalia...this collaboration is just a beginning”. In June 2016, the organization and QC provided aid to victims of flooding and violence in Beledweyne, Somalia. Somalia has lost much of its rural areas to al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization with links to al-Qaeda that consistently carries out attacks throughout the country.  Partnership with Turkish government  Following the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, the Turkish Red Crescent backed the Turkish government, sending a letter to hundreds of international aid organizations and NGOs, including to organizations of the United Nations and Red Crescents in 191 total countries. Like the government, the Turkish Red Crescent blamed the Gülen movement (which the government of Turkey considers a terrorist organization) for the coup attempt.  Global Gathering  In November 6–11, 2017, the International Red Cross and the Turkish Red Crescent movement brought together 190 national red cross and red crescent societies. Some major issues they discussed were: migration where they addressed prioritizing safety and assistance, nuclear weapons where they were working towards their elimination, and health where they addressed mental health and psycho social needs. Other issues included the need to involve affected people in relief and recovery efforts; the use of explosive weapons in popular areas; and the looming threat of epidemics and pandemics.

History It changed venues often until 1903, when it was decided to hold it at St. Catharines Port Dalhousie's Martindale Pond hosted by the St. Catharines Rowing Club permanently. Originally the race was 1 mile 550 yards long (2112m), the same distance as the Henley Royal Regatta in England at the time. The pond was an ideal location because the level of the water could be controlled. Wooden grandstands were built, and in 1947, women raced for the first time. In 1964, the distance was changed to 2000 metres, the current standard distance for international competition. The facilities were completely redone in 1966, and in 1972, women's races became a permanent, rather than exhibition event. In 1999, the facilities were again upgraded for the 1999 World Rowing Championships. The Royal Canadian Henley Regatta has welcomed many famous spectators, including Grace Kelly, former Prime Minister The Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau and former Prime Minister The Right Honourable Jean Chrétien. The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a plaque honouring the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta at the entrance to the Henley Regatta Course Grandstand, Main Street, St. Catharines. \\"Competitive rowing became popular in Canada in the 1860s, and in 1880 the first Royal Canadian Henley Regatta for international oarsmen was held in Toronto.

He is the only Austrian governor who has ever held the same office in two separate states. Personal background Rainer was a native of Sankt Veit an der Glan in Carinthia, the son of a German nationalist vocational teacher at a municipal Bürgerschule (secondary school). His father Norbert was a member of the German Democratic Party (Deutsche Demokratische Partei/DDP), and later the Greater German People's Party (Großdeutsche Volkspartei/GDVP). He attended the Realgymnasium in Klagenfurt and, having obtained his Matura degree, studied law at the University of Graz while he earned his living by working in a local banking institution or in general labour. After successfully completing his law examination, Rainer began working in a notary's office and completed his doctorate in 1926. From 1931 he worked as a notary public in Klagenfurt. He married Ada Pflüger on 21 May 1932. The couple had three daughters (born 2 December 1933, 9 May 1939 and 20 August 1942) and two sons (born 29 January 1935 and 31 January 1937). Political involvement Since Rainer was a student in high-school, he engaged as a member of right- wing organizations in Sankt Veit and also participated in the armed Austro- Slovene conflict in Carinthia. Prior to his graduation from law school in Graz, he joined the Austrian SA in 1923 and joined a Burschenschaft student fraternity. In October 1930, Rainer joined the Nazi Party establishing the local branch in Sankt Veit. A close friend of Odilo Globocnik, he joined the Austrian SS at the end of 1933. In the same year he took up a post at the office of Nazi Gauleiter Hubert Klausner in Klagenfurt. As the Nazi Party had been banned by the Austrian government under Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in 1933, Rainer was in August 1935 sentenced to one year in police custody, presumably for high treason. He was released early for good behaviour the following March, nevertheless like Klausner and his deputy Globocnik he had to step down from his administrative role in the party, transferring sole leadership to the rival Austrian Nazi leader Josef Leopold. As Leopold soon fell out of favour with Adolf Hitler, Rainer was in May 1936 again assigned to the Nazi Party's provincial body in Carinthia. Gauleiter and Reich Governor In the course of the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany on 13 March 1938, Rainer was recruited to serve as the organizational staff leader in the office of Josef Bürckel, the Reichskommissar responsible for the annexation of the Austrian lands. On 22 May 1938, Rainer was personally appointed by Hitler as Gauleiter of the Nazi Party in the Reichsgau Salzburg. Upon the 1938 elections, he also was elected a member of the Reichstag in Berlin. When World War II broke out, Rainer was appointed as Reich Defence Commissioner of the military district XVIII, headquartered in Salzburg. On 15 March 1940, he was additionally appointed as the Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governor) of Salzburg, thus uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in his jurisdiction. Rainer remained in these offices at Salzburg until 27 November 1941, when he was succeeded by Gustav Adolf Scheel. On 27 November 1941, Rainer was appointed as the Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter of Gau Carinthia, which also involved ruling over the adjacent occupied Yugoslavian territories in Upper Carniola. On 11 December 1942, Rainer was made Reich Defence Commissioner of Carinthia, much like his role in Salzburg. On 21 June 1943 he was promoted to SS–Obergruppenführer. After Italy abandoned its German ally on 8 September 1943, Rainer took over the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral as High Commissioner. This act established him as the chief of the civil administration in the Italian region of Friuli, as well as in Yugoslavian Istria and Inner Carniola. Sentencing and death On 7 May 1945, eight days after Hitler's suicide, Rainer transferred his official functions to an executive board and fled to the mountainous area around the Weißensee lake in Carinthia. After being given leads by the local population, British occupation troops arrested Rainer and transferred him to Nuremberg Prison in October 1945. On 12/13 June 1946 he appeared at the Nuremberg Trials as a defence witness for the former Austrian chancellor Dr Arthur Seyss-Inquart. On 13 March 1947, Rainer was extradited to Yugoslavia. Here he wrote an 80 page work on the Nürnberg Trials for Yugoslav authorities. On 10 July 1947, he was brought before a military court of the Yugoslav 4th Army at Ljubljana. He was found guilty of crimes against the people and sentenced to death by hanging on 19 July 1947. His widow received a death certificate from Yugoslavia after the war, which showed that same date. For decades afterward, the date of his execution was unknown and could only be speculated. In 2010, documentation came to light in the Slovenian National Archives in Ljubljana which may well have answered the question. An entry in the diary of Boris Kraigher, former Interior Minister in Slovenia, indicates that Dr Rainer was executed with a number of other prisoners in late November 1950. The long delay in Rainer's execution is explained by the fact that Tito's secret police utilized him as an informant. Upwards of 3,000 pages of his words, written from the Summer of 1947 through late 1949, and probably into 1950, have been deposited in Slovenian National Archives.

The third entry of the Super Sentai series franchise, Battle Fever J was a co-production of Toei Company and Marvel Comics. A total of 52 episodes aired on TV Asahi between February 3, 1979 and January 26, 1980. The team have codenames named for countries around the world, also respectively named in their theme song: Battle France, Battle Cossack (Soviet Union), Battle Kenya, Miss America (United States) and Battle Japan. It was also the first series in the Super Sentai franchise where the heroes must control giant robots to defeat a monster who itself has grown to a gigantic size. It also marks the first appearance of a Black Ranger in the franchise. Toei's tokusatsu adaptation of Spider-Man was the first to introduce this format and was also the inspiration for this series. The series was also partially inspired by the Marvel Comics character Captain America. Battle Fever J was the first series to use the term Super Sentai (unlike the previous two who were just called Sentai, without the “Super”) until Toei announced in 1995 that its predecessors Himitsu Sentai Gorenger and J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai were also part of the Super Sentai series, when Chōriki Sentai Ohranger was announced as the 19th Super Sentai team. Plot General Kurama assembles four young agents who had been dispatched around the world for training. They are joined by FBI investigator Diane Martin, whose father was murdered by Egos. The five don powered suits to become the Battle Fever team. The Battle Fever team's trump card is the Battle Fever Robo.

Egos then unleashes the \\"younger brother\\" of the Buffalo Monster, a giant robot replica of its \\"older brother\\". The Robot, fortunately, is finished in time. Aboard it, the Fever team defeats the Buffalo Monster and its successors. The Fever team never stops, even when it lost two of its members (the original Miss America and Battle Cossack). With new members, the team defeats Hedder, now the Hedder Monster, and breaks into Egos' headquarters, where they are fed into the Egos Monster Making Machine so that they may be used as material for a Battle Fever Monster. The team destroys the machine and slays the mysterious deity Satan Egos himself with the Lightning Sword Rocketter sword-throwing move.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Tampa Bay Devil Rays and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Chunichi Dragons. Career Los Angeles Dodgers Guzmán signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers as an international free agent on July 2, 2001. He was signed for $2.25 million, a franchise record signing bonus. Guzmán worked his way through the minor leagues, becoming a top prospect. He was named the Dodgers Minor League Player of the Year in 2004 and was elected to the Florida State League All-Star Game. In 2005, he was named a Southern League All-Star, and ranked the fifth-best overall prospect by Baseball America. Guzmán also played in the All-Star Futures Game twice, in 2004 and 2006. With a jump to the Major League level predicted for the 2006 season, Dodgers manager Grady Little converted Guzmán to left field during spring training. With Rafael Furcal, César Izturis, and Oscar Robles already playing shortstops on the Dodgers major league roster, the position change was made in an attempt to give Guzmán increased opportunity to play with the Dodgers in 2006. He made his major league debut on June 1 of that year, as a defensive replacement in the eighth inning of a game against the Philadelphia Phillies. Guzmán grounded into a double play in his first at-bat in the bottom half of the inning. Tampa Bay Rays Guzmán was traded on July 31, 2006, to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays with Sergio Pedroza for Julio Lugo. He spent most of the 2007 season with the Triple-A Durham Bulls, but made his Devil Rays debut on August 19 against the Cleveland Indians. Guzmán recorded his first major league hit, a walk-off single off of Rafael Pérez, that day. Minor league journeyman He became a free agent at the end of the season and signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals on December 13, 2008. On February 4, 2010, the Baltimore Orioles signed Guzmán to a minor league deal, and he completed the 2010 season at the AA level playing for the Bowie Baysox. In December 2010 it was announced that he signed a deal to play in Japan for the Chunichi Dragons in 2011. He signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds for the 2012 season, and was released in June. Guzmán played in the Mexican League in 2012 and 2013 and after not playing in 2014, he signed with the Camden Riversharks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for 2015.

In 1995 Rossi went on trial for the attempted murder of his wife. She recanted her original identification of Rossi as her attacker and espoused his innocence. The case ended in a mistrial and was front-page news in Rossi's adopted hometown of Pittsburgh and was widely covered as something of a cause célèbre by syndicated television news programs. Rossi eventually was acquitted of attempted murder but pleaded no contest to felony aggravated assault. Early years Rossi's father was a professional jazz guitarist in West View, Pennsylvania; the son followed in his father's footsteps, playing the guitar on stage at age 7. As a child, Rossi was fascinated with Pittsburgh-based faith healer Kathryn Kuhlman. After one of his father's hospitalizations for manic depression, Rossi landed in a surrogate family led by an evangelist who immersed him in Pentecostal preaching and outreach. After a drug overdose, Rossi became a born-again Christian and toured as a rock and roll preacher, usually in tandem with songwriting partner Johnny Walker, playing gospel rock. Rossi and his songwriting partner Walker were featured on The 700 Club. Pennsylvania ministries Richard Rossi prays for the sick at one of his faith healing services, September, 1990. Rossi moved to Lynchburg, Virginia at age 18 to study at Liberty University, where he earned a bachelor's and master's degree in biblical studies. His second church, created informally with ministry partner Jack Sims, was called \\"Matthew's Party,\\" the name taken from the biblical story about Jesus eating with tax collectors and sinners at the home of Matthew, the gospel writer. In 1986, Rossi started First Love, a charismatic church. He rented movie theaters and showed films as an evangelistic outreach. Dramatic faith healings allegedly occurred. The healing services, called \\"Healing Clinics,\\" grew from 200 to 2000. Rossi filmed the healings and co-produced a documentary on faith healing and exorcism in 1992 entitled Quest for Truth. The program first aired during the fall 1993 season on WPGH-TV 53 and WPTT-TV 22. In 1988, Rossi tried and failed to change both the name of the Church of the Three Rivers and its affiliation. He then joined the Assemblies of God the next year and led the Cranberry church, but left in 1991, saying that his ministry was too radical for the Assemblies; church officials said he left owing several thousand dollars for the church building. In September 1991, Rossi began broadcasting his nightly radio show Rich Rossi Live on Pittsburgh's WPIT-FM. The program created controversy when Rossi called other evangelical churches \\"whores\\" who sell out the gospel for money. Rossi appeared on the Jerry Springer Show in 1994 to discuss faith healing, exorcism, and ESP. Attempted murder charge On June 24, 1994, Rossi's wife, Sherrie Lynn, was found near death in a coma on the side of a Pennsylvania road. She had a crushed skull and was left covered in blood; her injuries were so severe that she needed to wear a helmet. Her rescuers thought she had been in a traffic accident, and called for an ambulance. Ninety minutes later, at 8:05 pm, Richard Rossi called police, and claimed that men killed his wife and shot at him twice. But when police came to interview him, his story changed, first claiming that a man that looked like him got into the passenger side of the car, then that the man who looked like him attacked from the driver's side. Rossi had a cellular phone available, but said he pursued the assailant instead of dialing for help because he was a \\"good runner.\\" Rossi also changed his story on where the assailants approached from, first saying they were in a white car, then that they \\"came out of the woods out of nowhere.\\" Police testified that Rossi told them a \\"satanic cult\\" was trying to frame him; Rossi denies this. Rossi was wearing only a pair of tan shorts when police interviewed him; Rossi claimed that he lost his shirt running through the woods, but did not explain why he was barefoot. Several witnesses reported seeing a man with long hair near the Rossi's cars, and State Police reports suggested the presence of two other cars, one blue and one white. Ms. Rossi twice testified that her husband attacked her and left her for dead. Sherrie Lynn received an order of protection from a court. But in October 1994, Sherrie withdrew her accusation; a state court judge refused her request to void the order of protection. (Press accounts claimed that Ms. Rossi stated that her attacker might have been a demon in human form, but the Rossis deny she said this.) Sherrie's stepbrother, Mark Plaugher, accused the Rossi family of pressuring her to change her story; her father said she had been \\"brainwashed,\\" and Sherrie's stepfather, Phil Plaugher, said that church members pressured Sherrie by telling her that it was a sin to testify against one's husband. Sherrie Rossi testified in the trial that her attacker was a different man with brown eyes and that Rossi's eyes are blue. She said her earlier testimony against Rossi was coerced by police when she was still recovering and did not have a complete recollection, and that her second testimony exonerating her husband came from \\"flashbacks\\" and a \\"fuller complete recollection\\" of what occurred. A defender of Rossi corroborated Sherrie Rossi's mystery attacker, testifying a passing motorist saw a bearded man matching Sherrie Rossi's description wearing jeans. (Rossi was wearing shorts). Sherrie Rossi said: \\"We have eyewitnesses who saw a white car similar to ours following us and several family members several weeks before I was attacked. My husband also received a number of threats before I was attacked. The whole police had one agenda from Day One, and that was to get my husband.\\" During her testimony, Sherrie Rossi wore a shirt with two doll figures labeled \\"Rich\\" and \\"Sherrie\\" and flashed the American Sign Language sign for love at her husband Richard. Over Rossi's wife's objections, prosecutors charged him with attempted murder and won a court ruling admitting her earlier testimony at trial. The parties argued whether the blood-soaked interior of Rossi's car was consistent with Sherrie's claim. The secretary of Rossi's church testified that Rossi asked him shortly after the incident to forge an alibi. The defense called two witnesses, a church member and Rossi's mother, for a total of a half-hour of testimony; Rossi himself did not testify. Butler County Courthouse on March 31, 1995. A five-day trial ended in a hung jury, with the vote 9–3 in favor of conviction after six and a half hours of deliberation. Before retrial, Rossi pleaded no contest to a count of second-degree aggravated assault while maintaining his innocence. Though his followers wanted him to fight what his wife called an \\"assault of justice\\", Rossi stated he pled nolo contendere to end the ordeal. \\"One of my many goals is to heal our family and become the best husband and father I can be,\\" Rossi said to the judge. He received a four-to-eight-month sentence in Butler County Jail plus four years probation and required domestic violence counseling; he served 96 days. Domestic violence workers criticized the short sentence. The Rossis renewed their wedding vows after his release. Rossi wrote an apologetic letter to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette saying: \\"I repent of the sins I have committed and, with God's help, do not plan to repeat them.\\" Sherrie Rossi, who had campaigned for her husband's exoneration, sued state and county officials for abridging her civil rights when courts refused to lift a bond restriction forbidding her husband to contact her while he was out on bail; the suit was dismissed by a federal court.Rossi v. Court of Butler, et al., No. 2:95-cv-01144-WLS-KJB (W.D. Pa.). In 1996, Sherrie self-published Assault of Justice: The Richard Rossi Mystery, defending her husband and proclaiming his innocence, and claiming that charges were retaliation for exposing police corruption and a satanic cult on his talk radio show. She said eyewitnesses confirmed her husband's innocence and that they had been receiving threats prior to the assault. An unsupported press release asserted Rossi was innocent (based on physical evidence and the testimony of eyewitnesses). While charges were pending and Rossi served his sentence, membership in his church dropped from 300 to 12. Media scrutiny of his trials and tribulations revealed Rossi suffered mental health, depression, and addiction issues similar to his father's. Rossi enrolled in a recovery program in jail that he continued after his release, including meetings four days a week, daily monitoring, and treatment in Atlanta. After his release from jail, Rossi and his wife hosted a free Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless at the Ranch House in Pittsburgh's North Park. Rossi paid for buses to transport urban children out of high-crime areas to the park. Most of the buses got to those wanting to come, but one had difficulty getting to the arranged pick-up due to snow. Native Americans danced and helped Rossi serve dinners to disadvantaged children. Some of his fellow inmates Rossi befriended in jail attended to help serve the poor. California After completing his probation, Rossi relocated to Hollywood with his wife and two children in 1997. He returned to preaching, serving as a pastor and church consultant, and moved into acting and filmmaking to explore his interest in creative and cutting-edge expressions of ministry. His tenure as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church was interrupted when parishioners discovered his attempted murder charges and alleged that he had misused church money; litigation ensued, and the parties settled out of court. Rossi's first Hollywood role was in the 1998 short film Jesus 2000. In 1998, he appeared on stage in his own adaptation of Elmer Gantry, which he wrote, produced and starred. His stage performance resulted in an offer to Rossi to play the role in a new film version. He started \\"Eternal Grace\\", a movement of Hollywood house churches for actors and celebrities who had difficulty attending public services due to paparazzi, and also for AIDS victims and others not welcome to attend other churches. He was protested by followers of Fred Phelps from Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, who decried his lenient attitude toward homosexuals. Rossi's wife Sherrie worked with puppets in their children's ministry. In 2001, Rossi wrote and directed Saving Sister Aimee, a short documentary film about 1920s evangelist Aimee McPherson. Though some considered it a sensationalized depiction, it won the Angel Award from the Southern California Motion Picture Council for best documentary. In 2005, Rossi revisited Sister Aimee's story in the low-budget feature biographical film Sister Aimee: The Aimee Semple McPherson Story, (aka Aimee Semple McPherson), featuring Mimi Michaels in the lead and Rance Howard as the preacher's father. It attracted a record crowd to Hollywood's New Beverly Cinema, a revival house specializing in independent and cult films owned by Quentin Tarantino. A group of Evangelicals offered to invest $2 million in the film, but with conditions that the movie did not depict McPherson's divorce or drug overdose and that the actor playing the lead be a Pentecostal Christian. Rossi turned them down. \\"By saying no to conditions that religious people put on me, I feel I'm actually of more service to God and people because I make an honest film,\\" he said. In addition to his film work, Rossi acted on stage in plays and musicals to positive reviews, remaining active in the Los Angeles theater community. Clemente film Richard Rossi (center) at screening of his Clemente film at Vogue Theater in San Francisco on May 7, 2014. Pictured with him are two fans of the film from Nicaragua whose families were saved by Clemente's relief efforts. Between acting jobs that included small roles on TV shows, among them The King of Queens, Ally McBeal, The X-Files, Gilmore Girls and several movies, Rossi finished his first novel, Stick Man, about a boy growing up in a bohemian household, with an accompanying musical soundtrack, and began working on Baseball's Last Hero: 21 Clemente Stories, a film about his childhood hero, baseball great Roberto Clemente, planning a \\"bicoastal\\" return to Pittsburgh to premiere his film on Roberto Clemente's birthday, August 18, 2013 before exhibiting the film in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, other cities, small art theaters, Roberto Clemente High School in Chicago, the Wild Goose Festival in North Carolina, and on DVD. The feature film was a labor of love for Rossi and the cadre of actors and technicians who volunteered their time and donated their services to the project. Olympian Jamie Nieto starred as Roberto Clemente. Rossi's telling of Clemente's story of commitment, loyalty, and devotion attempts to provide a counterpoint to today's baseball culture of players suspected of steroid abuse. The dramatic fulcrum of Baseball's Last Hero is a conversation Clemente has with a nun. \\"She talks to him about the cross. 'Greater love has no man than to lay down his life for his friends,' is what the nun quotes to him from Scripture, talking about sacrificial love and Christ's sacrificial love,\\" Rossi said. \\"This is the theme I wanted to point out – an allegory of Christ on the cross.\\" Rossi was pressured to delete the scene from the movie for being \\"too preachy and too Catholic.\\" The controversial scene turned out to be one of the most popular scenes in the film and won over fans to the idea of pitching for Clemente's canonization as a saint in the Catholic Church. Rossi received support for his efforts to canonize Clemente from various people and from Archbishop José Horacio Gómez of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. \\"I've never thought of him in terms of being a saint\\", said MLB second baseman Neil Walker, a devout Catholic whose father knew Clemente. \\"But he's somebody who lived his life serving others, really. So if it would happen, I wouldn't be terribly surprised by it.\\" Some claim the canonization church requirement of a miracle was met on July 22, 2017, when Jaime Nieto, who was paralyzed from the neck down in a backflip accident three years after the Clemente film was released, walked 130 steps at his own wedding to fellow Olympian Shevon Stoddart. The miracle was predicted by Rossi as a demonstration of the power of God in a letter he wrote to Pope Francis. Skeptics say Nieto's walking was improbable, but not miraculous, and was a result of Nieto's hard work and determination. The cause was also delayed according to some reports because the Archbishop of Puerto Rico was less passionate about Clemente's canonization than Pope Francis, and Vatican officials needing more time to investigate the miraculous claims.Sources:  * Recent news  2014–2015  On November 28, 2014, Rossi was in the news again regarding the controversy over the shooting of Michael Brown. Rossi wrote and recorded a protest song expressing his feelings about a grand jury's decision not to charge a white police officer in the death of the unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri. \\"I wrote the song in five minutes as a way to express my emotions about the danger of trigger-happy police,\\" Rossi said. \\"I filmed it on my laptop at my kitchen table and uploaded it to YouTube.\\" Rossi uploaded the video on November 26, and provided the song's lyrics in the video description. Here is a sample from the song's beginning, printed in the Los Angeles Daily News: \\"Down at the courthouse on a Monday afternoon/Justice was thrown right out the window when a young white cop entered the room.\\" Rossi continues to host his radio talk-show \\"Richard Rossi Live\\" as a podcast on BlogTalkRadio. In 2015, the format of the program changed from its Christian roots on WPIT, a Salem Radio Network station, by broadening its content for a general audience. Although Rossi still on occasion discusses religion, the program's focus is on known artists, writers, and celebrity guests. Following the positive Pittsburgh reception to Rossi's Roberto Clemente project, Rossi said they were coming home, living \\"bicoastal,\\" maintaining homes in Hollywood and Pittsburgh. \\"We'd like to spend more time in our home, where most of our family and friends live, in the North Hills of Pittsburgh,\\" Rossi said.Richard Rossi playing guitar in scene from his new film Canaan Land with D.H. Peligro on drums. (April 17, 2017) Despite filing bankruptcy in 1996 as a result of his legal problems, and starting over in California by giving $10 guitar lessons, several articles reported Rossi had within ten years rebuilt his net worth to $1,000,000 due to his various creative projects (filmmaking, writing, radio shows) in California, although Rossi would not discuss or confirm the stories.  2016–Present  In March, 2016, it was reported that Rossi was in pre-production on his film Canaan Land. Rebecca Holden played Sister Sara Sunday. On September 30, 2017, CBS KCAL9 news reported on Rossi's founding of the support group Families Fighting Fentanyl to combat the fentanyl epidemic, to help addicts, work with law enforcement to hold drug dealers accountable, and support grieving families who lost a loved one to fentanyl. Rossi discussed the 2017 death of his youngest brother due to an overdose of heroin laced with fentanyl. On January 31, 2018, Rossi and his family, in tandem with Pittsburgh Police, offered a cash reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual(s) who gave his brother the fatal fentanyl dose. In May 2019, Rossi and other actors performed monologues based on interviews with homeless people as part of Homeward L.A., an effort to raise money for the Midnight Mission, a Los Angeles skid row shelter.

The valleys are grasslands and chaparral with cacti, scrub oaks, willows, elderberry, and cottonwoods as primary vegetation with some joshua trees, junipers, piñons, oaks, and sugar pines.Theodoratus, Dorothea, PhD. and McBride, Kathleen. 2009. \\"California Tribal Environmental Justice Collaborative Grant Project.\\" Tribal Environmental Justice Collaborative Grant Project. November 2010.  Name  The valley of the Kern River has been the home of three distinct bands which are collectively named Tübatulabal. The name Tübatulabal (“a people that go to the forest to gather tubat (piñon nuts)”) loosely translates as \\"pine-nut eaters.\\" The name was given to the tribe by the neighboring Yokuts. At one point in history the Yokuts also called the Tübatulabals, \\"Pitanisha\\" (place where the rivers fork). The name for the north fork of the river has the Indian name of, Palegewanap or \\"place of the big river.\\" The south fork of the river conversely was given the name of Kutchibichwanap Palap, or \\"place of the little river.\\"Gomez, 2009  Bands  The three bands that comprise the Tübatulabal tribe are (from west to east)Audubon Kern River Preserve - Native American People of the Kern River Valley: *Bankalachi, Pong-ah-lache or Toloim / Tulamni (lived in the Greenhorn Mountains and from Poso Creek and Poso Flats around Glennville, California north along Cedar Creek, White River to Deer Creek, sometimes they were farther up along the South Fork Tule River, territory of the Tule River Yokuts, with the Foothill Yokuts (Tule River and Poso Creek Yokuts) they practiced extensive exogamy marriages, so that they are described as an intermediate group) **Bankalachi or Bokninuwiad (northern group, oft considered Foothill Yokuts) **Kumachisi (southern group, oft considered Foothill Yokuts) **Toloim or Tulamni (southwestern group, oft identified with the Tulamni Band of Buena Vista Yokuts) *Pahkanapil, Bahkanapil, Tubatulabal proper (from Mount Whitney south along the South Fork Kern River to Lake Isabella - around Onyx, California and Weldon, California - to Ridgecrest, California near Walker Pass) *Palagewan (Little Kern River, North Fork Kern River, south through Kern River Canyon into Hot Springs Valley (Lake Isabella) and the Kern River down to Bakersfield, California) They are culturally and linguistically closely related. The Pahkanapil is the only band which has, to some degree, survived European transgression and occupancy.  Culture  Tübatulabal traditional culture was similar to that of the Yokuts, who occupied most of the southern half of the California's Central Valley. Acorns, piñon nuts, and game animals were key elements in Tubatulabal subsistence. Located in the Kern Valley, the tribe had contact with the Poso Creek Yokuts to the southwest and the Tule-Kaweah Yokuts west, as well as to Western and Southern Numic speaking groups to the north and east (Western and Eastern Mono, and Timbisha (Panamint)). On their southern border were living the Kawaiisu, and further south the Tübatulabal had ties with Kitanemuk, Serrano, and Tataviam (Alliklik) peoples who spoke the Takic branch of Uto-Aztecan. The Tübatulabal were significant participants and go-betweens in the trade networks connecting the Great Basin, the southern deserts, the Central Valley, and the coastal groups. Compared to other tribes in the Sierra Nevada, Tübatulabal had higher status and privilege. Though the tribe followed traditional patriarchy, women had an equal voice in decisions. Marriage had to be mutually consensual, and women could practice birth control. According to the tribe's oral history, the deep crags, crevices, and crooks of the canyon moving upward (east from the mouth of the Kern Canyon) to the upper reaches of the Kern River were \\"created by hawk and duck as they bounced back and forth, to and from along the canyon walls as they raced up the river.\\"Waterman, n.d. The Tübatulabal are well known for their red pottery and coiled baskets.Pritzker 150 Today, many of their baskets are housed at the National Smithsonian Anthropological Archives, University of California Berkeley, California State Parks Archives, and many other museums and universities. Louisa Francisco, a Bankalachi was well known for her wonderful baskets. Some Tübatulabal families in Kern Valley are related to Francisco. Many of their ancestors married into the Tule River Tribe, Tachi Yokuts, and Tejon Indian Tribe. Tribal families shared in their basket making designs, materials, and weaving techniques. Louisa had a brother named Peter, both came from Poso Flat—a Bankalachi (Toloim) Village. Louisa was born 1865 at Poso Flat (Kern County) and died at age 95 in 1954. She was living on the Tule River Indian Reservation just prior to her death. Estefana Miranda, a Pakanapul, lived in Weldon, California (born in 1895 and died in 1957) on the Miranda Allotment.IND 14 Estefana was the daughter of Steban Miranda, the last Tübatulabal chief. Estefana knew how to harvest native tobacco, acorns, salt grass, and other native foods of the South Fork of Kern Valley and Kelso Valley areas. She knew how to make \\"flat round\\" basket used for both sifting and ceremonies. Her baskets were also used to process piñon nuts picked from Walker Pass, Kennedy Meadows, and Greenhorn Mountain areas. \\"Estefana was also an excellent horseman—she could make her horses jump side to side and jump over large dirt ditches.\\"Otay, 2009  Language  Their ancestral language, Tübatulabal belongs to the Uto-Aztecan language family. In the current state of the linguistics of the Uto-Aztecan family, it is classified as a branch unto itself. Tübatulabal is a Uto-Aztecan language that, although definitely part of the Uto-Aztecan stock, is not closely related to other languages in that group. Unlike the related languages, the Tübatulabal most often ended in consonant sounds. They used individual names and suffixes to denote place in the family and relation to the dead. Tübatulabal have two dialects \\"paka'anil\\" and \\"bankalachi\\". Today, in Mountain Mesa, California, the Tübatulabal tribe has a Pakanapul Language Program that teaches the \\"paka'anil\\" dialect. The last fluent \\"paka'anil\\" dialect speaker was James Andreas, who died in 2009. He lived on the Miranda Allotment, located in Weldon, California. James Andreas spent his last 10 years teaching the Pakanapul Language Team the \\"paka'anil\\" dialect. The \\"bankalachi\\" dialect is similar to the \\"paka'anil\\", however, there is little known about the \\"bankalachi\\" dialect.Miranda-Begay, 2011  Historical trauma  The Tubatulabal people of the Kern river valley have survived historical trauma. Of the three bands of the Tubatulabal, the Pahkanapul were the only ones to survive the Whiskey flats Massacre of 1863. 35–40 tubatulabal people were lined and up and shot dead by the U.S. Cavalry led by Captain McLaughlin. The Tubatulabal tribe was almost wiped out because most were adult men who died in the massacre. \\"They never seemed to blame the local whites or act vengeful towards those who had made such a change in their lives.\\" In an interview with one of the tribe members about the massacre conducted for a study stated \\" That morning the soldiers killed our people it caused a lot of heartache to our people physically, emotionally, and mentally. They took away all our people who tell stories, who could read the stars at night, who could farm. They took away all our old traditions, our songs, our language, and our pride. It affected us a lot. Even to this day it affects us.\\"  Population  Estimates for the precontact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. By two estimates, the Tübatulabal were a small to very small nation. Alfred L. Kroeber (1925:883) put the 1770 population of the Tübatulabal as 1,000.Kroeber 1925:883 Erminie W. Voegelin considered Kroeber's estimate too high (Voegelin 1938:39). For the time of initial European-American settlement, around 1850, she estimated 200–300. Kroeber in 1910 reported the population of the Tübatulabal as 150. Yamamoto in 2000 estimated the population at 900. Today about 400 Tübatulabal people reside in the Kern River Valley of California. 500 more live in surrounding areas.  Contemporary tribe  Today, a Tübatulabal tribe is seeking federal recognition. They have an office located in Mountain Mesa, California, and include descendants of several tribal families who were awarded allotment lands under the US Dawes Allotment Act 1887. Tribal membership is at 287 members, however, a new open enrollment process has been established as of October 2012. The tribe estimates about 400–600 total members.

The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse is one of Aesop's Fables. It is number 352 in the Perry Index and type 112 in Aarne–Thompson's folk tale index.D. L. Ashliman, Town Mouse and Country Mouse: fables of Aarne–Thompson type 112 Like several other elements in Aesop's fables, 'town mouse and country mouse' has become an English idiom. Story In the original tale, a proud town mouse visits his cousin in the country. The country mouse offers the city mouse a meal of simple country cuisine, at which the visitor scoffs and invites the country mouse back to the city for a taste of the \\"fine life\\" and the two cousins dine on white bread and other fine foods. But their rich feast is interrupted by a cat which forces the rodent cousins to abandon their meal and retreat back into their mouse hole for safety. Town mouse tells country mouse that the cat killed his mother and father and that he is frequently the target of attacks. After hearing this, the country mouse decides to return home, preferring security to opulence or, as the 13th-century preacher Odo of Cheriton phrased it, \\"I'd rather gnaw a bean than be gnawed by continual fear\\".John C.Jacobs: The Fables of Odo of Cheriton, New York, 1985, p. 87 The story was widespread in Classical times and there is an early Greek version by Babrius (Fable 108). Horace included it as part of one of his satires (II.6), ending on this story in a poem comparing town living unfavorable to life in the country. Marcus Aurelius alludes to it in his Meditations, Book 11.22; \\"Think of the country mouse and of the town mouse, and of the alarm and trepidation of the town mouse\\". However, it seems to have been the 12th century Anglo-Norman writer Walter of England who contributed most to the spread of the fable throughout medieval Europe. His Latin version (or that of Odo of Cheriton) has been credited as the source of the fable that appeared in the Spanish Libro de Buen Amor of Juan Ruiz in the first half of the 14th century.Wanda Ostrowska Kaufmann, The Anthropology of Wisdom Literature, Westport CT 1996, pp.110–11; it appears at lines 1370–86 and there is a translation in Mediaeval Age, ed. Angel Flores New York 1963, pp.450–2 Walter was also the source for several manuscript collections of Aesop's fables in ItalianMurray Peabody Brush, The Isopo Laurenziano, Columbus, OH, 1899, pp.1–42 and equally of the popular Esopi fabulas by , the first printed collection of Aesop's fables in that language (Verona, 1479), in which the story of the town mouse and the country mouse appears as fable 12. This consists of two sonnets, the first of which tells the story and the second contains a moral reflection. British variations British poetical treatments of the story vary widely. The Scottish Henryson's The Taill of the Uponlandis Mous and the Burges MousMediaeval Scottish Poetry (Abbotsford Series), Glasgow, Scotland, 1892, pp. 130–8. The text can be found online at lib.rochester.edu makes the two mice sisters.The reason for this difference and others is discussed in David West's essay \\"Of Mice and Men\\" in Quality and Pleasure in Latin Poetry, London, 1974, pp. 78–80 The one in the country envies her sister's rich living and pays her a visit, only to be chased by a cat and return home, contented with her own lot. Four final stanzas (lines 190–221) draw out the moral that it is better to limit one's ambition and one's appetites, warning those who make the belly their god that \\"The cat cummis and to the mous hes ee\\". Henryson attributes the story to Esope, myne author where Sir Thomas Wyatt makes it a song sung by \\"My mothers maydes when they did sowe and spynne\\" in the second of his satires. This is more in accord with Horace's description of it as \\"an old wives' tale\\" but Wyatt's retelling otherwise echoes Henryson's: an impoverished country mouse visits her sister in town but is caught by the cat. In the second half of the poem (lines 70–112) Wyatt addresses his interlocutor John Poynz on the vanity of human wishes. Horace, on the other hand, had discussed his own theme at great length before closing on the story. By contrast, the adaptation in La Fontaine's Fables, Le rat de ville et le rat des champs (I.9), is simply told. There it is the town rat that invites the country rat home, only to have the meal disturbed by dogs (as in Horace); the country rat then departs, reflecting, as in Aesop, that peace is preferable to fearful plenty. Gustave Doré's illustration of La Fontaine's fable Adaptations dating from Britain's \\"Augustan Age\\" concentrate upon the Horatian version of the fable. The reference is direct in The hind and the panther transvers'd to the story of the country-mouse and the city mouse, written by Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax and Matthew Prior in 1687. This was a satire directed against a piece of pro-Stuart propaganda and portrays the poet John Dryden (under the name of Bayes) proposing to elevate Horace's 'dry naked History' into a religious allegory (page 4ff). Part of the fun there is that in reality the Horatian retelling is far more sophisticated than the 'plain simple thing' that Bayes pretends it is, especially in its depiction of Roman town-life at the height of its power. It is this aspect of Horace's writing that is underlined by the two adaptations of his satire made by other Augustan authors. The first was a joint work by the friends Thomas Sprat and Abraham Cowley written in 1666. Horace has the story told by a garrulous countryman, a guise that Cowley takes on with delicate self-irony. It allows him to adapt the comforts of the imperial city described by Horace to those of Restoration London, with references to contemporary high cuisine and luxury furnishings such as Mortlake Tapestries. Cowley's portion appeared separately under the title of The Country Mouse in his volume of essays.Cowley's Essays, Kessinger Publishing, London 2004, pp.43–4; there is an online source at the first In the following century the friends Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope combined in a similar imitation of Horace's Satire in octosyllabic couplets, with Pope playing the part of the story-teller from line 133 onwards and attributing the tale to contemporary fabulist Matthew Prior.pp.16-22 The point of the piece is once again to make a witty transposition of the Classical scene into present- day circumstances as an extension of the poem's anachronistic fun. At a slightly later date Rowland Rugeley (1738 - 76) was to imitate their performance in much the same manner in \\"The City Mouse and Country Mouse: a fable to a friend in town\\".Miscellaneous poems and translations (1763), pp.1-9 The argument has been made that, for all the fable's championing of country life, the emphasis on the urban and urbane in these poems is fully in the spirit of the Horatian original. In all versions of the original fable, much is made of the poor fare upon which the country mouse subsists. Dried (grey) peas and bacon are frequently mentioned and it is these two that the early 19th century author Richard Scrafton Sharpe (c. 1780 -1852) uses in a repetitive refrain to his lyrical treatment of \\"The Country Mouse and the City Mouse\\".Text at Storynory He was the author of Old friends in a new dress – or Familiar fables in verse, which went through different editions from 1807 onwards. The stories are told in song measures rather than as a narrative, and it was in a later edition that this retelling appeared. Eastern analogies A similar story appears among the fables of Bidpai as \\"The Lean Cat and the Fat Cat\\". It is related that 'There was once a poor, lean old woman, who lived in a tiny, tumbled-down house, with a cat as poor and as lean as herself. This cat had never tasted a bit of bread, and had come no nearer a mouse than to find its tracks in the dust.' A sleek, plump cat boasts to her of how it feasts at the king's table and invites her to come and join in next day. The poor woman advises her pet to be content with its lot. Unheeding, the lean cat sets off for the palace. Owing to its infestation by cats, however, the king had ordered that any caught there were to be put to death. The lean cat dies, regretting that it had not listened to the old woman's wise advice. Later adaptations An illustration from Aunt Louisa's Oft Told Tales, New York c.1870 Beatrix Potter retold the story in The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (1918). In this she inverted the order of the visits, with the country mouse going to the city first, being frightened by a cat and disliking the food. Returning the visit later, the town mouse is frightened of the rain, the lawnmower and the danger of being stepped on by cows. The story concludes with the reflection that tastes differ. A segment from the tale was incorporated into the children's ballet film The Tales of Beatrix Potter, danced by the Royal Ballet with choreography by Frederick Ashton (1971). The ballet was subsequently performed onstage in 1992 and 2007. In 1927 the story was made into a French silent film, with puppet animation by the director Wladyslaw Starewicz, under the title Le Rat de Ville et le Rat des Champs. In this updated version, the urban rat drives out of Paris in his car to visit his cousin on the farm. They return to the city and visit a nightclub but their revels end in pandemonium with the arrival of a cat. Recognizing that city life is too hectic for him, the country rat prefers to dream of his urban adventure from the safety of his home. The American equivalent was the Silly Symphonies cartoon The Country Cousin (1936), in which the country mouse hikes along the railroad track to visit his cousin in the city. The main action takes place on the supper table and is governed by the unexplained need for silence. When the reason for this is revealed as the cat, the cousin escapes into the street, only to face the worse hazards of the traffic.Available on YouTube In 1980, the fable was whimsically adapted by Evelyn Lambart for the National Film Board of Canada using paper figures and brightly coloured backgrounds. Other cartoons much more loosely based on the fables have included Mouse in Manhattan (1945)Available on YouTube and The Country Mouse and the City Mouse: A Christmas Tale (HBO 1993), which eventually led to the TV series The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures. In the UK, Vicky Ireland dramatised the fable for Merseyside Young People's Theatre in 1987. The 80-minute play has since been acted in the US, South Africa and New Zealand. It features William Boot, a country mouse bored with rural life at his grandmother's house, who is visited by his city cousin and learns that he has inherited Tallyhoe Lodge in London. They leave to run a gauntlet of adventures, from which William returns to settle gratefully in his peaceful country retreat.

At first it was a purely local line, connecting only at Stobcross with the North British Railway, but as industry developed in the area it served it became increasingly important. It was built from a junction near the present-day Jordanhill railway station to a terminus at Clydebank, and in 1897 it was extended to Dalmuir. Most of the route is still in use as the Yoker section of the North Clyde suburban network. History North Clyde railways The Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway in 1882In 1858 the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway opened, forming the first railway connection from the city to the north bank of the Clyde. However the line ran a considerable distance from the river until it reached Bowling, and the intervening area was for the time being undeveloped. At the time, industry was concentrated in the city and the berthing of ships took place at the Broomielaw. Larger berthing facilities were needed, and the Clyde Commissioners constructed a new dock at Stobcross; it opened in 1877, and was called The Queen's Dock. By this time the North British Railway (NBR) had taken over the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway, and the NBR built a line to the dock. The Stobcross Railway opened in 1874, for goods and mineral traffic only. The Stobcross line ran in a wide sweep round the north of Glasgow through Maryhill, then a remote rural town, and then south and south- east through Partick, where there was a goods station. Also in 1874 the Whiteinch Railway opened; this was also a goods-only railway, running from the Stobcross line south to a Whiteinch goods station on the Dumbarton Road. This was built to support a small enclave of industry that had built up in the area, which was otherwise remote. Clydebank In July 1872 the Clyde Trustees evicted the Govan shipyard of J and G Thomson, and the company established a new yard downstream on the other bank at what became Clydebank. The shipyard workers of course all lived locally to Govan, and the company conveyed them to and from their place of work in an old steamer, the Vulcan. Heavy materials too were brought in by steamer. Over the succeeding years other industrial premises opened nearby, also using the river as their transport medium. J & G Thomson promoted the idea of a railway, at first to be called the Glasgow, Yoker and Dalmuir Railway, but the Forth and Cart Canal, a branch of the Forth and Clyde Canal proved awkward, and the idea was cut back to reach Clydebank only. Glasgow Yoker and Clydebank On 4 July 1878 the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament,Carter, Paterson; Ross says \\"in 1877\\" on page 124. to build a line connecting the Clydebank site with the Stobcross Railway. Local industrialists who would benefit from the line subscribed £65,000, and the remaining £17,500 was put forward by the North British Railway. The railway opened as a single line on 1 December 1882, with stations at Partick (on the Stobcross line) and Yoker. Partick could be reached by the Govan Ferry, and the Yoker station was not far from the Renfrew ferry. Goods traffic was of course significant, and the passenger service was not connected to the rest of the railway network for the time being; there was no passenger station at Stobcross. The passenger trains were not run at suitable times for the workers at first, and they continued to use the steamer. The line was worked by the North British Railway. The construction appears to have exceeded its estimated cost, for in 1888 debentures were redeemed by a preference share issue at a face value of £28,241. Singer sewing machines A year after the opening of the Clydebank line, the Singer Manufacturing Company opened the plant that became their sewing machine factory adjacent to Kilbowie, on the GD&HR; line nearby. This plant grew immensely, and encouraged other industries to set up in the area, so that Clydebank in general, served by both lines, became an important industrial complex. Glasgow City and District Railway The North British Railway network had suffered from the circuitous connection from Queen Street passenger terminal and College goods station to get access to the north Clyde lines, and in 1886 a great improvement was made when the Glasgow City and District Railway opened. This ran east to west through the city as a sub- surface line, connecting with the original Stobcross Railway end on; a new passenger station named Finnieston was provided there. This transformed the access for suburban passenger trains but also for goods and mineral traffic which could now run direct from Sighthill. A rival line The Caledonian Railway had long felt that it was losing out in its poor access to the north bank of the Clyde, and it encouraged the construction of the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway (the company used the variant spelling of Dumbartonshire). This opened in 1896, running generally closer to the Clyde than the North British lines, and giving more convenient access for goods and passenger purposes to many of the industrial sites. The North British managed to get a clause inserted into the L&DR; Act restraining that company from opposing a westward extension of the GY&CR.; Extending the GY&C; line The Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway in 1907The limited potential of the GY&C; line proved to be a problem, and encouraged by the NBR, the GY&CR; tried to get approval for a line onwards to Dalmuir, but in 1892 this was turned down by Parliament. However, in 1893 an Act was obtained authorising doubling of the single line and extension from Clydebank to Dalmuir. The GY&CR; was still independent but this work was carried out collaboratively with the NBR, which guaranteed the GY&CR; 6% on capital.Ross says \\"with an adjusted guarantee from the NBR to the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway of 6% on capital\\". Presumably this means a guaranteed income of that sum. The extension started a little to the east of the Clydebank terminus, which was therefore left on a dead end section. A new Clydebank station was opened on Kilbowie Road, and this station was known as Clydebank Central. The old terminus was renamed Clydebank East and continued to be the terminus for some suburban passenger trains. At Dalmuir the extension converged with the GD&HR; line, now owned by the NBR. The point of convergence was to the west of the existing Dalmuir station, which was near Park Road. The GY&CR; line passed under the GD&HTR; line and a new Dalmuir station with platforms on both lines was opened at Duntocher Road. The doubling of the original GY&CR; was completed on 13 December 1896, and the extension opened on 8 May 1897 for goods and mineral trains and on 17 May 1897. the through line was an instant success with passengers. the old terminus continued to be used as an end point for some suburban trains, and also as a starting and finishing point for excursions, until 1959. The GY&CR; was absorbed by the North British Railway on 15 July 1897. The Jordanhill Loop and Rothesay Dock The pressure to provide expanded quay facilities for larger vessels continued, and the Clyde Commissioners opened the new Rothesay DockIt was opened by the Prince of Wales, Duke of Rothesay, later to be King George V. near Clydebank on 25 April 1907. Just as with the Queen's Dock, it was essential to provide rail access to it, and it lay alongside the GY&CR; line, from which the connection was provided. A considerable volume of freight traffic was foreseen, and a connection at Jordanhill was provided to give direct access from Clydebank towards Maryhill. At the area close to the present-day Jordanhill station, the Stobcross Railway had run from north to east on a tight curve, passing the hospital grounds. When the GY&CR; line opened, that ran directly west from the Stobcross line, at Yoker Junction. A north to west curve, the Jordanhill Loop, forming a triangle, was constructed, giving the required direct access from the Yoker line towards the Maryhill direction. From 1923 In 1923 the main line railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" by Act of Parliament, the Railways Act 1921 into four large units; the North British Railway was a \\"constituent\\" of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). By now the GY&CR; line was fully integrated into the passenger and goods network on the north bank of the Clyde. The railways were then nationalised in 1948, the Scottish lines forming part of British Railways Scottish Region. The L&DR; line was now in the same management unit, and as social patterns changed and some heavy industry declined, the need for two competing networks along the Clyde was called into question. In fact the NBR network was designated for modernisation under a plan of 1955; the modernisation in fact became a scheme to electrify the passenger train operation, and this became effective in 1960. Most of the L&DR; section closed, although a number of short sections were retained to give continued access to industrial sites. The Rothesay Dock line was closed in the 1960s, but it was reopened when imported coal was brought to the dock in the early 1980s. Traffic ceased again in 1988 and the line has since been removed. Clydebank East, the original Clydebank terminus, closed in 1959, but in the final decade the terminus was the originating point of \\"Starlight Specials\\" which were overnight services to London at cheap fares. The remainder of the GY&CR; line continues in heavy use today as part of the Glasgow suburban network. In 1987 a passenger train maintenance depot was constructed at Yoker, together with a signalling centre, in a site formerly occupied by goods sidings, south of the line.

The growing prominence of corporate governance research, particularly among the elite journals, and an increase in research around bankruptcy, default and credit risk following the global financial crisis, suggests that finance researchers are responding to the evolution of real-world events when determining their research agendas. Recurring concepts in the Journal of Finance are especially Corporate Governance, volatility, options, pricing, performance measurement and Trading.Brooks, C. & Schopohl, L. (2018).

The following persons are or have been editor-in-chief of the journal: Awards Each year the top papers published in the journal are nominated for the Smith Breeden and Brattle Prizes. Criticism The US is pre-eminent in terms of the volume of work published in the leading journals in finance and US authors also over-achieve in terms of citations. Moreover, it appears that US journals are less likely to publish work by non-US based authors than journals edited in other locations. Furthermore, there is a concentration of finance research and citations towards the top-rated institutions. More than half of papers published in the JOD are by authors in the Times Higher Education’s Top 100 universities, and three-quarters are from the QS Top 200 MBA Schools. This concentration of publications in the top journals among authors from elite institutions, especially in the US, is concerning. It prevents researchers from other institutions to compete on a level playing field when producing research of comparable quality to those at the elite universities. Publications in elite finance journals drive the research agendas not only within their own spheres of activity but their influence is pervasive across all finance research. Future researchers will try to pin their arguments to this mast and finance scholars appear to view citing research from anything other than the very highest rated journals as diminishing the perceived standing of their own work which would damage its chances of publication. Therefore, even high-quality research in low rated journals will struggle to gain any sort of widespread recognition by other researchers. The broad similarities in subject matter and in methodology in finance publications across journal quality ratings are striking and it is ironic that a discipline which espouses the benefits of diversification as one of its core principles shows a research style and agenda that is so very narrow. The lack of paradigmatic diversity is dangerous because it helps to reinforce the narrowing of research agendas and methodological approaches to those preferred by the top journals, especially as the latter have little incentive to change the status quo given that they have done so well from the existing structure.Brooks, C. & Schopohl, L.

Its branches also spread into Connacht. The ILLA was known under different names—Land and Labour Association (LLA) or League (LLL). Its branches were active for almost thirty years, and had considerable success in propagating labour ideals before their traditions became the basis for the new labour and trade unions movements, with which they gradually amalgamated. Mass rally of tenant farmers and labourers demonstrating under ILLA banners, Market Square, Macroom, Co. Cork, around 1894 Background Following the early formation of the Tenant Right League in 1850, which first demanded the adoption and enforcement of the Three Fs to aid Irish tenant farmers, namely ::* fair rent; ::* fixity of tenure; ::* free sale; all of whom lacked these rights, the first ineffective Irish Land Acts of 1870, 1880 and 1881 followed. By giving priority to farming interests, the Acts severely restricted labourers' cottage building, generally in the hands of landowners. The additional half- heartedness shown towards labourers' housing by the Acts was symptomatic of the fact that rural labourers had been little involved in the Irish Land League's Land War waged on behalf of small tenant farmers by Michael Davitt and William O'Brien from 1879 to 1882 in the poorer regions of Connacht and Munster, where conditions were especially severe. Together with Charles Stewart Parnell and his party lieutenants, they went into a bitter verbal offensive and were imprisoned in October 1881 under the Irish Coercion Act in Kilmainham Jail for \\"sabotaging the Land Act\\", from where the No Rent Manifesto was issued calling for a national tenant farmer rent strike which was partially followed. Although the League discouraged violence, agrarian crimes increased widely. Land War manifesto In 1881, nearly 75% of Irish people lived in rural areas. About 38% of these comprised the agricultural workforce, of which nearly 70% were agricultural labourers, 25% of these forming a class of 'landless' labourers, an estimated 60,000 in number, together with their families amounting to nearly a quarter of a million of the rural population, struggling to survive in the squalor of 40,000 one room 'cabins' (together with their animals if they could afford them). Their simple twin demand was for a decent home and a small piece of land. The Land League was thus forced to also address labourer's issues. The first phase of Irish Tenant and Labourers (Land Purchase) Acts from 1883 to 1906 began with the 1883 Land Purchase (Ireland) Act, which was cumbersome, as was the 1885 Irish (Land Purchase) Act or Ashbourne Act. Both had to be amended in 1886 but nevertheless were a tentative start to land purchase under which initially 25,867 tenants were turned into owners of their farms.Sheehan, D.D.: Ireland since Parnell p.103, Daniel O'Connor (London) (1921) The Acts empowered to initiate schemes for building labourers' cottages with half acre allotments, the expenses of these to be met from local rates. They were therefore unpopular and few were built, as both the empowered Guardians and local farmers were themselves the ratepayers.McKay, Enda: The Housing of the Rural Labourer, 1883–1916 SAOTHAR, Vol.17 p. 17, Irish Labour History Society (1992) The Acts were further overshadowed by two events: first, due to falling prices for agricultural produce and bad weather tenants could not pay their rent and united in the Plan of Campaign to withhold excessive rents. At the same time, Charles Stewart Parnell and the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) held the balance of power in the House of Commons. Their key concern in 1886 turned to Gladstone's First Irish Home Rule Bill, which was subsequently defeated. Although Parnell had become converted to the labourers' cause whilst in Kilmainham Gaol, after he became leader of the IPP their cause fell victim to his distancing himself from the Plan of Campaign in the interest of pursuing Home Rule. Then further by his fall from power in 1891 and the ensuing Party split, aggravated by the rejection of the Second Irish Home Rule Bill by the House of Lords in 1893. Not least, from the middle of the 1890s less than 1,000 cottages a year were being built for small tenant farmers or privileged labourers. Origins Image of one of Ireland's oldest and still active Trades Union halls in Kanturk erected 1881. Acting in response to specific local needs, be it housing, land or employment, steadfast local spirits sustained Trade and Labour Leagues in parts of Cos Wicklow, Kilkenny, Laois, Kildare, Roscommon, Tyrone and Tipperary. However it was not until the formation of the Knights of the Plough a farm labourers' body founded by Benjamin Pellin, a small land-owner in the William Thompson tradition, at Narraghmore, Co. Kildare in June 1892,Lane, Pádraig G., The Land and Labour Association 1894–1914, Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, Vol.98, p.91, 109, (1993), Cork City Council Library Lane, Fintan: Benjamin Pelin, the Knights of the Plough and Social Radicalism, 1852-1934 Ch11 pp. 176-200, in Casey, Brian (Ed.): Defying the Law of the Land: Agrarian Radicals in Irish History, History Press (2013) and of the National Labour League in Kanturk in January 1893, that the required organisation of the labourers began to take shape.Lane, Pádraig G.: p.91 The rural area of North Cork around Kanturk and Duhallow had been since the 1860s a centre of labourer agitation and strikes, forming a number of early trade unions. In 1869 P. F. Johnson founded the Kanturk Labourers' Club (the first organised body to represent agricultural labourers) as well as the Irish Agricultural Labourers' Union (IALU) 1873 also in Kanturk, but these faded by 1875 due to lack of support from the nationalist home rule directory. The most successful organisation was later the Kanturk Trade and Labour Association established in 1889O'Connor, Emmet: A Labour History of Ireland 1824–1960 p.52, Gill and Macmillan (1992) with the assistance amongst others, of a young man as its secretary, D. D. Sheehan who had experienced eviction with his family at the height of the Land League's Land War in 1880, when his father followed William O'Brien's \\"Pay No Rent\\" manifesto, their farm taken over by a \\"land-grabber\\" who paid their rent arrears. The Kanturk Association spread to other districts under a new title, the Duhallow Trade and Labour Association, in which Michael Davitt also became involved, until it broke up under the Irish Party's \\"Parnell split\\" in 1891. Plaque on wall of Kanturk Union Hall It was realised on all sides, that the 1884 enfranchisement of the labourers had been insufficient in itself to wrest solutions to grievances from the state and the rural upper- and middle- classes. The control exercised over the implementation of the labourers' acts by conservative elements in rural society had had a ruinous affect. This finally brought the labourers' bodies together to gain political muscle. It became the raison d'être for calling a labour convention at Limerick Junction, County Tipperary on 15 August 1894,Lane, Pádraig G.: p.91Lane, Fintan: pp.189-192 at which the Irish Land and Labour Association was created and officially launched, its founders D. D. Sheehan as chairman together with a young Carrick-on-Suir solicitor J. J. O'Shee as its secretary.Maume, Patrick in: McGuire, James and Quinn, James (eds): Dictionary of Irish Biography From the Earliest Times to the Year 2002; Royal Irish Academy Vol. 7 O’Shee, J. J. p.846; Cambridge University Press (2009) It was formed to agitate on behalf of small tenant farmers and agrarian labourers as follower organisation to Michael Davitts' and Michael Austins' 1890 founded Irish Democratic Trade and Labour Federation, setting forth its broad but short lived achievements. Sheehan, D.D.: p.67 Sheehan founded the Association to pursue tenant-farmer and labourer's grievances as a labour lobby within the nationalist movement, demanding radical changes to the inadequate Irish Land Acts. With labourers \\"as strangers in a strange land, without influence and without rights\\" it was to be expected that obstructions placed in the path of the labourers' welfare by landowners and farmers would invite bitter recrimination at the new Associations meetings.Lane, Pádraig G.: p.91 The Association would prove itself to be the most enduring of the labour groups.O'Connor, Emmet: p.53 Agrarian agitation was unique in that it was an all-Ireland agitation. Ulster tenant-farmers and labourers equally demanded rights, their movement the Farmers and Labourers Union led by T. W. Russell. The Irish Trade Union Congress passed a motion in 1896 which recommended that in every parish in Ireland, a branch of the ILLA be founded.O'Brien, Rónán: A Divided House: The Irish Trade Union Congress and the origins of the Irish Labour Party p.22, in Making The Difference?' The Irish Labour Party 1912–2012, The Collins Press (2012) Programme The passing of the revolutionary Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, a \\"grass roots home rule\\" Act, totally reorganised the old aristocratic landlord \\"Grand Juries\\", eliminating their power by transferring it to Local County Councils elected by tenant farmers, town traders and labourers. The creation of the new councils had a significant effect on Ireland as it allowed local people to take decisions affecting themselves. The County and the sub-county District Councils also created a political platform for proponents of Irish Home Rule, displacing Unionist influence in many areas. The enfranchisement of local electors allowed the development of a new political class, creating a significant body of experienced politicians who began to take local affairs into their own hands. This coincided with William O'Brien founding the United Irish League (UIL), the wide expansion of the agricultural co-operative movement established earlier by Horace Plunkett and Sheehan becoming both President of the ILLA and editor of the Skibbereen based The Southern Star newspaper. He assured that the ILLA as well as the UIL were given weekly press coverage of their branch reports, particularly crucial for the expansion and growth of the UIL in Cork.O'Donovan, John: Class, Conflict, and the United Irish League in Cork, 1900–1903 in SAOTHAR 37 pp.19–29, Journal of the Irish Labour History Society p.20, (2012) ISSN 0332-1169 The Act was immediately recognised by the labourers, who for the first time held both active and passive electoral franchise, as a means to achieving their interests and facilitating those who desired to help them on local county councils. The prospects offered by the Act of radically overhauling the socio- economic distribution of political power in the countryside was not lost on the labourer movement. The ILLA took resolute steps to both organise the voting power of the labourers and to see to the 'proposal of labour candidates'. Modelling themselves on Davitt’s concepts, the ILLA platform included demands for: :::# – land for the people :::# – houses for the people :::# – work and wages for the people :::# – education for the people :::# – state pensions for old people :::# – all local rents shall be paid by the ground landlords. Its strategy was to achieve these through political and parliamentary leverage, pressure of the press and public agitation rather than by physical-force means or trade union action. Objectives The name of the association was somewhat anomalous, as it strived to represent and pursue the twofold interests of small tenant farmers and rural agrarian labourers. Both were a deprived and down trodden class supporting each other in their common plight, tenant farmers paying excessive rents or suffering eviction, labourers \\"compelled to live in hovels not fit to house the brute beast of the field\\" (Sheehan's later House of Commons speech). The objectives of the ILLA were therefore to achieve tenant land purchase, new and improved housing, welfare working conditions and access to land holdings for rural labourers. ILLA concern for other labour issues developed after the Local Government Act transferred responsibility for cottage building, land reclamation, drainage, road building, their repair and maintenance, to the County and District Councils. This called for considerable ILLA involvement when it came to tenders for contract work and the fair employment of local contractors and labour, settling disputes and complaints, often arising out of local political patronage. The situation of previously evicted tenants, now reduced to landless labourers, was also on their agenda. Propertied classes' hostility However where initial success such as the election of five of the Association's Central Council to County Councils, it was nullified by the continued domination of farmers and landowners in the local authorities. Where the Land and Labour Association clashed with the propertied classes' interests, it was excluded from all effective political action, which even led to the exclusion of the labourers from United Irish League meetings. The belief of J.F.X. O'Brien and others was that there should be no separate labour organisation alongside the UIL, which attempted to tactfully bring the Association and its followers under its wing. John Redmond's sedulous refusal to consider direct Parliamentary representation for the Land and Labour Association was but an instance of the propertied classes' obsession with maintaining their hold over national politics.Lane, Pádraig G.: p.92 The desire to keep the labouring classes in tow prompted the United Irish League to eventually give the Land and Labour Association entry to national councils in 1900. The failure of the UIL and the Irish Party to either refer to the labourers in their deliberations or to do anything for them at Westminster indicated the Associations intended subservient position. It took the Mid-Cork by-election of 1901 to show that the understanding between the UIL and the ILLA was paper-thin. When it became clear that the ILLA candidate, D. D. Sheehan, was going to make an impact, he was accused of being an \\"anti- Healyite\\" and that his first allegiance was to the labourers rather than to the party, expressed the class bias of the Irish Party against the workers.Lane, Pádraig G.: p.93 Land proprietors By the turn of the century the working class segment of the electorate were a new labour power to be reckoned with, a very worthy class to be courted and flattered at election time. They displayed their depth of support for the labour movement in Cork at the UIL selection convention for the Mid-Cork by-election of May 1901. Amidst turbulent and occasionally violent scenes in Macroom on 10 May, their President D. D. Sheehan, standing on a strictly labour platform, defeated the local UIL candidate of the Irish Party on a second ballot. This after an initial attempt by Joseph Devlin (representing the UIL National Directory), to exclude a number of ILLA branches from the convention.O'Donovan, John: p.21 In this respect Sheehans’ return on a labour-nationalist ticket as Mid-Cork Member of Parliament (1901–1918) to the House of Commons exposed the divide between rural labourers and the elitist nationalism of the UIL/IPP classes,O'Donovan, John: p.22 which was to deepen by the end of the decade. Rural workers were quick to grasp the potential of local democracy for plots, cottages and direct labour on council road-works.O'Connor, Emmet: p.62 Their ILLA organisation had grown to 98 branches by 1899, expanding to 144 branches in 1904 mainly in counties Cork, Limerick and Tipperary.Bradley, Dan: Farm Labourers: Irish struggle 1900–1976, Ch.2: Farm Labourer Organisations in co. Cork before 1919, pp.25–37 Athol Books (1988) UIL agitation by tenant farmers continued to press for compulsory land purchase and resulted in the calling of the December 1902 Land Conference, an initiative by moderate landlords led by Lord Dunraven on the one hand and William O'Brien, John Redmond MP, Timothy Harrington MP and Ulster's T. W. Russell MP representing tenant farmers on the other hand. It strove for a settlement by conciliatory agreement between landlord and tenant. After six sittings all eight tenant's demands were conceded, O'Brien having guided the official nationalist movement into endorsement of a new policy of conciliation. He followed this by campaigning vigorously for the greatest piece of social legislation Ireland had yet seen, orchestrating the Wyndham Land Purchase Act (1903) through Parliament. The Act provided very generous bonus subsidy terms to landowners on sale.Land Purchase Acts 1903+1909 encyclopedic definitions Purchases between tenants and landlords were negotiated by Sheehan and the ILLA branches after O'Brien and Sheehan formed a Cork Advisory Committee in September 1904, to mediate between landlords and tenants in their negotiations.Sheehan, D. D.: pp.187–88(1921) They thereby achieved purchase terms with low interest annuities which produced an exceptionally high take-up of land purchase. Munster tenants availed of land purchase in higher numbers than in any other province,Maume, Patrick: The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891–1918, pp.74–75, Gill & Macmillan (1999) whereby in county Cork alone there were 16,159 tenant land purchases, the highest numbers of any single county. Sheehan, D.D.: p.188 The Act effectively fulfilled the first important demand of the ILLA, the abolition of \\"landlordism\\", replaced by land purchase, to finally resolve the Land Question. The result was the formation of a new proud farming proprietorship and the steady extinction of the dominant Anglo-Irish landed gentry. Whereas in 1870 only 3% of Irish farmers owned their land, by 1908, this jumped to nearly 50%. By the early 1920s, the figure was at 70%, the process being later completed. Despite some deficiencies of the Land Act, O'Brien could take some pride in its working since its passage. The social effects of the Act were immediate The year 1903 alone saw a 33% drop in reports of intimidation, a 70% decline in boycotting cases, 60% fewer people needing police protection, and a 50% decrease in the number and acreage of grazing farms unlet or unstocked because of agitation. In the period 1903 to 1909 over 200,000 small peasant tenant-farmers became \\"owneroccupiers\\" of their holdings under the Acts.O'Brien, Joseph V.: William O'Brien and the course of Irish Politics, 1881–1918, The All-for-Ireland League pp. 166–67, University of California Press (1976) By 1914 75% of occupiers were buying out their landlords under the 1903 Act and the later Birrell Land Purchase (Ireland) Act (1909) which extended the 1903 Act by allowing for the compulsory purchase of tenanted farmland by the Land Commission. In all, under these pre-1921 Land Acts over 316,000 tenants purchased their holdings amounting to out of a total of 20 million in the country.Ferriter, Diarmaid: \\"The Transformation of Ireland, 1900–2000\\", Profile Books, London (2004), pp. 62–63 () Cottage ownership In November 1903 O'Brien left the Irish Party when his policy of \\"conciliation\\" with landowners was rejected by the party leaders John Redmond and John Dillon,Maume, Patrick: pp.69–70 who feared O’Brien’s course and popularity would drive a wedge between the farming and labouring community allegiance to the Irish party. Early Irish cottage homestead O'Brien then joined forces a year later with Sheehan's ILLA organisation,Maume, Patrick: pp.70–71 identifying himself with Sheehan's demand for agricultural labourers' housing, who up to then were dependent on limited provision of cottages by local County Councils or landowners at unfavourable terms. A breakthrough occurred when a scheme was made public at \\"the largest labour demonstration ever held in Ireland\\" (Cork Examiner), a memorable rally in Macroom on 10 December 1904 addressed by William O'Brien.McKay, Enda: SAOTHAR p.33 His concepts became known as the \`Macroom Programme´, its principles and measures subsequently carried into law in 1906.Sheehan, D. D.: pp.180–85 The Second Phase of the Labourers Acts (1906–1914) began after the unprecedented Labourers (Ireland) Act, long demanded by the ILLA was won in 1906, for which both the Redmondite and O'Brienite factions were zealous in claiming credit.Bradley, Dan: p.28 The so called 'Labourers Act' provided large scale funding for extensive state sponsored housing to accommodate rural labourers and others of the working classes. The labourer-owned cottages erected by the Local County Councils brought about a major socio-economic transformation, by simultaneously erasing the previous inhuman habitations.Ferriter, Diarmaid: pp.62-64, p.159 O'Brien saying that the Labourers Acts – \\"were scarcely less wonderworking than the abolition of landlordism itself\\". In 1904 Davitt going so far as to declare that the Labourers Acts constituted – \\"a rational principle of state Socialism\\". In the next five years the programme produced a complete 'municipalisation' of over 40,000 additional commodious working-class dwellings dotting the rural Irish countryside, the proportionally larger number of 7,560 cottages erected in County Cork in co-ordination with Sheehan and the ILLA branches became known locally as \\"Sheehans' cottages\\". At first the compulsory surrender of an acre of choice land to each labourer who claimed it was resisted by the new land owning farmers. In due course they too reaped the benefits, gone the days when a farmer never knew when or where to find labour to work his fields. Either they were migrants or drink ridden. Now occupying their own proud family home and vegetable patch at the corner of his farm, they worked cooperatively for him all year round. This had enormous long-term consequences for rural Irish society. Original 1906 Labourers' Act Cottage, known locally as a Sheehans' Cottage, pictured in 1977 Only 17 per cent of labourers had lived in houses with five or more rooms in 1841; in 1861 one rural family in ten still lived in what were classed by the census as fourth class accommodation, essentially meaning one room per family. By 1911 only one per cent of families did. The bulk of the labourers' cottages were erected by 1916, resulting in a widespread decline of rampant tuberculosis, typhoid and scarlet fever.Ferriter, Diarmaid: p.159 Up to a quarter of a million were housed under the Labourers Acts by 1921. It is not an exaggeration to term it a social revolution, in a sense it was the first large-scale public-housing schemes in the country, a development neglected by historians, because the houses, rural based and more scattered, were not as evident as the urban tenements, that officialdom would not even look into.Ferriter, Diarmaid: p.159McKay, Enda: SAOTHAR, pp.27–38 Aims accomplished Additional funding for the erection of a further 5000 cottages was won under the follow-on Labourers (Ireland) Act (1911), Sheehan making the concluding speech during the passage of the bill. Although he retired from the LLA in 1910, Sheehan remained active in the labour movement as its leader in Munster. Around 1912, Ireland was economically one of the prosperous small countries of Europe. D. D. Sheehan maintained in 1921, that the labourers, as a result of these housing acts (particularly the landmark 1906 bill), > \\"were no longer a people to be kicked and cuffed and ordered about by the > schoneens and squireens of the district; they became a very worthy class > indeed, to be courted and flattered at election times and wheedled with all > sorts of fair promises of what could be done for them\\".Sheehan, D. D.: p.176 > (Ferriter op. cit.) Having successfully settled the main grievances of small tenant farmers and agrarian labourers, O'Brien and Sheehan moved on by turning their attention to the unresolved question of the Home Rule Movement, founding for this purpose a new organisation, the All-for-Ireland League, many LLA branches joining the League.  Adversity  The Irish Parliamentary Party, after had it alienated O'Brien from the party in 1903, tried by every means to curtail his activities after he became associated with Sheehan's ILLA, regarding their conciliatory approach in the land question as a dangerous deviation from party policy. In the manner in which the Party took control of O'Brien's UIL through the involvement of Joseph Devlin, Redmond and Dillon were determined to undermine O'Brien and \\"squelch that body by getting a few reliable Munster MPs to start a new Land and Labour group and claim it as the legitimate continuation of the original association\\".O'Brien, Joseph V.: p.170 In 1905, Dillon's loyal \\"Redmonite\\" ally and ILLA secretary J. J. O'Shee was tasked with forming a break-away 'party-subservient' organisation in answer to Sheehan's domination of the original one. Sheehan had however created that domination on order to > realize the great democratic principle of the government of the people by > the people and for the people in the teeth of party autocracy.Lane, Pádraig G.: pp.94–95 A larger section, mainly in counties Cork, Limerick, Kerry and Tipperary, followed Sheehan who renamed it the 'Land and Labour Association' (LLA). Its members sat on most Rural and District County Councils. Splitting-off and in-fighting became symptomatic of all national movements after the Parnell split. O'Brien and some others rejoined the IPP in 1908 for the sake of unity, but he was again driven out on the occasion of the rigged Dublin National Convention in February 1909, called the \\"Baton Convention\\", in a dispute over the financial arrangements for the next stage of the 1909 Land Purchase Act.O'Brien, Joseph V.: p.187 By January 1910 further ILLA groups split off, in Cork city P. J. Bradley, building an empire on the title, and William Field MP, as president of a Dublin-based Land and Labour League (LLL), each claiming Irish Party credit for the earlier ILLA achievements. Sheehan resigned the LLA presidency in July 1910, his colleague Cornelius Buckley taking over. Cork then had three LLA factions from 1910 to 1915.Bradley, Dan: pp.28–32 This greatly damaged the labourer’s movement as soon nobody knew which organisation they belonged to. In other counties where branches were long established, they remained independent with divergent local activities, in some cases in Connacht under R. A. Corr, with the dual title Trade and Labour Association (T&LA;), as successor to Davitt’s Democratic Labour Federation. New Labour By the end of 1919, most ILLA and LLA branches had completed amalgamation with the expanding Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU),Bradley, Dan: pp.36–37 some independent branches remaining active in outlying areas of Munster and Connacht into the 1920s, when they in turn fused with the ITGWU, all forming the basis of the new labour movement.Murphy, Timothy J.: late Labour TD. north-Cork and former Minister for Local Government, in an interview published in an Irish Times article by Patrick Nolan (Series \\"State of the Unions\\") 18 November 1965, he expressed the view – The Irish Labour Party was to benefit from the efforts of the local ILLA sMitchell, Arthur: Labour in Irish Politics 1890–1930 p.16, Irish University Press, Dublin (1974) Thomas Johnson, first parliamentary leader of the Irish Labour Party is recorded as saying that Labour's strength outside of the urban areas could in part be attributed to the role played by organisations such as the ILLA.O'Brien, Rónán: p.31 Following the Great War a further 5000 cottage homes were built in both parts of Ireland for returning soldiers, under the Irish Land (Provision for Sailors and Soldiers) Act 1919 which related to the provision of cottages, plots, or gardens and the building of mostly small new housing estates for the veterans at the edge of towns. It was effected by the \\"Irish soldiers' and sailors' Land Trust\\", which co-operated with the new Irish Free State.

She was regent during the minority of her son from 639 until 642. Life She was of Saxon lineage, born about 608 or 610. The Lexikon des Mittelalters calls her ein Mädchen aus dem Dienstpersonal (\\"a maiden of the royal [ Austrasian ] household\\"). Her elevation to consort may have given importance to her relatives: her brother Lanthegisel was an important landowner in the Limousin and a relation of Aldegisel. Dagobert set aside his wife Gomatrud to marry her, ca. 629; to her was born Clovis II, second eldest of Dagobert's surviving sons and the one who succeeded him in Neustria and Burgundy. After Dagobert's death in January 639, she was initially regent for her son, accompanied by Aega, mayor of the Neustrian palace and an opponent of the powerful contingent of nobles headed by Burgundofaro whose seat was at Meaux. In the interest of reducing noble Burgundian independence of the Merovingian palace, she married her niece Ragnoberta to the Frank Flaochad and had the magnates and bishops of the realm of Burgundy acclaim him mayor of the palace at Orléans in 642. Soon she died at Landry in what was then Burgundy, where she had long resided; her body was translated to the Saint Denis Basilica. It is likely that she was poisoned or secretly murdered, as her untimely death allowed her son to fall under the influence of the nobility, who abhorred a strong royal hand.

History  The station was opened by the Scottish Central Railway on 14 March 1856 and was originally named Crieff Junction. There was another station with the name of Crieff Junction to the north of this station which was only short-lived. The branch northwestward to was opened (by the Crieff Junction Railway company) on the same day. On 1 April 1912 it was renamed Gleneagles. The station was rebuilt and the junction remodelled by the Caledonian Railway in 1919 following their takeover of the Scottish Central Railway. The Caledonian Railway built the nearby Gleneagles Hotel, which opened in 1925. The hotel served as the location for the G8 summit in 2005 and is a well-known golf resort; Gleneagles hosted the 2014 Ryder Cup. In anticipation of the 2014 Ryder Cup, Gleneagles railway station underwent a major refurbishment as part of a £7 million program to improve transport infrastructure in the area. Work was completed in April 2014, seeing the old station building regenerated with a lift, new platforms built upon the original ones, the fitting of Passenger information boards, additional regenerative paint work and a newly built car park built to connect with the new main road from the motorway. The branch line to Crieff closed on 6 July 1964 due to the Beeching Axe.

It was originally built to test missile defense concepts, but these attempts were dropped after the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was signed. The site later hosted two modest devices used primarily for experiments in space tracking. Several other laser test sites were also active during this period. During the 1980s, officials within the United States Department of Defense (DoD) suggested it was the site of a prototypical anti-satellite weapon system.\\"Soviets could have laser able to blind US satellites\\", Gadsden Times, 10 April 1984 The site was abandoned and is now partially disassembled. History Development of laser weapons in the Soviet Union began in 1964-1965. Among many proposals for laser weapons was an explosively pumped gas dynamic laser. Construction—consisting of a large concrete bunker lined with steel plates—was begun at Sary Shagan, but the facility was far from complete when the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was signed in 1972, and these efforts ended. The buildings were then re-purposed for more modest laser systems. Vympel NPO led the construction and developed the tracking and aiming systems. The lasers were developed at Astrofizika, a company newly formed from the laser departments of several defense contractors. They installed two lasers at the site, a visible-light ruby laser that was installed in 1979, and an infrared carbon dioxide laser that was installed in 1982. Tracking systems were tested by fitting aircraft with laser detectors and then looking for signals when the lasers fired. There were also tests against satellites that passed over the site, in an effort to demonstrate the ability to blind optical sensors. Instead, these experiments demonstrated the inability of the tracking system to point the lasers with the required level of accuracy in order to be effective. Anti-satellite weapon claims With the development of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in the early 1980s, the DoD began claiming that the Soviets were developing an anti- satellite laser weapons system at the Sary Shagan site. These statements were part of an argument suggesting that a sort of \\"laser gap\\" existed between the US and the USSR, harkening back to the mythical bomber gap and missile gap of previous decades. As it would turn out, this comparison was quite accurate, as the laser gap turned out to be equally mythical. Throughout, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was returning reports on the site that were quite accurate, and at odds with the DoD's public statements. The DoD presented only the worst-case assessments found in the public portions of the CIA's reports. With the ending of the Cold War, a delegation of US officials and experts were able to visit the site in July 1989. These observers noted a wide variety of evidence that the system—while intended to research the possibility of an anti-satellite laser capability—had never reached anywhere near the operational stage. The laser viewed by the US officials was extremely low- power, including the small size of the focusing optics and the uncooled director which would be incapable of handling a large laser. The lasers that they found were 1,000 times less powerful that the US's own MIRACL. The team dismissed the site as non-operational. When discussing the issue, Soviet officials were somewhat amused. They noted that the US public often had better information than their own military, and that excessive secrecy had led the Soviet citizenry to distrust the military's claims as to their own capabilities. Shuttle attack rumour Terra-3 is the topic of a widespread claim that the IR laser was used to target the Space Shuttle Challenger during its 6th orbital mission on 10 October 1984 (STS-41-G). According to reports by Steven Zaloga, the Shuttle was briefly illuminated and caused \\"malfunctions on the space shuttle and distress to the crew,\\" causing the United States to file a diplomatic protest about the incident. This claim appears to have started with former Soviet officials, notably Boris Kononenko. The crew members and \\"knowledgeable members of the US intelligence community\\" have denied that the shuttle was illuminated by the Terra-3.\\"STS-41-G\\" , Encyclopedia Astronautica  See also  *Omega (laser) References Category:Missile defense Category:Space weapons Category:Military lasers Category:Science and technology in the Soviet Union Category:Military installations of the Soviet Union ","title":"Terra-3"},{"id":"4244202","text":"The Blue EP is the latest material released by Spy Glass Blue.

It has a population of 59,175 (census 2010) and an area of 804 km². Its capital is the city of Ainaro, a small mountain town. Etymology The word Ainaro is a Portuguese approximation of the local Tetum and Mambai language word Ainaru, which means \\"tall tree\\". Geography Ainaro has a great abundance of rivers and fertile terrain for agriculture. It has a coastal area, on the Timor Sea, but also mountainous zones, including the highest point in East Timor, Mount Ramelau (2,960 m), also known as Tatamailau, which lies near the border with Ermera. The borders of the municipality are identical to that of the same in Portuguese Timor, with the following exceptions: during the Indonesian occupation, the then subdistrict of Turiscai became part of Manufahi from Ainaro, and the then subdistrict of Hato-Udo became part of Ainaro in exchange. The then subdistrict of Mape- Zumalai became part of Cova Lima in 2003. The municipality borders Aileu to the north, Manufahi to the south, Cova Lima to the southwest, Bobonaro to the west, and Ermera to the northwest.

The station is north of Glasgow Queen Street (High level) station on the Cumbernauld Line and is a terminus of the Springburn branch, a spur from Bellgrove station, on the North Clyde Line. The station was first built by the City of Glasgow Union Railway, whose branch line from opened to goods traffic in 1875. A station building was designed by the engineer James Carswell in 1875http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100260 and was opened in 1887, when passenger traffic then began operating.Railscot Chronology - City of Glasgow Union Railway; Railscot; Retrieved 2014-01-27 Initially built as a terminus, two through platforms were added shortly afterwards by the company when they gained running powers over the Sighthill Branch of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, which ran alongside the CGUR at this location. The link into this line gave the company access to both the E&G; main line at Cowlairs and also the former Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway, which had now become the main Caledonian Railway route from Glasgow Buchanan Street to NE Scotland via and Stirling. Several different passenger routes operated from the station, including workers trains to on the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway and a circular service that also used the Stobcross Railway and the GD&HR.; The CGUR was absorbed jointly by the North British and Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1896, with the former company taking over the Bellgrove to Springburn branch. The line from Bellgrove was electrified in November 1960 as part of the North Clyde scheme, but regular services northward to Cowlairs ended in 1963, when the workers trains to Singer were withdrawn. However, three years later, trains from Cumbernauld were re-routed here with the closure of the Buchanan Street terminus to passenger traffic.Railscot - Buchanan Street Extension Passengers had to change onto the North Clyde Line at Springburn to reach the city, as there was no direct route to Queen Street main line station - trains had to reverse at Cowlairs, as the junction there faced north. Normal practice therefore was to operate a Cumbernauld to Springburn shuttle service which connected with the North Clyde line trains. Through running eventually commenced in 1989, albeit with a reversal in a loop alongside the carriage sidings and depot at Eastfield to begin with. Cumbernauld Line trains are now able to run directly to Queen Street High Level via the Cowlairs Chord - a single track south to east curve which was opened in 1993 by British Rail. Though currently diesel operated, the line is in the process of being electrified as part of the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme.EGIP - Cumbernauld ElectrificationEGIP/Network Rail; Retrieved 2014-01-16 Springburn station has kept its four platforms, with two used by through trains and the others by terminating services from Bellgrove and points west. Two through goods lines used to run past the station to the west; these formed the original E&G; Sighthill branch. They were latterly used to access the goods yard at Sighthill prior to its closure in October 1981, as well as to access St. Rollox railway works but they have since been lifted.Railscot - Sighthill BranchRailscot; Retrieved 2014-01-27 The station building was designed by James Carsewell - it is now protected as a category B listed building.

The Tularosa Basin is a graben basin in the Basin and Range Province and within the Chihuahuan Desert, east of the Rio Grande in southern New Mexico, in the Southwestern United States. Geography The Tularosa Basin is located primarily in Otero County. It covers about (35% larger than Connecticut). It lies between the Sacramento Mountains to the east, and the San Andres and Oscura Mountains to the west. The basin stretches about north–south, and at its widest is about east-west. It is geologically considered part of the Rio Grande Rift zone, which widens there due to the slight clockwise rotation of the Colorado Plateau tectonic plate. Notable features of the basin include White Sands National Park, Oliver Lee Memorial State Park, the Carrizozo Malpais lava flow, Holloman Air Force Base, and the White Sands Missile Range with the historic Trinity nuclear test Site. Tularosa Creek flows westward into the Tularosa Basin just north of the village of Tularosa. The distinct northwestern New Mexico Tularosa River is located in Catron County. Hydrologically, the Tularosa Basin is an endorheic basin, as no water flows out of it. The basin is closed to the north by Chupadera Mesa and to the south by the broad flat 4000-foot-elevation plain between the Franklin and Hueco Mountains, with the conventional boundary taken to be the New Mexico–Texas border. Surface water that does not evaporate or soak into the ground eventually accumulates at playas (intermittently dry lake beds), the largest of which is Lake Lucero, at 3888 feet elevation, at the southwest end of the White Sands dunes. The White Sands are a 710-km2 (275-mi2) field of white sand dunes composed of gypsum crystals. To the north of Lake Lucero are extensive alkali flats, which produce additional gypsum for wind deposition on the dunes.  History  ;Apache, Spanish, and U.S. 'Old West' When the Spanish arrived in the Tularosa Basin, they found springs and small streams coming from the Sacramento Mountains that fed a relatively lush grassland on the eastern side of the basin. While the Spanish tried some sheep ranching and some mining, the area remained firmly under Apache control until the 1850s, when the United States established its military presence at Fort Stanton (in the Sacramento Mountains) (1855–1896), Torreon Fort (near Lincoln) (1850s), and Camp Comfort (1858–1859) at White Sands. Under US military protection, the first permanent settlement was established in 1862, when about 50 Hispanic farmers from the Rio Grande Valley moved to Tularosa. Efforts to control the Apache waned somewhat during the American Civil War and serious American settlement did not begin until the late 1870s, when settlers and cattle ranchers from Texas began moving into the basin. Creosote bush—(Larrea tridentata), that replaced the overgrazed perennial grasslands. ;Grasslands and grazing The native grasslands in the Tularosa Basin were able to support large herds in the wet years of the 1880s. When the Americans first started running cattle, in some places, the native perennial bunchgrasses grew 'as high as a horse’s shoulder' - depending on species. One cowhand estimated in 1889 that 85,000 head were mustered within the basin, but said that was “far too heavy a burden for the range” - or beyond its carrying capacity.Tom Fraser in an interview in 1942, quoted in Sonnichsen, C.L. (1980) Tularosa: Last of the Frontier West Univ. of NM Press edition, p. 21. Severe drought followed for years, and the grassland pastures never recovered from the overgrazing, which continued in many instances for 75 years or more and caused top-soil erosion and desertification. Even within the White Sands Missile Range, where cattle grazing was eliminated in 1945, the effects from the 1890 -1945 period of overgrazing can still be seen nearly everywhere. Many areas that were historically known to be rich perennial grasslands are now xeric desert shrublands, with creosote bush—(Larrea tridentata) predominating. ;Groundwater salinization Since surface water was unable to sustain the cattle herds, ranchers turned to groundwater, and the easily reachable aquifer of 'sweet water' was pumped out and depleted from under the basin, leaving only brackish water. Applying the groundwater to the surface resulted in additional salts being dissolved and transported back down by groundwater recharge into the aquifer, increasing its salinity. By 2000, it became clear that salts in the aquifer needed to be significantly reduced if existing levels of water use were to continue. Therefore, in 2004, the Tularosa Basin National Desalination Research Facility was established in the basin at Alamogordo, as a joint project of the Federal Bureau of Reclamation and Sandia National Laboratories. It is a national center for researching procedures to reduce brackish water creation and to develop new technologies for desalination as it is increasingly found in present-day inland basin aquifers with agricultural irrigation and potable water withdrawal demands.  Ecology  The Tularosa Basin is in the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion, with the former Great Plains grassland habitat ecotones. Because of the closed nature of the basin, a number of unique ecological niches have developed. A significant number of endemic species are only found in the Tularosa Basin. These include the White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa) and the Oscura Mountains chipmunk. Counties While the Tularosa Basin lies primarily in New Mexican Otero County, it also extends into Doña Ana, Sierra, Lincoln, and Socorro Counties in New Mexico, and El Paso County in southwest Texas.

The life-cycle hypothesis suggests that individuals plan their consumption and savings behaviour over their life-cycle. They intend to even out their consumption in the best possible manner over their entire lifetimes, doing so by accumulating when they earn and dis-saving when they are retired. The key assumption is that all individuals choose to maintain stable lifestyles. This implies that they usually don't save up a lot in one period to spend furiously in the next period, but keep their consumption levels approximately the same in every period. Background In the early 1950s, Franco Modigliani and his student, Richard Brumberg, developed a theory based on the observation that people make consumption decisions based both on resources available to them over their lifetime, and on their current life stage. Modigliani and Brumberg observed that individuals build up assets at the initial stages of their working lives. Later on during retirement, they make use of their stock of assets. The working people save up for their post-retirement lives and alter their consumption patterns according to their needs at different stages of their lives. While based on an examination of individual behaviour, this theory provided important predictions for the economy as a whole. It predicts that the aggregate saving of a country is dependent on the rate of growth of national income, not its level. Also, the stock of wealth in an economy is related to the length of retirement span. Although there were initially many challenges to this theory of consumption, its relevance in economic thinking has been recently acknowledged. The hypothesis Assume that there is a consumer who expects to live for another T years and has wealth of W. The consumer also expects to annually earn income Y until he retires R years from now. In this situation, the consumer's resources over his lifetime consist both of his initial wealth endowment, W, and of his lifetime earnings, RY. Note that the interest rate is assumed to be zero. If the interest rate were positive, we would have to account for the interest earned on savings. The consumer can distribute his lifetime resources over the remaining T years of his life. He divides equally among T years and in each year he consumes :C = \\\\frac{W+RY}{T}. The consumption function of this person can be written as :C = \\\\frac{1}{T}W+ \\\\frac{R}{T}Y. If every individual in the economy plans consumption in this manner, then the aggregate consumption function will be quite similar to the individual one. Thus, the aggregate consumption function of the economy is :C = aW+bY, where a is the marginal propensity to consume for wealth and b is the marginal propensity to consume for income. Implications From the equation given above, it is clear that if the income falls to zero the amount of consumption will be equal to aW. However, this is not a fixed value, as it depends on wealth. Moreover, according to the given consumption function, the average propensity to consume is :\\\\frac{C}{Y} = a \\\\frac{W}{Y}+b. Since wealth does not change proportionately with income from individual to individual or from year to year, we should get the result that high income leads to a low average propensity to consume while looking at the data across persons or over short periods of time. However, generally over a long period of time, wealth and income increase together, which leads to a constant ratio ' and thus a constant average propensity to consume. To further analyse the implications of the life-cycle model, we start by considering the case of a stationary economy in which population and productivity are constant through time. Then, we relax these assumptions one by one. Saving and wealth when income and population are stable In an unpublished paper written with R. Brumberg, it was observed that if we make some rational guesses about the average duration of working life and retired life and additionally assume that the rate of earning is constant until retirement and so is the rate of consumption. Combining these assumptions with a zero rate of return on net worth, we can find, in a stationary economy of constant population and productivity, that the aggregate stock of wealth would be very significant. Moreover, under these conditions, the aggregate rate of saving would become zero as the level of positive saving by the individuals during their earning years would be offset by the dissaving of the retired households using up their earlier accumulation. Hence, wealth remains constant in totality while it is constantly being transferred from dissavers to savers in exchange for current resources. The effect of population growth Let us assume that income grows as a consequence of population growth—or due to growth in income per employed, itself a consequence of increasing productivity. We can then prove that saving is positive even if there are no bequests. We initially analyse the effect of pure population growth while keeping all other assumptions the same. If the size of the cohorts born in successive years grows at the rate p then both population and the aggregate income grow at the rate p. As a result of this growth there is an increase in the ratio of younger individuals in their earning phase to retired individuals in their dissaving phase—which leads to a positive net flow of saving. The effect of productivity growth We now consider the situation where population is stationary but average income earned at each age, and hence, aggregate income rises continuously over time due to increasing productivity. This also tends to lead to a positive rate of saving and a growing stock of wealth. This is because each successive cohort enjoys earning greater than the preceding cohorts, and thus a large level of consumption at each age—since, by assumption, the allocation of consumption over life remains unchanged in time. Moreover, this implies that the currently working generation will aim for a level of consumption in their post-retirement years larger than the consumption enjoyed by the currently retired individuals belonging to a less affluent generation. To support this future level of consumption post- retirement, the working individuals must save currently on a scale higher than the dissaving of the retired households. Hence even if population is stationary, net aggregate saving tends to be positive. Theory and evidence The findings of many economists bring out a problem in the life-cycle model. It was found out that the elderly do not dissave as quickly as has been said in the model. There are two explanations for the aforementioned behaviour of the elderly. The first explanation is that the retired individuals are cautious about unpredictable expenses. The additional saving that arises due to this behaviour is called precautionary saving. Precautionary saving may be made for the probable event of living longer than expected and hence having to provide for a longer than the planned span of retirement. Another rational reason is possibility of ill-health and huge medical expenses. These probable events make the elderly save more. The second explanation is that the elderly may save more so they can leave bequests to their children. This discourages dissaving at the expected rate. Elderly dissaving is also influenced by the present factors that materially prevent them form the possibility of spending their previous savings. One of them is the loss of the driving license. An extended survey held in 1998, 2000, and 2002 among the U.S. retired citizens highlighted that \\"about 90% of the trips among people older than age 65 are in a private vehicle\\" and that driving cessation was highly correlated (46% to 63%, Tobit regression) to a reduction in spending on non basic needs such as trips, tickets, and dinings out. Overall research on the retired section of the society show that the life-cycle model cannot completely explain consumer behaviour. Providing for retirement is an important reason for dissaving. However precautionary saving and bequests are also important. It also relevant to distinguish elderly poors in two basic tipologies: income poors alone, or income and consumption poors. While the life cycle hypothesis predicts the income and the consumption patterns of the elderly population, a series of research papers published in the 2000s highlighted the role of other factors in making the elderly class of people among the income poors alone, and not both income and consumption poors. It is the latter class of people the one who is the poorest among the older population. Those influencing factors are: the stock of assets and particularly the house property, the racial and scholarly background as well as the presence of family assistance network. According to another extended survey collected among \\"disadvantaged groups such as rural, female, less educated individuals\\" in Burkina Faso, the spread of mobile and easy-to-transfer money doesn't show any correlation with the level of saving for predictable events occurring in the future (such as consumption patterns during the age of retirement), while it increases the propensity to save for personal health emergencies and, in the second instance, for unpredictable events.

Summary Autobiography of Red is the story of a boy named Geryon who, at least in a metaphorical sense, is the Greek monster Geryon. It is unclear how much of the mythological Geryon's connection to the story's Geryon is literal, and how much is metaphorical. Sexually abused by his older brother, his affectionate mother too weak-willed to protect him, the monstrous young boy finds solace in photography and in a romance with a young man named Herakles. Herakles leaves his young lover at the peak of Geryon's infatuation; when Geryon comes across Herakles several years later on a trip to Argentina, Herakles' new lover Ancash forms the third point of a love triangle. The novel ends, ambiguously, with Geryon, Ancash, and Herakles stopping outside a bakery near a volcano. The book also contains Carson's very loose translation of the Geryoneis fragments, using many anachronisms and taking many liberties, and some discussion of both Stesichorus and the Geryon myth, including a fictional interview with \\"Stesichoros\\", a veiled reference to Gertrude Stein.  Style  Critic Sam Anderson describes the book as follows: > The book is subtitled \\"A Novel in Verse,\\" but—as usual with Carson—neither > \\"novel\\" nor \\"verse\\" quite seems to apply. It begins as if it were a critical > study of the ancient Greek poet Stesichoros, with special emphasis on a few > surviving fragments he wrote about a minor character from Greek mythology, > Geryon, a winged red monster who lives on a red island herding red cattle. > Geryon is most famous as a footnote in the life of Herakles, whose 10th > labor was to sail to that island and steal those cattle—in the process of > which, almost as an afterthought, he killed Geryon by shooting him in the > head with an arrow.

His > chief tormentor is Herakles, a charismatic ne'er-do-well who ends up > breaking Geryon's heart. The book is strange and sweet and funny, and the > remoteness of the ancient myth crossed with the familiarity of the modern > setting (hockey practice, buses, baby sitters) creates a particularly > Carsonian effect: the paradox of distant closeness. Reception Autobiography of Red was warmly received by authors and critics, with highly positive reviews from Alice Munro, Michael Ondaatje, Susan Sontag, among others. The book also sold unusually well for literary poetry, with at least 25,000 copies sold by the year 2000, two years after its publication. It was described as \\"one of the crossover classics of contemporary poetry: poetry that can seduce even people who don't like poetry\\"Sam Anderson, \\"The Inscrutable Brilliance of Anne Carson,\\" The New York Times Magazine, March 17, 2013. and Carson herself as \\"that rarest of rare things, a bestselling poet.\\" The book was referenced, alongside Carson's previous work Eros the Bittersweet, in a 2004 episode of The L Word.

After a career in the steel industry, he was Conservative Member of Parliament for Arundel for 23 years, from the February 1974 general election until the constituency was abolished in 1997. He was the first MP with an MBA from Harvard, and was a junior government minister in Margaret Thatcher's first government, from 1979 to 1981. He was heavily engaged with the Inter- Parliamentary Union, and had interests in theatre, cricket, golf, and wrote a number of books. Early and private life Marshall was born in Sheffield. His father was a printer, and his mother performed in music hall. He was educated at Bradfield College before began he a business career. He joined United Steel in Sheffield in 1951, managed a branch in Calcutta from 1954 to 1958, obtained an MBA from Harvard University in 1960, and also studied at Stanford University, and then managed a branch in Bombay until 1964. He was commercial director at the company's steelworks in Workington from 1964, and then moved to become managing director of engineering group Head Wrightson Export in 1967. He joined Urwick Orr & Partners as a management consultant in 1969. He married Caroline Oliphant in 1972, acquiring two stepdaughters. Political career He joined the Young Conservatives in 1950, but remained relatively inactive in politics until 1970, when he contested The Hartlepools, a safe Labour seat. He became MP for Arundel in the February 1974 general election, and retained his seat until his retirement from politics in 1997. In Parliament, his knowledge of the steel industry made him an effective critic of Sir Don Ryder's plan to nationalise British Leyland. He was a member of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, and realised that British Steel Corporation needed major reconstruction. He was able to implement his ideas when he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Industry in 1979, under Sir Keith Joseph, where his portfolio that included aerospace, information technology, telecommunications, the Post Office, shipbuilding, space and steel. He was a strong supporter of Japanese investment in British industry. He oversaw the denationalisation of Cable & Wireless and the launch of Teletext. Marshall returned to the back benches in 1981. He took an interest in the fledgling British space industry, lobbying for British participation in Ariane. He was also a member of the Defence Select Committee, a role that was controversial as he was a paid adviser to British Aerospace. He was also involved in the parliamentary-industry discussion group, Pitcom, becoming its chairman in 1987. He was closely involved with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, being a vice-chairman from 1985 to 1987, chairman from 1987 to 1990, presiding over its Centenary Conference in 1989, was its world president from 1991 to 1994, and was then appointed honorary life president. He was knighted and appointed a deputy lieutenant of West Sussex in 1990. He retired at the 1997 general election, when the boundaries of his seat were changed. He continued his business interests in retirement. After converting to Roman Catholicism in later life, he became a non-executive director of The Catholic Herald in 2003. Outside politics Marshall was a keen cricketer, having played for Harvard and Nepal. He captained the Lords and Commons Cricket XI, was a member of the MCC, and was active in the Lord's Taverners. He also commentated on cricket in India for the BBC, and was a member of the All India Radio Test match panel during his 10 years working in India. He also played golf, and was a member of the Royal & Ancient in St Andrews and a club near Worthing. He was also an author. He published Top Hat and Tails in 1979, a biography of Jack Buchanan; The Timetable of Technology in 1982; Gentlemen and Players in 1987, an account of the annual Gentlemen versus Players cricket matches held between English first-class cricket amateurs and their professional colleagues from 1919 to 1962; Cricket at the Castle in 1995, about cricket at Arundel Castle Cricket Club; and More Sussex Seams in 1999. He also wrote five plays for television, and biographies for radio, and edited two volumes of monologues by Stanley Holloway, published in 1979 and 1980, as well as The Book of Comic and Dramatic Monologues, published in 1981.

First developed by Milton Friedman, it supposes that a person's consumption at a point in time is determined not just by their current income but also by their expected income in future years—their \\"permanent income\\". In its simplest form, the hypothesis states that changes in permanent income, rather than changes in temporary income, are what drive the changes in a consumer's consumption patterns. Its predictions of consumption smoothing, where people spread out transitory changes in income over time, depart from the traditional Keynesian emphasis on the marginal propensity to consume. It has had a profound effect on the study of consumer behavior, and provides an explanation for some of the failures of Keynesian demand management techniques. Income consists of a permanent (anticipated and planned) component and a transitory (windfall gain/unexpected) component. In the permanent income hypothesis model, the key determinant of consumption is an individual's lifetime income, not his current income. Permanent income is defined as expected long-term average income. Assuming consumers experience diminishing marginal utility, they will want to smooth out consumption over time, e.g. take on debt as a student and also ensure savings for retirement. Coupled with the idea of average lifetime income, the consumption smoothing element of the PIH predicts that transitory changes in income will have only a small effect on consumption. Only longer- lasting changes in income will have a large effect on spending. A consumer's permanent income is determined by their assets: physical (property), financial (shares, bonds) and human (education and experience). These influence the consumer's ability to earn income. The consumer can then make an estimation of anticipated lifetime income. A worker saves only if they expect that their long-term average income, i.e. their permanent income, will be less than their current income. Origins The American economist Milton Friedman developed the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) in his 1957 book A Theory of the Consumption Function. As classical Keynesian consumption theory was unable to explain the constancy of the saving rate in the face of rising real incomes in the United States, a number of new theories of consumer behavior emerged. In his book, Friedman posits a theory that encompasses many of the competing hypotheses at the time as special cases and presents statistical evidence in support of his theory. Theoretical considerations In his theory, John Maynard Keynes supported economic policy makers by his argument emphasizing their capability of macroeconomic fine-tuning. The only problem was that actual consumption time series were much less volatile than the predictions derived from the theory of Keynes. For Keynes, consumption expenditures are linked to disposable income by a parameter called the marginal propensity to consume. However, since the marginal propensity to consume itself is a function of income, it is also true that additional increases in disposable income lead to diminishing increases in consumption expenditures: in other words, the marginal propensity to consume has an inverse relation with real income. It must be stressed that the relation characterized by substantial stability links current consumption expenditures to current disposable income—and, on these grounds, a considerable leeway is provided for aggregate demand stimulation, since a change in income immediately results in a multiplied shift in aggregate demand (this is the essence of the Keynesian case of the multiplier effect). The same is true of tax cut policies. According to the basic theory of Keynes, governments are always capable of countercyclical fine-tuning of macroeconomic systems through demand management. The permanent income hypothesis questions this ability of governments. However, it is also true that permanent income theory is concentrated mainly on long-run dynamics and relations, while Keynes focused primarily on short-run considerations. The emergence of the PIH raised serious debates, and the authors tried either to verify or to falsify the theory of Friedman—in the latter case, arguments were directed mainly towards stressing that the relation between consumption and disposable income still follows (more or less) the mechanism supposed by Keynes. According to some hints dropped in the literature, PIH has the advantage (among others) that it can help us resolve the (alleged) inconsistency between occasionally arising large-scale fluctuations of disposable income and the considerable stability of consumption expenditures. Friedman starts elaborating his theory under the assumption of complete certainty. Under these conditions, a consumer unit precisely knows each definite sum it will receive in each of a finite number of periods and knows in advance the consumer prices plus the deposit and the borrowing rates of interest that will prevail in each period. Under such circumstances, for Friedman, there are only two motives for a consumer unit to spend more or less on consumption than its income: The first is to smooth its consumption expenditures through appropriate timing of borrowing and lending; and the second is either to realize interest earnings on deposits if the relevant rate of interest is positive, or to benefit from borrowing if the interest rate is negative. The concrete behaviour of a consumer unit under the joint influence of these factors depends on its tastes and preferences. According to the PIH, the distribution of consumption across consecutive periods is the result of an optimizing method by which each consumer tries to maximize his utility. At the same time, whatever ratio of income one devotes to consumption in each period, all these consumption expenditures are allocated in the course of an optimization process—that is, consumer units try to optimize not only across periods but within each period. We have a fundamentally different framework if expectations are rational (REH). Under these circumstances, not only some past but also all information about the future available at the moment is utilized in forming expectations about permanent income. To revise the level of consumption expenditures it is not enough to realize the changes in current income, since if this shift could be foreseen, rationally expecting agents build this development into their expectations in advance. Consumption follows a random walk path under REH. Simple model Consider a (potentially infinitely-lived) consumer who maximizes his expected lifetime utility from the consumption of a stream of goods c between periods t and T, as determined by one-period utility function u(\\\\cdot). In each period t, he receives an income y_t, which he can either spend on a consumption good c_t or save in the form of an asset A_t that pays a constant real interest rate r in the next period. The utility of consumption in future periods is discounted at the rate \\\\beta\\\\in(0,1). Finally, let \\\\operatorname E_t[\\\\cdot] denote expectation conditional on the information available in period t. Formally, the consumer's problem is then : \\\\max_{\\\\\\\\{c_k\\\\\\\\}_{k=t}^T} \\\\operatorname E_t\\\\sum_{k=0}^{T-t} \\\\beta^k u(c_{t+k}) subject to : A_{t+1} = (1+r)(A_t + y_t - c_t). Assuming that the utility function is quadratic, and that (1+r)\\\\beta = 1, the optimal consumption choice of the consumer is governed by the Euler equation : c_t = \\\\operatorname E_t[c_{t+1}]. Given a finite time horizon of length T-t, we set A_{T+1}=0 with the understanding the consumer spends all his wealth by the end of the last period. Solving the consumer's budget constraint forward to the last period, we determine that the consumption function is given by \\\\left[A_t + \\\\sum_{k=0}^{T-t} \\\\left(\\\\frac 1 {1+r}\\\\right)^k \\\\operatorname E_t[y_{t+k}] \\\\right]. }} Over an infinite time horizon, we instead impose a no-Ponzi game condition, which prevents the consumer from continuously borrowing and rolling over his debt to future periods, by requiring : \\\\lim_{t\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\left(\\\\frac 1 {1+r}\\\\right)^t A_t=0. The resulting consumption function is then Both expressions () and () capture the essence of the permanent income hypothesis: current consumption is determined by a combination of current non-human wealth A_t and human capital wealth y_t. The fraction of total wealth consumed today further depends on the interest rate r and the length of the time horizon over which the consumer is optimizing. Empirical evidence An early test of the permanent income hypothesis was reported by Robert Hall in 1978. Hall notes that if previous consumption was based on all information consumers had at the time, past income should not contain any additional explanatory power about current consumption above past consumption. This prediction is supported by the data, which Hall interprets as support for a slightly modified version of the permanent income hypothesis. Hall and Frederic Mishkin (1982) analyze data from 2,000 households and find that consumption responds much more strongly to permanent than to transitory movements of income and that the PIH is compatible with 80% of households in the sample. Ben Bernanke (1984) finds \\"no evidence against the permanent income hypothesis\\" when looking at data on automobile consumption. In contrast, Marjorie Flavin (1981) finds that consumption is very sensitive to transitory income shocks, a rejection of the PIH. Greg Mankiw and Matthew Shapiro (1985) however dispute these findings, arguing that Flavin's test specification (which assumes that income is stationary) is biased towards finding excess sensitivity. More recently, Nicholas Souleles (1999) uses income tax refunds to test the PIH. Since a refund depends on income in the previous year, it is predictable income and should thus not alter consumption in the year of its receipt. The evidence finds that consumption does indeed respond to the income refund, with a marginal propensity to consume between 35–60%. Melvin Stephens (2003) finds that the consumption patterns of social security recipients in the United States is not well explained by the PIH. Many of the rejections of the PIH emphasize the importance of liquidity constraints. This places a focus not on the PIH's behavioral assumptions, but rather on its ancillary assumption that consumers can easily borrow or lend. This insight has led to adjustments of the simplest PIH model to account for e.g. capital market imperfections. Some of these adjustments to the PIH, such as the buffer-stock version of Christopher Carroll (1997) have added further evidence supporting consumption smoothing. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 3000 tests of the permanent income hypothesis reported in 144 studies found that many rejections of the PIH are due to publication bias and that, after correction for publication bias, the PIH is consistent with data. Policy implications The PIH helps explain the failure of transitory Keynesian demand management techniques to achieve its policy targets. In a simple Keynesian framework the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is assumed constant, and so temporary tax cuts can have a large stimulating effect on demand. The PIH framework suggests that a consumer will spread out the gains from a temporary tax cut over a long horizon, and so the stimulus effect will be much smaller. There is evidence supporting such a view, e.g. Shapiro and Slemrod (2003).

Those networks can consist of terrestrial transmitters for analogue or digital radio and TV, cable networks or satellites (either for direct reception, DTH, or intended for cable television headends). The playout happens in master control in a playout area, which can be either situated in the central apparatus room or in purposely built playout centres, which can be owned by a broadcaster or run by an independent specialist company that has been contracted to handle the playout for a number of channels from different broadcasters. Some of the larger playout centres in Europe, Southeast Asia and the United States handle well in excess of 50 radio and TV \\"feeds\\". Feeds would often consist of several different versions of a core service, often different language versions or with separately scheduled content, such as local opt outs for news or promotions. Playout systems Centralcasting is multi-channel playout that generally uses broadcast automation systems with broadcast programming applications. These systems generally work in a similar way, controlling video servers, video tape recorder (VTR) devices, Flexicarts, audio mixing consoles, vision mixers and video routers, and other devices using a serial communications 9-Pin Protocol (RS-232 or RS-422). This provides deterministic control, enabling frame accurate playback, Instant replay or video switching. Many systems consist of a front end operator interface on a separate platform to the controllers – e.g. a Windows GUI will present a friendly easy to use method of editing a playlist, but actually control would be done on a platform with a \\"real time\\" operating system such that any large scale playlist amendments do not cause any delays to device control. Most broadcast automation systems will have a series of common device drivers built in, for example Sony VTR control (aka Sony Serial), Louth Video Disk Control Protocol (VDCP, a proprietary communications protocol), General Purpose Interface (GPI), Grass Valley Group M21 Master Control. This ensures that a broadcast automation system bought \\"off the shelf\\" will at least be able to ingest and playout content, although may not be able to take advantage of more efficient methods of control. Most server, and especially most digital on-screen graphic and character generator (CG) manufacturers will have a specific device driver for their device, with increasing degrees of complexity, and different automation companies will include these drivers to enhance their product or to fit a customers need. This is the \\"traditional\\" method of Playout Automation, where there are multiple devices. Modern automation systems use the Automated Playout method, which is where the broadcast server fulfills the functions of the multiple devices, and is a self-contained system, like the PlayBox Technology Channel in a Box. Playout devices Playout will usually involve an airchain of devices which begin with content, typically stored on video servers, and ultimately an output, either as an (Asynchronous serial interface) (ASI) / IP or (Serial Digital Interface) (SDI) for on pass to a distribution company. The devices in the chain depend on the service required under the contract with the Channel. Typically a standard television channel would require a Master Control Video switcher, and/or a Video router to allow switching of live sources. This video switcher may include other functions such as keying (graphics) (also known as Down Stream Keyers), Audio Overs for mixing in voice overs (VO) or announcements, and facilitate transitions between events, such as a fade through black or crossfade (also known as mix). Other devices include: Graphics inserters – At least one Graphics inserter, or one with several layers. This allows for Station identification/Logo/Digital on-screen graphic (Dog or Bug) insertion, and can also be used for end credits sequences, coming next graphics or programme information straps Subtitling inserters – This can be either closed or open – i.e. in vision as a graphic for all to see, or closed either as an MPEG stream item, Closed Captioning or World System Teletext. Audio servers – An audio playout system would provide scheduled voiceovers Aspect Ratio Converters – These alter the picture shape or send an embedded signal to allow the material format to be displayed correctly on a particular feed (e.g. Widescreen on a standard non-widescreen Analogue terrestrial feed) Some of these more advanced devices require information from the playlist, and so do not tend to use an RS422/232 driver, but a complex XML based system which allows for more complex metadata to be passed, e.g. a \\"Now\\" or \\"Next\\" Graphic can be created from a template using text information from the playlist. Playout Centers Playout is one of the basic infrastructure of a playout center. Mostly called as channel in a box server, but basically composed of playout servers with integrated graphics and IP or ASI output. Aim of playout centers is mostly to serve customers a simple file based television facility. Up-link and TV Channel in a box servers simply provide the facility. Workflow A common workflow is for the broadcast automation system to have a recording schedule to ingest material from a satellite or line feed source and then time-shift that material based on a playlist or schedule. The playout schedule will have been created in the customer's broadcast programming scheduling system and exported into a format suitable to be used in the Playout system. There is a move to SMPTE-22, known as Broadcast Exchange Format (BXF) to try to standardise the messaging involved in this interaction. The resulting playlist is \\"loaded\\" into the appropriate channel of the broadcast automation system in advance of the transmission time. Various processes will take place to ensure the content is available on the correct servers for playout at the right time, typically this involves advance requests to move material from deep storage such as Tape Archives or FTP Clusters to Broadcast Video servers, often using FTP. On playing out the material, the audio and video signals are usually transported from the playout area to the network via a studio/transmitter link (STL), which may be fibre backlink, microwave or satellite uplink. Playout is often referred to as Presentation or Transmission (TX), and is under control of an automatic transmission system.

SH-325 runs for through Cimarron County, Oklahoma, from a continuation of New Mexico State Road 456 at the New Mexico border west of Kenton to the traffic circle in Boise City. Along the way it provides access to Black Mesa State Park, near Black Mesa, the highest point in the state of Oklahoma. Route description SH-325 begins at the tip of the Oklahoma Panhandle, where NM 456 crosses into Oklahoma from Union County, New Mexico. Just east of the state line, the highway bridges Carrizozo Creek, just upstream of where it empties into the Cimarron River. Just east of the state line, SH-325 passes through the town of Kenton. Further east of Kenton, the highway crosses over Tesesquite Creek and South Carrizo Creek, both tributaries of the Cimarron River. After crossing South Carrizo Creek, the road gradually curves onto a south–north alignment. SH-325 heads south for about , crossing the intermittent Cold Springs Creek. The road then turns east. The remainder of the route is a mostly flat, straight shot into Boise City, with a minor curve to the west of town where it crosses a railroad track. The route ends at the traffic circle surrounding the Cimarron County Courthouse in downtown Boise City. History The road between Kenton and Boise City that is now SH-325 has carried a bevy of designations, and has been intermittently included and excluded from the state highway system over the years. The road was first numbered as a state route in 1926, when the original SH-11 was extended west from its original terminus in Boise City. At the same time, the U.S. route system was being introduced to Oklahoma, and under this new system, the highway received the additional designation as US-64. On the 1928 official state map, this portion of highway is marked as \\"Not maintained\\", though the route continued to carry both highway designations. By 1930, the road was once again state-maintained, and the old SH-11 designation had been done away with as the U.S. route system established itself and superseded the now-redundant state highway numbers that it replaced. US-64, using the Kenton route, would continue to serve as the only state highway connection to New Mexico until the middle of the century. On July 7, 1947, US-64 was shifted onto a new road that had opened, extending southwest from Boise City and crossing into New Mexico near the southwest corner of the Panhandle. This left the route to Kenton without a designation, which it would lack for the rest of the 1940s, the 1950s, and most of the 1960s. Kenton was briefly reconnected to the state highway system when State Highway 134 was designated along the old alignment of US-64. This highway was only shown on the 1963 state highway map, implying that it was commissioned the year before and revoked sometime that year. By the time SH-134 was designated, the highway had been fully paved. When SH-134 was decommissioned, its alignment continued to persist on the state highway map, with the legend \\"(not on highway system)\\" and no shields. The old US-64 route to Kenton finally received its present-day designation in 1973, when it was numbered after the already-existing NM 325, which once extended to the Oklahoma state line.

The term \\"mind transfer\\" also refers to a hypothetical transfer of a mind from one biological brain to another. Uploaded minds and societies of minds, often in simulated realities, are recurring themes in science-fiction novels and films since the 1950s.  Early and particularly important examples  A story featuring an artificial brain that replicates the personality of a specific person is \\"The Infinite Brain\\" by John Scott Campbell, written under the name John C. Campbell,The author's real name is noted on p. 50 of Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years edited by Everett Franklin Bleiler and Richard Bleiler. and published in the May 1930 issue of Science Wonder Stories.May 1930 issue of Science Wonder Stories on archive.org The artificial brain is created by an inventor named Anton Des Roubles, who tells the narrator that \\"I am attempting to construct a mechanism exactly duplicating the mechanical and electrical processes occurring in the human brain and constituting the phenomena known as thought.\\" The narrator later learns that Des Roubles has died, and on visiting his laboratory, finds a machine that can communicate with him via typed messages, and which tells him \\"I, Anton Des Roubles, am dead—my body is dead—but I still live. I am this machine. These racks of apparatus are my brains, which is thinking even as yours is. Anton Des Roubles is dead but he has built me, his exact mental duplicate, to carry on his life and work.\\" The machine also tells him \\"He made my brain precisely like his, built three hundred thousand cells for my memory, and filled two hundred thousand of them with his own knowledge. I have his personality; it is my own through a process I will tell you of later. ... I think just as you do. I have a consciousness as have other men.\\" He then explains his discovery that the electrical impulses in the brain create magnetic fields that can be detected by a device he built called a \\"Telepather\\", and that \\"[t]hrough this instrument any one's mental condition can be exactly duplicated.\\" Later, he enlists the narrator's help in constructing a new type of artificial brain that will retain his memories but possess an expanded intellect, though the experiment does not go as planned, as the new intelligence has a radically different personality and soon sets out to conquer the world. An early story featuring technological transfer of memories and personality from one brain to another is \\"Intelligence Undying\\" by Edmond Hamilton, first published in the April 1936 issue of Amazing Stories. In this story, an elderly scientist named John Hanley explains that when humans are first born, \\"our minds are a blank sheet except for certain reflexes which we all inherit. But from our birth onward, our minds are affected by all about us, our reflexes are conditioned, as the behaviorists say. All we experience is printed on the sheet of our minds. ... Everything a human being learns, therefore, simply establishes new connections between the nerve cells of the brain. ... As I said, a newborn child has no such knowledge connections in his cortex at all—he has not yet formed any. Now if I take that child immediately after birth and establish in his brain exactly the same web of intricate neurone connections I have built up in my own brain, he will have exactly the same mind, memories, knowledge, as I have ... his mind will be exactly identical with my mind!\\" He then explains he has developed a technique to do just this, saying \\"I've devised a way to scan my brain's intricate web of neurone connections by electrical impulses, and by means of those impulses to build up an exactly identical web of neurone connections in the infant's brain. Just as a television scanning-disk can break down a complicated picture into impulses that reproduce the picture elsewhere.\\" He adds that the impulses scanning his brain will kill him, but the \\"counter-impulses\\" imprinting the same pattern on the baby's brain will not harm him. The story shows the successful transfer of John Hanley's mind to the baby, whom he describes as \\"John Hanley 2nd\\", and then skips forward to the year 3144 to depict \\"John Hanley, 21st\\" using his advanced technology to become the ruler of the Earth in order to end a war between the two great political powers of the time, and then further ahead to \\"John Hanley, 416th\\" helping to evacuate humanity to the planet Mercury in response to the Sun shrinking into a white dwarf. He chooses to remain on Earth awaiting death, so that people would \\"learn once more to do for themselves, would become again a strong a self-reliant race\\", with Hanley concluding that he \\"had been wrong in living as a single super-mind down through the ages. He saw that now, and now he was undoing that wrong.\\" A story featuring human minds replicated in a computer is the novella Izzard and the Membrane by Walter M. Miller, Jr., first published in May 1951.Roberson, William H. Walter M. Miller, Jr.: A Reference Guide to His Fiction and His Life, p. 83. In this story, an American cyberneticist named Scott MacDonney is captured by Russians and made to work on an advanced computer, Izzard, which they plan to use to coordinate an attack on the United States. He has conversations with Izzard as he works on it, and when he asks it if it is self-aware, it says \\"answer indeterminate\\" and then asks \\"can human individual's self-awareness transor be mechanically duplicated?\\" MacDonney is unfamiliar with the concept of a self-awareness transor (it is later revealed that this information was loaded into Izzard by a mysterious entity who may nor may not be GodSamuelson, David N. \\"The Lost Canticles of Walter M. Miller, Jr.. *Science Fiction Studies*, March 1976.), and Izzard defines it by saying \\"A self-awareness transor is the mathematical function which describes the specific consciousness pattern of one human individual.\\"From p. 34 of Year's Best Science Fiction Novels 1952, which reprinted \\"Izzard and the Membrane.\\" It is later found that this mathematical function can indeed be duplicated, although not by a detailed scan of the individual's brain as in later notions of mind uploading; instead, Donney just has to describe the individual verbally in sufficient detail, and Izzard uses this information to locate the transor in the appropriate \\"mathematical region\\". In Izzard's words, \\"to duplicate consciousness of deceased, it will be necessary for you to furnish anthropometric and psychic characteristics of the individual. These characteristics will not determine transor, but will only give its general form. Knowing its form, will enable me to sweep my circuit pattern through its mathematical region until the proper transor is reached. At that point, the consciousness will appear among the circuits.\\"From pp. 47-48 of Year's Best Science Fiction Novels 1952. Using this method, MacDonney is able to recreate the mind of his dead wife in Izzard's memory, as well as create a virtual duplicate of himself, which seems to have a shared awareness with the biological MacDonney. In The Altered Ego by Jerry Sohl (1954), a person's mind can be \\"recorded\\" and used to create a \\"restoration\\" in the event of their death. In a restoration, the person's biological body is repaired and brought back to life, and their memories are restored to the last time that they had their minds recorded (what the story calls a 'brain record'Sohl, Jerry. The Altered Ego (1954), p. 70), an early example of a story in which a person can create periodic backups of their own mind which are stored in an artificial medium. The recording process is not described in great detail, but it is mentioned that the recording is used to create a duplicate or \\"dupe\\" which is stored in the \\"restoration bank\\",Sohl, Jerry. The Altered Ego (1954), p. 100 and at one point a lecturer says that \\"The experience of the years, the neurograms, simple memory circuits—neurons, if you wish—stored among these nerve cells, are transferred to the dupe, a group of more than ten billion molecules in colloidal suspension. They are charged much as you would charge the plates of a battery, the small neuroelectrical impulses emanating from your brain during the recording session being duplicated on the molecular structure in the solution.\\"Sohl, Jerry. The Altered Ego (1954), p. 105 During restoration, they take the dupe and \\"infuse it into an empty brain\\", and the plot turns on the fact that it is possible to install one person's dupe in the body of a completely different person.Sohl, Jerry. The Altered Ego (1954), p. 139 An early example featuring uploaded minds in robotic bodies can be found in Frederik Pohl's story \\"The Tunnel Under the World\\" from 1955. In this story, the protagonist Guy Burckhardt continually wakes up on the same date from a dream of dying in an explosion. Burckhardt is already familiar with the idea of putting human minds in robotic bodies, since this is what is done with the robot workers at the nearby Contro Chemical factory. As someone has once explained it to him, \\"each machine was controlled by a sort of computer which reproduced, in its electronic snarl, the actual memory and mind of a human being ... It was only a matter, he said, of transferring a man's habit patterns from brain cells to vacuum-tube cells.\\" Later in the story, Pohl gives some additional description of the procedure: \\"Take a master petroleum chemist, infinitely skilled in the separation of crude oil into its fractions. Strap him down, probe into his brain with searching electronic needles. The machine scans the patterns of the mind, translates what it sees into charts and sine waves. Impress these same waves on a robot computer and you have your chemist. Or a thousand copies of your chemist, if you wish, with all of his knowledge and skill, and no human limitations at all.\\" After some investigation, Burckhardt learns that his entire town had been killed in a chemical explosion, and the brains of the dead townspeople had been scanned and placed into miniature robotic bodies in a miniature replica of the town (as a character explains to him, 'It's as easy to transfer a pattern from a dead brain as a living one'), so that a businessman named Mr. Dorchin could charge companies to use the townspeople as test subjects for new products and advertisements. Something close to the notion of mind uploading is very briefly mentioned in Isaac Asimov's 1956 short story The Last Question: \\"One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain.\\" A more detailed exploration of the idea (and one in which individual identity is preserved, unlike in Asimov's story) can be found in Arthur C. Clarke's novel The City and the Stars, also from 1956 (this novel was a revised and expanded version of Clarke's earlier story Against the Fall of Night, but the earlier version did not contain the elements relating to mind uploading). The story is set in a city named Diaspar one billion years in the future, where the minds of inhabitants are stored as patterns of information in the city's Central Computer in between a series of 1000-year lives in cloned bodies. Various commentators identify this story as one of the first (if not the first) to deal with mind uploading, human-machine synthesis, and computerized immortality.Geraci, Robert M. (2010), Apocalyptic AI: Visions of Heaven in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality, p. 54. Note however that although Geraci deems this the first story to feature mind uploading, he incorrectly gives the publication date as 1953, which is actually the publication date of the novel Against the Fall of Night which The City and the Stars was a revised version of.Tofts, Darren and Annemarie Jonson, Alessio Cavallaro (2004), Prefiguring Cyberculture: An Intellectual History, p. 253Bainbridge, William Sims (2004), Berkshire Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction, p. 438.Dinello, Daniel (2006), Technophobia!: Science Fiction Visions of Posthuman Technology, p. 172. Another of the \\"firsts\\" is the novel Detta är verkligheten (This is reality), 1968, by the renowned philosopher and logician Bertil Mårtensson, a novel in which he describes people living in an uploaded state as a means to control overpopulation. The uploaded people believe that they are \\"alive\\", but in reality they are playing elaborate and advanced fantasy games. In a twist at the end, the author changes everything into one of the best \\"multiverse\\" ideas of science fiction. In Robert Silverberg's To Live Again (1969), an entire worldwide economy is built up around the buying and selling of \\"souls\\" (personas that have been tape-recorded at six-month intervals), allowing well- heeled consumers the opportunity to spend tens of millions of dollars on a medical treatment that uploads the most recent recordings of archived personalities into the minds of the buyers. Federal law prevents people from buying a \\"personality recording\\" unless the possessor first had died; similarly, two or more buyers were not allowed to own a \\"share\\" of the persona. In this novel, the personality recording always went to the highest bidder. However, when one attempted to buy (and therefore possess) too many personalities, there was the risk that one of the personas would wrest control of the body from the possessor. In the 1982 novel Software, part of the Ware Tetralogy by Rudy Rucker, one of the main characters, Cobb Anderson, has his mind downloaded and his body replaced with an extremely human-like android body. The robots who persuade Anderson into doing this sell the process to him as a way to become immortal. In William Gibson's award-winning Neuromancer (1984), which popularized the concept of \\"cyberspace\\", a hacking tool used by the main character is an artificial infomorph of a notorious cyber-criminal, Dixie Flatline. The infomorph only assists in exchange for the promise that he be deleted after the mission is complete. The fiction of Greg Egan has explored many of the philosophical, ethical, legal, and identity aspects of mind transfer, as well as the financial and computing aspects (i.e. hardware, software, processing power) of maintaining \\"copies.\\" In Egan's Permutation City (1994), Diaspora (1997) and Zendegi (2010), \\"copies\\" are made by computer simulation of scanned brain physiology. See also Egan's \\"jewelhead\\" stories, where the mind is transferred from the organic brain to a small, immortal backup computer at the base of the skull, the organic brain then being surgically removed. The movie The Matrix is commonly mistaken for a mind uploading movie, but with exception to suggestions in later movies, it is only about virtual reality and simulated reality, since the main character Neo's physical brain still is required for his mind to reside in. The mind (the information content of the brain) is not copied into an emulated brain in a computer. Neo's physical brain is connected into the Matrix via a brain- machine interface. Only the rest of the physical body is simulated. Neo is disconnected from and reconnected to this dreamworld. James Cameron's 2009 movie Avatar has so far been the commercially most successful example of a work of fiction that features a form of mind uploading. Throughout most of the movie, the hero's mind has not actually been uploaded and transferred to another body, but is simply controlling the body from a distance, a form of telepresence. However, at the end of the movie the hero's mind is uploaded into Eywa, the mind of the planet, and then back into his Avatar body.  Further examples  Mind transfer is a theme in many other works of science fiction in a wide range of media. Specific examples include the following: Literature * Frederik Pohl's story The Tunnel under the World (1955). See above article. * Isaac Asimov's short story The Last Question (1956). See above article. * Arthur C. Clarke's The City and the Stars (1956).

The final stages of the Encoding are described in the chapter 14 of Noon: 22nd Century (Candles Before the Control Board), first published in 1961. * Clifford D. Simak's Hugo- shortlisted novel Time is the Simplest Thing (1961) is based around mind copying and uploading. The initial swap involves 'the Pinkness' giving 'Shep Blaine' a very large number of minds that it has collected over the aeons in exchange for a copy of his mind. * Philip José Farmer's World of Tiers series (1965–1993) introduces the villainous Bellers, who were laboratory machines designed to temporarily hold Lord's consciousness between clone bodies, which became sentient and self replicating.onto a Holopox unit shortly before being nuked by the KGB. * In Roger Zelazny's Lord of Light (1967), the characters can technologically \\"transmigrate\\" their minds into new bodies. * In Arthur C. Clarke's novel 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the beings controlling the monoliths were once alien lifeforms that had uploaded their minds into robotic bodies and finally into the fabric of space and time itself. The character Dave Bowman undergoes an uploading from the body of a human into a \\"ghost\\", as he is described in later books. * Bertil Mårtensson's novel Detta är verkligheten (This is reality), 1968.

This option is also available in Rifts Sourcebook 1. In either case it can be permanent. * William Gibson's novel Neuromancer (1984). See opening section for details. * Frederik Pohl's novel Heechee Rendezvous (1984) was the first in his Heechee series in which the protagonist Robinette Broadhead had been uploaded into a computer after his death.

The story also features Bear's notion of the Taylor algorithms which allow a mentality to discover what type of system it is running on (for example, Bear writes on p. 109 that with these algorithms, \\"a downloaded mentality could tell whether or not it had been downloaded\\"). * Janet Asimov's Mind Transfer (1988) journeys through the birth, life, death, and second life of a man whose family pioneers human-to-android mind transfer. It also explores the ethical and moral issues of transferring consciousness into an android at the moment of death, and examines the idea of prematurely activating an android which has not yet accepted a human brain scan. * Several characters in Kyle Allen's The Archon Conspiracy (1989) are repeatedly killed and resurrected in prosthetic bodies, once a \\"pattern map\\" of their brains is recovered and hard-wired into an artificial neural net.

The duplicates only last 24 hours, and the original can then choose whether or not to upload the ditto's memories back into himself afterward. Most people use dittos to do their work. * Richard K. Morgan's Altered Carbon (2002) and other Takeshi Kovacs books, where everyone has a \\"cortical stack\\" implanted at the base of their skull, soon after being born.

The same theme is found in P F Hamilton's Mindstar Rising (1993) in which an industrialist's mind is also uploaded to a storage device. * Similar themes are also found in Broken Angels and Altered Carbon by Richard Morgan. * Hannu Rajaniemi's Quantum Thief series (2010–2014), which includes the novels The Quantum Thief, The Fractal Prince and The Causal Angel, describes a posthuman world where uploaded minds (named gogols) are widely used as intellectual software utilized for various purposes including data analysis, planning and control of embedded systems. * Clyde Dsouza's Memories with Maya (2013) looks at how deep learning processes, and 'Digital Breadcrumbs' left behind by people (tweets, Facebook updates, blogs) combined with memories of living relatives can be used to re-construct a mind and augment it with narrow AI libraries. The resulting 'Dirrogate' or Digital Surrogate can be thought of as a posthumous mind upload. * Damien Boyes's series Lost Time (2015-), features characters whose minds are uploaded and digitally restored into artificial bodies. The series explores the emotional, legal, philosophical, and societal ramifications of mind uploading technology. * In the novel So Far Out to Sea by Dane St. John (2016), the visionary Abraham Trevis must locate a habitable exoplanet and plot out a journey to get there, in which he plans to use an experimental process called \\"relocation\\" to allow humans to survive the inhospitable forces of space and time – it consists of specialized nanotechnology called \\"architects\\", engineered for the purpose of replicating neurons and all individual experiences, learnings, and emotional traits. *In Steve Toutonghi's 2016 novel, Join, people are able to fuse their individual psyches into shared collective consciousnesses--a shared identity known as a join--in order to live multiple lives simultaneously, enjoy perfect companionship, and never die. *In Adrian Tchaikovsky's novel Children of Time (2016) both Dr. Avrana Kern and Gilgamesh Captain Vrie Guyen experiment with whole brain emulation with varied degrees of success. *In The Physics of Immortality: Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead by Frank Tipler. Film * In the film The Creation of the Humanoids (1962), set in the future after a nuclear war, the blue-skinned androids known as \\"humanoids\\" are trying to infiltrate human society by creating android replicas of humans that have recently died, using a procedure called a \\"thalamic transplant\\" to take the memories and personality of the recently deceased human and place them in the replicas. *In the 1979 film Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the entity that calls itself V'Ger is a heavily-modified Earth space probe that is capable of converting lifeforms and objects such as spacecraft into digitized \\"data patterns\\", which can then be represented in holographic or even physical form. The best example of this is when a probe from V'Ger kills the Starship Enterprise's navigator, Lieutenant Ilia, and then generates a mechanized duplicate of her to act as its representative to the Enterprise crew. In the film, it is stated that the duplicate is so detailed as to simulate humanoid biological functions, as well as contain the original Ilia's memory patterns, which the crew attempts to uncover in order to better understand V'Ger's motives. * In the film Tron (1982), human programmer Flynn is digitized by an artificial intelligence called the \\"Master Control Program\\", bringing him inside the virtual world of the computer. * Mamoru Oshii/Masamune Shirow's anime/manga Ghost in the Shell (1989–) portrays a future world in which human beings aggressively mechanize, replacing body and mind with interfacing mechanical/computer/electrical parts, often to the point of complete mechanization/replacement of all original material. Its sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence deals heavily with the philosophical ramifications of this problem. * In the film Robotrix (1991), a criminally insane scientist, Ryuichi Sakamoto, transfers his mind into a cyborg and immediately commits a series of rapes and murders.

The cyborg-robot team pursue the criminal Sakamoto by investigating a series of murdered prostitutes. * The film The Lawnmower Man (1992) deals with attempts by scientists to boost the intelligence of a man named Jobe using a program of accelerated learning, using nootropic drugs, virtual reality input, and cortex stimulation. After becoming superintelligent, Jobe finds a way to transfer his mind completely into virtual reality, leaving his physical body as a wizened husk. * The film Freejack (1992) describes a future where the wealthy can seize people out of the past, moments before their death, and transfer their own mind & consciousness to the newly captured body, at the expense of that person's mind. A \\"freejack\\" is what an escapee of this process is called. The computer equipment which stores a mind temporarily while it awaits transplant is referred to as \\"the spiritual switchboard\\". * The Thirteenth Floor (1999) is set in late 1990s Los Angeles, where Hannon owns a multibillion-dollar computer enterprise, and is the inventor of a newly completed virtual reality (VR) simulation of 1937 Los Angeles.

Minds cannot function in purely digital form, they must be placed back into a human container. * The central conceit of the 2009 science fiction film Avatar is that human consciousness can be used to control genetically grown bodies (Avatars) based on the native inhabitants of an alien world, in order to integrate into their society. This is not true mind uploading, as the humans only control the Avatars remotely (a form of telepresence), but later in the film Grace connects with Eywa (the collective consciousness of the planet) so her mind can be permanently transferred to her Avatar body. Her mind is uploaded to Eywa, but she does not return to her Avatar body and stays within the Tree of Souls. At the end of the film, Jake's mind is uploaded to Eywa and successfully returns to his Avatar body leaving his human body lifeless. The basis for this type of transfer is not explained in detail, but it seems to have a physical basis rather than being something more mystical, given that Grace had earlier described Eywa as a \\"global network\\" (like a neural network) made up of electrochemical \\"connections\\" (which she said were \\"like the synapses between neurons\\") between the roots of trees, and also said that \\"the Na'vi can access it—they can upload and download data—memories\\". * In the 2014 movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Arnim Zola, a biochemist for HYDRA developed a terminal disease and he transferred his consciousness to a giant computer that took up the entire area of an old, abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility in New Jersey. * In the 2014 movie Transcendence, Dr. Will Caster, an artificial intelligence researcher, is assassinated with a bullet laced with radioactive material and has his consciousness uploaded to several quantum processors (and eventually the internet) in order for him to survive in a digital form. * In the 2015 movie CHAPPiE the title character Chappie transfers the dying Deon's consciousness into a spare robot through a modified neural helmet. * In the 2015 film Advantageous, Gwen Koh is made to choose between having her consciousness transferred to a different body in order to keep her job as the face of a technology company or not having the resources to give her daughter the education that will maintain her position in a socially and economically stratified society. * In the 2015 film Self/less the super wealthy are offered the extension of their lives through the transfer of their minds into what are presented as cloned bodies, but are actually humans whose memories are overwritten and suppressed. * In the 2018 film Replicas a researcher working on creating synthetic robot brains copies his family's minds into cloned human bodies after they are killed in a car accident, in-order to bring them back to life. However, although their minds are copied into cloned bodies, their minds are first uploaded into storage devices called Mem-Drives capable of storing the entire contents of a human brain, until their minds can then later (only after the cloned bodies that first have to be grown are finished maturing) be transferred subsequently into the cloned human bodies. This film also deals with the concept of Mind uploading (into fully artificial robot bodies) as that is exactly what the primary character in the film is trying to accomplish, from nearly the very beginning of the film. Television * In Galaxy Express 999 (1978), people can achieve effective immortality by transferring their minds into android bodies, if they are wealthy enough to afford them. The main character is set on this as his supreme aspiration in life, but slowly comes to appreciate that it is not quite the panacea he had been led to believe it was. * In the 1985 TV movie Max Headroom and ABC Television series, TV reporter Edison Carter is copied into Network 23's computers creating the TV personality Max Headroom. * Red Dwarf (1988–1999), where a person's memories and personality can be recorded in just a few seconds and, upon their death, they can be recreated as a holographic simulation.

His memories reduced to raw data of events. * In Star Trek: The Next Generation season 7 episode 10 \\"Inheritance\\" (1994), Data encounters his \\"mother\\" who unknown to her, had her mind scanned by synaptic scanner by her husband (and Datas \\"father\\") Dr Noonien Soong. This was done while she was unconscious, and days before her death an exact copy of her brain was transferred to a positronic matrix, inside a gynoid body (but labeled android body on the show). * In Battle Angel Alita (1990–, also known as Gunnm), a closely guarded secret of the elite city of Tiphares/Zalem is that its citizens, after being eugenically screened and rigorously tested in a maturity ritual, have their brains scanned, removed and replaced with chips. When this is revealed to a Tipharean/Zalem citizen, the internalized philosophical debate causes most citizens to go insane. * In the Phantom 2040 TV series (1994–) and videogame (1995), Maxwell Madison Sr., the husband of one of the series' main antagonists Rebecca Madison, is killed during a train wreck with the 23rd Phantom and his brainwaves are uploaded onto a computer mainframe.

The device is activated when the scientist is executed in an electric chair. He is thwarted in his attempt to subject his ex-girlfriend to the same process. * In Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001) season 7 episode 7 \\"Body and Soul\\" The Doctor had to upload himself into Seven of Nine due to a race who hated photonic life forms. * In Yu-Gi-Oh! (1996–), Noah Kaiba died in a car accident and his mind was uploaded to a supercomputer. * In the TV series Stargate SG-1 (1997–2007), the Asgard cheat death by transferring their minds into new clone bodies. The mind of Thor, the high commander of the Asgard fleet, was for a time transferred into the computer of a Goa'uld spaceship. In the episode \\"Tin Man\\" (1998), the SG-1 team visit a warehouse of an extinct alien civilization, where the android caretaker scans their minds and builds android duplicates of the team, who are unaware that they aren't the originals until they find their original bodies in suspended animation. In \\"Holiday\\" (1999) Dr. Daniel Jackson's mind is transferred into Machello's body and vice versa. In \\"Entity\\" (2001) Samantha Carter's mind is transferred into a computer. In \\"Lifeboat\\" (2003) around 12 minds are transferred into and then out of Daniel Jackson's body. In the two-part opening of season 8, \\"New Order\\" (2004), Jack O'Neill's mind is fully interfaced with the main computer of Thor's ship. * In the TV series Stargate Atlantis, after being infected with Asuran (Replicator) Nanites, Dr. Weir is capable of accessing and uploading herself in the Asuran collecive network. * In the TV series Stargate Universe, the consciousnesses of a number of deceased characters are uploaded to the Destiny's main computer, where they exist as live computer programs which can interact with the crew via induced audiovisual hallucinations. * Cowboy Bebop episode 23 \\"Brain Scratch\\" (1999) is about a cult dedicated towards electronic transference of the mind into a computer network. * In the French animated series Code Lyoko (2003–), the primary characters use devices called Scanners that read the entire physical makeup of the user, digitize their atoms and then teleport the user onto the virtual world of Lyoko. * In the television series Caprica (2009–2010), a prequel to Battlestar Galactica, the ability to upload human consciousnesses into a virtual reality world is featured prominently. (Battlestar Galactica did not itself feature true mind uploading, since the cylons were artificial intelligences that were not based on ordinary human brains, though their minds could be transferred from one body to another in the same manner as is often envisioned for uploads.) While some characters believe that the process only creates an imperfect copy of the original person, as the death of the original consciousness is unnecessary for the creation of the virtual copy, other characters believe that it can be viewed as a form of religious rebirth analogous to the afterlife. * Mind transfer is a central theme in the television series Dollhouse (2009–2010). * In the anime series Serial Experiments Lain, the antagonist Masami Eiri embeds his memories and consciousness into the \\"Wired\\", the internet of the story universe. He believed that humanity should evolve by ridding themselves of their physical limitations and live as digital entities only. * In the second installment of the story The Trial of a Time Lord in the original Doctor Who series, the Doctor's assistant Perpugilliam Brown has her mind erased, and replaced with the mind of the dying Lord Kiv of the Mentors. The storyline mentions that this is the first time the entire mind of an individual can be transplanted from one body to another. It is a pivotal moment in the history of the series as it is the purported reason that the Time Lords took the Doctor out of time and placed him on trial. It was later shown to be false evidence in the Doctor's trial. * In the episode Silence in the Library of the 2005 revival of the British television show Doctor Who Donna Noble is \\"saved\\" by the computer Cal where she joins several others inside the computer that had been saved previously. Arguably the process of saving the individuals is more involved then simple mind uploading as the teleportation patterns of the individuals are also stored and the Doctor is able in the next episode Forest of the Dead to get Cal to return them to the physical world. However, also in Forest of the Dead, the character of River Song, is killed but the doctor is able, using a future Doctor's sonic screwdriver to upload River's consciousness into Cal thus extending her life indefinitely. * In the episode \\"13.1\\" of the show Warehouse 13, former Warehouse Agent Hugo Miller's hologram appears when an attempt is made to upgrade the computer systems inside the Warehouse. In fear of being deleted during the upgrade, Hugo locks down the entire Warehouse and attempts to kill everyone inside. Hugo's hologram is later identified as a portion of the agent's mind in which he uploaded onto the Warehouse computers using an artifact, but something went wrong during the transfer and only certain parts of his mind went into the computer, leaving the other parts in Hugo's biological mind. Having only half of an actual brain renders him insane and he is put into an asylum until he is later retrieved by Pete and Myka to reverse what the artifact has done, thus making him a whole person again and deleting the holographic and homicidal half version of Hugo in the Warehouse 13 computer systems. * The 2014 episode \\"White Christmas\\" of the British TV show Black Mirror features a procedure where copies of living subjects' minds are uploaded to \\"cookies\\", devices capable of running full brain emulation, and then used for household control jobs, judicial investigation, and criminal sentencing. An operator can also adjust the cookie speed to make the emulated mind experiment a different time scale, a feature used to apply a thousand- year long sentence to an individual's mind, which is served in a few hours of real-world time. * In the 2014 episode \\"Days of Future Future\\" of the Simpsons, Professor Frink loads Homer's brain onto a USB-Stick and then brings him to life in a digital environment with his head being shown on (the future equivalents of) \\"TV\\"-screens, digital photo frames and computer screens between which Homer can move freely and engage in screensavers and video games. Later Bart buys him a \\"robot body\\" (similar to the Surrogates in the movie Surrogates) which he plugs into the \\"TV\\" upon which it conflates and Homer's head moves from the screen over to the physical robot. * The 2016 episode San Junipero of the British TV show Black Mirror. * In Westworld (2016), the eponymous theme park is run with the purpose of digitalizing consciousness in order to achieve immortality. This is done by analyzing the human guests' behaviors and adjusting their digital representation until it reacts in the same way as the guest to any given stimulus. * In season 3 of The 100 (2014-2020), which aired in 2016, an AI device known as The Flame is introduced. This device requires merging with a human brain, and is passed down (over many years) to each new Commander of the Grounders, aka Heda. Each new Commander has access to (the ability to see and speak to) all of the prior Commanders, as their minds live on after their deaths, due to being uploaded and saved within The Flame. *Altered Carbon (2018) is based on the premise that \\"More than 300 years in the future, society has been transformed by new technology, leading to human bodies being interchangeable and death no longer being permanent.\\" *In season 6 of The 100 (2014-2020), which aired in 2019, a group of colonists from Earth inhabited an Earthlike planet called Sanctum. They developed the technology to download the human mind to a drive and upload it to another human being. In order to achieve this, they also developed the technology to wipe the mind of a human being while keeping the brain intact. After wiping the mind of the victim, they could then insert the mind drive into the body and upload the consciousness of the downloaded mind, effectively allowing human consciousness to live forever in different bodies. * In Star Trek: Picard (2020), protagonist Jean-Luc Picard's consciousness is transferred to an android body upon his human body's death. Knowing that Picard would not want to be immortal, creator Altan Intigo Soong and La Sirena crew members Soji Asha and Agnes Jurati deliberately limit his new lifespan to what it would have been without the brain defect that killed him. Comics * In the Marvel Comics universe, Adolf Hitler's mind was transferred into a cloned body upon his death; this clone became the supervillain called the Hate-Monger, first introduced in 1963. * The 1966 comic book superhero NoMan \\"was a human mind housed in a robotic body.

Bill is a cyborg and Ti Asha Ra is created from within the Celestial Galactus himself. In issues #652-55, Skuttlebutt is destroyed, and Ti Asha Ra is killed; however, the ship entity Bill had been chasing is a form of cosmic life collector and partitions Ti Asha Ra's mind to upload Skuttlebutt's consciousness into her physical body, apparently resurrecting her from the dead. It also uploads the life goddess Gaea and Ti Asha Ra into itself, which allows the Asgardian warrior maiden Sif and Bill to rescue them later as all is returned to normal. * In Amazing Spider-Man, Otto Octavius was able to house copy of his mind in a robotic body of the Living Brain. After its destruction, Octavius transferred his mind into a clone body and then, into a new clone body of Spider-Man. * In DC comics the hero \\"NoMan\\" was a 76-year-old man before having his consciousness uploaded.

Davis Jewish General Hospital () since 1978, is an acute-care teaching hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The hospital is affiliated with McGill University and has 637 beds. History The Jewish General Hospital, which opened its doors in 1934, was founded as a general hospital, open to all patients regardless of race, religion, language or ethnic background. While part of the Quebec medicare system, and functionally bilingual in French and English, the hospital continues to be run chiefly by members of the Jewish community. At his death in 1928, Mortimer Davis left most of his estate to be used for the construction of a Jewish public hospital that would bear his name. In 1969, the hospital opened the affiliated Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, one of the largest and most influential research centres in Canada. Among many other medical innovations, in 1974, the JGH was one of the first hospitals in Canada to open a division of colorectal surgery. Among the famous alumni of the hospital is former head nurse Beverley Binder (née Rosen). In 1978, fifty years after Davis's death, $10 million from his estate was donated to the Jewish General Hospital, which was then renamed the Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital. Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research The Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research (LDI) is the research arm of the Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital and has strong academic ties to McGill University. Founded in 1969, the LDI has a roster of nearly 200 researchers, and it is an important North American biomedical research institute. LDI researchers have made major breakthroughs in the areas of HIV/AIDS, aging, cancer, vascular disease, epidemiology, and psychosocial science.

The original black-and-white version was published by XOR Corporation in 1989. In 1993, Storm Impact released an upgraded shareware version of TaskMaker featuring color graphics and compatibility with newer versions of the classic Mac OS. Storm Impact also released a sequel, The Tomb of the Taskmaker, in 1997. With Storm Impact's closure that same year, both TaskMaker games are no longer supported. They are still covered by intellectual property rights, including copyrights. Plot The player is a young hero who has arrived to be trained and eventually become the leader of the land. The TaskMaker, leader of the game's world, serves as the player's mentor. The TaskMaker assigns the player ten tasks, which are quests to obtain an item from a different dungeon or town. In doing so, the player encounters game elements such as illusionary walls, teleports, traps, and switches, as well as monsters, and other non-playable characters with whom the player can interact. In the game's next-to-last task, the TaskMaker asks the player to kill a prisoner on his island. Returning to the TaskMaker after killing the prisoner reveals the TaskMaker to be evil, and the game ends; not killing the prisoner results in a battle with the TaskMaker as the final task, and leads to the game's true ending. Once the TaskMaker is killed, the player is declared \\"master\\" of the land, and a special menu is unlocked in the game, allowing for the player to edit all the dungeons and villages. Gameplay A screenshot from the Storm Impact version. The player's overall status is measured by seven status bars. All stats save for food will replenish through time and resting. *Food: Food is the character's appetite and requires food in order to fill. Although food does not affect combat, it allows the character to rest and heal. When depleted, the character will be unable to rest and continually lose health until he either receives more food or he dies. *Health: Health illustrates the character's wellbeing and how close to death they become. Health is lost by falling into traps and getting hit by enemies. Once it falls to or below zero, the player is transported to Hell. Hell is a maze lined with flaming walls containing 4 exits in each corner with a demon guard. Only one exit will be open and thus one demon to battle. *Spirit: Spirit is required for both battle, special commands and spellcasting. Strength: Strength is important in battle and in some cases spellcasting. *Agility: Agility is need for battle, spellcasting and special commands such as stealing. *Intellect: Intellect is important for spellcasting and battle. *Stamina: Stamina reflects how long a character can sustain a battle until resting is required. While the other four stats are required for spellcasting, stamina is solely required for weapon based fighting and such can only be upgraded by leveling up, magical components and battle. Each bar's length can be increased by leveling up (after a certain amount of fighting and/or spell casting) or by taking potions or reading scrolls to increase their strength. Money takes on the form of valuables such as copper pieces and gold bars which takes up room in the character's inventory. In this form, they can be traded and bestowed onto others although they can not be spent. When the player dies while holding these gems, they will be lost to scavengers. It is imperative they are deposited in \\"Auto Tellers\\" in order to convert them into currency and thus safe from looting. The world's currency can be spent at numerous stores around the world to purchase both weapons, armour, magical components and nourishment. Gameplay items include magical potions, scrolls, and wands (which can help to replenish the status bars, increase the bars' lengths, or aid in fighting monsters) as well as useless items which can only be eliminated by depositing them in recycling bins. Miscellaneous items such as checkers can be bought, although they serve no purpose other than gifts. Bestowing gifts onto others will increase their happiness and lower their hostility to the player. Low level non-playable characters and enemies only require cheap items to make them happy, while the higher level ones demand pricier gifts. The player also can cast one of several spells, including both built-in and hidden spells. Reception The original XOR version of TaskMaker was reviewed negatively in MacWEEK, which compared it unfavorably to contemporary Macintosh role-playing video games The Bard's Tale, Might and Magic and Pool of Radiance. MacWEEK noted the game's quick and controllable fun, but claimed that it lacked richness and had less enticing graphics compared to the other titles. The Macintosh IIx version of the game got 4 out of 5 stars in Dragon; the reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, saying that it was \\"not hard\\" but adding, \\"it is proven that those who write game code specifically for one computer system and don’t rely on a port of another system’s code usually publish a better-than-average game.\\" The Lessers also noted that the game's graphics were reminiscent of the Mac game OrbQuest, in that \\"[y]ou have a top- down view of your area, in black and white and shades of gray.\\" \\"Though not state-of-the-art in gaming technology\\", Computer Gaming Worlds Chuck Miller in June 1994 said, the shareware TaskMaker 2.0 \\"is nonetheless a very solid, professional production ... an enjoyable, if slightly dated RPG\\" comparable to Ultima III through V. Allgame critic Lisa Karen Savignano gave the Storm Impact version of the game four-and-a-half stars out of five. She said that although it did not have a very strong replay value, it had solid graphics and sound, as well as complex puzzles and a well-detailed manual to aid in gameplay. The Tomb of the TaskMaker Storm Impact released a sequel entitled The Tomb of the TaskMaker in 1997. This sequel was set after the end of the first game's storyline. In The Tomb of the Taskmaker, the protagonist is now the leader of the land, and is informed of various tasks that he has to perform to restore peace. As with TaskMaker, the tasks in the sequel involve retrieving artifacts that must be brought back to the throne, but unlike in the predecessor, said artifacts are destroyed afterward. During the course of the game, the player is told by a messenger that the TaskMaker has come back to life in his tomb and that he is the one depositing these evil artifacts around the world. The final task involves entering the tomb, where the player discovers that the TaskMaker is dead, and a captain guard who has been protecting the TaskMaker's bones states that he is the true mastermind and attempts to kill the player with his cohort of guards. The player then has to defeat the captain guard and his assistants to win the game; as in the first game, defeating the final villain unlocks a Master menu. The Tomb of the TaskMaker features additional gameplay aspects, while retaining many elements of the first game such as the use of weapons, potions, spells and wands, and most of the monster designs. New options include the ability to choose a male or female character, as well as the role of magician, fighter or thief. A fighter can use every form of weapon and armor, a magician can cast certain spells that other players cannot, and a thief can pick locks and steal objects. Although only the fighter can wield and wear every piece of weapon and armour in the game, the most powerful ones can be wielded and worn by all three classes. Hell has been redesigned to involve doing a deplorable task such as bestowing gifts to demons, killing bunnies, throwing random switches or binning a large number of gold bars. After doing one of these tasks, the exit will be open. The game was released just before Storm Impact closed, and never made it past version 1.0 until Cook posted an updated test version (which fixed several bugs from the original version and added two new dungeons) on his personal website in July 2008.

Built in 1971 by the Government of Canada for Canadian National Railways (CNR) at Port Weller Dry Docks near St. Catharines, Ontario, Vacationland was designed for the sheltered waters of the Northumberland Strait; and as such her vehicle decks are open on both sides and she lacks a hurricane bow. She measures 99.06 metres (325 feet) in length, 20.9 metres (67 feet) in beam, and displaces 2775 tons. She has a capacity for 485 passengers and 155 vehicles or 16 tractor trailers. She is a sister ship to the MV Holiday Island. She is powered by two Ruston V-16 16CSVM Ruston diesel train engines that produce 3625 horsepower each giving a total of 7250 horsepower. Her propellers are of the Voith- Schnieder Cycloidal design which are located in the bow and stern of the ship. They are variable pitch that turn opposite one another that propels the ship and steers it as well. The table diameter that the blades are housed in is 14.5 feet. Her sister ship the MV Holiday Island has the same propulsion machinery and main engines. The MV Vacationland had her sea trials at Port Weller Drydocks in mid April 1971 and her sister ship MV Holiday Island had her sea trials during the first week of April 1971. Their keels were laid at the Port Weller Drydock in November 1969. The MV Vacationland entered service on the Cape Tormentine-Borden run after the MV Holiday Island which had arrived the week before her in May 1971. CNR changed the name of its ferry services to CN Marine in 1977 and then to Marine Atlantic in 1986. The opening of the Confederation Bridge on June 1, 1997 saw Marine Atlantic close its ferry service and all of its vessels on this route except Holiday Island were disposed and sold off by the Crown Assets division of the Department of Public Works and Government Services. Vacationlands sister ship Holiday Island sailed 100 kilometres to the east end of the strait and began service that month under the colours of Northumberland Ferries Ltd., however Vacationland sailed to Sydney, Nova Scotia and help haul cargo from the Marine Atlantic Borden terminal and was stored there until being sold in 1998 to the Government of New Brunswick. Upon her purchase by the Government of New Brunswick Vacationland was renamed MV Fundy Paradise with the intention of using her for service between Blacks Harbour and Grand Manan Island. Funding for making modifications to the docks at both terminals for accepting the ship was never approved and she was towed to the Steel and Engine Products Ltd. shipyard in Liverpool, Nova Scotia where she was mothballed until the Government of New Brunswick decided to dispose of her in 2001. Fundy Paradise was towed back to Sydney from Liverpool and remained docked at Sydport while listed for sale until 2005 when she was sold to a company from Quebec City. In summer 2009, she was towed from Sydney to Trois-Rivières where she is undergoing a major refit and conversion for rock and sand transportation on the Saint Lawrence River.

The opening of the Confederation Bridge on June 1, 1997 saw Marine Atlantic close its ferry service and all of its vessels on this route except Holiday Island were disposed and sold off by the Crown Assets division of the Department of Public Works and Government Services. Holiday Island sailed 100 kilometres to the east end of the strait and began service that month under the colours of Northumberland Ferries Ltd., replacing two smaller ferries (MV Prince Nova, which was sold to a ferry company operating in Long Island Sound, and MV Prince Edward, which was sold to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador). In 2016, Northumberland Ferries announced that the vessel would not be in service until necessary repairs could be made. In early October 2016, the MV Holiday Island arrived in Wood Islands, PEI after undergoing repairs and re-entered service later that month. She also sports the new livery of Northumberland Ferries, along with the MV Confederation.

Thompson is an American wargame designer and founder of Metagaming Concepts. His first game was Stellar Conquest, a popular and well-designed simulation of interstellar warfare. Thompson is most famous for his idea to publish small, low-cost games in what came to be known as the MicroGame format. For a while, Metagaming dominated this niche wargaming market. Career Howard Thompson founded Metagaming Concepts in 1975 to publish his game Stellar Conquest when no one was interested in publishing the game. Thompson, as the first editor of The Space Gamer magazine, stated \\"The magazine had been planned for after our third or fourth game but circumstances demand we do it now.\\"\\"Where We're Going\\", Howard Thompson, The Space Gamer, Number 1 (Metagaming, 1975) In 1976, Thompson published Godsfire, designed by Lynn Willis and developed by Steve Jackson. In 1977, Thompson came up with the concept of the MicroGame, the first of which was Ogre. In the early 1980s, some speculate that the company started to run into financial trouble, partially because of the generally poor economic situation at that time, and because of the split with one of his main game designers, Steve Jackson. Thompson was not satisfied with the work done on The Fantasy Trip by Jackson, stating that it was too complex and had taken too long. Thompson decided that packaging the game in a box would be too expensive, so he split the product into four books, publishing them indidivually in 1980 as Advanced Melee, Advanced Wizard, In the Labyrinth, and Tollenkar's Lair; while the game was being prepared, Thompson also changed his production methods and thus Jackson was no longer able to check the final proofs of the game as he had on earlier releases. As a result of these actions, Jackson left Metagaming and founded Steve Jackson Games later that year. Jackson bought The Space Gamer from Metagaming, and sold the rights to The Fantasy Trip to Metagaming. However, Thompson sought legal action against SJG for the rights to a short wargame called One-Page Bulge, and the lawsuit was settled with an agreement that was reached on November 26, 1981 which gave Jackson full rights to One-Page Bulge, and to Ogre and G.E.V. (whose ownership was questioned during the legal proceedings). In the first SJG issue of The Space Gamer, Thompson wrote a report on Metagaming and stated \\"Metagaming's staff won't miss the effort. After the change in ownership Metagaming feels comfortable with the decision; it was the right thing to do.\\"\\"Metagaming Report\\", Howard Thompson, The Space Gamer, Number 27 (SJG, March–April 1980) Thompson wrote MicroQuest #3 Treasure of the Silver Dragon (1980) and MicroQuest #6 Treasure of Unicorn Gold (1981) for The Fantasy Trip and marketed each of them linked to a real treasure hunt where readers could find out the clues in the books and receive $10,000 from Metagaming. Looking to produce more group-oriented products for The Fantasy Trip, Thompson signed an agreement in 1982 with RPG publisher Gamelords to create a campaign world for the game, but only two campaign books were published. On 1 January 1982, Thompson created Games Research Group, Inc., which was initially part of Metagaming. On April 16, 1982, Thompson let his two wargame designers go, allowing them to work as freelancers for Games Research Group instead of working as employees. In April 1983, Metagaming ceased operations and Thompson left the industry; Steve Jackson tried to purchase The Fantasy Trip from Thompson, but Jackson declined the offered price of $250,000. Thompson promised to return to the field to produce computer games, but by 1984 he stopped returning phone calls and has subsequently disappeared entirely from the gaming community.

Inside the main church at New Valamo. New Valamo or New Valaam (, or more informally, especially in the postal address: Uusi- Valamo, , ) is an Orthodox monastery in Heinävesi, Finland. The monastery was established in its present location in 1940. However, the tradition of the Valamo monastery dates back to 1717. The monastery was then originally established on Valaam (also known historically by the Finnish name Valamo) which is an archipelago in the northern portion of Lake Ladoga, lying within the Republic of Karelia in the Russian Federation. The New Valamo Monastery is now an active centre of the Orthodox religious life and culture in Finland and welcomes visitors throughout the year. The relocation of the monastery In 1939, during the Winter War, some 190 monks from the Valamo Monastery in Karelia were evacuated from their old abode on a group of islands in Lake Ladoga in the Viipuri Province to present Eastern Finland. The old Valamo Monastery was occupied by the armed forces of the Soviet Union quite soon after the outbreak of the Winter War. After a temporary dwelling place the monks decided to settle down in Heinävesi in Eastern Finland. The choice fell on a mansion in Papinniemi, Heinävesi, after the monks had found there, quite surprisingly, an icon of St. Sergius and St. Herman of Valaam, the founders of the monastery in the 12th century. The monks considered this to be a sign from God.\\"Ortodoksinen kirkko Suomessa\\"( The Orthodox Church in Finland) (ed. by Fr. Ambrosius and Markku Haapio) (1979) p. 287\\"Orthodoxy in Finland, Past and present (ed. by V. Purmonen)(1984) p.41 Having received evacuees from the Konevsky (Konevitsa) and Pechenga (Petsamo) monasteries, it is now the only monastery for men of the Finnish Orthodox Church.\\"Orthodoxy in Finland, Past and present\\" (ed. V. Purmonen) (1984) pp. 41–42  The miracle-working icons of Valamo  The best -known miracle-working icons at Valamo are those of the Mother of God of Konevitsa and the Mother of God of Valamo, both located in the main church. Monastery activities and economy Economy The monks of the New Valamo Monastery live a communal life of spirituality founded in the Ascetic tradition of the Orthodox Church. According to the ancient tradition, the monastery should support itself fully. At present, the main source of livelihood for the New Valamo Monastery is tourism: over 160,000 people visit the monastery each year, and all of the revenue goes directly to wards the maintenance and development of the premises. As a result of the financial crises 2008 the monastery too has had to face some financial challenges. This has led to for example co-determination procedures. During 2003-2013 the financial reports of the monastery have shown a surplus in two years. 2012 the result was positive mainly because 2012 the monastery received insurance reimbursements due to the fire incident in its main building. 2013 the monastery had debts of one million euros, and annual turnover reaching approximately 2,5 meur. The distillery operations of Valamo have shown healthy results every year, for example 2014 a surplus of 89.000 euros. Monastery's distillery The Christian faith is linked by tradition to wine and other alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverage making skills have been preserved and passed down within monastery wall for centuries. This tradition continues at the New Valamo Monastery. The annual capacity of the Valamo distillery is 120.000 litres, and it is the biggest distillery in Finland. During 2014 and 2015 the operative distillery company Viiniherman Ltd has made additional investments of 1 million euros into the distillery. Viiniherman Ltd is owned by majority by the monastery and the distillery is located at the monasterys' premises. They built a modern 500 square metre warehouse to Ilomantsi, Finland. So they will ship all of the whisky distillates from Valamo to Ilomantsi warehouse for maturation. Some of their whisky will have a church wine cask maturation, while some will be matured in bourbon casks. Valamo will produce peated and unpeated malt whisky. The capacity of the new warehouse is 450 000 liters and their current pot for whisky making is 1000 liters, which will allow an annual production of 40 000 liters. 2012 Fire Deanery after the fire In March 2012, there was a fire in the old main building of Papinniemi estate, which also served as the first main building of the monastery. The building had been built in 1840. The attic of the building was destroyed in the fire. It had been used as a storage space, and there were no valuables in it. All the valuable artefacts from the lower floors had been successfully removed during the fire, with the exception of the furniture. The furnaces of the building has been in poor condition, and their use had been prohibited for several years. However, one of the furnaces had been used for heating, and in a police investigation it was found that the fire had started from the cracks of the chimney. A couple of foreign extraction, who had been living in the building, were prosecuted in the Southern Savo Local Court. The court did not find sufficient evidence to back the claim that the furnace had been used for heating. The case was tried in December 2012. The damages of the monastery amounted up to 1,6 million Euros. The State of Finland was ordered to pay some of the expenses of the man who had been accused of causing the fire.

The series is about the boarding school adventures of twin girls Patricia and Isabel O'Sullivan. Plot summary The children's story starts with the twins Pat and Isabel O'Sullivan looking forward to enjoying their first summer term at St. Clare's. Their mother is happy to see them looking forward to school. One day, they go to play tennis with a friend, and meet a girl who has mumps. The twins, to their dismay, are put in quarantine, and are not allowed to go back to school at the beginning of the term. When they arrive back the following week, they are heartily welcomed by their friends. Five new girls have joined their form. There is an American girl called Sadie, who is obviously quite rich and elegant. The twins discover that their cousin Alison has already made friends with her. There is a wild-looking girl called Carlotta, who is half Spanish. There is a naughty but very likeable girl Bobby (Roberta), who quickly becomes friends with Janet. There is another girl called Prudence, who is quite pretty but has no sense of humour. The last new girl is Pam, who is very hard working but also very shy. The girls soon discover that Miss Roberts is on the war path. She is the first form head and is determined that her girls should do well and be promoted in next form. The twins also get to know the new girls. Prudence turns out to be nasty, spiteful, and dishonest. She takes a strong dislike to Carlotta, and discovers that Carlotta once belonged to a circus. She reveals Carlotta's secret to the other girls, hoping it will make them despise her, but it only serves to make Carlotta even more popular. Prudence also manipulates the shy Pam under the false disguise of a friendship. As a result, Pam is initially disliked by all of the girls except Carlotta and Isabel, who take pity on her when they realise that she is afraid to tackle Prudence as she does not want to be on her own. Encouraged by the two older girls, Pam eventually stands up to Prudence and ends their forced friendship, becoming friends with Carlotta instead. Bobby initially doesn't seem to care for anything or anyone until Miss Theobald tells her that she is cheating her parents badly. After learning this, Bobby starts working hard, too, though she occasionally plays tricks. The American girl, Sadie, is like Alison, always caring about her looks. She also hates sports and all outdoor activities (although, unlike Alison, she actually enjoys swimming). However, she is good tempered and laughs at being teased. The girls soon find out that Sadie is an heiress. Sadie's father died and left a will giving away all his money to his sisters, but Sadie's mother won it back through lawsuits. During the term, while Prudence is spying on Carlotta, Sadie is kidnapped, and Carlotta - who finds her tied up, gagged and blindfolded in the back seat of a motor car - goes after her, and stages a fake road accident, during which she manages to rescue her with the help of her circus' friends. The term ends happily for most, with Prudence leaving because everyone hates her for her part in Sadie's kidnap (she could have alerted Sadie to the fact that she was in danger when she and Pam met a strange man lurking around the school entrance but was too busy trying to get Carlotta into trouble to realise this, and ignored Pam's warning to report the man to Miss Theobald), Sadie herself bouncing back strongly from her kidnapping ordeal and preparing to go back to America, and the other girls looking forward to going into second year except Prudence, who is leaving and Pam, who is too young to move into the second form.

After studies at the Athénée Royal, he came to the University of Ghent, where he came under the influence of Henri Pirenne. After studies with Ferdinand Lot, he practiced law for a period, before returning to the University of Ghent. Here he succeeded Pirenne in 1930 as professor of medieval history, after Pirenne left the university as a result of the enforcement of Dutch as language of instruction. He remained there until his retirement in 1961. Ganshof's work was primarily on Flanders in the Carolingian period. His best known book is Qu'est-ce que la féodalité? (1947). Here he defines feudalism narrowly, in simple legal and military terms. Feudalism, in Ganshof's view, existed only within the nobility. This contrasts with Marc Bloch, where feudalism encompasses society as a whole, and Susan Reynolds, who questions the concept of feudalism in itself. Though Ganshof's definition is not always accepted today, this book was not his only work. He contributed greatly to his field, mostly through articles. Among the few books he published were Les Destinées de l'Empire en occident de 395 à 888 (1928) and Flandre sous les premiers comtes (1943). In 1946 he received the Francqui Prize for Human Sciences. Ganshof was renowned as the greatest European expert on the Frankish kingdoms, particularly under the Carolingian dynasty; he never wrote the definitive biography of Charlemagne that everyone expected of him, but his contributions to Frankish history continue to be fundamental. The best English-language introduction to this (very major) aspect of his work is in F.L. Ganshof, The Carolingians and the Frankish Monarchy. Studies in Carolingian History, tr. Janet Sondheimer (London: Longman, 1971). This collection of major articles ends with an exhaustive bibliography of Ganshof's writings on Merovingian and Carolingian history down to 1970.

History Early criticism against Brahmanism flourished within Sramana movement.Svarghese, Alexander P. 2008. India : History, Religion, Vision And Contribution To The World. p. 259-60. Particularly in Nāstika schools of Indian philosophy like Buddhism, Jainism, and others such as Ājīvika, Cārvāka and Ajñana.AL Basham (1951), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 94-103 Ajñana were the sceptical school of ancient Indian philosophy. A major rival of early Buddhism, Jainism and Vedic Hinduism. The fourth school of Ajñana scepticism is associated with Sanjaya Belatthiputta. Sanjaya is described as a contemporary of Buddha, as a well-known and celebrated teacher, and as a leader of a sect who was held in high esteem by the common folk. He is said to have taught Sariputta and Moggallāna, before their conversion to Buddhism. Cārvākas were the atheistic and materialism school of ancient Indian philosophy. They were critical of Brahmanism, as well of Buddhism and Jainism. Buddhism was critical of Brahmanism, Jainism, Carvaka and Ājīvika.J. Abraham Velez de Cea 2013 \\"The Buddha and Religious Diversity\\", p.90 Medieval period Criticism against Brahmanism continued up to late medieval period, particularly by some Shaivism and Vaishnavism sects of Hinduism notably with rise of Bhakti movement and Lingayatism.\\"Lingayat.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 09 Jul. 2010. The Bhakti movement in particular encouraged followers to attain spiritual union with God not through sacrifices, rituals, pilgrimages, or prayers, but through the “force of pure love and fervent yearning for God.” The merchant class and agricultural class largely funded the growth of Nāstika sects and religions during ancient and medieval period, who saw them as alternative to expensive Brahmanical ritualism and superstitions. 20th century In the early 20th century, criticism against Brahminism came within various sections of Brahmin and other Hindu communities who were part of nationalist and rationalist movement. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was an eminent Hindu nationalist leader of the Indian independence movement. He was also an atheist and a staunch rationalist who disapproved of orthodox Hindu beliefs of caste system and dismissed cow worship as superstitious. Being Hindu, for him, was a cultural and political identity. Anti-Brahminism became organized in the formation of the Justice Party in late 1916 in Tamil Nadu. This party, composed of non-Brahmins who were typically feudal castes, land-owning agricultural castes and merchant castes and was committed to enhancing the opportunities for non- Brahmins.Ritualizing on the Boundaries; by Fred W. Clothey; The Reddys, Mudaliars, and Nairs are specific examples of South Indian non-Brahmin castes that were involved in the anti-Brahminism movement for about 50 years. With the dawn of the 20th century, and the rapid penetration of western education and western ideas, there was a rise in consciousness amongst the lower castes who felt that rights which were legitimately theirs were being denied to them. In 1920, when the Justice Party came to power, Brahmins occupied about 70 percent of the high level posts in the government. After reservation was introduced by the Justice Party, it reversed this trend, allowing non-Brahmins to rise in the government of the Madras Presidency.\\"https://archive.is/20120918002111/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main17.asp?filename=Ne042206superiority.asp\\" One of the most prominent proponents of Anti-Brahminism was Dravidian leader Periyar E. V. Ramasamy. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is quite often confused as being anti-Brahmin. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste was seen as a supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun brahmanism. Anti-Brahmin violence in Maharashtra  20th Century acts of violence  After Gandhi's murder by Nathuram Godse, a Chitpawan, Brahmins in Maharashtra, became targets of violence, mostly by some elements from the Maratha caste. The exact number deaths are unknown. Thousands of offices and homes were also set on fire. Molestation incidents were also reported during these attacks. On the first day alone, the number of deaths in Bombay were 15 and 50 in Pune. As per V.M. Sirsikar, \\"It will be too much to believe that the riots took place because of the intense love of Gandhiji on the part of the Marathas. Godse became a hate symbol against the Brahmins \\" Donald Rosenthal opines in 1948 that the motivation for the violence was the historical opposition Maratha community faced for their caste status. He writes,\\"Even today[1948], local Brahmins claim that the Marathas organized the riots to take political advantage of the situation\\". In Satara alone, the official reports show that about 1000 houses were burnt down in about 300 villages. There were \\"cruel, cold-blooded killings\\" as well - for example, one family whose last name happened to be 'Godse' had three of its male members killed. Maureen Patterson concludes that the greatest violence took place not in the cities of Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur - but in Satara, Kolhapur and Belgaum. Destruction was very large in Kolhapur was In Sangli, the Jains and the Lingayats joined the Marathas in the attacks against the Brahmins. Here, specifically, the factories owned by the Chitpawan Brahmins were destroyed. This event led to the hasty integration of the Patwardhan states into the Bombay Province by March 1948.  21st century threats of violence  Purshottam Khedekar, the chief of \\"Maratha Maha Sangh\\" (a Maratha caste based organization) and Sambhaji Brigade, published writings in 2011 that had defamatory statements about the sexual habits, orientation and character of Brahmin men and women. He made a call for \\"instigating communal riots purposefully started to kill Brahmin men.\\" However, Ramteke, an Ambedkarite, has written against Khedekar's writing. He said: “We should keep a distance from Khedekar and his movement against Brahmins. Dr Babasaheb [Ambedkar] never stooped to this level. If we continue to associate with him, it will malign our image. The government should ban the book and the organisation”. In 2011, a news report said that the \\"Maratha politicians have mostly been silent on the issue\\". A case has since been registered against Khedekar.http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-laine-baiter-maratha-author- pens-book-to-bash- brahmins-1546409https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/pune/cover-story/brahmin- insult-charge-on-maratha-seva-sangh-chief/articleshow/55988221.cms  Incidences in Tamilnadu  In the late 1950s, members of Dravidar Kazhagam have been accused of having assaulted the owner of \\"Hotel Murali Cafe\\", in Triplicane, Chennai for having the name \\"Hotel Murali Iyer's Cafe\\". In 2015, an 80 year old man and a 12 year old boy were attacked, and their religious symbols were destroyed in public. The assailants were later identified as party members of Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam, a Periyar inspired party, who yelled \\"Periyar Vaazhga\\" (Long live Periyar) during the assault.

Baughan played college football at Georgia Tech. College career While at Georgia Tech, Baughan played and started at both linebacker and center. In 1959, he was Georgia Tech's captain, an All-American, the Southeastern Conference Lineman of the Year, and the Most Valuable Player in the 1960 Gator Bowl. He set a Georgia Tech single-season record with 124 tackles. Baughan was inducted into the Georgia Tech Hall of Fame in 1965 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988. NFL career Baughan was selected in the second round of the 1960 NFL Draft by the Eagles as the 20th player chosen overall and became an immediate starter for the team at right side linebacker. Baughan played the next 10 years in the NFL and was voted all-pro seven times. At the conclusion of his rookie season, the Eagles won the 1960 NFL Championship, the last title for the franchise until their victory in Super Bowl 52 over the New England Patriots. Baughan was selected to the Pro Bowl for the first of nine times that year, finishing with three interceptions. All told, Baughan would make the Pro Bowl five out of six years during his time with the Eagles. During a December 12, 1965 in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Eagles intercepted a team-record nine passes en route to a 47-13 win over the Steelers. Six of those points came courtesy of Baughan when he returned a first quarter interception by Steelers quarterback Bill Nelsen 33 yards for the lone touchdown of his NFL career. By 1966, the number of games the Eagles won had sharply declined and Baughan decided that he wanted out of Philadelphia. However, George Allen, who was entering his first season as an NFL head coach with the Los Angeles Rams, won the right to Baughan's services by sending two players (linebacker Fred Brown and defensive tackle Frank Molden [Street and Smith's Official Yearbook; 1966 Pro Football; page 45]) to the Eagles in return. Baughan and Allen would develop a strong relationship, spending extensive time studying game film together. Baughan would later state that he learned more about football from Allen than anyone else. philadelphiaeagles.com Baughan was chosen to be the Rams defensive captain and was in charge of signal calling for the unit. He was selected for the Pro Bowl in each of his first four seasons with the Rams and was also named 1st Team All-Pro three times. After an injury-plagued 1970 season, in which he played in only 10 games, Baughan retired from the NFL. From 1972 to 1973, he was an assistant coach and defensive coordinator at Georgia Tech. In 1974, Allen, now the head coach of the Washington Redskins, talked Baughan into a brief return to the NFL as a player-coach for the Redskins. At the conclusion of that season, Baughan retired. He finished with 18 interceptions (including 1 returned for a touchdown) and 10 fumble recoveries in 147 games played. Coaching career From 1975 to 1982, he was a defensive coordinator for the Baltimore Colts and Detroit Lions. During his time with the Colts, the team won three straight AFC East divisional championships from 1975 to 1977. He became head football coach at Cornell University in 1983, and his 1988 team was co-champion of the Ivy League. It was Cornell's first championship since 1971. Baughan was forced to resign as head coach at Cornell after information surfaced about an affair he had with an assistant coach's wife. Baughan then returned to the NFL for stints as an assistant with the Minnesota Vikings, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and, finally, the Baltimore Ravens. He retired from coaching in 1998. Honors In addition to being a member of the Georgia Tech and College Football Halls of Fame, Baughan has also been inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame (1980), the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame (1983) and the Gator Bowl Hall of Fame. However, he has not yet been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association's third HOVG class. In 2012 Baughan received the Outstanding Eagle Scout Award from the National Eagle Scout Association of the Boy Scouts of America. On August 4, 2015, the Philadelphia Eagles announced that Baughan will be inducted into the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame on Monday, October 19 when the team hosts the New York Giants on Monday Night Football.

The Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders (also known as the House on the Rock), is a parable of Jesus appearing in the Gospel of Matthew () and Luke (). The parable illustrates the importance of building one's life on obedience to the teachings and example of Jesus. Narrative In the Gospel of Matthew, the Parable appears at the end of the Sermon on the Mount as follows: Matthew's summary of Jesus' sayings, noting that \\"the people were astonished at his teaching\\", follows immediately after this parable. Interpretation This parable emphasises the need to put Jesus' teachings into practice, and speaks of \\"two sorts of people whose hearts are revealed in their actions\\".Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , pp. 277, 281. Matthew's version of the parable has a \\"more complex narrative structure\\" Richard N. Longenecker, The Challenge of Jesus' Parables, Eerdmans, 2000, , pp. 287–89. than Luke's, mentioning rain and winds as well as floods. These forces are usually interpreted ethically, as trials of life that can be resisted by a life founded on Christian doctrine, but can also be interpreted eschatologically. The usual interpretation goes back to John Chrysostom (c. 347–407), who wrote in his Homily 24 on Matthew: > By \\"rain\\" here, and \\"floods,\\" and \\"winds,\\" He is expressing metaphorically > the calamities and afflictions that befall men; such as false accusations, > plots, bereavements, deaths, loss of friends, vexations from strangers, all > the ills in our life that any one could mention. \\"But to none of these,\\" > says He, \\"does such a soul give way; and the cause is, it is founded on the > rock.\\" He calls the steadfastness of His doctrine a rock; because in truth > His commands are stronger than any rock, setting one above all the waves of > human affairs. For he who keeps these things strictly, will not have the > advantage of men only when they are vexing him, but even of the very devils > plotting against him. And that it is not vain boasting so to speak, Job is > our witness, who received all the assaults of the devil, and stood > unmoveable; and the apostles too are our witnesses, for that when the waves > of the whole world were beating against them, when both nations and princes, > both their own people and strangers, both the evil spirits, and the devil, > and every engine was set in motion, they stood firmer than a rock, and > dispersed it all.Chrysostom's Homily 24 on Matthew, New Advent. Hymns This parable has formed the theme for many hymns, such as Built on the Rock (N. F. S. Grundtvig, 1837) and My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less (Edward Mote, c. 1834), which begins: > My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness. I dare > not trust the sweetest frame, But wholly trust in Jesus' Name. On Christ the > solid Rock I stand, All other ground is sinking sand; All other ground is > sinking sand.

Though he adopted the title of King (lugal), Puzer-Mama shows kinship with future Lagashite kings in the religiosity of his inscriptions. He took control of Lagash during Shar-kali-sharri’s reign, when troubles with the Guti left the Sargonic king with only “a small rump state whose center lay at the confluence of the Diyala and Tigris river.” (Frayne 1993 p. 186) Puzer- Mama’s royal inscription -- wherein he receives the various gifts of the gods appropriate to rulership: power by Ningirsu, intelligence by Enki, and position by Inanna, (Frayne 1993 p. 272) -- may be contrasted with the contemporary religious element in Shar-kali-sharri's various inscriptions: a call for the gods to punish any who alter his inscriptions, and specifically to “tear out his foundations and destroy his progeny” (one of a number of curses for protection found in royal inscriptions starting with the reign of Sargon.) Puzer-Mama appears in Babylonian inscription (BM 2310) as one of the ancient rulers of Lagash, particularly the list of \\"The rulers of Lagaš\\": Puzur-Mama also appears in a letter about territorial disputes between two Governors, apparently sent to Shar-Kali-Sharri: According to other inscriptions however, his tutelary god was Shulutula.

Thompson was considered the number one high school prospect in the land. He elected to play college basketball for Denny Crum at the University of Louisville. His team reached the semi- finals of the national championship his freshman year, where they lost to the University of Houston. In his junior year he led the Cardinals in scoring, rebounding and assists. His senior season the Cardinals won the 1986 NCAA national championship. NBA In the 1986 NBA Draft he was selected 19th overall by the Atlanta Hawks. In a draft-day trade he was sent to the Los Angeles Lakers. He was a reserve on the Lakers teams that won back-to-back NBA Championships in 1986-87 and 1987-88. He is one of only four players to have won an NCAA championship and an NBA championship in back to back seasons, the other three being Bill Russell (University of San Francisco 1956, Boston Celtics 1957), Henry Bibby (UCLA 1972, New York Knicks 1973) and Earvin Johnson (Michigan State 1979, Los Angeles Lakers 1980). After an injury- riddled sophomore season with the Lakers, he was then left unprotected in the 1988 NBA expansion draft and was selected by the Miami Heat, where he was a starter for the Heat's inaugural game and averaged 10.8 points per game in Miami's expansion season. As a part-time starter in 1989-90, Thompson averaged 11 points per game. He also appeared in the 1990 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where he finished 7th out of 8 participants.

While his debut album Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy (1983) was performed by Bragg accompanied only by his guitar, Brewing Up with Billy Bragg began to use subtle overdubs, such as backing vocals on \\"Love Gets Dangerous\\", trumpet on \\"The Saturday Boy\\" and organ on \\"A Lover Sings\\". The album also continued Bragg's legacy of political songs. \\"It Says Here\\" is a bitingly satirical attack on the British tabloid press and \\"Island of No Return\\" is a concise anti-war anthem. In 2000 Q magazine placed Brewing Up with Billy Bragg at number 87 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. The album reached number 16 in the UK albums chart. It was ranked number 6 among the \\"Albums of the Year\\" for 1984 by NME.

For hundreds of years, Kazakhs were herders who raised fat-tailed sheep, Bactrian camels, and horses, relying on these animals for transportation, clothing, and food. The cooking techniques and major ingredients have been strongly influenced by the nation's nomadic way of life. For example, most cooking techniques are aimed at long-term preservation of food. There is a large practice of salting and drying meat so that it will last, and there is a preference for sour milk, as it is easier to save in a nomadic lifestyle. Meat in various forms has always been the primary ingredient of Kazakh cuisine, and traditional Kazakh cooking is based on boiling. Horse and mutton are the most popular forms of meat and are most often served in large uncut pieces which have been boiled. Kazakhs cared especially for horses which they intended to slaughter—keeping them separate from other animals and feeding them so much that they often became so fat they had difficulty moving. A platter of horse meat served traditionally as an appetizer Preparation of a meal in Kazakhstan Kurt Quwyrdaq Shelpek Common and traditional dishes Manti (dumpling) Majority of Kazakh cuisine is () – four kinds of cattle (i.e. four kinds of meat): horses, camels, cows, and sheep. Horse meat is the main festive meat, while sheep's meat is used as common meat. Camel meat is also a kind of festive meat, but not the main (as camels in Kazakhstan are not as common as horses). Cow's meat is also a kind of common meat. , a dish consisting of boiled horse or mutton meat is the most popular Kazakh dish. It is also called \\"five fingers\\" because of the way it is eaten. The chunks of boiled meat are cut and served by the host in order of the guests’ importance. is usually eaten with a boiled pasta sheet, and a meat broth called , and is traditionally served in Kazakh bowls called . is another Kazakh's national dish.

Another popular dish is pilaf (), which is made from meat fried with carrots, onions or garlic, then cooked with rice. , also known as crackler, is melted fat in a large bowl with sugar, eaten by dipping it with bread and is often served with tea. is a sausage made during fall and winter slaughtering and is made by stuffing intestines with pieces of ground meat, fat, blood, garlic, salt, and black pepper. , also known as kebab, is popular among hunters and travelers and is a dish in which small pieces of meat are roasted over a fire. is a dish made from the heart, aorta, and fat of a horse, prepared in a kettle, and is often shared between sisters-in-law as a sign of unity. is a sausage eaten in the spring when a cow has a new calf; it is a giant sausage sometimes served with rice or . is a dish made from sheep's brain, made by putting the brain in a wooden bowl, adding marrow, pieces of meat, salted fat in broth, and garlic, and this dish is then often served to honored guests. is a large camel bone distributed to children after slaughtering and cooking meat from a camel. is another kind of sausage eaten later in the year after it has aged—if smoked it will last a long time, something important in Kazakh cooking. is the layer of fat under a horse's mane and is served only to special and honored guests, as it is such a rare commodity. is the rump of a horse, probably served boiled. is a white broth made in the fall, and is a special meal for rich men. is a meal which used to be served to kinsmen at wedding parties.

Black tea was introduced from China after the foundation of the Silk Way and was traditionally consumed with sweets after the main course. Nowadays it has virtually replaced other traditional drinks and every meal is accompanied with tea. The tea ceremony, taking its roots from the nomads many centuries ago, is a special dastarkhan ritual in Kazakhstan. Kazakh tea is typically strong black tea with milk or cream. Consumption of tea in Kazakhstan is one of the highest in the world - 1.2 kilograms a year per person. In comparison, tea consumption in India is 650 grams per person.

Influential cuisines In addition to traditional nomadic practices and the internal development of Kazakh food and cuisine, other countries and ethnic groups have had a large influence on the food and food culture of Kazakhstan. These ethnic groups included Russians, Tatars, Ukrainians, Uzbeks, Germans, Uyghurs, Koreans, and many more.\\"Kazakhstan food and national meals\\" Although traditional Kazakh cuisine is based on meat and milk products, more recently, vegetables, fish and seafood, baked dishes, and sweets have been added to Kazakh cuisine. Practice and ritual In nomadic cookery, the amount of equipment is minimal because it must be transported from location to location to follow the grazing herds. In addition, there are no luxuries such as electricity or running water. The iron kazan is the most indispensable piece of cookware—it is used for cooking pilaf, soups, and even bread—if the kazan is shallow, it can be turned over to cook flatbread on the back. Many parts of the sheep and goat are used for holding milk products or for making cheese. The host of the meal cuts the meat himself (or herself) and gives the best cuts to more honored people or to children. This meat is most often eaten with thin boiled pieces of pastry. Sometimes the most honored guest at a meal will receive a cooked head of a ram, which is passed around in ceremonial or ritual practice. A guest is always given the place of honor and a special welcome in Kazakh practice. Kazakhs traditionally eat at a low table called a Dastarkhān.”Cuisine of Kazakhstan\\" Kazakhs also maintain a tradition of using beautiful dishware when possible. is served in wide bowls decorated with silver or in painted cups, and meat is often served on wide platters. Tea is steeped in ornate teapots and served in lovely cups. Unusual ingredients such as dried melon and small intestines were regularly woven into interesting patterns, and the bread boasted floral designs painted with berry juice. Bigger and deeper bowls are used to serve dairy products, and small wooden basins are used for making dough. Further more, each family has their own wooden spoons, which are cared for and transported in felt and wooden cases, showing their importance in food culture in Kazakhstan.Glenn Randall Mack and Asele Surina, Food culture in Russia and Central Asia (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2005), 112-13. Kazakhs like other Central Asian nations have some special rules of \\"tea ceremony\\". Traditionally it is not allowed to pour tea to the brim of the cup called . The less tea is poured the more respect is given to the guest. It is explained by saying that if the host pours too much tea, it looks like he wants the guest to leave sooner. The less tea is poured, the more the host has to pour it over and over again, so that the guest always has hot tea, which shows care for the guest. However, different regions may have different understandings of the amount of \\"tea with respect\\".

Gleason's theorem in quantum logic and the Greenwood–Gleason graph, an important example in Ramsey theory, are named for him. As a young World War II naval officer, Gleason broke German and Japanese military codes. After the war he spent his entire academic career at Harvard University, from which he retired in 1992. His numerous academic and scholarly leadership posts included chairmanship of the Harvard Mathematics Department and the Harvard Society of Fellows, and presidency of the American Mathematical Society. He continued to advise the United States government on cryptographic security, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on education for children, almost until the end of his life. Gleason won the Newcomb Cleveland Prize in 1952 and the Gung–Hu Distinguished Service Award of the American Mathematical Society in 1996. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society, and held the Hollis Chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard. He was fond of saying that proofs \\"really aren't there to convince you that something is truethey're there to show you why it is true.\\" The Notices of the American Mathematical Society called him \\"one of the quiet giants of twentieth-century mathematics, the consummate professor dedicated to scholarship, teaching, and service in equal measure.\\" Biography US Navy, 1940s Gleason was born in Fresno, California, the youngest of three children; his father Henry Gleason was a botanist and a member of the Mayflower Society, and his mother was the daughter of Swiss-American winemaker Andrew Mattei. His older brother Henry Jr. became a linguist. He grew up in Bronxville, New York, where his father was the curator of the New York Botanical Garden. . After briefly attending Berkeley High School (Berkeley, California) he graduated from Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, winning a scholarship to Yale University. Though Gleason's mathematics education had gone only so far as some self-taught calculus, Yale mathematician William Raymond Longley urged him to try a course in mechanics normally intended for juniors. One month later he enrolled in a differential equations course (\\"mostly full of seniors\\") as well. When Einar Hille temporarily replaced the regular instructor, Gleason found Hille's style \\"unbelievably different ... He had a view of mathematics that was just vastly different ... That was a very important experience for me. So after that I took a lot of courses from Hille\\" including, in his sophomore year, graduate- level real analysis. \\"Starting with that course with Hille, I began to have some sense of what mathematics is about.\\" While at Yale he competed three times (1940, 1941 and 1942) in the recently founded William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, always placing among the top five entrants in the country (making him the second three-time Putnam Fellow).. After the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor during his senior year, Gleason applied for a commission in the US Navy,. and on graduation joined the team working to break Japanese naval codes. (Others on this team included his future collaborator Robert E. Greenwood and Yale professor Marshall Hall Jr.) He also collaborated with British researchers attacking the German Enigma cipher; Alan Turing, who spent substantial time with Gleason while visiting Washington, called him \\"the brilliant young Yale graduate mathematician\\" in a report of his visit. Jean Berko, 1958 In 1946, at the recommendation of Navy colleague Donald Howard Menzel, Gleason was appointed a Junior Fellow at Harvard. An early goal of the Junior Fellows program was to allow young scholars showing extraordinary promise to sidestep the lengthy PhD process; four years later Harvard appointed Gleason an assistant professor of mathematics, though he was almost immediately recalled to Washington for cryptographic work related to the Korean War. He returned to Harvard in the fall of 1952, and soon after published the most important of his results on Hilbert's fifth problem (see below). Harvard awarded him tenure the following year. In January 1959 he married Jean Berko whom he had met at a party featuring the music of Tom Lehrer.. Berko, a psycholinguist, worked for many years at Boston University. They had three daughters. In 1969 Gleason took the Hollis Chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Established in 1727, this is the oldest scientific endowed professorship in the US.. He retired from Harvard in 1992 but remained active in service to Harvard (as chair of the Society of Fellows, for example) and to mathematics: in particular, promoting the Harvard Calculus Reform Project. and working with the Massachusetts Board of Education. He died in 2008 from complications following surgery.  Teaching and education reform Australia, 1988 Gleason said he \\"always enjoyed helping other people with math\\"a colleague said he \\"regarded teaching mathematicslike doing mathematicsas both important and also genuinely fun.\\" At fourteen, during his brief attendance at Berkeley High School, he found himself not only bored with first-semester geometry, but also helping other students with their homeworkincluding those taking the second half of the course, which he soon began auditing.. At Harvard he \\"regularly taught at every level\\", including administratively burdensome multisection courses. One class presented Gleason with a framed print of Picasso's Mother and Child in recognition of his care for them. In 1964 he created \\"the first of the 'bridge' courses now ubiquitous for math majors, only twenty years before its time.\\" Such a course is designed to teach new students, accustomed to rote learning of mathematics in secondary school, how to reason abstractly and construct mathematical proofs.. That effort led to publication of his Fundamentals of Abstract Analysis, of which one reviewer wrote: Sphinx, 2001 But Gleason's \\"talent for exposition\\" did not always imply that the reader would be enlightened without effort of his own. Even in a wartime memo on the urgently important decryption of the German Enigma cipher, Gleason and his colleagues wrote: His notes and exercises on probability and statistics, drawn up for his lectures to code-breaking colleagues during the war (see below) remained in use in National Security Agency training for several decades; they were published openly in 1985. In a 1964 Science article, Gleason wrote of an apparent paradox arising in attempts to explain mathematics to nonmathematicians: \\"With the inevitable clipboard under his arm\\", 1989 Gleason was part of the School Mathematics Study Group, which helped define the New Math of the 1960sambitious changes in American elementary and high school mathematics teaching emphasizing understanding of concepts over rote algorithms. Gleason was \\"always interested in how people learn\\"; as part of the New Math effort he spent most mornings over several months with second-graders. Some years later he gave a talk in which he described his goal as having been: In 1986 he helped found the Calculus Consortium, which has published a successful and influential series of \\"calculus reform\\" textbooks for college and high school, on precalculus, calculus, and other areas. His \\"credo for this program as for all of his teaching was that the ideas should be based in equal parts of geometry for visualization of the concepts, computation for grounding in the real world, and algebraic manipulation for power.\\" However, the program faced heavy criticism from the mathematics community for its omission of topics such as the mean value theorem,. and for its perceived lack of mathematical rigor.... Cryptanalysis work the German Enigma. \\"The recovery of wiring from a depth can be a very and try it.\\" During World War II Gleason was part of OP-20-G, the U.S. Navy's signals intelligence and cryptanalysis group. One task of this group, in collaboration with British cryptographers at Bletchley Park such as Alan Turing, was to penetrate German Enigma machine communications networks. The British had great success with two of these networks, but the third, used for German-Japanese naval coordination, remained unbroken because of a faulty assumption that it employed a simplified version of Enigma. After OP-20-G's Marshall Hall observed that certain metadata in Berlin-to-Tokyo transmissions used letter sets disjoint from those used in Tokyo-to-Berlin metadata, Gleason hypothesized that the corresponding unencrypted letters sets were A-M (in one direction) and N-Z (in the other), then devised novel statistical tests by which he confirmed this hypothesis. The result was routine decryption of this third network by 1944. (This work also involved deeper related to permutation groups and the graph isomorphism problem.) OP-20-G then turned to the Japanese navy's \\"Coral\\" cipher. A key tool for the attack on Coral was the \\"Gleason crutch\\", a form of Chernoff bound on tail distributions of sums of independent random variables. Gleason's classified work on this bound predated Chernoff's work by a decade. Toward the end of the war he concentrated on documenting the work of OP-20-G and developing systems for training new cryptographers. In 1950 Gleason returned to active duty for the Korean War, serving as a Lieutenant Commander in the Nebraska Avenue Complex (which much later became the home of the DHS Cyber Security Division). His cryptographic work from this period remains classified, but it is known that he recruited mathematicians and taught them cryptanalysis. He served on the advisory boards for the National Security Agency and the Institute for Defense Analyses, and he continued to recruit, and to advise the military on cryptanalysis, almost to the end of his life. Mathematics research Gleason made fundamental contributions to widely varied areas of mathematics, including the theory of Lie groups, quantum mechanics,. and combinatorics. According to Freeman Dyson's famous classification of mathematicians as being either birds or frogs,. Gleason was a frog: he worked as a problem solver rather than a visionary formulating grand theories.. Hilbert's fifth problem Journal entry (1949): \\"July 10. We hung out the wash this fifth.\\" In 1900 David Hilbert posed 23 problems he felt would be central to next century of mathematics research. Hilbert's fifth problem concerns the characterization of Lie groups by their actions on topological spaces: to what extent does their topology provide information sufficient to determine their geometry? The \\"restricted\\" version of Hilbert's fifth problem (solved by Gleason) asks, more specifically, whether every locally Euclidean topological group is a Lie group. That is, if a group G has the structure of a topological manifold, can that structure be strengthened to a real analytic structure, so that within any neighborhood of an element of G, the group law is defined by a convergent power series, and so that overlapping neighborhoods have compatible power series definitions? Prior to Gleason's work, special cases of the problem had been solved by Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer, John von Neumann, Lev Pontryagin, and Garrett Birkhoff, among others.. . With his mentor George Mackey at Alice Mackey's 80th birthday (2000). Gleason's interest in the fifth problem began in the late 1940s, sparked by a course he took from George Mackey. In 1949 he published a paper introducing the \\"no small subgroups\\" property of Lie groups (the existence of a neighborhood of the identity within which no nontrivial subgroup exists) that would eventually be crucial to its solution. His 1952 paper on the subject, together with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof. The \\"unrestricted\\" version of Hilbert's fifth problem, closer to Hilbert's original formulation, considers both a locally Euclidean group G and another manifold M on which G has a continuous action. Hilbert asked whether, in this case, M and the action of G could be given a real analytic structure. It was quickly realized that the answer was negative, after which attention centered on the restricted problem. However, with some additional smoothness assumptions on G and M, it might yet be possible to prove the existence of a real analytic structure on the group action. The Hilbert–Smith conjecture, still unsolved, encapsulates the remaining difficulties of this case.See, e.g., . Quantum mechanics With family cat Fred about 1966 The Born rule states that an observable property of a quantum system is defined by a Hermitian operator on a separable Hilbert space, that the only observable values of the property are the eigenvalues of the operator, and that the probability of the system being observed in a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the complex number obtained by projecting the state vector (a point in the Hilbert space) onto the corresponding eigenvector. George Mackey had asked whether Born's rule is a necessary consequence of a particular set of axioms for quantum mechanics, and more specifically whether every measure on the lattice of projections of a Hilbert space can be defined by a positive operator with unit trace. Though Richard Kadison proved this was false for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, Gleason's theorem (published 1957) shows it to be true for higher dimensions. Gleason's theorem implies the nonexistence of certain types of hidden variable theories for quantum mechanics, strengthening a previous argument of John von Neumann. Von Neumann had claimed to show that hidden variable theories were impossible, but (as Grete Hermann pointed out) his demonstration made an assumption that quantum systems obeyed a form of additivity of expectation for noncommuting operators that might not hold a priori. In 1966, John Stewart Bell showed that Gleason's theorem could be used to remove this extra assumption from von Neumann's argument. Ramsey theory The Greenwood–Gleason graph The Ramsey number R(k,l) is the smallest number r such that every graph with at least r vertices contains either a k-vertex clique or an l-vertex independent set. Ramsey numbers require enormous effort to compute; when max(k,l) ≥ 3 only finitely many of them are known precisely, and an exact computation of R(6,6) is believed to be out of reach. In 1953, the calculation of R(3,3) was given as a question in the Putnam Competition; in 1955, motivated by this problem, . Gleason and his co- author Robert E. Greenwood made significant progress in the computation of Ramsey numbers with their proof that R(3,4) = 9, R(3,5) = 14, and R(4,4) = 18\\\\. Since then, only five more of these values have been found.. In the same 1955 paper, Greenwood and Gleason also computed the multicolor Ramsey number R(3,3,3): the smallest number r such that, if a complete graph on r vertices has its edges colored with three colors, then it necessarily contains a monochromatic triangle. As they showed, R(3,3,3) = 17; this remains the only nontrivial multicolor Ramsey number whose exact value is known. As part of their proof, they used an algebraic construction to show that a 16-vertex complete graph can be decomposed into three disjoint copies of a triangle-free 5-regular graph with 16 vertices and 40 edges. . (sometimes called the Greenwood–Gleason graph).. Ronald Graham writes that the paper by Greenwood and Gleason \\"is now recognized as a classic in the development of Ramsey theory\\". In the late 1960s, Gleason became the doctoral advisor of Joel Spencer, who also became known for his contributions to Ramsey theory. Coding theory Henry Allan Gleason Jr., in Toronto, 1969 Gleason published few contributions to coding theory, but they were influential ones, and included \\"many of the seminal ideas and early results\\" in algebraic coding theory. During the 1950s and 1960s, he attended monthly meetings on coding theory with Vera Pless and others at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory.. Pless, who had previously worked in abstract algebra but became one of the world's leading experts in coding theory during this time, writes that \\"these monthly meetings were what I lived for.\\" She frequently posed her mathematical problems to Gleason and was often rewarded with a quick and insightful response. The Gleason–Prange theorem is named after Gleason's work with AFCRL researcher Eugene Prange; it was originally published in a 1964 AFCRL research report by H. F. Mattson Jr. and E. F. Assmus Jr. It concerns the quadratic residue code of order n, extended by adding a single parity check bit. This \\"remarkable theorem\\". shows that this code is highly symmetric, having the projective linear group PSL2(n) as a subgroup of its symmetries. Gleason is also the namesake of the Gleason polynomials, a system of polynomials that generate the weight enumerators of linear codes.. These polynomials take a particularly simple form for self-dual codes: in this case there are just two of them, the two bivariate polynomials x2 + y2 and x8 + 14x2y2 + y8. Gleason's student Jessie MacWilliams continued Gleason's work in this area, proving a relationship between the weight enumerators of codes and their duals that has become known as the MacWilliams identity. Other areas Gleason founded the theory of Dirichlet algebras,. and made other contributions including work on finite geometrySee his 1956 paper \\"Finite Fano planes\\". and on the enumerative combinatorics of permutations. (In 1959 he wrote that his research \\"sidelines\\" included \\"an intense interest in combinatorial problems.\\") As well, he was not above publishing research in more elementary mathematics, such as the derivation of the set of polygons that can be constructed with compass, straightedge, and an angle trisector. Awards and honors In Naval Reserve uniform, 1960s In 1952 Gleason was awarded the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Newcomb Cleveland Prize. for his work on Hilbert's fifth problem. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,. and belonged to the Société Mathématique de France. In 1981 and 1982 he was president of the American Mathematical Society, and at various times held numerous other posts in professional and scholarly organizations, including chairmanship of the Harvard Department of Mathematics. In 1986 he chaired the organizing committee for the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berkeley, California, and was president of the Congress. In 1996 the Harvard Society of Fellows held a special symposium honoring Gleason on his retirement after seven years as its chairman;. that same year, the Mathematics Association of America awarded him the Yueh-Gin Gung and Dr. Charles Y. Hu Distinguished Service to Mathematics Award.. A past president of the Association wrote: After his death a 32-page collection of essays in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society recalled \\"the life and work of [this] eminent American mathematician\\", . calling him \\"one of the quiet giants of twentieth-century mathematics, the consummate professor dedicated to scholarship, teaching, and service in equal measure.\\"  Selected publications  ;Research papers * *. *. *. *. *. *. ;Books *.

Although his refusal to accept the sacrament bears some resemblance to the Donatist heresy, which states that sacraments performed by corrupt priests are actually invalid, it was not clear at the time whether Ramihrdus should actually be condemned or not, since his refusal could also be interpreted in the context of Pope Gregory VII's contemporary attempt to reform the church, which included several initiatives directed towards the reform of the clergy. However, an angry mob (unclear whether or not it was, in fact, priest, the locals of Cambrai, or even both) seized Ramihrdus from where he was being kept in a hut, after the clergy had been deliberating his circumstances of accusations against the corrupt priests, and burned him as a heretic.

Life Griffin Markham was the son of Thomas Markham (1530-1607) and of Mary Griffin (1540-ca.1633) of Ollerton, Nottinghamshire. He likely converted to Roman Catholicism early in his life, under the influence of his mother. On 29 May 1592 he married Anne Roos.Markham, p. 104 Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, knighted him in 1591 at the siege of Rouen. During the Nine Years War in Ireland (1594-1603) he commanded the cavalry under Sir Conyers Clifford, and his opportune arrival and counter-charge after the defeat of the infantry at the Battle of Curlew Pass (1599) saved the army from complete disaster. His right arm was broken during the affray. Markham was banished from court for unknown reasons around 1593.Markham, p. 100 Although he had anticipated the accession of King James I with a degree of hope, after it occurred in March 1603 he experienced disappointment with the new monarch's lack of favour, and took part in the Bye Plot (June 1603) and subsequently the Main Plot (July 1603), for which he was convicted (1603) and sentenced to death. However, he was reprieved from execution and exiled (1605).Markham, p. 102 His properties were given to his cousin, Sir John Harington. He spent the rest of his life in exile in Europe, acting as a spy for Robert Cecil, and joining the English regiment in the Low Countries; there he fell out with Sir Edmund Baynham, a conspirator in the Gunpowder Plot, and fought a bloody duel with him.

The doll, introduced at the American Toy Fair in New York City in March 1963, belonged to a line of highly successful talking dolls introduced in 1960 (Chatty Cathy was the first of these dolls). Other chatty dolls in the line (and the year they were introduced) were Chatty Baby (1962), Tiny Chatty Baby (1963), Tiny Chatty Brother (1963) and Singin' Chatty (1965). Mattel trademarked the word chatty in the 1960s, and some of the packaging for its talking toys carried the tag line, \\"A Chatty doll by Mattel\\" or \\"A Chatty toy by Mattel\\". Mattel dolls such as Drowsy, Baby Cheryl, and Tatters had the tag line on their boxes that said, \\"A Chatty Doll by Mattel.\\" Charmin' Chatty spoke different phrases when a pullstring attached to a \\"chatty ring\\" protruding from its upper back was pulled. The ring was connected to a simple low-fidelity phonograph record in the doll's abdomen. The record was driven by a metal coil wound by pulling the toy's string. Charmin' Chatty was distinguished from Mattel's other talking dolls by having changeable records, all boxes for the doll, clothing and games have a symbol on them that says: \\"Changeable Record Doll.\\" Three-inch records were inserted and removed from a slot in the left side of the doll. The basic doll came with 5 double-sided \\"chatty records\\" with 12 phrases on each side of the record. Thus, with 10 sides total, the doll was able to speak 120 different phrases. By comparison, the original version of Chatty Cathy introduced in 1960 spoke only 11 phrases (that doll's repertoire was expanded to 18 phrases in 1963). Initially, the records were made of black vinyl which was vulnerable to warping and blistering, so they were quickly replaced by white nylon records.The titles of the records that came with the doll were: Get Acquainted Side 1 and Side 2, Poems/Proverbs, Scary/Animal Noises, Mother/Ridiculous, & Good/Famous. Charmin' Chatty's shoulder-length hair was available in blonde and auburn, and she had blue side glancing \\"life-like decal eyes.\\" Standing 24 inches tall, the doll came with a sailor outfit (a white jacket with a red sailor collar, jumper dress with a navy blue skirt, red knee socks, and blue-and-white saddle shoes). The doll, which wore eyeglass frames, was called \\"the educated doll\\" perhaps because it was able to speak foreign languages when its records were changed. Eight different outfits were available separately for the doll; each came with a record with phrases related to that particular outfit. Among the different costume sets and themes for Charmin' Chatty were \\"Let's Play Together\\", \\"Let's Go Shopping\\", \\"Let's Play Nurse\\", \\"Let's Play Cinderella\\", \\"Let's Play Birthday Party\\", \\"Let's Play Pajama Party\\", and \\"Let's Play Tea Party\\". One outfit called \\"Let's Talk 'n Travel in Foreign Lands\\" came with 4 double-sided records and allowed the doll to speak in English and 6 other languages. Sometimes referred to as Charmin' Chatty's travel set, this is the most sought-after outfit by collectors. It included a navy blue coat, red straw hat, and blue shoes for the doll, plus a flight bag and stewardess hat for the child to wear (the idea being Charmin' Chatty was going on an around- the-world airplane trip and the child was the stewardess). Phrases included on the travel set records were, \\"The Queen lives in Buckingham Palace\\", \\"Garçon means boy in French\\", and \\"In German, Schule means school\\". Included in each set were props for the child to wear or use. One of the phrases on the record accompanying Charmin' Chatty's shopping outfit was, \\"Shall we buy a Barbie doll?\\" There were also four \\"Chatty Games\\" available, packaged in sets of two games each, which came with a record that allowed the doll to call out game moves when its string was pulled. Because you never knew what phrase the doll would say, Charmin' Chatty could call out a move, and using the specially designed game board... she could win the game herself! The game titles were, \\"Chatty at the Fair/Chatty Skate 'N Slide\\" and \\"Chatty Animal Round-up/Chatty Animal Friends\\". Charmin' Chatty was included in World Book Encyclopedia's doll section, representing the quintessential modern doll of the era. The doll was also featured on the cover of the December 7, 1963 Saturday Evening Post and a Little Golden Book was written about the doll. References * Kettelkamp, Sean.

The album was recorded in the Moles Studio in Bath, and features contributions from The Balanescu Quartet. Initial CD copies were sold in a glow-in-the-dark, encapsulated CD case. The lineup fluctuated during recording, with the band eventually reduced to a core trio of Jason Pierce, Kate Radley and Sean Cook. Previous members Mark Refoy and Jonny Mattock performed the main guitar and drums sections respectively, but by the time of album release, both men had been sacked from the band. At the time of release, Pierce had renamed the band as \\"Spiritualized Electric Mainline\\", the name that appears on the album cover, before reverting to the Spiritualized name shortly afterwards. The track \\"Pure Phase\\" was the basis for a limited edition release called \\"Pure Phase Tones For DJs\\", which consisted of 16 versions of \\"Pure Phase\\", four on each side of the single, playable at both 33 and 45rpm. The tracks were in the keys of C/F; D/G; E/A; F/B-flat; G/C; A/D; B/E; and C/F, at varying frequencies. Pierce intended that they were to be used as a set, in order to make chords.

Although she wrote a number of novels and works on travel, she was best known for her poetry. Her work was conservative; she did not write anything that she felt was improper for children to hear, and was described as consisting of \\"respectable but not highly distinguished or passionate phrases to the conventional wisdom of her time and place.\\" She had a keen sense of form and, working as she did in several mediums, to her belonged the distinction of never attempting to say in verse what might better find expression in prose. To her sense of form she added a clear-seeing eye, and the ability so to fit words together as to make others see what she saw. Her work has constantly appeared in the foremost publications and her books have followed each other at regular intervals. Some of her early books included, Farmingdale (1854), Leanmere (1856), Sibyl Huntington (1869), Poems (1872), Expiation (1873), Friar Anselmo and Other Poems (1879), The Legend of the Baboushka,—a Christmas Poem (1881), Daybreak,— an Easter Poem (1882), Bermuda,—an Idyl of the Summer Islands (1884), and Afternoon Songs (1885). Early years and education Julia Caroline Ripley was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on February 13, 1825. Her mother, Zulma De Lacy Thomas, shared a mingled Huguenot and Catholic descent. Her maternal grandparents were natives of France, who fled to South Carolina from San Domingo (i.e. Haiti) at the time of the successful slave insurrection in that island, near the close of the 18th century. Her father, William Young Ripley, was born in Middlebury, Vermont, the son of one of Vermont's pioneers, and it is through him that she was descended from some of the first New England immigrants, including William Bradford, governor of Plymouth Colony, and William Ripley, who arrived in Hingham, Massachusetts in 1638. She referred to her early girlhood as the most eventful part of her life. There was the long journey to Vermont the summer she was 18 months old, and her young mother's death only four days after reaching the state which it had been hoped would give her health. There was the sojourn in New York, where William had established himself in business, and where he wanted his little daughter's company. Clear and vivid was her memory of that trip down the Hudson River taken with her father when she was three years old, and of their arrival at the small boarding school on then fashionable Bleeker Street. At six, she was back in Middlebury, browsing in her father's large and well chosen library —she could not remember the time when she did not know how to read—a library established in a newly built house four miles up the Otter from Middlebury village in a quarter of the town called Farmingdale, a house presided over by a new step-mother. Here, also she recited daily lessons to her father and did her daily \\"stent\\" of sewing or knitting. Dorr grew to womanhood in a home of culture and refinement, and it is here where she began writing as a little child. It is here also that the father engaged in business again, and devoted himself chiefly to the development of the Rutland marble quarries. The home also included her half-brothers, Edward H. Ripley and Major General William Y. W. Ripley, both of whom became prominent officers in the American Civil War.\\"W.Y.W. Ripley Dead: End Comes Quickly for Prominent Rutland Man\\". St. Albans Daily Messenger December 21, 1905. Reprinted at Vermont in the Civil War. Schooling came to her, as it was apt to come to a girl of her period, intermittently and in variety. She spent a year in a small boarding school in Plattsburg; an interval at a school kept at the Shurtliff homestead in Middlebury; attendance at the Middlebury Female Semimary; a winter at a village Academy in Rutland, where she recited Latin with boys preparing to enter college as sophomores; and a term or two at \\"Old T. C. A.\\" It was at Middlebury, in a one-story school house on Pleasant Street, that she began the study of Latin, the subject of all others most useful in her adult life, as she declared. There, too, under Father Merrill, she wrote on the blackboard the list of English kings from Julius Caesar to William the Fourth, without a blunder. The feat was recalled by President John M. Thomas when in 1910 he conferred on her the degree of Doctor of Letters from Middlebury College, an honor which with characteristic modesty she accepted as a tribute to the women of her generation. Career \\"The Maples\\" On February 22, 1847, she married Seneca M. Dorr, of New York. After her marriage, for a decade they lived in an old Dutch manor house in Ghent, New York. In that house, the first three of her five children were born, and there her public literary life began. In 1847, he sent one of her poems, without her knowledge, to the Union Magazine, and this was her first published poem. In the following year, her first published story, \\"Isabel Leslie\\", gained a prize offered by Sartain's Magazine. Edward Everett Hale and James Russell Lowell were also among the prize winners. The Dorr family then pulled up stakes and started for the far west by way of Rutland. The intended visit turned into something far different as they built a new home, \\"The Maples\\". Prose Julia Dorr, c. 1897 Her work constantly appeared in the best publications, and her books followed each other at intervals through 1885, when the volume Afternoon Songs appeared. Her books included: Farmingdale (New York, 1854), Lanmere (New York, 1855), Sybil Huntington (New York, 1869), Poems (Philadelphia, 1871), Expiation (Philadelphia, 1873), Friar Anselmo and Other Poems (New York, 1879), The Legend of the Babouhka (New York, 1881), Daybreak (New York, 1882), Bermuda (New York. 1884), Afternoon Songs (New York, 1885). Her stories were particularly skillful in detail and plot, and in the interpretation of the New England character. A series of essays on marriage, contributed by Dorr to a New England journal under the titles \\"Letters to a Young Wife\\" and \\"Letters to a Young Husband\\" appeared in book-form without her sanction, with the title Bride and Bridegroom (Cincinnati, 1873). Her travel books, including Bermuda, were in demand by tourists. Two other graphic travel books were the result of a couple of British summers: The Flower of England's Face and A Cathedral Pilgrimage. In King's Houses was a romance for young people, its scene laid in the days of Queen Anne. Poetry The actuality of experience which occasioned the travel-sketches formed a great part of her poetry. Most of her lyrics took shape from happenings, large and small. The sonnet was her favorite verse form. Its very restrictions enticed her. \\"Whom the Gods Love\\", \\"Recognition\\", \\"Largesse\\", and \\"Awakening\\" were just a few of her sonnets. The American Civil War, in which fought her distinguished half-brothers, General W. Y. W. Ripley and General E. H. Ripley, moved her to patriotic verse. Her ode, \\"Vermont\\", was written for the centennial celebration at Bennington, Vermont in 1877; \\"The Voice of the Tower\\", for the dedication of the Ethan Allen Monument at Burlington. Dorr's poems were characterized by strength and melody, sweetness and sympathy, a thorough knowledge of poetic technique, and through all, a high purpose which rendered such work of lasting value. One of her poems was included in Emerson's 1894 anthology Parnassus. Later writing Julia Dorr, c. 1912 It is obvious by the titles of her later books that she had not anticipated them in any long look ahead. The Complete Edition of her poems –this completeness came to amuse her– was printed in 1892. Afternoon Songs had appeared seven years earlier. Afterglow followed in 1900. In her 80s, she published Beyond the Sunset, laughing at the sequence as at a pleasant joke that life had played upon her. Almost half the poems in that last little volume were written within a year and a half of her 85th birthday, but she did not stop with them. On the title page of the book she had chosen to write the words Tennyson put into the mouth of voyage-hungry Ulysses, > My purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset and the baths Of all the western > stars until I die. Much of writing in later years included letters with her friends, such as Edmund Clarence Stedman and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Influence and reception Dorr belonged by friendship and association to that New England group of poets and writers famous in American literature through the names of Longfellow, Emerson, Whittier, Holmes, and Lowell. They knew her as a workman of like temper with themselves and a woman of rare companionableness and power. The group following these, that including Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Edmund Clarence Stedman, and William Dean Howells, also knew and valued her both as friend and fellow craftsman. In his American Anthology Stedman wrote, \\"Mrs. Dorr holds a distinguished and enviable position among American women.\\" Writing of Dorr in his book, The Builders of American Literature, Francis H. Underwood remarked, \\"If one can judge from her poems, she must lead an ideal life.\\" She was represented in The Lyric Year, a collection of the best American verse of 1912, limited to 100 poems culled from many thousands submitted. Personally, her influence was that of one who has lived a life of culture and industry. She made earnest efforts to draw the attention of her countrywomen to ways of calm, domestic quiet, and to emancipate them from the thraldom of foolish fashion. The customs that avail nothing as aids to comfort and happiness she deprecated. To live the life of true culture and practical benevolence, ready to uplift to heights of delightful song, and to cheer, encourage and quietly reprove as necessity demands — this was her mission. In her own city, her social influence had been wide:- \\"When summer days were long, and she was bearing the burden and heat of the day as a young wife and mother, Mrs. Dorr's life was eminently quiet and secluded, her pen being almost her only link with the outside world. But with the autumn rest, have come to her wider fields and broader activities. In and around her beautiful home, enriched with treasures from many lands, there has grown up a far-reaching intellectual life of which she is the soul and centre. She is loved and honored in her own town, and there hundreds of women, of all ranks, turn to her for help and inspiration. The year of Mr. Dorr's death, she became the leader of a band of women who founded the Rutland Free Library, the success of which has been remarkable. Mrs. Dorr is still president of the association; and has given to the library, in memory of her husband, what is said to be the finest and most complete collection of books on Political Science to be found in New England, outside of Cambridge University. Personal life From \\"The Maples\\", her Rutland home, Dorr became involved in her community, leading the work of broadening women's interests. For 33 years, she was president of \\"The Fortnightly\\", the literary society of her church. To \\"The Maples\\" in its more than half-century of life came many authors; among them Emerson, searching the vicinity for the lost grave of his grandfather who died in the American Revolutionary War. At the Atlantic breakfast given in honor of Dr. Holmes' 70th birthday, Dorr was warned that Emerson, shadowed as he then was by loss of memory, might not know her. But the minute he saw her he exclaimed, \\"Oh, Mrs. Dorr, I shall never forget the view of Killington from your piazza!\\" Here, too, came authors' second-selves, their books, inscribed by their own hands; and authors' letters, both congratulatory and purely friendly, Longfellow's, Whittier's, Emerson's—covering many years —Dr. Holmes', the one she knew best of the Cambridge group, Stedman's, R. H. Stoddard's, his wife's, Howells'—But to name them all would be to recite a long list of the makers of American literature. Nor of American literature alone. One of the pleasantest consequences of her last public appearance at the Howells' birthday dinner was the personal touch it gave her with the English poet, William Watson. In 1884, the year of her husband's death, Dorr became the leader of a group of women who founded the Rutland Free Library. She served as president of the association, and gave to the library, in memory of her husband, what was said to be the finest and most complete collection of books on political science to be found in New England at the time, and one of the best in the English-speaking world outside of the University of Cambridge. She died January 18, 1913.

History  The title of the song appears to have been borrowed from the title of the 1934 book of the same name by Carl Carmer. It refers to a spectacular occurrence of the Leonid meteor shower that had been observed in Alabama in November 1833, \\"the night the stars fell.\\" As reported by the Florence Gazette: \\"[There were] thousands of luminous bodies shooting across the firmament in every direction. There was little wind and not a trace of clouds, and the meteors succeeded each other in quick succession.\\" One of the earliest recordings of \\"Stars Fell on Alabama\\" was by the Guy Lombardo Orchestra; Guy Lombardo's brother Carmen performed the vocals. Recorded on August 27, 1934, it was issued by Decca Records as catalog number 104. The song has been recorded by over 100 artists. Among them are: Al Bowlly, Bing Crosby (for his 1975 album A Southern Memoir), Lee Wiley, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong; Cannonball Adderley with John Coltrane; Jack Teagarden; Jimmy Buffett; Billie Holiday; Anita O'Day; Dean Martin; Kay Starr; Frank Sinatra; Doris Day; Frankie Laine; Art Tatum; Erroll Garner; Don Rondo; Kate Smith; Mel Torme; Mina; Renee Olstead; Ricky Nelson; Stan Getz; Ben Webster; Vera Lynn; Tara Nevins; the Radcliffe Pitches; Ralph Marterie; Harry Connick, Jr.; Sonny Stitt; Lizz Wright.  21st-century usage  The Marching Southerners of Jacksonville State University in Jacksonville, Alabama, perform an arrangement of the tune by previous band director John T. Finley at every home football game and exhibition. The song has become the unofficial anthem of both the Southerners and Jacksonville State University. In January 2002, the phrase \\"Stars Fell on Alabama\\" was added to Alabama's license plates,Code of Alabama: Section 32-6-54 (1951) and 32-6-54.1 (1997). The amendment removes the requirement for special-purpose plates. and the traditional \\"Heart of Dixie\\" slogan was reduced to a smaller size.

Similar to the shot put, the stone put more frequently uses an ordinary stone or rock instead of a steel ball. The weight of the stone will vary from 16 to 26 lb for men (or 8 to 18 lb for women) depending on which type of stone put event (Braemar stone or Open stone) is being contested and also on the idiosyncrasies of the event (mainly because stones in use have no standard weight). There are also some differences in allowable techniques and rules. Robert Burns was keen on stone putting and apparently left his favourite putting stone at Ellisland Farm near Dumfries. If he saw anyone using it whilst he lived there he would call \\"Bide a wee\\" and join in the sport, always proving that he was the strongest man there.Peel, Page 74 Origin of the stone put As with most aspects of the Scottish Highland games, and Scottish Highlands culture generally, a certain amount of legend has grown around the origins and antiquity of the stone put. Michael Brander, in his 1992 book Essential Guide to the Highland Games, reports on some of the stories concerning the stone put which have become traditional. He discusses what have become known to tradition as the \\"stones of strength\\" which were of two types. In one, the Clach Cuid Fir (or Manhood Stone), a very large stone of well over 100 lb is employed and the test is to be able to lift it to a certain height or place it on a wall. In the other type, the Clach Neart (or Stone of Strength), a smaller stone, variable in weight, but around 20 or 30 lb, is employed. The object is to see how far the stone could be thrown or putted.

In 1921, she founded the first anthroposophical medical clinic in Arlesheim, known until 2014 as the Ita Wegman Clinic.Arlesheim Klinik, http://www.klinik- arlesheim.ch/de/klinik-arlesheim/ She also developed a special form of massage therapy, called rhythmical massage, and other self-claimed therapeutic treatments. Early life and education Ita Wegman, as she was known throughout her life, was born as Maria Ita Wegman in 1876 in Karawang, West Java, the first child of a Dutch colonial family. Around the turn of the century, she returned to Europe (she had visited before) and studied therapeutic gymnastics and massage. In 1902, when she was 26, she met Rudolf Steiner for the first time. Five years later, she began medical school at the University of Zurich, where women were not discriminated to study medicine. She was granted a diploma as a medical doctor in 1911 with a specialization in women's medicine and joined an existing medical practice. Career Before 1900 in Berlin In 1917, having opened an independent practice, she developed a cancer treatment using an extract of mistletoe following indications from Steiner. This first remedy, which she called Iscar, was later developed into Iscador and has become an approved cancer treatment in Germany and a number of other countries,Kienle, Kiene and Albonico, Anthroposophic Medicine, Schattauer 2006 , Chapter 3 and 6 and is undergoing clinical trials in the U.S.A.National Cancer Institute, Mistletoe extracts By 1919 she had a joint practice together with two other doctors, also women. In 1920 she purchased land in Arlesheim, where she opened her own clinic, the Klinisch- Therapeutisches Institut, or Clinical-Therapeutic Institute, the next year. A number of other doctors joined the institute, which grew steadily over the next years as a first center for anthroposophical medicine. In 1922 she founded a therapeutic home for mentally handicapped children, Haus Sonnenhof, also in Arlesheim, and co-founded a pharmaceutical laboratory, Weleda, that has since grown into a significant producer of medicines and health-care products. In the following year, Rudolf Steiner asked Wegman to join the Executive Council of the newly reformed Anthroposophical Society at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland. She also directed the Medical Section of the research center at the Goetheanum. Together, Wegman and Steiner wrote what was to be Steiner's last book, Extending Practical Medicine (earlier editions were published as Fundamentals of Therapy), which gave a theoretical basis to the new medicine they were developing. The book was partly written while Wegman cared for Steiner, who was already terminally ill. Wegman founded a new medical journal, Natura, the following year. In 1936, the clinic opened a second home in Ascona, Switzerland. Shortly thereafter, difficulties between Wegman and the rest of the Executive Council flared up, and Wegman was asked to leave the Council; in addition, she and a number of supporters had their membership in the Anthroposophical Society itself withdrawn. The medical work flourished, however, and Wegman travelled extensively in support of the rapidly growing movement to extend medicine's limits; she was especially active in the Netherlands and England during this time. Wegman died in Arlesheim in 1943, at the age of 67.

Biography Lamon, born in New York City and raised in the state of New York, began studying the violin at the age of seven. She studied violin at the Westchester Conservatory of Music with Editha Braham and Gabriel Banat. Later she attended Brandeis University in Boston where she earned a Bachelor of Music degree studying violin with Robert Koff, the original second violinist of the Juilliard Quartet. From Brandeis University, Lamon left the USA to study in the Netherlands with Herman Krebbers, then the concertmaster of the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. She returned to North America in the mid-1970s to establish her career as a baroque specialist. Lamon held the position of concertmaster for and appeared in solo performances with many prestigious ensembles and orchestras in the USA and became in 1974 the first violinist to win the prestigious Erwin Bodky Award for Excellence in the Performance of Early Music. In the late 1970s, while teaching in the Early Music Department of Smith College in Massachusetts, Lamon made two guest appearances in Canada with the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra, which resulted in an invitation in 1981 offering her the position of Music Director. Lamon has resided in Toronto since 1981 and became a Canadian citizen in 1988. Under Lamon's leadership, Tafelmusik has achieved international stature and is considered one of the best ensembles in its field with recordings for various labels, including Philips, Nonesuch, CBC Records, Sony Classical and Analekta. Her solo recordings include Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, the Juno Award-winning Bach Brandenburg Concertos and the Bach Violin Concertos, among others. Lamon teaches at University of Toronto and the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. She received an honorary Doctor of Letters from York University in 1994. In 1996, she became the first recipient of the Muriel Sherrin Award which is presented by the Toronto Arts Council Foundation to artists and creators who have excelled at international initiatives in the fields of music or dance. In 1997, the Alliance Française of Toronto awarded Lamon its newly created Prix Alliance for her contributions to cultural exchanges and artistic ties between Canada and France. In September 1997, Lamon received the Joan Chalmers Award for Creativity and Excellence in the Arts for her artistic direction of Tafelmusik. In March 1999, the Canada Council for the Arts awarded her the 1998 Molson Prize in the Arts, recognizing her outstanding lifetime contribution to the cultural and intellectual life of Canada. Most recently, Lamon was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada on July 13, 2000 in Ottawa. This award honours her for her distinguished work as a baroque violinist, concertmaster, chamber musician, teacher, and Music Director of Tafelmusik. In 2014, she was made a Member of the Order of Ontario. In October 2012, Lamon announced that after 33 years of directing Tafelmusik, she would be stepping down as full-time music director after the 2013/14 season after a career of recording, performing, and touring.

It is an animated show about urban legends hosted by two animatronic puppets, Larry de Bug, a cockroach, (voiced by James Rankin) and his gooey sidekick, Maurice the maggot (voiced by Dan Redican) in Ted's Diner - a 1940s era diner setting staffed by Rosie the waitress (voiced by Jayne Eastwood, but never seen - Season One only). It was often part of The Three Friends and Jerry when it aired on Fox Family. This series, described as \\"a Twilight Zone for kids,\\" centers on the kind of myths and legends that are told as scary campfire or bedtime stories. Every episode always starts with and finishes with the phrase: \\"This is a true story, and it happened to a friend of a friend of mine.\\" and by the words of Larry, \\"Just because they never happened, doesn't mean they ain't true.\\" Animation styles and musical scoring varied within each half-hour episode, incorporating 20 different looks in the first season alone. The short stories and changing styles were specifically designed to keep viewers' attention span. Series creator Steve Schnier successfully pitched his concept of modern urban legends to YTV in 1991. In 1994, Steve teamed with executive producer John Delmage. The resulting Freaky Stories pilot premiered during YTV's \\"Dark Night 3\\" Halloween block on October 28, 1995, and the series itself premiered as a one-hour special as part of \\"Dark Night 5\\" on October 24, 1997. While most episodes were finished on digibeta, the pilot was shot on film using traditional animation techniques but completed on video. The subsequent series was digitally inked, painted and composited.

He was selected to one Pro Bowl in 1969 as a member of the Atlanta Falcons. Berry was a member of three Super Bowl teams with the Minnesota Vikings in the mid-1970s. College career Born and raised in San Jose, California, Berry played football at Willow Glen High School, where his father was a longtime head coach. He graduated in 1960 and played college football at Oregon, where he was a three-year letter winner under head coach Len Casanova. At Oregon, Berry teamed with future Pro Football Hall of Famers Mel Renfro and Dave Wilcox and led the Ducks to three consecutive winning seasons. In his junior year in 1963, Oregon's last as an independent, the Ducks beat SMU 21–14 in the Sun Bowl on New Year's Eve. (The Pacific-8 conference did not allow a second bowl team until 1975). He was named a first-team All-American after his senior season, despite being edged out as All-Pacific-8 quarterback by Craig Morton of California. In the balloting for the Heisman Trophy won by John Huarte of Notre Dame, Berry was thirteenth, just behind Joe Namath (Alabama) and Gale Sayers (Kansas). His teammates named him the outstanding player and he played in the East-West Shrine Game and the Hula Bowl. In 1985, Berry received the university's distinguished alumnus award. Berry was inducted to the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1987 and the University of Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1992. Professional career Minnesota Vikings Selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the eleventh round of the 1964 NFL Draft and by the Denver Broncos in the twenty-sixth round of the 1964 AFL Draft, Berry played his senior season at Oregon in 1964 and signed with the Minnesota Vikings in late November. Minnesota had acquired his draft rights in an off-season trade with the Eagles. Berry was out of college during the 1961 season, a de facto redshirt year. Berry played three seasons with the Vikings, the first two under head coach Norm Van Brocklin, a former Oregon quarterback, and was primarily a reserve behind Fran Tarkenton. He made his first start in 1966, a loss in the snow at home to the expansion Atlanta Falcons on December 4. Following the 1966 season, Tarkenton demanded to be traded and was sent to the New York Giants for multiple draft picks and Van Brocklin stepped down as head coach. Joe Kapp was the starting quarterback under new head coach Bud Grant in 1967 and Berry saw very limited action. In training camp in 1968, Berry was behind Kapp and Gary Cuozzo and missed the final cut in early September. Atlanta Falcons Berry was quickly picked up by the Atlanta Falcons in 1968, and Van Brocklin became the head coach after the third game of the season. Berry started 51 games for the Falcons in five seasons, through 1972, throwing for 8,489 yards and 57 touchdowns, with a passer rating of 79.2. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1969, and was traded back to the Vikings in May 1973. Second stint with Vikings Berry played for the Minnesota Vikings again for four seasons, starting in 1973. He was again the backup to Tarkenton, and Minnesota played in three Super Bowls (VIII, IX, and XI) during this second stint, all losses. Berry retired from football on the first day of 1977 training camp, July 28. Personal Berry has a daughter, Jennifer (born 1972) and a son, Michael (born 1993) and two grandchildren.

Craig (DE-201), a of the United States Navy, was named in honor of Lieutenant Commander James Edwin Craig (1901–1941), who was killed in action aboard during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. James E. Craig was launched on 22 July 1943, by Charleston Navy Yard; sponsored by Mrs. J. E. Craig, widow of Lieutenant Commander Craig; and commissioned on 1 November 1943, Lieutenant Commander Hampton M. Ericson in command. Service history The new destroyer escort departed the Charleston Navy Yard on 23 November for shakedown off Bermuda and returned to the yard on 25 December for alterations. She sailed on 4 January 1944 for Panama via the Windward Passage. In the Caribbean she joined her sister ships and on 7 January to escort two troop transports. She transited the Panama Canal on 8 January. In company with other destroyer escorts, James E. Craig steamed from Balboa, Panama, on 14 January escorting SS Azalea City to Nouméa, New Caledonia. Stopping at Bora Bora on 27 January, James E. Craig and Azalea City departed the 28th and two days later encountered a typhoon which pounded the ships with waves.

Craig departed Espiritu Santo on 13 February with three other escorts and seven merchant ships bound for Guadalcanal. Upon arrival the 16th, she began anti-submarine patrol off Lunga Point. She departed for Espiritu Santo on 23 February, escorting two merchant ships and continued her escort duty between Guadalcanal and Espiritu Santo for several weeks. On 15 March, she escorted the oiler from Espiritu Santo to a fueling rendezvous with Task Force 36, which was engaged in operations against Kavieng, New Ireland, and Emirau Island, \\"the last link in the ring around Rabaul.\\" Refueling completed the 25th, James E. Craig and Cacapon joined other escorts and tankers and returned to Espirito Santo. On 31 March, James E. Craig departed Espiritu Santo in company with Escort Division 37, including Lovelace, , and . Stopping at Tulagi in the Solomons, 2 to 4 April, they sailed the 5th for New Guinea, where James E. Craig was to see action for five months. On 26 April, James E. Craig joined a convoy of escorts and transports bound from Cape Sudest to Humboldt Bay to support the invasion of Hollandia, underway since the 22nd. The convoy arrived on 3 May; and after discharging the transports, the escorts returned to Cape Sudest the 5th. James E. Craig, now under the command of Lieutenant Commander Edward F. Andrews, steamed on 13 May on escort duty to Humboldt Bay via Aitape, arrived the 17th, and immediately joined an attack convoy bound for Wakde Airfield, Sawar Airfield and Sarmi, west of Hollandia. She returned the same day to Humboldt Bay, where she continued her patrols and escort duty. She bombarded enemy troop concentrations between Wakde and Sarmi on the 27th and returned to Cape Cretin via Humboldt Bay on the 31st. James E. Craig returned to Humboldt Bay on 6 June to prepare for the bitter Battle of Biak. With six other escorts, she accompanied the convoy and supported the landing operations on 12 June. Departing the same day, the convoy returned to Humboldt Bay the 14th; and James E. Craig continued as escort to Cape Cretin, where she arrived three days later. During the remainder of June and through July, James E. Craig continued escort and anti-submarine duties along the northern coast of New Guinea. While on ASW operations off Wakde, she conducted prolonged, successful bombardments of enemy supply depots at Sawar, 11–12 July, expending some 3,300 rounds of 3-inch and 1.1-inch shellfire. A week later, she arrived at Noemfoor Island, southwest of Biak, and escorted convoys 18 to 23 July on a triangular route from Noemfoor to Humboldt Bay via Biak. Arriving at Madang, Astrolabe Bay, on 23 July for overhaul, James E. Craig returned to Humboldt Bay to resume her escort and ASW operations. During August, she plied the coastal waters off New Guinea from Cape Cretin to Wakde; then devoted the six weeks to escort and anti-submarine patrol between Cape Cretin, Manus Island, and Humboldt Bay. On 11 October, she joined a convoy at Ulithi, then sailed for the Palaus on the 18th and arrived Peleliu two days later for ASW operations. She returned to Manus the 25th for repairs. Philippines campaign  =Attacked off Leyte= Back at Humboldt Bay on 14 November, she joined a large convoy of transports, amphibious craft, and escorts underway on the 17th for the Philippine Islands, to support the vital, Allied foothold on Leyte, established some four weeks earlier. The convoy of 75 ships and 9 escorts steamed northwestward and by dusk of the 23rd approached Leyte Gulf. James E. Craig, returning from radar picket patrol to her assigned ASW station, made radar contact with six low-flying unidentified planes approaching from the south at approximately . Soon her spotters observed \\"Jill\\" torpedo bombers out, closing at high speed. As the enemy aircraft broke into three groups in an attempt to \\"box the target,\\" James E. Craig turned left full rudder to meet the attackers; and all guns which could bear commenced firing at the aircraft, still more than out. Four of the attackers began a run and launched their torpedoes at a range of 1,000–1,500 yards to port; as the ship turned, three torpedoes passed \\"close aboard to port\\" and almost parallel to her. Meanwhile, two aircraft commenced a run from the starboard side. Approaching almost directly from out of the sunset, one dropped a torpedo within a thousand yards which broached once before settling down on its run. As James E. Craig turned hard to starboard, the torpedo passed within astern. One of the attackers passed within of the ship, was hit by starboard 20 mm gunfire, and splashed after passing over frigate . The convoy stood into San Pedro Bay, Leyte, the following day, and remained at battle stations a greater part of the day to repel enemy aircraft which attempted to bomb the convoy. That night, the convoy and escorts reformed and departed for Humboldt Bay via the Palaus. Upon arrival, James E. Craig received general maintenance and overhaul from destroyer tender through 10 December. She spent the remainder of the month escorting fleet tankers and practicing anti-aircraft and night torpedo firing drills at Padaido, Dutch East Indies, and Humboldt Bay. On 28 December, Escort Division 37 departed Humboldt Bay with a convoy of tankers and merchant ships bound for Leyte, where they arrived on 1 January 1945. =Landings on Luzon= The following day, James E. Craig stood out for Mindoro Island to join Task Group 77.2, ordered to support landing operations on northern Luzon. Enemy reconnaissance planes maintained close surveillance; and late afternoon on 4 January an enemy kamikaze penetrated defenses and struck , causing her to burst into flame. After the conflagration got out of hand, the escort carrier's commander ordered abandon ship. James E. Craig assisted in rescue operations and, later that evening, proceeded with other escorts and tankers to Mindoro. Standing into Mangarin Bay the following morning, James E. Craig commenced picket and ASW operations, which continued through the day and into the night, as the convoy departed Mangarin to maneuver off Mindoro during darkness. Designed to prevent enemy attack at night, the night maneuvers continued until the 10th, when the convoy remained at Mangarin Bay through the night. James E. Craig resumed ASW operations at the harbor entrance for several days until troublesome submarine detection equipment forced her to retire to Mangarin Harbor on 14 January. She commenced anti-aircraft patrol for ships in anchorage and on 5 February returned to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, for repairs, thence to Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, arriving on 2 March. =Escort duties= Getting underway the following day, she returned to San Pedro Bay via Kossol Roads, Palaus. Upon arriving Leyte on 10 March, James E. Craig prepared for continued escort duties between San Pedro Bay and Manila, Manus, Humboldt Bay, and Kossol Roads. From 14 March to 21 May, she operated almost continuously on escort duty, and on the 21st she departed Leyte for Lingayen Gulf. Standing into San Fernando Harbor four days later, she commenced anti- submarine and escort patrols along the coast of Luzon that continued to 13 August when she departed for Manila. Once at Manila, she resumed ASW operations to the 27th; then, as escort in company with Eichenberger, she convoyed tugs and tows en route Okinawa. An impending typhoon disrupted the convoy on 1 September; high seas and winds scattered the ships and separated tugs from their tows. After the storm abated on 2 September, James E. Craig began search and rescue operations which continued to the 9th. Further typhoon warnings caused the ships to return to Subic Bay, Luzon, where the convoy anchored the following day. Decommissioning James E. Craig remained at Subic Bay until 1 October, when she steamed for the United States via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. She arrived San Diego on 5 November and decommissioned there on 2 July 1946. She was struck from the Navy List on 30 June 1968.  Awards  James E. Craig received four battle stars for World War II service.

Following the mysterious death of the 10th Panchen Lama, the 14th Dalai Lama recognized Gedhun Choekyi Nyima in 1995. Three days later, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) abducted the Panchen Lama and his family. Months later, the PRC chose Gyaincain Norbu as its proxyAnthony Kuhn, In Tibet, A Long-Banned Buddhist Rite Takes Place, But Not Everyone’s Pleased, (24 July 2016), National Public Radio, https://wamu.org/story/16/07/24/in_tibet_a_long_banned_buddhist_rite_takes_place_but_not_everyones_pleased/ Panchen Lama. During the traditional search process, Chatral Rinpoche indicated to the Dalai Lama that all signs pointed to Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, while the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas recognize each other's incarnations. The PRC had established its own search committee, which included Chatral Rinpoche and other monks, and used a lottery system referred to as the Golden Urn. Neither Gedhun Choekyi Nyima nor his family have been seen since the abduction. Chadral Rinpoche was arrested by Chinese authorities the day after the abduction. Picture of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima before his abduction at 6 years of age (left), and a forensic image of him at 30 years of age (right), by Tim Widden Recognition and Abduction of the Panchen Lama Before his death, the 10th Panchen Lama, Choekyi Gyaltsen, had been held for 15 years as a political prisoner of China, and after his release wrote the 70,000 Character Petition to Mao Zedong on 18 May 1962, which assessed China's occupation of Tibet, explained the grievances of Tibetans, and exposed China's \\"use of routine propaganda regarding revolution, liberation, democratic reform and the so- called 'socialist paradise' as \\"pure deception\\".\\" He again was critical of Chinese policies in Tibet five days before his mysterious death. The Chinese state-run CCTV network states that three days after the death of the 10th Panchen Lama on 28 January 1989, the Premier of the State Council published its decision on how the 11th Panchen Lama would be selected based on the feedback gathered from the committee of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and monks on 30 January 1989.Goldstein 1997, p. 101 Tibetans would not consider the 11th Panchen Lama incarnation legitimate unless he were identified according to Tibetan traditional means, including a search by the 10th Panchen Lama's closest Khenpos based on dreams and omens, and a formal recognition by the Dalai Lama.Goldstein 1997, pp. 100–1 Often, the Nechung Oracle was also consulted. By 1994, five years after the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, ordinarily, the 11th Panchen Lama would have already been identified.Hilton 2000, pg. 6 The Nechung Oracle in Dharamsala had been consulted on the matter.Hilton 2000, pg. 9 The leaders of the Chinese government wanted a process under their authority. Beijing planned to use a group of monks to identify a group of candidates, not only one, and then to use the Golden Urn to randomly select one of them, and to exclude the Dalai Lama from the process altogether.Goldstein 1997, pp. 100–1 Beijing later allowed Tashi Lhunpo Monastery's Chadrel Rinpoche, the head of the search team, to communicate with the Dalai Lama in hopes that a mutually acceptable process and candidate could be accomplished. At the end of 1994, twenty-five candidates had been identified, and Chadrel Rinpoche sent the Dalai Lama detailed information on all of them; but Chadrel Rinpoche also wrote that all signs pointed to Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the true reincarnation. In February 1995, the Dalai Lama replied to Chadrel Rinpoche that his own divinations confirmed Gedhun Choekyi Nyima. According to Robert Goldstein, Chadrel Rinpoche intended to use the process that occurred in identifying Choekyi Gyaltsen, the 10th Panchen Lama, in 1949: The urn would not be used; China would be first to publicly name the choice; and then the Dalai Lama would confirm it. In March 1995, Chinese officials insisted on drawing a name from three to five slips in the urn. On 14 May 1995, the Dalai Lama preempted the Chinese's drawing of names by publicly recognizing Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th Panchen Lama.Goldstein 1997, pp. 102–6 On 17 May, the Chinese government abducted the recognized Panchen Lama. Then in November 1995 they selected a different boy, Gyaincain Norbu, using their Golden Urn lottery system. This decision was immediately denounced by the Dalai Lama. China continues to detain Gedhun Choekyi Nyima and his family in a place whose location has not been divulged to the public.Goldstein, 1997, pp. 102-6 Chadrel Rinpoche, the Panchen Lama's senior Khenpo, was also arrested on 18 May 1995, the day after Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was abducted.Senior Tibetan monk given jail term by China, (8 May 1997), https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/08/world/senior-tibetan-monk-given-jail-term- by-china.html Two years later on 8 May 1997, Chadrel Rinpoche was sentenced to six years in prison for splittism and betraying state secrets.Goldstein 1997, pg. 107 He was then incarcerated in China, re-incarcerated under house arrest in a Chinese military camp near Lhasa, and the Central Tibetan Administration reports he died of poisoning in 2011.Central Tibetan Administration, \\"Tibet: Suspicious Death of Panchen Lama Search Leader\\", 25 November 2011, https://unpo.org/article/13525 The Dalai Lama has denounced China by saying \\"the person who reincarnates has sole legitimate authority over where and how he or she takes rebirth and how that reincarnation is to be recognized.\\" \\"It is a reality that no one else can force the person concerned, or manipulate him or her,\\" \\"It is particularly inappropriate for Chinese communists, who explicitly reject even the idea of past and future lives, let alone the concept of reincarnate Tulkus, to meddle in the system of reincarnation and especially the reincarnations of the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas.\\" James Griffiths, A boy chosen as the Panchen Lama disappeared in 1995..., (21 May 2020), https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/20/asia/china-tibet-panchen-lama-dalai- lama-intl-hnk/index.html China's meddling is widely interpreted as an attempt to control the recognition process of the next Dalai Lama.

The line was opened first, in 1874, and gave the North British company access to the north bank of the River Clyde; there was a goods depot at Partick. As industry and housing developed further west the line became the stem of further branches, and in 1886 the sub-surface Glasgow City and District Railway connected through Queen Street Low Level to Stobcross. Queen's Dock closed in 1969 and freight use of the line was minimal, but part of the line has been electrified and most of it is in use in 2015 for passenger trains. History The Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway System map of the Stobcross RailwayThe Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway (GD&HR;) was opened in 1858, running from the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&GR;) at Cowlairs to Dumbarton where it joined an existing railway; together they served Balloch and Loch Lomond, and Helensburgh. The new line ran in a broad loop round the north of Glasgow and then westwards some distance north of the River Clyde. At the time the industry of Glasgow was concentrated in the central and eastern areas, and the shipping that came to the city berthed at Broomielaw; there was relatively little industrial and marine activity on Clydeside west of the city, and the GD&HR; did not serve those areas. The GD&HR; was absorbed by the E&GR; in 1862 and the E&GR; was itself absorbed by the larger North British Railway (NBR) in 1865. The Queen's Dock As shipping activity increased, larger and more numerous vessels required to berth in Glasgow and it was obvious that they could not be accommodated in the central area. In 1872 the Clyde Commissioners started work on a new dock at Stobcross, on the north shore of the Clyde to the west of the city. The new dock was formally opened on 18 September 1877 by the Lord Provost of Glasgow, and he announced that by permission of Queen Victoria the new dock was to be known as The Queen's Dock. The new facility was obviously going to make considerable changes to commodity flows in Glasgow, and the North British Railway set about constructing a branch line to serve the dock. The NBR obtained an authorising Act in 1869; it was amended in 1870 and 1871 for financial reasons. The line was to run from Maryhill on the GD&HR; southwards, turning east past the Royal Lunatic Asylum (later converted and now Gartnavel Hospital), then running south-east through Partickhill to the dock. Even though the route avoided the main city area, considerable difficulty and expense arose from the necessary land acquisition. The Forth and Clyde Canal was diverted over a length of 586 yards (535 m) and the route used for the new railway line. The original estimate for the line had been £84,400 but £140,000 was spent on land acquisition and legal fees alone. In 1868 the NBR observed that there was little sign of the Stobcross being started, and introduced a Parliamentary Bill to abandon the line. However, in fact they did proceed with it. Extensive siding accommodation was provided at Stobcross. The importance to the city of free rail access was such that the rival Caledonian Railway was granted running powers over the line by Parliament; the Caledonian got access to the NBR system from Sighthill via Springburn. The siding complex at Stobcross was 70 feet (21 m) above the level of the quayside lines and a steeply graded connecting line was built; the Caledonian got joint ownership of that short section. The G&SWR; also applied for access but their line was to run west from Dunlop Street across St Enoch square, continuing along the bank of the Clyde, and this scheme was refused by Parliament. The line opens The Stobcross line opened on 20 October 1874, for goods and mineral traffic only. The route from the NBR line out of Queen Street was extremely circuitous, but for the time being any more direct routing was unthinkable. The NBR went to considerable lengths to make the exercise of the Caledonian Railway's running powers as inconvenient as possible; this included various forms of delay for supposed operational reasons, and the refusal to allow stabling of Caledonian locomotives at Stobcross, resulting in much wasteful light running. However the NBR and the Caledonian each had their own goods yard at Partick. The Whiteinch estate It was not just berthing of ships that was moving down river; by this time a small industrial complex had established at Whiteinch. Shipbuilding and joinery works were prominent. The area was rural and remote at the time, and the construction of the Stobcross line presented an obvious opportunity, and on 1 July 1872 the Whiteinch Railway was authorised; at the same time the Whiteinch Tramway was authorised, which distributed wagons within the estate area. The Whiteinch Railway joined the Stobcross line near Crow Road; the junction was named Whiteinch Junction and the line opened on 29 October 1874. The Whiteinch Railway ran down as far as the Dumbarton Road, and the tramway operated an east-west distributor route south of the main road. On 1 January 1897 the Whiteinch Railway was made a passenger line, with a new connection with the Yoker line at Whiteinch West Junction; the passenger service finished on 2 April 1951. The branch was used as a depot for the electrification works trains when the North Side Electrification was in progress in the late 1950s. Knightswood and Cowdenhill There were numerous pits and quarries near Knightswood not far from the line. In 1875 a branch line from what became Knightswood South Junction was opened in a northerly arc to Jordanhill Brickworks, and the branch was extended back to the north later to reach Knightswood Brickworks and the Western Colliery at Cowdenhill. In later years the location of pits and factories changed and the configuration of this branch was changed accordingly. Yoker and Clydebank Just as Stobcross was a response to the westerly movement of the focus of industry, so that process continued, and from 1870 Clydebank became the centre of a complex of heavy industry. It too was not close to the original GD&HR; line and the nominally independent Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway was opened on 1 December 1882 to serve it. The line ran west from Yoker Junction, just west of Whiteinch Junction, on a straight alignment just north of the Whiteinch line. There were passenger stations at Partick, Yoker and Clydebank. For the time being this was an isolated section; Stobcross was not a passenger station. The Glasgow City and District Railway During all this time, as heavy industry, shipbuilding and quay facilities were moving west, the NBR's North Clyde network continued to be accessed only from Cowlairs via Maryhill, a long way round. On 15 March 1886 the Glasgow City and District Railway opened. It was a subsurface line running east to west through the centre of Glasgow, from College in the east, through a new Low Level station at Queen Street, to Stobcross which was now on a through line instead of a dead end. The line proved immensely popular with passengers, and goods traffic could now be brought in by a shorter route. A short branch was opened on the same day from Partick Junction (on the original Stobcross line) to a terminus at Hyndland. On 1 August 1886 a spur was opened from Knightswood South Junction to Knightswood North Junction, forming a south to west chord and enabling through running from the City and District line towards Milngavie and Dalmuir. Clydebank to Dalmuir Remote from the Stobcross branch, the missing link from Clydebank to Dalmuir was filled in 1897, from which time the NBR network was complete, with two linked routes from Queen Street High and Low Levels to Dalmuir and beyond, with the facility to cross over through Anniesland. At the same time the junction at Jordanhill was made into a triangle by the opening of the north to west chord there: \\"Partick West Chord\\". The Caledonian Railway and its satellites The North British Railway had established a commanding network serving increasing areas of residential development and heavy industry on the north side of the Clyde, based on the original Stobcross line of 1874. The rival Caledonian Railway still had the smallest of toeholds on the north bank, until in the years 1894 to 1896 the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway opened, from the Caledonian main line east of Buchanan Street, arcing round in a similar northerly arc to the Stobcross line, then turning west to reach Dumbarton. This was progress for the rival company, but it was not enough. In the years 1895 to 1896 the Glasgow Central Railway opened, running from Rutherglen on the main line out of Glasgow Central, to Stobcross and curving round to Maryhill. Now the Caledonian too had a direct line through the centre of the city offering convenient east-west transits for passengers. Stobcross and the Queen's Dock was now reached from the city by the Caledonian as well. From 1923 In 1923 the main line railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" by the Railways Act 1921 into four large groups. The North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the Caledonian Railway was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). For the time being the competition continued. In 1948 the Government once again reorganised the railways, this time taking them into state ownership, nationalisation. Both the North Clyde networks were now part of British Railways, Scottish Region. The train services continued much as before, but changing social patterns, the decline of heavy industries and the rise of efficient bus services, meant that the steam trains running through the city in poorly ventilated tunnels were increasingly unpopular. A modernisation plan was developed in 1955, and this led to electrification of the passenger operation of most of the former NBR network. Most of the old Caledonian routes were to close to passengers. The new passenger service was inaugurated in 1960. The Hyndland branch of 1886 was closed to passengers (on 5 November 1960), and a depot for the new electric trains was created there, in use until 1989, when the depot at Yoker was opened. The Caledonian Railway route to Rutherglen was closed in 1964. However it was revived when in 1979 the Argyle Line opened, using most of the earlier alignment from Stobcross eastwards. The Queen's Dock had closed to maritime use in 1969, and from 1982 the area was regenerated by infilling the docks; the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre now stands on the site. The extensive sidings at Stobcross to serve the dock have all been removed and occupied by the Exhibition Centre and other developments. The railway connection to the Queen's Dock was severed much earlier, in 1980, when Maryhill Park Junction signal box was burnt down, and the section of the original Stobcross Railway from Maryhill Park Junction to Knightswood South Junction was disconnected. There had been workers trains from Clydebank to Springburn over the route until 1959, and also empty passenger stock trains from Cowlairs to Queen Street Low Level for trains originating there. The section of the Glasgow Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway from Cowlairs to Maryhill had also been closed to local passenger trains since 1961, and only the through West Highland Line trains and goods traffic used it for many years. However, from 1993 a new local passenger service has been resumed, from Glasgow Queen Street to Maryhill, and since 2005 it has been extended to Anniesland on the former Stobcross Railway. The physical junction at Maryhill Park Junction has been moved to the west of the River Kelvin viaduct. A typically 30 minute interval passenger service operates. Topography The locations on the Stobcross Railway were: * Maryhill Park Junction divergence from the GD&HR; line; * Knightswood South Junction; convergence of the line from Westerton; * Great Western Road; opened 15 March 1886; renamed Anniesland 1931; * Hyndland North Junction; divergence of west curve towards Yoker; also known as Partick North Junction, and Whiteinch North Junction; * Hyndland East Junction; convergence of line from Yoker; also known as Partick East Junction, and Whiteinch East Junction; * Hyndland; opened 7 November 1960; ** Hyndland (first station); opened 15 March 1886; closed 7 November 1960; * Hyndland Junction; convergence of line from Hyndland (first station); also known as Partick Junction; * Partick; opened 1 December 1882; renamed Partickhill 1953; moved south of Dumbarton Road 17 December 1979 to co-locate with the Glasgow Subway station, and renamed Partick; * Yorkhill; opened 2 February 1885; closed 1 January 1917; reopened 1 February 1919; closed 1 April 1921; * Stobcross; not a NBR passenger station; goods station and connection to Queen's Dock, and later end-on junction with Glasgow City and District Railway and Glasgow Central Railway. The line today Almost all of the route is still open as of September 2015: most of it forms part of the North Clyde Line electric commuter network and the remainder at the northern end is used by Maryhill Line DMU services between and . Network Rail began work in the summer of 2015 to reinstate the former Knightswood South Junction connection near Anniesland to allow through running once more between Hyndland & Partick and Maryhill via Kelvindale. The only parts of the route that are no longer in use are the goods yards at Partickhill and the Queen's Dock and the old terminus station at Hyndland.

The Adventurer name first started out a four seat high performance sports coupe concept car,\\"Chrysler Stylist Brings Out Two Experimental Models.\\" Popular Mechanics, January 1954, p. 113. but then was changed to be DeSoto's special, limited- production, high-performance model, similar to the more luxurious and exclusive Chrysler 300. While in production, the Adventurer was DeSoto's top- trim level car, replacing the DeSoto Custom, and offered only as a hardtop coupe in 1956. The model range grew when the coupe was joined by a convertible in 1957, and a four-door hardtop and sedan in its final year of 1960. 1956 Introduced in 1956 as a sub-series of the top level DeSoto Fireflite series, the Adventurer was originally marketed as a limited production two-door hardtop, and available in a white/black/gold color scheme only. The first Adventurer came with a hi-output 341 cubic inch Hemi V8, dual exhausts and custom appointments and trim. Standard trim included dual outside side mirrors, gold wheel covers, radio, electric clock, padded instrument panel, windshield washers, full instrumentation, safety door locks,http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/DeSoto/1956_DeSoto/1956_DeSoto_Brochure/1956%20DeSoto-12.html and heavy duty suspension. A total of 996 cars were sold in its first year. Specifications *Wheelbase = *Length = * Width = * Height = * Leg-room-front = * Transmission = PowerFlite automatic 1957 1957 DeSoto Adventurer For 1957, the Adventurer received Chrysler's forward look design along with other divisional cars. A convertible also joined the two-door hardtop, and again color choices were limited to the black-white and gold color theme. The car debuted in December, 1956 as a hardtop, and to rave reviews, foremost among them was Mechanix Illustrated Automobile Editor Tom McCahill who proclaimed the DeSoto as being the best styled of all of Chrysler's makes for 1957. A convertible debuted in February 1957. Most Adventurers had dual headlights as a standard, which became available for DeSoto as an option mid-year. Like the 1956 car, the 1957 Adventurer was powered by Chrysler's high output V8, which was now up four cubic inches to . Equipped with dual four barrel carburetors, the engine developed one horsepower per cubic inch displacement. For 1957, 1,950 units were produced, including 300 convertibles. 1958 The 1958 Adventurer was an update to the all-new styling that car received in 1957. Along with the annual trim changes, the car also received a new grille with a mesh insert, plus dual headlights with slightly revised openings. The cars debuted at the Chicago auto show in January 1958. The Hemi engine was no longer available, instead a 361 cubic inch wedge head was used. DeSoto offered fuel injection (produced by Bendix Corporation), the units proved troublesome and were an expensive option so very few Adventurers were sold with them. Those not equipped with the unit received the dual-quad carburetors. The shortened model year, combined with the effects of the 1958 recession dropped Adventurer production down to 432 units, 350 hardtops and 82 convertibles, a 78 percent drop in sales compared to 1957. However DeSoto itself was in the midst of a sales free-fall, and all series production was off brand-wide. 1959 1959 DeSoto Adventurer Restyled for 1959, the DeSoto's look began to take on more traits of the up-market Chrysler. The new model year was introduced in October 1958. The Adventurer again was limited in its color schemes, and came with the most standard features of any DeSoto automobile (though the radio became an option). The car was powered by the wedge head 383 V8, tuned to at 5,000 R.P.M. 687 units, 590 hardtops and 97 convertibles, were produced for 1959, up from 1958, but not significantly enough to help stem the forty percent drop to DeSoto's divisional sales. New was the standard swivel out seats. 1960 swiveling front seats 1960 DeSoto Adventurer For its final year, the Adventurer lost its convertible but gained a four-door hardtop and sedan. Instead of being a limited edition model, the Adventurer was the top trim model range for the two series DeSoto line-up for 1960. Ram induction was reintroduced on models with the quad-four carburetor. This was also the only year that car came in a variety of colors instead of its traditional white-black and gold combination. Total sales for the Adventurer line posted its best effort with 11,597 models produced. But rumors began circulating that Chrysler was ready to kill the DeSoto and customers reacted by buying other makes of cars. Also hurting DeSoto was its design, nearly identical to the Chrysler Windsor, except for the grille and the blade styled tail lights. Consumers purchased the Windsor without the fear that it would be an orphan like the DeSoto was soon bound to be. New was dual speed rear window defoggers, a drivers seat with five more inches added to the seat back, the Hiway Hifi that played RCA Victor 45rpm records, and Unibody construction. In Desoto's final year of 1961, dealers would offer a single car line, available in two body styles. Chrysler announced the end of the DeSoto in November 1960, with production lasting just long enough to deplete supplies of DeSoto trim on hand. Cultural references Popular comic book/TV show/video game characters Sam & Max traditionally drive a black-and-white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer hard- top squad car, with their \\"Freelance Police\\" logo emblazoned on the doors. It was replaced by an open-top model in the later Telltale series for gameplay reasons; in-game it is implied that Max caused some unspecified accident to happen to the original car, resulting in the loss of its roof or its total replacement. It is also the car driven by Lola in the Lola comic strip by Todd Clark. The comic strip Shoe has made use of a 1959 Desoto \\"Firedome\\" model, based on the Adventurer. A 1956 DeSoto was driven by James Stewart's character Scottie in the 1958 film Vertigo.

He served as the Gauleiter in the Gau of Magdeburg-Anhalt and was the Reichsstatthalter of the Free States of Anhalt and Brunswick Military Career First Loeper became an Officer Candidate (Fahnenjunker) in Pioneer Battalion 2 in Spandau and then completed training at the Neiße Military School. Already in 1904 he was made a leutnant, and after various other commands, eventually an oberleutnant in 1912. Then came his transfer to the Magdeburg Pioneer Battalion 4, where he took over command of a searchlight platoon. After the First World War broke out, Loeper was then deployed between 1914 and 1918 at the Western Front as a hauptmann and company chief of Pioneer Battalion 19. He was wounded several times. For the service in the World War I, he was decorated with the both classes of Iron Cross, both classes of the Mecklenburg-Schwerin Military Merit Cross, Frederickscross, Prussian Service Cross and Wound Badge in Black. After the war ended, Loeper became leader of a Freikorps that saw deployment both in the Baltic States and the Ruhr area. In this capacity, he was involved in quelling the Spartakus uprising. With the founding of the Reichswehr, Loeper became company chief of Pioneer Battalion 2. In 1923, he worked as an Instructor at the Pionierschule in Munich, and got to know Adolf Hitler. Loeper took part in the Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923 and aimed at getting the Pionierschule to fall in and follow Hitler's orders. After the putsch failed, Loeper was discharged from the Reichswehr in 1924 for his participation. Nazi Career Loeper joined the NSDAP (Nazi Party) in 1925. He moved to Dessau in Gau Anhalt and became the Ortsgruppenleiter (Local Group Leader) there. In the same year he became the Gau's Deputy Business Manager. In September 1926 he advanced to Organization Leader, Propaganda Leader and Deputy Gauleiter. Finally, on 1 April 1927, he became Gauleiter of the now enlarged Gau Anhalt-Provinz Sachsen-Nord, succeeding Gustav Hermann Schmischke. The Gau was renamed Gau Magdeburg-Anhalt on 1 October 1928.Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume II (Georg Joel - Dr. Bernhard Rust), R. James Bender Publishing, 2017, p. 236, . Loeper gave himself over to building the Party up in his Gau, and fought against the Bauhaus, which was located in Dessau at that time. In a letter in 1930 he wrote \\"as the Bauhaus belongs to Jerusalem and not to Dessau\\". Loeper later had a decisive part in stripping this institution of its assets. In 1928, Loeper became a member of the Anhalt Landtag. In January 1930, Loeper became leader of the Nazi Party's personnel office at the party headquarters in the Brown House in Munich. In September 1930, Loeper was also elected a member of the Reichstag for electoral district 10, (Magdeburg). Anhalt had a Nazi Land government as early as May 1932 headed by Alfred Freyburg, and in that year Loeper published the first issue of the Nazi newspaper Trommler and established the publishing house Trommler-Verlag. In 1932 he instituted at Schloß Großkühnau (in Dessau) the first Stammabteilung and the Führerschule of the Reichsarbeitsdienst. On 15 July 1932 came Loeper's appointment as Landesinspekteur for Middle Germany- Brandenburg. In this position, he had oversight responsibility for his Gau and three others (Brandenburg, Halle-Merseburg & Ostmark). This was a short-lived initiative by Gregor Strasser to centralize control over the Gaue. However, it was unpopular with the Gauleiters and was repealed on Strasser's resignation in December 1932. Loeper then returned to his Gauleiter position in Magdeburg- Anhalt.Dietrich Orlow: The History of the Nazi Party: 1919-1933 (University of Pittsburgh Press), 1969, pp. 273; 295. . After the Nazis' nationwide seizure of power in 1933, Loeper was appointed Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governor) for the Free States of Brunswick and Anhalt. He set up office in Dessau. In May he also was named an honorary Gau leader of the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Also in 1933, the city of Magdeburg made him an honorary citizen, a distinction of which he was posthumously stripped in 1946. On 9 February 1934, he was officially enrolled in the SS and appointed an honorary SS-Gruppenführer. In September 1935, he became a member of the Academy for German Law (Akademie für Deutsches Recht). On 23 October 1935, Loeper died of neck cancer. At the funeral, Hitler himself delivered the eulogy. His burial took place in the Napoleon Tower (Napoleonturm) in Mildensee near Dessau. Various honours flowed from the region. The Magdeburg borough of Ottersleben named a street Hauptmann-Loeper-Straße after him. After the Nazi régime fell, though, such honours quickly disappeared.

It is meant to mean explicitly discarded information.  Example  Consider the following phrase: \\"the best horse at the race is number 7\\". The information carried is very small, if considered from the point of view of information theory: just a few words. However let's assume that this phrase was spoken by a knowledgeable person, after a complex study of all the horses in the race, to someone interested in betting. The details are discarded, but the receiver of the information might get the same practical value of a complete analysis.  Meaning as proposed by Nørretranders  Effective communication depends on a shared body of knowledge between the persons communicating. In using words, sounds, and gestures, the speaker has deliberately thrown away a huge body of information, though it remains implied. This shared context is called exformation. Exformation is everything we do not actually say but have in our heads when, or before, we say anything at all - whereas information is the measurable, demonstrable utterance we actually come out with. If someone is talking about computers, what is said will have more meaning if the person listening has some prior idea what a computer is, what it is good for, and in what contexts one might encounter one. From the information content of a message alone, there is no way of measuring how much exformation it contains. In 1862 the author Victor Hugo wrote to his publisher asking how his most recent book, Les Misérables, was getting on. Hugo just wrote \\"?\\" in his message, to which his publisher replied \\"!\\", to indicate it was selling well. This exchange of messages would have no meaning to a third party because the shared context is unique to those taking part in it. The amount of information (a single character) was extremely small, and yet because of exformation a meaning is clearly conveyed.

'Kamata' by name with Kamatapur as capital. The exact time when the change was made is uncertain. But possibly it had been made by Sandhya (c1250-1270) as a safeguard against mounting dangers from the east and the west. Its control on the eastern regions beyond the Manah (Manas river) was lax.\\" and after the fall of the Khen dynasty in 1498 CE. The first of the Koch kings, Viswa Singha and then his sons, Nara Narayan as the subsequent king and Chilarai as the general, soon occupied the western portion of the erstwhile Kamarupa Kingdom as well as some regions of south Assam. The dynasty forked for the first time into two major branches that controlled Koch Bihar and Koch Hajo. Koch Bihar became a vassal of the Mughals, whereas Koch Hajo came under Ahom control and was subsequently absorbed. Koch Bihar became a princely state during British rule and was absorbed after Indian independence. The third branch of this dynasty at Khaspur disappeared into the Kachari kingdom. History Historical background After the fall of the Pala dynasty of Kamarupa, the kingdom fractured into different domains in the 12th century. In the east, the Chutiya kingdom emerged on the north and south bank of Brahmaputra River. The Ahom kingdom which emerged in the south bank later occupied and absorbed the larger Chutiya kingdom. To their west was the Kachari kingdom. Sandhya, a ruler of Kamarupanagara (Guwahati) moved his capital further west to present- day North Bengal in the middle of the 13th century and the domain he ruled over came to be called Kamata kingdom. The buffer region, between the eastern kingdoms and Kamata was the domain of the Baro-Bhuyans chieftains. Alauddin Husain Shah of Gaur defeated Nilambar of Kamata in 1498, occupied the region and placed his son, Daniyal in charge. Within a few years, the Baro-Bhuyans, led by one Harup Narayan of the Brahmaputra valley defeated, captured and executed Daniyal, and the region lapsed into Bhuyan confederate rule. Meanwhile, an alliance was formed when a Mech chief, Haridas Mandal, married two sisters Hira and Jira, the daughters of Hajo, a Koch chief. Haridas Mandal's domain was in Chikna Mountains situated between the Sankosh River and the Champabati River in Kokrajhar district of Undivided Goalpara district of Assam. Bisu, who was to later become Viswa Singha, was born to Haridas Mandal and Hira.\\"...it becomes clear that Biswa Singha's father was a Mech and mother was a Koch and both the tribes were \\"rude\\" and \\"impure\\", hence non-Aryan or non-Hinduised.\\" Later, Brahman pundits created a legend that lord Siva was the father of Viswa Singha to accord legitimacy to the ruler. Beginning of the Koch dynasty Cooch Behar Palace Origin of the Koch dynasty, based on the Darrang Raja Vamsavali According to J N Sarkar, Viswa Singha belonged to one of the dominant Koch tribes, which were a collection of Mongoloid tribes.. \\"Minjahuddin found the features of the Koch, Mech, and Tharu tribes similar to a south Siberian tribe. Bryan Hodgson (JASB) xviii (2) 1849, 704-5, classes the Koches with the Bodo and Dhimal tribes. Buchanan agrees. Dalton takes them to be Dravidian. But Risley thinks they represented a fusion of Mongoloid and Dravidian stock, with the later predominating. According to Waddell Mongoloid type of Koches predominated in Assam.\\" When Bisu, as Viswa Singha was then known, acquired power, the Brahmins found him out and conferred on him the status of the Kshatriya varna; and the subsequent interaction with Brahmans lead to the Hinduization of his tribesmen. The earliest known ancestor of Viswa Singha was his father Haria Mandal, from the Chiknabari village in Undivided Goalpara district, the head of the twelve most powerful Mech families. Haria Mandal was married to Jira and Hira, daughters of a Koch chief named Hajo, after whom Koch Hajo was named. Viswa Singha was the son of Haria Mandal and Hira.. According to some Koch chronicles, a son of Haria Mandal, Chandan, became the king in 1510 followed by Vishwa Singha. According to other chronicles, Chandan was an earlier king. Consolidation of power Viswa Singha sought the alliance of tribal (Koch, Garo and Mech) chiefs\\"...Dimarua, Panbari, Beltola, Rani, Moirapur, Borduar, Bholagram, Pantanduar, Chaigaon, Bogaduar, Bongaon, Baku, Luki, Hengerabari. Biswa Singha received the allegiance of these states including those of Darrang, Karaibari, Atiabari, Kamtabari, and Balrampur.\\" against the more powerful Baro-Bhuyans and began his campaign around 1509. Successively, he defeated the Bhuyans of Ouguri, Jhargaon, Karnapur, Phulaguri, Bijni and Pandunath (Pandu, in Guwahati).\\"It is stated that Biswa Singha subjugated the Bar Bhuyan then the Saru Bhuyan and then the Bhuyan of Ouguri. After this he defeated the Daivajnya Chuti Bhuyan and thereafter Kusum Bhuyan, Dihala Bhuyan, Kalia Bhuyan and the Bhuyans of Jhargaon, Kabilash Bhuyan, the Bhuyans of Karnapur, Phulaguri, and Bijni, and finally Pratap Rai Bhuyan of Pandunath, Guwahati. The Gurucaritas also mention Gandhanva Rai, the Bhuyan of Banduka and Sriram Khan of Sajalagram.\\" He was particularly stretched by the Bhuyan of Karnapur, and could defeat him only by a stratagem during Bihu. After subjugating the petty rulers, he announced himself the king of Kamata bounded on the east by Barnadi river and on the west by the Karatoya river in the year 1515. He moved his capital from Chikana to Kamatapur (also called Kantapur) which is just a few miles southeast of the present-day Cooch Behar town. Viswa Singha's two sons, Naranarayan and Shukladhwaj (Chilarai), the king and the commander-in-chief of the army respectively, took the kingdom to its zenith. Nara Narayan made Raghudev, the son of Chilarai, the governor of Koch Hajo, the eastern portion of the country. After the death of Nara Narayan, Raghudev declared independence. The division of the Kamata kingdom into Koch Bihar and Koch Hajo was permanent. Nara Narayan was impressed by the bhakti saint Srimanta Sankardeva who became a member of his court in the last three years of his life and who established a Satra in the kingdom.

Parikshit Narayan was sent to Delhi for an audience with the Mughal Emperor, but his brother Balinarayan escaped and took refuge in the Ahom kingdom. The region to the east of Barnadi and up to the Bharali river was under the control of some Baro-Bhuyan chieftains, but they were soon removed by the Mughals. In 1615 the Mughals, under Syed Hakim and Syed Aba Bakr, attacked the Ahoms but were repelled back to the Barnadi river. The Ahom king, Prataap Singha, then established Balinarayan as a vassal in the newly acquired region between Barnadi and Bharali rivers, and called it Darrang.

Kamalnarayan established eighteen clans of Koch families that took hereditary roles in the state of Khaspur and who came to be known as Dheyans (after Dewan).

They both eventually come to terms but Lynette tells Bree that she is going to be honest with the lawyer. This disappoints Bree who had expected Lynette to lie. Bree decides that she does not want this to ruin their friendship and makes Lynette a muffin basket. When Lynette sees proof that Bree has been abusive, she cannot help but deny that this actually happened since Andrew is very vindictive. While talking with Andrew and luring him with a car, Lynette learns the truth and has made her decision. At the court interrogation, Lynette lies stating that Bree is a very good mother and friend and never would endanger her children.

Under Estonian law it is the legal successor to the pre–World War II Estonian Orthodox Church, which in 1940 had over 210,000 faithful, three bishops, 156 parishes, 131 priests, 19 deacons, two monasteries, and a theological seminary; the majority of the faithful were ethnic Estonians. Its official name is the Orthodox Church of Estonia. The current primate of the church is Stephanos, Metropolitan of Tallinn and all Estonia, elected in 1999. History Saint Catherine's Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church in Võru. Little is known about the history of the church in the area until the 17th and 18th centuries, when many Old Believers fled there from Russia to avoid the liturgical reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow.In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonia was a part of the Russian Empire. In the 1850s a rumour spread that the Orthodox Church promised to provide everybody who converted to Orthodoxy a piece of land of their own somewhere in Russia. Some 65,000 Estonian peasants were converted to the Orthodox faith in the hope of obtaining land, and numerous Orthodox churches were built.\\"Eesti Apostlik- Õigeusu Kirik, Ajalugu (=History) (In Estonian)\\" (www.eaok.ee) Later, when the rumour turned out to be a hoax, a great part of the new Orthodox peasants returned to the Lutheran Church. In the late 19th century, a wave of Russification was introduced, supported by the Russian hierarchy but not by the local Estonian clergy. The Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky in Tallinn and the Pühtitsa (Pukhtitsa) convent in Kuremäe in East Estonia were also built around this time.  Autonomy under the Moscow Patriarchate  After the Republic of Estonia was proclaimed in 1918, the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, St. Tikhon, in 1920 recognised the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church (EAOC) as being autonomous (Resolution No. 1780), postponing the discussion of its autocephaly. Archbishop Alexander Paulus was elected and ordained Metropolitan Alexander of Tallinn and All Estonia (et), head of the EAOC.Historical background of Orthodoxy in Estonia, Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate website. Prior to this, Soviet Russia had adopted a Marxist–Leninist ideology which held as an ideological goal the elimination of religion and its replacement with state atheism.Lenin, Vladimir Ilyich. \\"The Attitude of the Workers' Party to Religion\\", Proletary, No.45, May 13 (26), 1909. In response, Patriarch Tikhon had excommunicated the Soviet leadership in 1918, leading to a period of intense persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church.Pospielovsky, Dimitry V. The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime, 1917–1983, ch.2, St Vladimir's Seminary Press, Crestwood NY, 1984. In April 1922, Tikhon was imprisoned,\\"Glorification of St Tikhon, the Apostle to America\\", Orthodox Church in America website. and the Estonian clergy lost contact with the Moscow Patriarchate.  Transfer to the Ecumenical Patriarchate  In September 1922 the Council of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church petitioned the Patriarch of Constantinople, Meletius IV, to (1) transfer control of the Estonian church from the Russian Orthodox Church to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and (2) clarify the Estonian church's canonical status. In 1923 the Patriarchate of Constantinople issued a tomos (ecclesiastical edict) which brought the EAOC under Constantinople's jurisdiction and granted it autonomy, but not full autocephaly.Ringvee, Ringo. \\"History of the controversy\\", Estonica – Encyclopedia about Estonia, Estonian Institute.Toom, Tarmo. \\"Estonia, Orthodox Church in\\", The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, p.226-8, Wiley-Blackwell Publishing, 2011. Before 1941, one-fifth of the total Estonian population (who had been mostly Lutheran since the Reformation in the early 16th century when the country was controlled by the Teutonic Order) were Orthodox Christians under the Patriarchate of Constantinople. There were 158 parishes in Estonia and 183 clerics in the Estonian church. There was also a Chair of Orthodoxy in the Faculty of Theology at the University of Tartu. There was a Pskovo-Pechorsky Monastery in Petseri, two convents—in Narva and Kuremäe, a priory in Tallinn and a seminary in Petseri. The ancient monastery in Petseri was preserved from the mass church destructions that occurred in Soviet Russia. World War II In 1940, Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union, whose government undertook a general programme of the dissolution of all ecclesiastical independence within its territory. From 1942 to 1944, however, autonomy under Constantinople was temporarily revived. In 1945, a representative of the Moscow Patriarchate dismissed the members of the OCE synod who had remained in Estonia and established a new organisation, the Diocesan Council. Orthodox believers in occupied Estonia were thus subordinated to being a diocese within the Russian Orthodox Church. Just before the second Soviet occupation in 1944 and the dissolution of the Estonian synod, the primate of the church, Metropolitan Aleksander, went into exile along with 21 clergymen and about 8,000 Orthodox believers. The Orthodox Church of Estonia in Exile with its synod in Sweden continued its activity according to the canonical statutes, until the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991. Before he died in 1953, Metr. Aleksander established his community as an exarchate under Constantinople. Most of the other bishops and clergy who remained behind were deported to Siberia. In 1958, a new synod was established in exile, and the church was organized from Sweden. Inactive In 1978, at the urging of the Moscow Patriarchate, the Ecumenical Patriarch declared the charter (tomos) of the Church, as granted in 1923, inoperative. The church ceased to exist until the breakup of the Soviet Union, when divisions within the Orthodox community in Estonia arose between those who claimed that the Moscow Patriarchate has no jurisdiction in Estonia and those who wished to return to the jurisdiction of Moscow. The dispute often took place along ethnic lines, as many Russians had immigrated to Estonia during the Soviet occupation. Lengthy negotiations between the two patriarchates failed to produce any agreement. Reactivation In 1993, the synod of the Orthodox Church of Estonia in Exile was re-registered as the legal successor of the autonomous Orthodox Church of Estonia, and on February 20, 1996, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I formally reactivated the tomos granted to the OCE in 1923, restoring its canonical subordination to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. This action brought immediate protest from the Estonian-born Patriarch Alexei II of the Moscow Patriarchate, which regarded the Estonian church as being part of its territory. The Patriarch of Moscow temporarily removed the name of the Ecumenical Patriarch from the diptychs. In this difficult situation, the Orthodox Church of Estonia received help and support from the Finnish Orthodox Church, especially from Archbishop Johannes (Rinne) of the Archdiocese of Karelia and All Finland and Auxiliary Bishop Ambrosius (Risto Jääskeläinen) of Joensuu. The Ecumenical Patriarchate decided that Archbishop Johannes and Bishop Ambrosius as well as pastor Heikki Huttunen from Espoo should be available to give help in the reconstruction of the newly restored church. Archbishop Johannes would temporarily act as a deputy metropolitan (1996–1999) of the Estonian Autonomous Church.Metropolitan Johannes:\\"Viron ortodoksisen Kirkon tie uuteen itsenäisyyteen\\" Aamun Koitto Number 19/2007 p.18-20 An agreement was reached in which local congregations could choose which jurisdiction to follow. The Orthodox community in Estonia, which accounts for about 30 percent of the total population, remains divided, with the majority of faithful (mostly ethnic Russians) remaining under Moscow. From a U.S. Department of State report released in November 2003, about 20,000 believers (mostly ethnic Estonians) in 60 parishes are part of the autonomous church, with 150,000 faithful in 31 parishes, along with the monastic community of Pühtitsa, paying allegiance to Moscow. International Religious Freedom Report 2003 In 1999, the church received a resident hierarch, Metropolitan Stephanos (Charalambides) of Tallinn who had formerly been an auxiliary bishop under the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Metropolitan of France.

Education and career Malar Balasubramanian graduated from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland in 2001 and completed a pediatric residency program at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh in June, 2004. She practiced medicine in India for a time before returning to her home in the Blue Ash suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio two or three weeks prior to her mother's homicide. She was planning to move to St. Louis to begin a fellowship in pediatric cardiology. Initial Story of Homicide On July 27, 2005, Malar Balasubramaniam's brother and sister received an email from her. Parts of this email read, \\"Once I realized that I won't succeed the way I wanted to in life and decided to end it, I realized that I couldn't leave you two alone with Amma\\" (\\"Amma\\" means \\"mother\\") and \\"I'm sorry for what I did to Amma, I am, but I'm glad she's not here to hurt us anymore.\\" She told police she wanted to kill herself, but did not want to leave her mother behind to harm her brother and sister. She also told police she left a six-page letter in the car that explained why she killed her mother. She was indicted Friday, July 29, 2005 on one count of aggravated murder. First Court Appearance Malar Balasubramanian was arraigned on charges of aggravated murder before Hamilton County, Ohio Judge Dennis Helmick on August 8, 2005. She did not enter a plea, so Judge Helmick entered a \\"Not Guilty\\" plea for her. She was jailed without bond. Plea Change On Friday, September 16, 2005, Malar Balasubramanian changed her plea to \\"not guilty by reason of insanity\\". Lawyers representing Dr. Balasubramanian said the new plea was supported by evidence that suggested the then 28-year-old doctor was distraught, injured and under the influence of drugs. The evidence included an e-mail police believed Dr. Balasubramanian transmitted to her brother and sister near the time of their mother's death. In the message, she tells her siblings she did not want to leave them alone with their mother and that she was \\"very sorry to have done this to you.\\" She also wrote that she had considered hurting herself many times and had finally decided she could not go on because she was a \\"second-rate\\" friend, sibling and doctor. Final Plea Change and Sentencing On Monday, January 30, 2006, Dr. Malar Balasubramanian changed her plea to guilty of a reduced charge of \\"involuntary manslaughter.\\" She was sentenced to 10 years in jail by Judge Dennis Helmick. She was released on December 18, 2012 on judicial release. The judicial release kept her under the probation until the December 2017 however due to her good conduct she was given an early release from the probation. Death On Wednesday, February 15, 2017, she was found in her apartment in Upper Manhattan where she had hung herself.

Backed on various tracks by his former Soft Boy mates Kimberley Rew, Matthew Seligman and Morris Windsor, Hitchcock confessed satisfaction at being able to record an album with only his own artistic goals to cater to, whereas previously he had been compelled to write for the band. Vince Ely of the Psychedelic Furs, Knox and Pat Collier of the Vibrators, Gary Barnacle and Thomas Dolby also make guest backing appearances. The sessions were recorded from June 1980 to January 1981 at the Barge, Alaska Studios in Waterloo, London, and Music Works with Pat Collier producing (\\"with a little help from Matthew Seligman\\"). The ensuing set falls somewhere between the harder edged style of The Soft Boys and Hitchcock's more reflective and melodic work with The Egyptians a few years later. Released in May 1981, the album included ten original Hitchcock compositions. Key tracks include concert favourites \\"Acid Bird\\" and the rocker \\"Brenda's Iron Sledge\\", plus some of Hitchcock's patent comedy in \\"Do Policemen Sing?\\" and \\"The Man Who Invented Himself\\". The album's working title \\"Zinc Pear\\" is retained in the cover art, although the title eventually settled on refers instead to the early Soft Boys recording \\"Black Snake Diamond Rock\\". (Another working title had it listed as \\"The Perfumed Corpse\\".) The cover art and calligraphy are Hitchcock's work (credited as \\"R.R.H.\\"), and the inner sleeve of the LP featured an original, cosmic Hitchcock pen-and-ink comic titled The Enchanted Sewer. The album has subsequently re-emerged on CD three times, with a mixture of bonus titles, pulled from B sides and outtakes. The 2nd and 3rd CD issues include a different mix of \\"The Man Who Invented Himself\\" sans horns, the original master having been lost in the intervening fourteen years. In 2017, Hitchcock sporadically performed the album in-full live alongside Yo La Tengo. Track listing All songs written by Robyn Hitchcock.

Smith is an American musician, instrument-builder, and printmaker often associated with the Jewelled Antler collective. Born in Fullerton, California and based in San Francisco and, more recently, Los Angeles, he has been musically active since the mid-1990s. His main instrument is guitar, both acoustic and electric, although other instruments, including the hurdy-gurdy, bouzouki, fretted spike fiddles, and assorted ethnic instruments, have been incorporated into his work. Smith’s music tends to range from dense, orchestrated pieces to sparse solo excursions on electric guitar and is improvised as often as composed. His music has drawn elements from psychedelic rock, traditional folk music, soundtracks, free jazz, and modern composers, and tends to be contemplative and somewhat mournful. Some of his records feature elaborate packaging, woodcut and linocut prints, and handmade chapbooks. Throughout his career Smith has recorded for a number of independent labels such as Important Records, Soft Abuse, Catsup Plate, Root Strata, Immune Recordings, Last Visible Dog, Jewelled Antler, Darla Records, and Emperor Jones.

The game was included in the Sega Genesis Classics collections on Steam and other platforms in 2010. It was also included on the Sega Genesis Mini in North America and Sega Mega Drive Mini in PAL regions. It is similar in gameplay to Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole, blending role-playing video game, action-adventure and platform video game elements in much the same way.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. The game is played from an isometric viewpoint. Players can move freely, jump, and push objects. They can execute simple sword slashes, use four magic elements in different combinations, and use items for various effects. Gameplay is a mix of action, puzzle solving, and platforming for the most part, with the usual role-playing staples like towns, shops, equipment, and spellcasting. The player controls Sir David as he travels through an assortment of dungeons, battling creatures such as \\"slime\\", solving puzzles to advance and saving those who were kidnapped. An auto-map feature keeps the focus on action and single-room puzzles, rather than mazes or labyrinths.  Plot  Sir David is invited to visit Green Row after a recent journey. He has not been there for a long time and was eager to return. However, the king informs David that townspeople have been disappearing. The king asks him to search for the missing people. After finding a hidden stairway in the graveyard, he discovers a large dungeon of many floors underneath the town. In the dungeon, as he begins to find the missing people, he gradually learns the story of an evil wizard named Ragno Roke, who was angered by the queen's rejection of his marriage proposal. As revenge, Lord Roke has planned to use the kidnapped townspeople as a sacrifice to reawaken the evil demon Ramiah, sealed long ago in the dungeon. As David descends, he passes through a town of goblins, and a guild of wizards who have been operating in the dungeon. At the end of the game, David confronts both Roke and Ramiah. At this point the townspeople have been rescued, but Roke tells David that his own life would be sufficient revive Ramiah and sacrifices himself, bringing Ramiah to life for a final battle with David. After a victory, David leaves on horseback.  Reception  Mean Machines Sega praised the graphics and unique mixture of gameplay elements. They criticized that the game is often too easy and dull, and compared it unfavorably to Beyond Oasis (referred to by its European title, The Story of Thor) for longevity, but nonetheless gave it a very positive assessment, calling it \\"A superlative arcade adventure with great playability.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the graphics, but all but one of them gave the game an overall negative assessment, saying that the perspective severely hinders visibility, the combat is clunky, the lack of story makes the game less involving and creates difficulty figuring out where to go next, and there is too much of an emphasis on puzzles. A reviewer for Next Generation said that the game design reflected Treasure's experience with action games, but that the non-action elements such as the puzzles and storyline are overly shallow, and the isometric perspective creates control difficulties. He concluded, \\"Light Crusader is still one of the more exciting and graphically pleasing Genesis titles that has come out recently, but this is by no means a RPG.\\" GamePros The Unknown Gamer commented that the graphics and music are impressive in parts, but that the game is less challenging and complex than most RPGs, and that the player character maneuvers poorly, \\"with nowhere near the range or fluidity of movement of Ali in Beyond Oasis.\\" However, he concluded, \\"In the end, Light Crusader gets a passing grade because of some cool bosses and interesting puzzle challenges.\\" Hobby Consolas commended the pseudo-3D isometric visuals, gameplay, presentation and sound, stating that \\"Light Crusader fills an important void in the Mega Drive's role-playing game's library; the one that goes from pure role to adventure and nothing else.\\"  Notes   References   External links  * Light Crusader at GameFAQs * Light Crusader at Giant Bomb * Light Crusader at MobyGames Category:1995 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Sega video games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Single- player video games Category:Treasure (company) games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Aki Hata Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Virtual Console games Category:Windows games ","title":"Light Crusader"},{"id":"4245566","text":"Auriscalpium is a genus of mushrooms typifying the family Auriscalpiaceae.  Etymology  Auriscalpium is a compound of the Latin, auris, \\"ear\\"; and scalpo, \\"I scratch\\", generally meaning ear pick. The term was originally applied as a specific epithet by Linnaeus in 1753, viz. Hydnum auriscalpium and changed in 1821 to vulgare when S.F. Gray recognized the cone-inhabiting fungus as a new genus, named after its type species, Auriscalpium vulgare. Tautonyms, such as \\"Auriscalpium auriscalpium\\" are illegitimate under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.  Taxonomy  The genus includes the following species: * A. andinum * A. barbatum * A. dissectum * A. gilbertsonii * A. luteolum * A. umbella * A. villipes * A. vulgare  Description  Members of this genus are characterized by in part by rough- walled, amyloid spores that are produced on pendant spines, hence it is considered to be a tooth fungus. The type species, A. vulgare, is a common, easily identified fungus in the Northern Hemisphere found fruiting exclusively on mature, fallen, often buried conifer cones. Its wiry, long hairy stipe is topped by an eccentrically placed, shaggy pileus bearing the pendant, flexible, spore-bearing spines. The entire fructification resembles and perhaps could be used as an ear pick (see etymology above). Other species in the genus do not occur on cones or lack the eccentric pileus on a long stalk. According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), the genus contains eight widely distributed species.

They were constructed for King Frederick the Great of Prussia from 1771 to 1775. History The building, which stands to the west of Sanssouci Palace, serves as a complement to the Picture Gallery, which lies to the east. Both buildings flank the summer palace. The chambers replaced an orangery, which had been built at that site in 1745 on plans by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff and held the terraces' potted plants during the winter months. Ramps, on which the tubs were taken in and out, serve as reminders of the building's original use. Master builder Georg Christian Unger was commissioned to turn the orangery building into a guesthouse. The building's basic elements were left alone, as were its size and floor-to-ceiling french doors. The most obvious change was the addition of a cupola on the middle section. The similarities between the architecture of the New Chambers and that of the Picture Gallery are such that the both buildings can be mistaken for the other. Description Interior The real alteration occurred in the interior, where seven guest rooms and two ballrooms were created. The building is a highpoint of the late style of Frederican Rococo, even though Neoclassical style was already largely set as the prevailing taste of the period. The guest rooms were decorated differently with lacquered, painted, or inlaid cabinets, whose costly inlays of native woods decorated the entire wall from the ceiling to the floor. For paintings, the guest rooms have views of Potsdam, which document the town's design under Frederick the Great and were specially commissioned for the guesthouse by the king. The Jasper Room View from the Jasper Room towards the Ovid Gallery In the middle of the building, under the cupola, lies the largest room, the Jasper Room. The ballroom's walls are decorated with red jasper and grey Silesian marble. The same colors are found in the floor design. The ceiling painting Venus mit ihrem Gefolge (Venus with her Retinue) was created in 1774 by Johann Christoph Frisch. Decorated panels from both antiquity and the 18th century were attached to the background of red jasper. The Ovid Gallery The second, large ballroom, located in the eastern part of the New Chambers is the Ovid Gallery, decorated in the style of French mirrored rooms. On the long side of the room is a mirror stretching almost to the ceiling, across from which, on the garden side, are French doors. Frederick asked for the walls to be decorated with gilded reliefs of the liaisons of the ancient gods, which had been told of by the Roman poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses. The room's rich decoration comes from the workshop of the sculptors and brothers Johann David Räntz and Johann Lorentz Wilhelm Räntz. World Heritage Site Since 1990 the palace and garden of Sanssouci including the New Chambers has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site, called Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.

The steel stringer bridge carries the Route 2 expressway, and also crosses over Interstate 91 (which runs parallel to the river). the bridge had an average daily traffic of 29,200. One of the centerpieces of Hartford's Riverfront Recapture project, it features a wide pedestrian promenade and access to the rest of the riverfront park area as well as to Constitution Plaza. The bridge makes up a section of the East Coast Greenway, a system of trails connecting Calais, Maine to Key West, Florida.  History  In 1950, the Bulkeley Bridge upstream was very congested with traffic, primarily because it was the only bridge that led to downtown Hartford, so it was planned to build a bridge just downstream, called the State Street Bridge. In 1955 they renamed this planned bridge as the Founders Bridge. In the same year, the Greater Hartford Bridge Authority was created to help with this bridge's planning, along with the Putnam Bridge and the Bissell Bridge. The bridge opened on December 27, 1957 and was put under the designation of CT 2. Tolls were removed about the time the bridge was connected to I-91 and I-84. In the late 1980s the bridge was considered for rebuilding to accompany a riverfront plaza being planned in the area. This led the state to rebuild the bridge in 1994 to add lanes, a large sidewalk, and path connections to East Hartford and Hartford. This rebuilding also eliminated the hazardous, congestion-prone connections to and from I-91 to the south, as these ramps had been made redundant by the toll-free Charter Oak Bridge replacement span. In 2001, a walkway was completed to link the path across Columbus Boulevard to Constitution Plaza.

Pomeroy went to Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut and graduated from the Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He became an associate professor at the same institution in 1912, and was one of the founders of the Williamsburg Hospital, Brooklyn. He was elected President of the Kings County Medical Society in 1916. Pomeroy developed his technique of tubal ligation but never reported or published it. His associates, Bishop and Nelms, presented the procedure and results four years after his death at a medical meeting in 1929 and published it the following year. Its simplicity and effectiveness made the Pomeroy procedure a common choice for female sterilization that is still being used today. The “Pomeroy” procedure is performed on each fallopian tube where a knuckle is created, tied with catgut, and the tube at the apex of the knuckle is severed.  References  * Bishop E, Nelms WF.

At the end of the year, he was selected to play in the Chicago College All-Star Game, Senior Bowl, and the North-South Shrine Game, where he was voted the outstanding player of the game. Professional career Philadelphia Eagles Bielski was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round with the ninth overall pick of the 1955 NFL Draft, becoming the highest-drafted running back from Maryland. During his first years, he made a team record two 50-yard field goals. In 1958, he was converted into an end. After the 1959 season, the Eagles left him off their list of players who were exempt from the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft.

Baltimore Colts In 1962, Bielski played as a placekicker and backup tight end. In 1963, he retired at the end of the season. In a nine-year career he had 107 receptions for 1,305 yards, 229 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. He also kicked 58 extra points and 26 field goals.

During her years of research into romantic love experiences, she obtained thousands of personal testimonies from questionnaires, interviews, and letters from readers of her writing, in an attempt to support her hypothesis that a distinct and involuntary psychological state occurs identically among otherwise normal persons across cultures, educational level, gender, and other traits. Tennov emphasized that her data consist entirely of verbal reports by volunteers who reported their love experiences. About Dorothy Tennov was born in Montgomery County, Alabama. She received her bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and a Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut. She was a professor of psychology at the University of Bridgeport for twenty years. In addition to being a professor of psychology she was also a student of the philosophy of science. She had three sons: Randall Hoffman (d. Nov. 19, 1994), Ace Hoffman and Daniel Hoffman. Since 1986 she lived in Millsboro, Delaware, where she lectured at the local senior learning academy and worked as a volunteer at the nursing home. She was passionate about music, especially classical. She could play the piano, which she did in a local church. She volunteered at the community theatre, Possum Point Players. Tennov died in Harbeson, Delaware at the age of 78 in 2007.Cf.

Among her other writings were a prize-winning play about life in a nursing home, reviews of books on scientific subjects, presentations at scientific meetings, and essays. Her television credits included a PBS interview with the late French novelist and essayist, Simone de Beauvoir and appearance in a 1998 BBC documentary, The Evolution of Desire.

He played college football at the University of Illinois from 1944 to 1947 and professional football in the National Football League for the Detroit Lions from 1948 to 1954. He earned trips to the Pro Bowl after the 1951 and 1953 seasons. He was also selected as a first-team All Pro player four consecutive years from 1951 to 1954. At times weighing as much as 350 pounds, Bingaman was the heaviest player in the NFL during his playing career. He later worked as an assistant coach for the Detroit Lions from 1960 to 1964 and for the Miami Dolphins from 1966 to 1969. Early years Bingaman was born in 1926 in McKenzie, Tennessee, moved to Indiana, and attended Lew Wallace High School in Gary, Indiana. College football Bingaman enrolled at the University of Illinois and played college football at the tackle position for the Fighting Illini football team from 1944 to 1947. He was the starting right tackle for the 1946 Illinois Fighting Illini football team that won the Big Ten Conference championship, was ranked #5 in the final AP Poll, and defeated #4 UCLA in the 1947 Rose Bowl. Professional football player Bingaman was selected by the Detroit Lions in the third round (15th overall pick) of the 1948 NFL Draft, signed with the Lions in June 1948, and played for the team, principally at the middle guard position on defense, for seven years from 1948 to 1954. He appeared in 78 NFL games and was selected as a second-team All Pro in 1950 and a first-team All Pro in 1951 (AP), 1952 (UP), 1953 (AP, UP), and 1954 (AP, UP, TSN). He was also chosen to play in the Pro Bowl after the 1951 and 1953 seasons. He was a member of the Lions' NFL championship teams in 1952 and 1953. In August 1954, he weighed in at 349-1/2 pounds, with the Lions having to use the scale at a grain elevator to capture his weight. According to one account published in 1960, he was \\"the biggest man who ever played professional football\\". At the end of the 1954 season, Bingaman announced that he was retiring at age 29, noting that it was \\"getting tougher every year to get in shape.\\" Coaching career After retiring as a player, Bingaman took a job working in public relations for Goebel Brewing Company in Detroit. He also owned a bar in Detroit. He testified in a 1957 drunk driving case against former teammate Bobby Layne that he had served Layne six or seven scotch and waters, but nevertheless believed that Layne \\"was very capable of driving.\\" Layne was found not guilty. Bingaman also testified that the Scotch he served had \\"practically no alcoholic proof,\\" prompting one Detroit columnist to write, \\"Greater love hath no man than he should ruin his business for a friend.\\" In 1959, he sold his bar, and in 1960 he was hired as an assistant coach by the Detroit Lions. He replaced Buster Ramsey as the Lions' defensive line coach under head coach George Wilson. He served for five years as the Lions' defensive line coach, leading a group that became known as the Fearsome Foursome (Roger Brown, Alex Karras, Darris McCord, and Sam Williams) and was acknowledged as one of the best defensive lines in the NFL. After the Lions compiled a 7–5–2 record in 1964, team owner William Clay Ford, Sr. fired five assistant coaches, including Bingaman. In February 1966, after spending 1965 working as an NFL scout, Bingaman was hired as an assistant coach by the Miami Dolphins. He rejoined his former boss, George Wilson, who took over as the Dolphins' head coach one week earlier. In January 1967, Bingaman rejected an offer from Joe Schmidt to return to the Lions, opting remain with George Wilson in Miami. On December 7, 1969, he collapsed on the sidelines during a game against the Denver Broncos. He had no pulse or heartbeat for three minutes and had to be revived with a shot of adrenaline injected into his heart. He was diagnosed as having suffered \\"an irregularity of the heart-beat which caused him to go into temporary shock.\\" After the 1969 season, George Wilson was fired by the Dolphins and replaced by Don Shula. In February 1970, Shula offered Bingaman \\"a position involving special assignments.\\" He spent the year as a special assistant, scouting college players for the Dolphins. Family and death Bingaman was married in 1949 and divorced in 1956. His wife alleged in the 1956 divorce proceedings that Bingaman \\"beat her, neglected her and made her feel unwanted.\\" He later remarried, and he and his second wife, Betty, had a son, Lester Bingaman III. Bingaman suffered from weight issues after retiring as a player. In 1963, he lost 86 pounds in four months, reducing to 225 pounds. He suffered congestive heart failure in early 1968 and began dieting anew. He then collapsed on the sideline of a Dolphins' game in December 1969.

The set was recorded at the Marquee and the tapes cleaned up for release at Alaska Studios with minor drop-in overdubs. The gig was also videotaped and appeared on VHS with a few additional numbers, interspersed with several studio recordings available through their promo videos. The material selected for this album includes titles ranging through Hitchcock's back catalogue, from Soft Boys songs (\\"Kingdom Of Love\\", \\"The Face Of Death\\") through his first solo album (\\"Acid Bird\\", \\"Brenda's Iron Sledge\\") and up to the recently released Fegmania! (\\"Heaven\\", \\"My Wife and My Dead Wife\\"). The live recording captures the new band just it was defining its sound and fairly documents the highlights of Hitchcock's live set and musical focus in the mid-1980s. The cover features a painting by Hitchcock depicting airborne fish, jellyfish and an array of ducks and chickens. As with a number of his albums, Hitchcock handwrote the liner notes. The album title is taken from the lyric of the song \\"Listening to the Higsons\\", the penultimate track on the album. Hitchcock has stated that this lyric comes from mishearing a Higsons song with the lyric \\"Gotta let this heat out.\\" 1 The Midnight CD issue adds \\"Egyptian Cream\\", \\"The Fly\\", and a staple of his live sets, the Soft Boys' \\"Only the Stones Remain\\", as does the 1995 Rhino reissue.

Information about the origin and reign of the Kalabhras is uncertain and scarce. Their proposed roots vary from southeast region of modern Karnataka, Kalappalars of Vellalar community, to Kalavar chieftains. The Kalabhra era is sometimes referred to as the \\"dark period\\" of Tamil history, and information about it is generally inferred from any mentions in the literature and inscriptions that are dated many centuries after their era ended. According to Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Kalabhras were largely overthrown in the 5th century, as new power centers led by Chalukyas and Pallavas arose.Southern Indian kingdoms, Encyclopaedia Britannica (2017) In contrast, Upinder Singh states that Shivaskandavarman rise in the 4th century, as evidenced by inscriptions, show Kalabhras were not in power at that time near rivers Penner and Vellar (close to Kaveri). The Kalabhras dynasty had ended for certain by the last quarter of 6th century when Simhavishnu consolidated his rule up to the Kaveri river, south of which the Pandyas by then were already in power.  Identification  The origin and identity of the Kalabhras is uncertain. One theory states that they were probably hill tribes that rose out of obscurity to become a power in South India. Other theories state that they were probably from north of Tamil-speaking region (modern southeast Karnataka), or on etymological grounds may have been the Kalappalars of Vellala community or the Kalavar chieftains. According to Kulke and Rothermund, \\"nothing is known about the origins or tribal affiliations\\" of the Kalabhras, and their rule is called the \\"Kalabhra Interregnum\\". They are reviled in texts written centuries later, particularly by Tamil Hindu scholars. This has led to the inference that the Kalabhra rulers may have ended grants to Hindu temples and persecuted the Brahmins, and supported Buddhism and Jainism during their rule. However, the textual support for these conjectures is unclear. In support of their possible Jaina patronage, is the 10th-century Jain text on grammar which quotes a poem that some scholars attribute to Acchuta Vikkanta, a Kalabhra king. A non-Tamil language Buddhist text Vinayaviniccaya by Buddhadatta was composed in the 5th-century Tamil region. According to Shu Hikosaka, Buddhadatta in this Pali language text mentions \\"Putamarikalam in the Chola country\\". According to Karl Potter in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Buddhist philosophy from 360 to 650 AD, multiple scholars place the 5th-century Buddhadatta in the Chola kingdom near Kaveri river. According to Arunachalam, the Pali manuscripts of this text includes the name Acutavikkante Kalambakulanandane and therefore he states Acutavikkante must have been a Kalabhra king. However, the oldest surviving Vinayaviniccaya manuscript in Pali does not have that name, it has Kalabbha. This could be Kalabhra. According to Burton Stein, the Kalabhra interregnum may represent a strong bid by non-peasant (tribal) warriors for power over the fertile plains of Tamil region with support from the heterodox Indian religious tradition (Buddhism and Jainism). This may have led to persecution of the peasants and urban elites of the Brahmanical religious traditions (Hinduism), who then worked to remove the Kalabhras and retaliated against their persecutors after returning to power. In contrast, R.S. Sharma states the opposite theory and considers \\"Kalabhras as an example for peasant revolt to the state\\" – with tribal elements, albeit around the 6th century.; All these theories are hampered by the fact that there is a \\"profound lack of evidence for the events or nature of Kalabhra rule\\", states Rebecca Darley. 8th-century Velvikudi grant inscription A much-cited and discussed epigraphical evidence for the existence of Kalabhras is the 155-lines-long 8th-century Velvikudi grant copper plate inscription of Nedunjadaiyan. It was created at least 200 years after the end of the Kalabhras. It opens with an invocation to Shiva and many lines in Sanskrit written in Grantha script, followed by Tamil written in Vatteluttu script. Loaded with myth and exaggerated legends, the inscription has the following few lines about a Kalabhra king and his relatively quick end by Pandya king Kadungon (lines 39–40, translated by H. Krishna Sastri): 8th Century Velvikudi grant that mentions Kalabhras. The inscription then recites the generations of Pandya and Chola kings who followed the victorious Kadungon, and finally to king Nedunjadaiyan who ruled in the year of the inscription (c. 770 CE). The copper plate records that a Brahmin complainant said that the land grant which was given to his ancestors before Kalabhras \\"ignobly seized it\\" has not been returned so far after numerous generations (lines 103–118). The king sought evidence of past ownership, which he was provided, and thereafter the king restored the grant to the complainant. The inscription ends in Sanskrit with verses from Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism, followed by the engraver's colophon. This inscription has been assumed to be an accurate historical record by some scholars, interpreted to affirm that Kalabhras existed for some period, they conquered some or all parts of the Pandyan kingdom, they seized lands belonging to Brahmin(s) and were defeated by the Pandyas (Pāṇṭiya). Some scholars dismiss the Kalabhra interregnum as for all practical purposes \\"a myth\\". The passing mention of Kalabhras in some records have led to a number of theories for the identity of the Kalabhras. T. A. Gopinath Rao equates them with the Mutharaiyars and an inscription in the Vaikunta Perumal temple at Kanchi mentions a Mutharaiyar named as Kalavara- Kalvan. M. Raghava Iyengar, on the other hand, identifies the Kalabhras with the Vellala Kalappalars. Based on the Velvikudi plates inscription above, R. Narasimhacharya and V. Venkayya believe them to have been Karnatas. K. R. Venkatarama Iyer suggests that the Kalabhras might have emerged from the Bangalore-Chittoor region early in the 5th century. Numismatics A study of unearthed coins of that era show on the two sides of each coin, a range of Brahmi inscriptions in Prakrit language and images. Typically the coins show tiger, elephant, horse and fish icons. In \\"rare specimens\\", states Gupta, one finds an image of a seated Jain muni (monk) or the Buddhist Manjushri, or a short sword or the Swastika symbol. Other coins of this era have images of Hindu gods and goddesses with inscriptions in Tamil or Prakrit. According to Gupta, these use of Prakrit language on the coins may reflect the non-Tamil origins of Kalabhra. Other scholars are skeptical of the coin's dating and interpretation, the origins of the coins and the impact of trade, and the rareness of Jain and Buddhist iconography. According to Timothy Power – a scholar of Middle East and Mediterranean archaeology and history, coins and texts attest to an on-going trade between the Mediterranean, Middle East and South Indian ports such as Muziris until the 5th century, but then suddenly there is no mention of Indian ports in the Mediterranean texts around mid-6th century. This \\"dark age\\" may be related to the conquest of Kalabhras over Tamilakam in the 6th century. This period of violence and the closure of trading ports probably lasted about 75 years, around the first half of the 6th century.  Religion and literature  The religious affiliation of Kalabhras is unknown. According to Peterson theory, the Kalabhras likely patronised the Sramana religions (Buddhism, Jainism, Ajivikas). More particularly, states Peterson, the Kalabhras may have supported the Digambara sect of Jainism and that they \\"supposedly\\" suppressed the Vedic-Brahmanical traditions that were well established in the Tamil regions by the 3rd century CE. During their patronage, states Peterson, Jain scholars formed an academy in Madurai and wrote texts in Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, and Tamil. These include classics such as the Tirukkural, the Tamil epics, long and short devotional poems. Some of these texts \\"paint a picture of dialogue and mutual tolerance\\" between the various Indian religions in the Tamil country, according to Peterson. Other scholars disagree that these are Jain texts, or that the authors of these texts that praise the Vedas, the Brahmins, Hindu gods and goddesses were Jains. According to F. E. Hardy, the palace ceremony of Kalabhras was dedicated to a Vishnu or Mayon (Krishna) temple. This supports the theory that they may have been Shaivite and Vaishnavite.Veermani Pd. Upadhyaya Felicitation Volume by Veermani Prasad Upadhyaya Their inscriptions include the Hindu god Murugan. King Achyuta worshipped Vaishnava Tirumal.Buddhism in Tamil Nadu: collected papers By G. John Samuel, Ār. Es Śivagaṇēśamūrti, M. S. Nagarajan, Institute of Asian Studies (Madras, India)  End of the dynasty  It is unknown as to how the Kalabhras rule ended. However, a multitude of evidence affirms that Simhavishnu – the Pallava king had united the Tamil regions, removed Kalabhras and others, consolidated his kingdom from south of the Krishna river and up to the Kaveri river by c. 575 CE. To the south of Kaveri, the Pandyas were already in power at that time. This is attested by the numerous inscriptions dated from the 6th century and thereafter, as well as the Chinese language memoirs of the Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang who visited the Tamil region about 640 CE along with other parts of the Indian subcontinent. Xuanzang describes a peaceful cosmopolitan region where some 100 monasteries with 10,000 monks were studying Mahayana Buddhism, Kanchipuram was hosting learned debates with hundreds of heretic Deva (Hindu) temples but no Buddhist institutions. Xuangzang makes no mention of the Kalabhras.

The Polish forces were led by General Juliusz Rómmel. Prelude The German aggression was anticipated by the Poles from the spring of 1939, when Poland refused to join the Axis against the Soviet Union (see Polish Soviet War of 1919-1920). Poland’s strategy during the forecasted war would be to withstand the initial German attack and trigger France and Great Britain to declare war on Germany, and, afterwards, to execute a fighting retreat to the Romanian Bridgehead. Polish General Juliusz Rómmel was given command of the Łódź Army and to buy time to finish the mobilization of his own army, he led three divisions in the direction of the border. He believed that only through mobility and continuous resistance (\\"fighting for every village\\"), the German advance could be slowed enough to finish mobilization of his own army. The headquarters of the army were in the city of Łódź. The reason for the late mobilization was pressure from the French and the British not to mobilize. As of 29 August 1939, the Poles re—started the mobilization against advice from Paris and London (see Jabłonków Incident, 25 August 1939). Germany's political blunder The German Army attacked on September 1, 1939. Given their overwhelming military superiority in terms of numbers and equipment, and the strategic advantage of having the Poles surrounded on three sides (West from mainland Germany, North from East Prussia and South from the former Czechoslovakia), they hoped for a quick and relatively bloodless victory. Some modern historians repudiate the idea that the Blitzkrieg was first used in the invasion of Poland (see ). Adolf Hitler thought the French and British military leaders were incapable of even pushing the pencil to declare war in the event of Germany invading Poland. He was wrong. On September 3, 1939, both countries declared war on Germany, but they failed to provide any meaningful support (see Western betrayal), and the only Allied attack (the Saar Offensive) did not result in any diversion of German troops. The taking of Łódź: the Polish blunder After the initial ambushes worked (Battle of Mokra), the Germans gained momentum and easily defeated the rear units of the Łódź Army (still in the process of mobilization). Łódź had fallen. The three divisions sent to the border were cut off and ceased to exist. This created a domino effect. Because Łódź had fallen, the victorious tank brigade and the supporting infantry soldiers had to withdraw from Piotrkow Trybunalski. This exposed the flank of the Kraków Army and they and the fully mechanized 10th Cavalry Brigade of Stanislaw Maczek had to head towards Lviv. This withdrawal from southwestern Poland in turn forced a withdrawal from northern Poland and left units under the de facto command of General Kutrzeba (Battle of Bzura river) stranded west of the Vistula river. Even the units that did successfully withdraw, for the most part, did not reach either the Romanian Bridgehead nor the Hungarian border crossing because on September 17, 1939, Soviet troops took over that very bridgehead and cut off the routes of escape. Only 60,000 to 80,000 Polish soldiers escaped German, Soviet, or Slovak capture or the need to hide to continue the fight as underground soldiers. Polish counterattack The Germans advanced too fast for the units of the Polish Army to be in a position to counterattack, or for other armies to encircle the Germans by forcing their spear heads into a small narrow corridor between Łódź and Warsaw. The only major Polish offensive action occurred during the Battle of Bzura river marshes also known as the Battle of Kutno (township). Aftermath All of Poland fell completely under the control of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and the Slovak Republic on October 6, 1939. By 1940 the city of Łódź was renamed Litzmannstadt and became an important industrial city for the German war machine. Munitions and uniforms were manufactured in the newly established Ghetto Litzmannstadt by Jewish slave labor. Jews from Poland, Germany, Benelux and Czechoslovakia as well as Roma people from Austria were brought to live and work there in appalling conditions. While most of them were taken for extermination in the Nazi death camps, more than 70,000 survived until the summer of 1944. But the Soviet move forward stopped and in August 1944 those survivors were also killed by the Nazis. At the end of the war Łódź was taken by the Soviet Army on January 17, 1945, without substantial damage to the city. Only 877 Jews survived to the moment of liberation. Tens of thousands of ethnic Poles were expelled from the city. In 1939, at least 10,000 Poles were expelled. A concentration camp was built for the children of the ethnic Poles. Later, the dwellings of the Poles were taken over by the ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union. 300,000 Jews and 120,000 ethnic Poles died during the Nazi occupation.

It was released in 1986. Most of the album was recorded at Alaska Studios and Berry Street, but two tracks, \\"The President\\" and \\"Lady Waters & The Hooded One\\", were live recordings made for the BBC, with overdubs recorded on BBC Mobile and at Alaska. The album title derives from the song \\"Airscape\\", which has been cited several times by Hitchcock as a favourite among his own compositions, and a live rendition was tagged on to later CD editions. \\"Airscape\\" concerns his \\"favourite beach\\", Compton Beach on the Isle of Wight, which also provided a backdrop for the cover shots. He was inspired by learning about the erosion of the cliffs, and imagining the ghosts of people who had walked the cliffs centuries ago now suspended over the water. The song \\"The President\\" makes reference to Ronald Reagan's visit to Bitburg, where members of the Waffen-SS were buried. The song \\"Raymond Chandler Evening\\" is an homage to the world- weary novels of mystery writer Raymond Chandler.

It was fought between the forces of the Polish Piotrków Operational Group under Gen. Wiktor Thommée and the German 10th Infantry Division. In the effect of a successive delaying action, the Polish forces managed to regroup and withdraw eastwards while at the same time inflicting heavy losses on the opposing unit. However, their victory was only a temporary setback for the Nazi invasion of Poland. Prelude Due to the strategic errors made by Gen. Juliusz Rómmel, the commander of the Łódź Army, the Polish units that were to form a defensive wedge against the German assault towards Warsaw were dislocated too close to the German border. Because of that, the Piotrków Operational Group, along with the rest of that army's units, entered contact with enemy forces already on September 1 and lost the chance to successfully support the Kraków Army and Poznań Army, defending the areas on both flanks. Also, the German superiority in mobile units meant that the Polish forces had it difficult to break off the enemy and regain strategic initiative. The chaos in Polish ranks was enlarged by the fast pace of German advance and the fact that general Rómmel abandoned his army and left for Warsaw. The command was taken over by the commanding officer of the Piotrków Operational Group, general Wiktor Thommée. Opposing forces To enable regroupment of the dispersed forces of the Łódź Army, Gen. Thommée ordered all the units to move to the forests in the area of the towns of Stryków and Głowno. The Polish forces included Wołyńska Cavalry Brigade (along with the remnants of the badly-damaged 21st Vistula Uhlan Regiment), the 2nd Legions Infantry Division, as well as 28th and 30th Infantry Divisions. The opposing force was composed of two infantry divisions of the German 8th Army under Johannes Blaskowitz. These were the 10th Infantry Division under Conrad von Cochenhausen and 24th Infantry Division under Friedrich Olbricht, as well as several smaller detachments of both 10th and 12th Corps. Battle The first Polish units to reach the area, that is the Wołyńska Cavalry Bde and the 30th Infantry Division were ordered to secure the area in order to allow for the remaining units to join up with the core of the army. However, due to chaotic command during the first days of the war, all divisions were dispersed and most regiments acted separately. In the course of the withdrawal it turned out that the 36th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Division was separated from the main forces and had to break through German lines in order to catch up. The same issue applied to the 30th Infantry Regiment of the 10th Infantry Division, which formed a defensive line in the village of Boginia and did not receive the orders for withdrawal.

He currently is a coach for the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Ishii was regarded as one of the best Japanese shortstops of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Though late in his career his stats declined due to age, he still contributed with his precise fielding and solid batting abilities, as well as his veteran leadership. Ishii entered the professional leagues with the Yokohama Taiyo Whales, and played with the franchise for most of his career. (The team changed its name to the Yokohama BayStars in 1993.) Biography Ishii joined the Yokohama Taiyo Whales from outside the draft in 1988. His uniform number was 66. He played as a pitcher during his early career, and marked his first professional victory in 1989. He also got a hit in his first victory. Ishii compiled a record of 1-4, with a 5.69 ERA in his three years as a pitcher. Ishii converted to the infield in 1992. He became the team's regular third baseman the same year. The team changed its name to the Yokohama BayStars in 1993, and Ishii changed his uniform number to 0. He played a full season at third base, batting second. He won the Central League Golden Glove award and led the league in steals. He changed his number to 5 in 1994. He played in the All-Star Game for the first time in 1995. He switched from third base to shortstop in 1996. He was an all-star for five consecutive seasons from 1997 to 2001. Ishii began to bat lead-off in 1997. He received a Best Nine Award as the best shortstop in the Central League in 1997. He would receive this award for five consecutive years, until 2001. The Yokohama Baystars won the Central League pennant, as well as the Japan Championship Series in 1998 (38 years after their last championship in 1960). Ishii led the league in steals and hits, and received his fourth Golden Glove award at shortstop. He led the league in steals for three consecutive seasons (1998~2000). In 1999 he marked 1,000 career hits, 1,000 games played, and 200 career steals. Ishii led the league in hits for the second time in his career in 2001. Ishii went into a huge slump in 2003, getting fewer than 100 hits in a season for the first time since 1992. He reversed his slump in 2004, matching his career high in home runs. He started every single game in 2005, batting first and playing shortstop. He also played in every inning. In 2006, he played in every inning of all 146 season games for the second year in a row. He also tied his career high for single-season hits. Ishii got his 2,000th career hit on May 11, 2006, in his first at-bat against the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.\\"Takuro Ishii Hits 2,000th,\\" JapaneseBaseball.com (May 12, 2006). He was the 34th player in Japanese baseball — and the second player who has a win as a pitcher — to reach the milestone. As a result, he automatically became a member of Meikyukai, one of the two Japanese baseball halls of fame. Ishii had knee surgery during the 2006 off-season, and was removed from a game on April 1, ending his full-inning play record at 339 games (second most among active players). After spending 19 seasons with the Whales/BayStars, Ishii moved to the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in 2009. After retiring following the 2012 season, he became a coach for the Carp.  Personal life  Ishii's wife is FujiTV announcer Shiori Arase. He has two children, born in 2002 and 2005. His former wife is Azusa Senou, who was a member of CoCo.

No members of this subfamily are extant today, with all becoming extinct by the late Pleistocene. Procoptodon goliah, the largest macropodid known to have existed, was a sthenurine kangaroo, but sthenurines occurred in a range of sizes, with Procoptodon gilli being the smallest at the size of a small wallaby. The short, robust skull of sthenurines is considered to be indicative that they were browsers that fed on leaves. Some species may have been able to reach above their heads and grasp branches with their semiopposable paws to assist in procuring leaves from trees. A single hoofed digit is present on the feet of sthenurines. Taxonomy The subfamilial arrangement Sthenurinae was circumscribed by Ludwig Glauert in 1926. Locomotion Unlike modern macropodids, which hop (either bipedally or quadrupedally), sthenurines seem to have abandoned saltation as a means of locomotion. Their comparatively inflexible spines, robust hindlimb and pelvic elements, and the lack of capacity for rapid hopping suggest that these animals walked bipedally, somewhat like hominids, even converging with those primates in details of their pelvic anatomy. Furthermore, their hooved single digits and metatarsal anatomy suggest that unlike their plantigrade relatives, sthenurines were unguligrade, walking on the tips of their \\"toes\\".

Named after a downtown Toronto neighbourhood, it was formed by singer/songwriter and guitarist Keith McKie (born November 20, 1947 in St Albans, England, immigrated to Canada in April 1953), formerly with The Vendettas, with guitarist and pianist Gene Martynec (born March 28, 1947 in Germany) from Bobby Kris & The Imperials. The original line up was completed with former Vendettas' bass player Alex Darou (born January 6, 1943 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario) and drummer Jimmy Watson (born August 23, 1950, Belfast, Northern Ireland). Former Luke & The Apostles frontman, singer/songwriter Luke Gibson (born November 5, 1946 in Toronto) was added later in 1967, and synthesizer player John Mills-Cockell (born May 19, 1943 in Toronto) was a member in 1969. History Brought together around May 1967 by musical entrepreneur Bernie Finkelstein, the Market debuted at the Night Owl on June 4 and performed initially in Toronto coffeehouses such as the Red Gas Room, and high schools. In mid-August, after the dissolution of Luke & The Apostles, the Market recruited Luke Gibson by which time they had already released two singles for Stone Records. These singles achieved minimal success but Finkelstein was able to sign them to Warner Brothers in New York City. In 1968, the Market did the soundtrack to the NFB film The Ernie Game. Later that year, they released the album Avenue Road, produced by Felix Pappalardi, followed by a tour of the United States. In 1969, keyboardist John Mills- Cockell joined, and their follow-up, Aardvark, was released, once again produced by Pappalardi, followed by their second US tour. However, this wasn't done in enough time to save the splintering band who split that same year. Demise of the Market Although it was short lived and did not enjoy great commercial success, Kensington Market was one of the first Canadian rock bands to develop a style – texturally complex, lyrically eloquent – independent of US and British models. Its LPs did not capture the exuberant, improvisatory nature of its live performances. Darou died in the early 1970s. Watson retired from the world of music. Finkelstein founded True North Records. John Mills- Cockell went on to record with synth-prog band Syrinx before trying his own solo career – both projects were on Finkelstein's True North Records. Pappalardi died on April 17, 1983 from a gunshot to the neck. Martynec subsequently worked in Toronto studios, while Gibson and McKie have had minor and intermittent solo careers. Gibson made the LP Another Perfect Day (TNorth TN6) in 1971 and McKie released Rumors at the newsstand (Quantum QR-81003) in 1981.

History Some Velvet Sidewalk was formed in Eugene, Oregon in 1987 by Al Larsen (vocals/guitar) and Robert Christie (drums). Their first release was From Playground 'Til Now, and was independently released on cassette in 1988. Somewhere around this time, Jenny Olay joined on second guitar and went on the band's first American jaunt with the Go Team, Rich Jensen, Spook & The Zombies, and Mecca Normal. In 1990, Larsen along with Tobi Vail (drums) and Louise Olsen (bass) recorded the album, Shipwreck. (The release of this album was heavily delayed, but it was eventually released in 1995.) Just before the 1990 release of their first full album, Appetite For Extinction, Robert Christie left the band and was replaced by Don Blair and bass player Martin Bernier, whom Larsen had found in a free musician's wanted ad. A short tour of small Pacific NW towns quickly followed with D.C. band Scream, of which Dave Grohl was a member and it was Some Velvet Sidewalk that accompanied Scream when Kurt Cobain first met Grohl at a small party at Slim Moon's home. This new line-up soon recorded with Calvin Johnson in Yo Yo Studios along with Pat Maley what would become known as the \\"Pumpkin Patch\\" single. They went back to the studio in 1991 with producer and musician Steve Fisk to record Avalanche, which released in 1992. They spent 1992 and 1993 touring and released a short EP called I Scream. Following suit, the next album, Whirlpool, showed up in 1994. Ryan Baldoz of Olympia joined on second guitar around this time. SVS soon added keyboardist Paul Schuster to the lineup to record the 1997 album, Generate!. The final true SVS release, the EP The Lowdown, was released in late 1997. The band broke up following an American tour, and the members went their separate ways. In 1999, Larsen compiled and released a posthumous SVS album called Original Love Rock Masters. This album is a compilation that contains live songs, garage demos, and various side projects. Crayon and the Pastels have recorded and released cover versions of Some Velvet Sidewalk songs. Al Larsen continued his musical career with bands such as the Polar Bears, the Evil Tambourines and Melting Igloo. In 2005, he released a solo album titled The Hardline According to Danny & the Dinosaur on his own label, Property Is Theft. Larsen is now an Assistant Professor and Coordinator of Creative Media at Champlain College. Martin Bernier joined Seattle's the Heroic Trio, which featured Australian ex- pat and future Welcome bassist Jo Klaxton and drummer Lenni Rennals. They released one full-length album and one three-songsong EP on La Push Records. Following Bernier's exit from that band he joined Olympia's Bunnyfoot Charm. Don Blair went on to play drums in Totfinder along with ex-Sleep Capsule member Russ Klatt. He now plays in the experimental Waves. The original drummer and founding member, Robert Christie, was killed in a car accident January 2001 along with his wife, Denise and two sons, Ted and John.

Capture and detention According to Marjorie Cohn, Adnan Latif was involved in a car accident in 1994, during which he suffered significant head injuries, which left him with on-going neurological problems. Latif said he traveled from Yemen to Pakistan in August 2001 to seek medical treatment, while the U.S. government alleged he went there to receive military training from affiliates of al Qaeda. He was captured in December 2001 at the Pakistan/Afghanistan border in a widespread dragnet of Arabs, and brought to Guantanamo prison in January 2002. Judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings Immediately after his imprisonment, Latif and Guantanamo prisoners generally were blocked from filing habeas corpus petitions because of President George W. Bush's doctrine that \\"war on terror\\" detainees were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and so could be held indefinitely without charge and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention. In June 2004, however, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives had basic habeas corpus rights, to be informed of and allowed to attempt to refute the allegations justifying their detention. Latif attorneys Marc D. Falkoff and David Remes filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf in 2004. Following the Supreme Court Rasul ruling, in July 2004 the Department of Defense set up its Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRT). Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, would later, in 2008, list detainees still held in Guantanamo, and the CSRT allegations against them. The allegations were as follows regarding Adnan Latif: the military alleged he was an al Qaeda fighter and operative, that he went to Afghanistan for jihad, that he \\"... took military or terrorist training in Afghanistan,\\" and that he \\"... fought for the Taliban.\\" Further allegations were that his name or alias had been found \\"on material seized in raids on Al Qaeda safehouses and facilities,\\" and that he served on the security detail of Osama Bin Laden. Annual CSRT status review hearings were held in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, and there is evidence Latif attended his 2004, 2005 and 2007 hearings. Late in 2005, Guantanamo detainee habeas corpus rights were again restricted and largely replaced with a much more limited review known as \\"DTA appeal, after United States Congress passage of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006. However, in June 2008, the United States Supreme Court overturned provisions of those laws and restored detainee access to habeas corpus. Responding to Latif's habeas corpus petition in July 2010, District Court judge Henry Kennedy ordered Latif's release from detention, his ruling stating that the government had failed to show by a preponderance of evidence that he was part of al Qaeda or an affiliated force. Latif attorney Remes said, \\"This is a mentally disturbed man who has said from the beginning that he went to Afghanistan seeking medical care because he was too poor to pay for it. Finally, a court has recognized that he's been telling the truth, and ordered his release.\\"Yemeni psych patient ordered freed - Guantánamo - MiamiHerald.com The decision was, however, appealed and a three judge DC Circuit Court of Appeals panel over-turned the ruling in an October 14, 2011, split decision which granted government allegations stronger credibility. The Supreme Court decided not to review the appeals court decision. Life at Guantanamo Latif and other prisoners described Guantanamo conditions to Latif attorney Falkoff when he and other U.S. attorneys were first allowed to visit them in November 2004: \\"During the three years in which they had been held in total isolation, they had been subjected repeatedly to stress positions, sleep deprivation, blaring music, and extremes of heat and cold during endless interrogations.\\" Latif also described to Lakoff a visit to his cell by an 'Immediate Reaction Force\\" team: Latif became a frequent hunger striker, and described being force fed as \\"like having a dagger shoved down your throat.\\" The Miami Herald writes that at times Latif \\"would smear his excrement on himself, throw blood at his lawyers, and on at least one occasion was brought to meet his lawyer clad only in a padded green garment called an 'anti-suicide smock' held together by Velcro.\\" In 2008, Latif's attorney Remes filed an emergency federal court motion stating that Latif was suffering seizures and was not being properly treated. The motion, which requested Latif's medical records, a pillow and an additional blanket, was denied. Falkoff recalled, \\"he was the guy that we tried unsuccessfully to get medical records for, and a blanket and mattress, after we found him lying on the floor of our interview cell, weak and emaciated.\\" In a letter described in an April 17, 2009, Al Jazeera report, Latif stated he had recently been abused at Guantanamo. The report also quoted attorney David Remes' observations on the appearance of Abdul Latif and his other clients: \\"Adnan Latif ... has a badly dislocated shoulder blade. I've seen the evidence of physical torture and I've also heard about the evidence of psychological torture.\\" Guantanamo's Psychiatric ward, where Latif was reported to have been confined. The Associated Press reported on May 11, 2009 that Remes said that Latif had slit his wrists during his most recent visit. Remes said that Latif had used the edge of a strip of broken veneer from the side of a table in the interview room to sever a vein in his wrist, and used the interview table to hide his bleeding wrist from others and the room's video camera. Remes stated that Latif had tried to commit suicide before, and therefore had at times been confined to the prison's psychiatric facility. Remes also said Latif needed mental health care, but all camp authorities were doing was attempting to keep him subdued. A December 10, 2012 article at Truthout reported that Latif had written a letter to Remes complaining of his treatment at Guantanamo. Dated May 28, 2010, Latif complained in the letter that guards were placing contraband items, such as scissors, in his cell. \\"The way they deal with me proves to me that they want to get rid of me, but in a way that they cannot be accused of causing it,\\" he told his attorney. The same article reports that on two separate instances in 2010, camp officials tried to get Latif to fire Remes. On one of these occasions, he was given an injection with an unspecified drug before a meeting with a military lawyer. Latif told Remes later (according to attorney notes, as described in the Truthout article) that \\"they wanted to have no one report\\" his death. Clearances for release On April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts. Latif's nine page long assessment was drafted on January 17, 2008 and signed by camp commandant Mark Buzby, and it recommended that he be transferred out of Department of Defense control. Historian Andy Worthington, the author of The Guantanamo Files, writes that the 2008 assessment repeated earlier recommendations that Latif be released. Worthington reported that in addition to being cleared for release by Joint Task Force Guantanamo, and by the US District Court Judge Henry Kennedy, Latif had been cleared for release by the Guantánamo Review Task Force that President Barack Obama had set up when he came to office in 2009. Death On September 10, 2012, Latif died at Guantanamo. He had been held there for 10 years, 7 months and 25 days, after arriving there on January 17, 2002. On September 10, camp authorities informed the press that a detainee held in the punishment cells of Camp five had been found dead early in the afternoon of September 10, but did not reveal the detainee's name, and stated that the cause of death was not apparent. The next day it was acknowledged the prisoner was Adnan Latif, and later a military autopsy reportedly declared suicide the cause of death. The results of a full Naval Criminal Investigative Service investigation were not expected to be known until sometime in 2013. Before the publication of Latif's identity, Wells Dixon, a lawyer who helped several Guantanamo detainees with their habeas corpus petitions, described the captives' feelings of despair, which he attributed to recent judicial reverses.

Early life  He was born on 25 May 1956 in Point Fortin, Trinidad and Tobago. His mother is a Grenadian and his father is Trinidadian.  Career  Lyons became famous from his first entry into the calypso tent world in 1980 with \\"Soca Baptist,\\" a song he penned in 1979. \\"Soca Baptist\\" won him his first Carnival Road March Monarch award in 1980. He won the annual T&T; Carnival Road March title ten times (in 1980, 1981 and 1983 he won under the moniker Blue Boy, and as Superblue in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 2000, 2013 and 2018). He won the Trinidad & Tobago Soca Monarch (now the International Soca Monarch) title seven times. Superblue is famous for wearing blue costumes and dancing on top of speaker boxes. He developed a reputation for performing daring antics while on stage for the Soca Monarch competitions. Superblue's has many children. His daughters Terri Lyons and Fay-Ann Lyons are in the entertainment industry. Fay-Ann Lyons' calypsonian mother is Lady Gypsy, a soca musician (composer and performer), who won three Road March Monarch titles (2003, 2008 and 2009). Superblue recorded the song \\"Clear de Road\\" with Fay-Ann. They performed it together for the International Soca Monarch competition in 2004, placing out of the top ten. Since his Soca Monarch win in 2000, Superblue remained out of the winners' circle until 2011 when he received the SAO Hall of Fame Award for his body of work. He continues to record music and his earlier songs are considered classic soca compositions, used in Panorama competitions. He made a triumphant return to the Soca Monarch stage in 2013 with his song \\"Fantastic Friday,\\" and captured the International Power Soca Monarch title in a tie with the defending champion, Machel Montano. SuperBlue is hailed as the originator of the \\"jump and wave\\" style of soca songs and is credited by the benefactor of the International Soca Monarch, William Munro\\"An Insight into the International Soca Monarch Competition\\". with a major role in the success of that competition. His song \\"Barbara\\" was played as background music in the movie Side Streets (1998). SuperBlue sealed his triumphant return to the soca scene in 2013 by winning the Road March Title and tying for first place in the International Soca Monarch with Machel Montano. His winning song \\"Fantastic Friday\\" was played over 500 times on Carnival Monday and Tuesday, beating Montano (who had fewer than 60 plays), by over 400 plays. In 2018, Montano and Superblue jointly released \\"Soca Kingdom\\" for Carnival. They dominated the Road March competition, winning with over twice as many plays as the second place song.

Javed and Danny plan a trip to Alibagh and invite Rajiv and Mambo only on condition that they come along with girls. Rajiv decides to ask Payal (Amrita Rao), his reserved childhood friend to become his girlfriend and tells her that he's in love with her. He does that only for the trip as he doesn't believe in love and serious relationships. Payal returns her \\"feelings\\" and agrees, as she has been in love with him since their school days.

Rajiv doesn't accept her apology and asks her to kiss him in front of everyone. Payal refuses saying that she doesn't need to prove her love by doing such a cheap act. Their relationship falls apart and Rajiv challenges that he'll have the most beautiful girlfriend of the college. Rajiv's best friend Mambo (Vishal Malhotra), who was in support of Rajiv and Payal's friendly relation, does not like this and insists that he gets back with Payal. But Rajiv rebukes him. Soon after, Alisha Sahay (Shenaz Treasurywala), a stylish and beautiful girl, starts at Spencer College. Rajiv is smitten by her and manages to woo her with the help of his friend Love Guru (Yash Tonk). Meanwhile, Mambo and Payal become close, Mambo tries to cheer her up and be with her always. Payal still cares a lot for Rajiv and is silently hurt at seeing Alisha and Rajiv together. Nevertheless, she continues to talk to Rajiv and wish him a happy birthday. Rajiv is taken aback by the fact that it was Payal and not Alisha who bothered to wish him first, as Alisha is busy with her modelling shoot. Rajiv starts noticing that Payal and Mambo are coming close, which irks him. Rajiv is surprised to find Payal at his birthday party in a pub. Payal gets emotional and tells him she now thinks that her views about love were wrong and that is why Rajiv is so happy with Alisha, something which was not with Payal. Mambo and Rajiv come to blows because of Payal, and Alisha slowly starts disliking Payal. The final straw is when Alisha sees Rajiv and Payal talking, and she learns from a mutual friend that they were together before she entered the college. She confronts Payal, behaves rudely with her, and accuses her of stealing her boyfriend. Mambo tries to defend Payal, and Alisha puts him off, which infuriates him. Rajiv and Mambo get into a fist fight. Alisha and Rajiv leave with everyone accusing him of fighting with his friends. At Alisha's flat, Rajiv is unable to think of anything else but how Payal loved him and he let her go, and how after their break up, she still cared for him, and the recent fight. Alisha gets insecure and keeps asking him to profess his love. He, imagining Alisha to be Payal, hugs her and says \\"I love you, Payal\\". At the Farewell party of the college, Rajiv apologizes to Mambo with a thought that Mambo was planning to propose to Payal. He then realizes his mistake as Payal still loves him and Mambo was just being her friend. Rajiv tries to apologize to Payal, but she doesn't listen to him. Rajiv then takes the mic and publicly apologizes to Payal. He tells her he loves her a lot, even though she might not believe him. Payal is still angry with him and tells him that doing a drama in front of everyone and proclaiming his love is not going to make her relent. Rajiv stands before her and gazes pleadingly into her eyes. Payal is convinced that Rajiv does love her and embraces him. Alisha comes there and finds Rajiv and Payal dancing on a slow tune. She apologizes to Payal for her behavior and wishes them good luck. The movie ends with Rajiv and Payal's dance.

He played college football at Los Angeles City College. Early years Bishop was born on July 1, 1934 in Rawlings, Virginia. He attended Jefferson High School. He moved on to Los Angeles City College, where he was a two-way End and earned Junior College All-American honors. Professional career Pittsburgh Steelers Bishop was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Pittsburgh Steelers after the 1958 NFL Draft. He was tried at split end and as a halfback, catching only 3 passes in his rookie season. In his second year, he was used at defensive halfback and punt returner, but was released after 2 games on October 12, because of poor performances. Chicago Bears The Chicago Bears claimed him off waivers during the 1959 season, but played him in only one game. Dallas Cowboys On September 6, 1960, the expansion Dallas Cowboys claimed him off waivers. Bishop was switched to cornerback and during the Cowboys' 1960 inaugural year, he became the franchise first starting right cornerback, registering 71 tackles, 13 passes defensed and 3 interceptions in a 12-game season, tying him with Tom Franckhauser for the team lead. In 1961, he began to stand out, finishing with 8 interceptions in a 14-game season, which trailed league leader Dick Lynch by one. Only Everson Walls (twice) and Mel Renfro (once), have had more interceptions in a season for the Cowboys. He also established a team record that still stands today, with five consecutive games with an interception. That year Bishop did not make the Pro Bowl, but was named to the 1961 Sporting News: First team All-NFL. In 1962, he had 6 interceptions and also scored his lone career touchdown, returning an interception 84 yards in a loss to the Los Angeles Rams. After missing the Pro Bowl the previous season, Bishop was one of the first Cowboys players ever to receive this honor. Other teammates that joined him in the Pro Bowl that season were: QB Eddie LeBaron; DT Bob Lilly; RB Don Perkins; and LB Jerry Tubbs. In 1963, he recorded 5 interceptions, making him the Cowboys leader in interceptions during their first four years of existence. A knee injury forced him to have surgery before the 1964 season, which would limit him the rest of his career. He started 7 games at right cornerback, while alternating with Warren Livingston. In 1965, he was a backup behind Livingston and retired at the end of the season. Bishop played 8 seasons in the NFL, leaving as the Cowboys career interceptions leader. His 22 interceptions ranks eleventh on the current franchise career interceptions list. The Cowboys have had several great cornerbacks since then, but Bishop's contributions to the franchise must be remembered. Although he played on some of the Cowboys worst teams, he became one of their original defensive stars. Personal life Bishop at one point worked as a morticians' assistant during the off-season.

The strip was a spin-off of They'll Do It Every Time, an earlier Hatlo creation.  Publication history  From August 14, 1943 to February 13, 1966, Little Iodine was written and drawn by Hatlo, who said, \\"I tried to make her the embodiment of all the brats I knew... I tried to make her naughty as hell--and still likable.\\"Reynolds, Moira Davidson. Comic Strips in American Newspapers, 1945-1980. McFarland, 2003. Al Scaduto also contributed to the strip from February 20, 1966 to September 3, 1967, with Hy Eisman and Bob Dunn taking the strip from September 10, 1967 through its end in August 1983. Iodine also appeared in a series of 56 Dell Comics between 1949 and 1962. Characters and story First seen during the 1930s in a supporting role in Hatlo's popular gag panel, They'll Do It Every Time, Little Iodine was the daughter of Henry Tremblechin and his wife, Cora. Her purpose was to serve as a pesky nuisance to the strip's star, Henry, and her behavior caused endless misery for her mild-mannered, easily unsettled father. However, Iodine proved to be popular in her own right, stealing the strip from her parents, so Hatlo promoted the character into her own strip in 1943. Iodine's antics gave the Sunday comics page a female precursor to Hank Ketcham's Dennis the Menace. Film adaptation In 1946, Comet Productions, a company established by Mary Pickford, her husband, Charles Rogers and Columbia executive Ralph Cohn, produced a 56-minute feature film, Little Iodine, starring Hobart Cavanaugh as Henry, Irene Ryan as Cora and Jo Ann Marlowe as Little Iodine. The film was directed by Reginald Le Borg. In the movie, Iodine thinks that her mother is having an affair with Professor Simkins (Leon Belasco). Consequently, she tries one antic after another to break up the adulterous couple. Her efforts backfire when they cause conflict between Henry and his employer, Mr. Bigdome (Emory Parnell). Jimmy Hatlo's Little Iodine (November 7, 1948) The film was scheduled for release earlier than October 20, 1946 (its actual distribution date), but that date was postponed due to an epidemic of polio that prevented children across the United States from attending films. The film is currently believed to be lost. References Sources * Strickler, Dave. Syndicated Comic Strips and Artists, 1924-1995: The Complete Index. Cambria, California: Comics Access, 1995.

It is one of three universities of the Missouri Baptist Convention. The main campus is located on a 68-acre site near Creve Coeur and Town and County in West St Louis County, off highway 64-40. There are currently 12 MBU locations including its regional learning centers throughout the St. Louis region and Illinois. The school enrolled 5,309 students in 2019. History In 1957, a growing need for an evangelical Christian institution in the St. Louis area prompted the opening of a campus extension of Hannibal- LaGrange College at Tower Grove Baptist Church. Sixty-eight students were enrolled that inaugural year. Classes for the extension center, also known as St. Louis Baptist College, met in the activities building of Tower Grove Baptist Church. In 1964, Missouri Baptist College was chartered as an evangelical Christian, four-year liberal arts college. Under the auspices of Hannibal-LaGrange College and the direction of its president, Dr. L.A. Foster, Bible courses were offered for pastors and laymen. During the second term, several liberal arts courses were requested and provided. Student influence, along with organizational work of St. Louis Baptist leaders, pastors and laymen, influenced MBU's charter. The first meeting of the Board of Trustees for Missouri Baptist College was held in January 1964. Dr. Frank Kellogg served as the first chairman of the Board of Trustees and later as the second president. In July 1964, leaders acquired the site of MBU's main campus, metropolitan land near Interstate 270 and U.S. Route 40 in West Saint Louis County. In September 1968, 186 students began classes, more than tripling the institution's size in just over a decade. In May 1973, Missouri Baptist College graduated its first class of twenty-nine students, each earning a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1980, Missouri Baptist College began a new chapter of its life with the completion of the Pillsbury-Huff Residence Halls, converting from a commuter campus to a residential institution. In the fall of 1986, MBC began offering courses in both Jefferson and Franklin counties. Dr. R. Alton Lacey took the reins of Missouri Baptist University in 1995 as the university's sixth president. Under his leadership, MBU's enrollment more than doubled; the university introduced graduate, post-graduate programs, and new undergraduate degrees; and MBU held a successful $10 million campaign, the largest development project in MBU's history. In April 2000, the college was approved to offer the Master of Science in Education. Today the MBU graduate program includes a Master of Business Administration and a Master of Arts in Christian Ministry and an expanded offering of its initial graduate program, the Master of Science in Education. In the spring of 2002, the campus completed the Spirit of Excellence campaign with the dedication of the new $10 million Pillsbury Chapel and Dale Williams Fine Arts Center. The building, encompassing more than acts as a host to musical, religious, business, educational and community events. The Spirit of Excellence campaign also led to the renovation of the Thomas and Virginia Field Academic Hall, a much larger cafeteria and bookstore, a new student lounge, an improved computer lab and numerous offices and classrooms. Also in 2002, Missouri Baptist College became Missouri Baptist University. In the fall of 2005, MBU's enrollment reached an all-time high of 4,460 students. At its thirty-fourth commencement exercises, MBU conferred 579 degrees, another MBU record. During the summer of 2007, MBU's Jung-Kellogg Library was renovated and a new coffeehouse added. In the Fall Semester of 2009, the university began offering its first doctorate program, a Doctorate of Education. In 2017, Dr. R. Alton Lacey announced his retirement after 23 years as MBU president. In the fall of 2017, Dr. Keith L. Ross was appointed as MBU's seventh president. Lacey assumed the role as chancellor in January 2018. There were ongoing renovations to the library and major additions to the football field during the summer of 2019. The library has now been transformed into a learning commons space. In 2019, after a 17 year lawsuit Missouri Baptist University came back under the jurisdiction of the Missouri Baptist Convention Board of trustees.  Academics  As of December 2018, Missouri baptist offers over fifty degree programs through both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Degrees are offered through their schools of business, education, and nursing, and their divisions of fine arts, humanities, natural sciences, health & sports sciences, interdisciplinary studies, counseling (graduate), and social & behavioral sciences. They also offer several master's degrees programs and some doctorates in education. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

The riot, which resulted in four deaths and numerous injuries, was subsequently blamed by local authorities, who were controlled by management, upon the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The Wheatland hop riot was among the first major farm labor confrontations in California and a harbinger of further such battles in the United States throughout the 20th century. History Background Hops plants produce a resinous flower cone which is used as a flavoring agent in beer. Ralph H. Durst (March 28, 1865 – May 4, 1938) was a leading grower of hops in the Central Valley of California. The Durst Ranch, located on 640 acres () outside the town of Wheatland in Yuba County, California, was the largest single employer of agricultural labor in the state, requiring each summer the hiring of hundreds of seasonal workers to help bring in the harvest.* David A. Kulczyk, \\"Hops of Wrath: 1913's Bloody Wheatland Hop Riot Eventually Led to Better Conditions for Workers. Too Bad it was Only Temporary\\", Sacramento News-Review, August 30, 2007. The farm also dried and packaged the picked hops on site, before transporting them by train to San Francisco for export to England. In the summer of 1913 Durst advertised for temporary harvest workers as he had always done, promising ample work at high rates of pay.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All: A History of the Industrial Workers of the World. First paperback edition. New York: Quadrangle Books, 1969; pg. 294. In one flier soliciting laborers, the Durst Ranch promised a job to every white hops picker who arrived on his farm by August 5.Greg Hall, Harvest Wobblies: The Industrial Workers of the World and Agricultural Laborers in the American West, 1905–1930. Corvallis, OR: Oregon State University Press, 2001; pg. 48. In this year, however, the number of willing workers far outstripped demand, with some 2800 men, women, and children flocking to the Durst Ranch to work as pickers in the fields. Jobs actually existed for only about 1500 workers daily, and pay rates were consequently slashed.Cletus E. Daniel, Bitter Harvest: A History of California Farmworkers, 1870–1941. Paperback edition. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1982; pg. 89. In addition to the lack of employment for many of those arriving at the Durst Ranch, living conditions for the temporary field hands were particularly abysmal. Workers lived in tents in the hot summer sun on a barren hillside, paying Durst 75 cents per week for the privilege as a rental fee. More workers were on hand than could be accommodated in these tents, however, forcing some to make do in the elements under crude structures constructed from poles and burlap sacks. Toilet facilities were grossly insufficient for such a large workforce. They were often extremely filthy, overflowing with human waste and covered with flies. Drinking water was a mile from the fields and Durst refused to supply any to the pickers under his employ, instead allowing his cousin to operate a commercial lemonade wagon.Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, pp. 294–295. Furthermore, the lemonade was an inferior synthetic brew, sold for five cents a glass.\\"The Wheatland Boys\\", International Socialist Review, vol. 14, no. 7 (January 1914), pp. 442–443. Wages were to be paid based on the weight of hops picked, with pickers promised a pay rate of $1 per 100 pounds harvested.Hall, Harvest Wobblies, pg. 49. This rate was deceptive in that the picked hops were heavily cleaned before final weighing, with no pickers allowed to be present to verify the work of the cleaning crew. Workers generally received less than $1.50 per day for twelve hours of toil under a summer sun that could reach .Hall, Harvest Wobblies, pp. 49–50. Workers on other farms in the area typically netted twice as much.Hall, Harvest Wobblies, pg. 50. Further stoking worker unrest, Durst maintained a policy of retaining 10% of the daily wage owed each worker until the end of harvest, to be received only by those who remained at the Durst Ranch to the end. Workers would in this way be obligated to stay at the farm to the end of harvest or face forfeiture of a substantial portion of their earnings. Strike Richard \\"Blackie\\" Ford, spokesman for striking field workers at the time of the Wheatland hop riot Harvest of hops began on the Durst Ranch on July 29, 1913. Discontent over pay and conditions immediately erupted among the migrant workers as the actual terms of their employment and living conditions became clear. On Friday, August 1, 1913, a group of about thirty field workers loosely affiliated with the radical Industrial Workers of the World (members of which were known as \\"Wobblies\\") established themselves as a temporary local of that organization and began to agitate among their peers to take action about the dire conditions which they faced. A former Wobbly, Richard \\"Blackie\\" Ford, was chosen to be the spokesman for the field workers' demands, which included a pay rate of $1.25 per 100 picked pounds, a new system in which workers cleaned their own picked hops, drinking water to be provided in the fields, improvement of toilet facilities and separate bathrooms for women, and the hiring of assistants to help women and children with the loading of heavy hop sacks into wagons. Durst partially complied, indicating that he would henceforth improve toilet facilities, provide water in the fields, and allow one worker to witness the cleaning process. Ford responded by threatening a strike if the other demands were not met. Durst immediately terminated Ford and the others on the strike committee who accompanied him. However, Ford and the strike committee refused to collect their pay and exit the ranch, prompting Durst to call Deputy Sheriff Henry Daken and ask him to arrest the strike leader. No arrests were made owing to the lack of an arrest warrant. The tense situation began to boil over. A mass meeting was called, which was addressed by Ford and Herman Suhr, an IWW member who was acting as secretary of the temporary Durst Farm local. Other speakers addressed the crowd in the German, Greek, Italian, Arabic, and Spanish languages.Hall, Harvest Wobblies, pg. 51. A show of hands indicated that a large majority of pickers at the meeting were in favor of a strike. The crowd remained peaceful and sang Wobbly songs through the afternoon. Additional small meetings were held among the pickers on Saturday, August 2.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, pg. 295. Events of August 3, 1913 With a major strike of hop pickers in the offing, Ralph Durst headed to town to round up local authorities to put down the revolt. He gathered Yuba County District Attorney Edward Manwell (who was also his own lawyer), Marysville Sheriff George Voss, and a number of deputies. The sheriff and his men approached the speakers' platform to arrest Ford, who was addressing the assembly. Workers began to intervene on his behalf. Greatly outnumbered, one of the law enforcement officials fired a shotgun into the air in an effort to disperse the crowd. The shot provoked the opposite effect intended and many members of the crowd jumped on District Attorney Manwell and Deputy Sheriff Lee Anderson and began beating them. Gunfire erupted and a full-fledged riot ensued. In the aftermath the 45-year- old Manwell, Deputy Sheriff Eugene Reardon, a Puerto Rican hop picker, and an English hop picker lay dead. One picker lost an arm to a shotgun blast. Eyewitness accounts of the incident were contradictory.One local newspaper, the Marysville Appeal, noted that while a large number of people had witnessed the shooting, \\"their stories varied considerably.\\" Quoted in Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 4: The Industrial Workers of the World, 1905–1917. New York: International Publishers, 19654; pg. 265. In the best estimation of historian Greg Hall: > The crowd...was unarmed. By most accounts, the deaths of Manwell and Reardon > resulted from Reardon and perhaps another member of the posse having their > guns taken away and used against them. Another historian of the Wheatland events indicates that the district attorney and the deputy were killed by the Puerto Rican worker, who had successfully disarmed a lawman and used his firearm against them, only to be killed himself by a member of the posse.Daniel, Bitter Harvest, pg. 90. The English picker who was killed is said to have been an innocent bystander in this alternative account. In the aftermath of the violence many hop workers immediately vacated the Durst Ranch, scattering in every direction. Meanwhile, Wheatland and Marysville authorities immediately contacted Governor Hiram Johnson requesting rapid dispatch of units of the National Guard to maintain order. Local law enforcement authorities themselves rushed into action, making about 100 arrests of seasonal agricultural workers. Those arrested were subjected to starvation and physical beating in an effort to gain testimony to be used against strike leaders.Hall, Harvest Wobblies, pg. 52. One such prisoner, a field worker named Alfred Nelson, was hauled from county to county where he was held incommunicado, sweated, starved, beaten, and repeatedly threatened with death unless he confessed to participation in the killings.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4, pg. 266. In Martinez, Nelson was taken from jail to a room in a hotel where he was beaten by a sheriff and a private detective with pistol butts and a rubber hose and threatened with summary execution. Nelson refused to confess and was eventually returned to jail. The treatment of Nelson shocked Martinez District Attorney A.B. McKenzie, who declared Nelson's treatment to have been \\"one of the biggest outrages that has ever been perpetuated in this state.\\" The Swedish consulate in San Francisco lodged a formal protest on behalf of Nelson, a Swedish national. A coroner's inquest was conducted which concluded that the IWW strike leadership had caused the riot which led to the death of District Attorney Manwell. Arrest warrants were hastily issued for Ford and Suhr on charges of murder. The pair were soon detained, as were their fellow workers Walter Bagan and William Beck, all of whom were held over for trial. The psychological pressure was so severe that Nels Nelson, the picker who lost his arm to a gunshot wound, hanged himself to death in his cell. Another prisoner unsuccessfully attempted to do the same. A third prisoner suffered a breakdown and had to be committed to a mental hospital. Trial Herman D. Suhr, secretary of the Durst Farm local of the Industrial Workers of the World and a leader of the ill-fated August 1913 strike. The defense of the IWW defendants was conducted by Socialist attorney Austin Lewis, a friend of the organization. Two legal defense organizations were established to raise funds for the trial — the Wheatland Hop Picker's Defense League, launched by the IWW itself, and the International Workers' Defense League, which was a coalition effort. By the middle of February 1914 the groups had raised a combined $5,575 to aid the defense effort.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4, pg. 267. Newspapers around the state tarred the IWW defendants as fanatics committed to violence and local sentiment was overwhelmingly hostile. One local newspaper, the Marysville Democrat, denounced the Wobblies as \\"venomous human snakes\\" who \\"always urged armed resistance to constituted authority\\" and were thus \\"more dangerous and deadly than the wild animals of the jungles.Marysville Democrat, August 4, 1913. Quoted in Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4, pg. 265. The trial opened in neighboring Marysville. Attorney Lewis attempted to obtain a change of venue so that the defendants might be tried in a more neutral setting than the superheated environment of Yuba County. In addition to pervasive bias against the IWW in the local community, Lewis noted that the judge in the case, E.P. McDaniel, was a personal friend of the dead district attorney. The request for the change of venue was denied and Governor Johnson likewise declined to appoint a new judge in the case. Eight of the twelve members of the jury for the trial of the agricultural strike organizers were farmers. Testimony for the prosecution emphasized the fact that Ford and Suhr were \\"agitators.\\"Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4, pg. 270. No witness indicated that they had seen Ford with a gun; rather the case was made that by mobilizing the hop pickers the IWW organizer had \\"filled the magazines of wrath.\\" Suhr's so-called \\"confession\\" was not introduced into evidence, indicative that it had been obtained through the use of illegal force, but three deputies were put on the stand to testify that Suhr had told them he had taken a gun from an old man while fleeing the scene and fired twice. This accusation was denied by Suhr. No eyewitness evidence was produced to indicate that Suhr had actually fired the fatal shots. Defense witnesses indicated that the shots which killed the law enforcement officials were fired by the dead Puerto Rican picker from Deputy Reardon's gun, which had been seized in the scuffle. Attorney Lewis emphasized in his closing that > None of the defendants took part in the shooting. None was seen with a gun > in his hands. None advised or abetted violence. Nothing in the evidence > points to a conspiracy — much less proves it.Quoted in Foner, History of the > Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4, pg. 270. Despite Lewis's best efforts, the result of the trial was never really in doubt. On January 13, 1914 Blackie Ford and Herman Suhr, the recognized leaders of the strike which had degenerated into a fatal riot, were found guilty of second-degree murder after one day of jury deliberations.Hall, Harvest Wobblies, pp. 52–53. Both received life sentences in the state penitentiary.Hall, Harvest Wobblies, pg. 53. Walter Bagan and William Beck, owing to their lesser role in the strike and no evidence tying them to the violence which resulted, were acquitted. Legacy Despite the convictions of Ford and Suhr, the stature of the IWW grew among the migrant workers of California following the Wheatland Hop Riot and that organization emerged as a primary representative of farm workers in the state. The number of Wobblies in California rose to 5,000 by the end of 1914, with forty locals of the organization dotting the state.Hall, Harvest Wobblies, pp. 53–54. The Wheatland hop riot of 1913 focused public opinion for the first time on the plight of California's agricultural laborers. California's progressive Republican Governor Hiram Johnson empowered a new Commission on Immigration and Housing to investigate the underlying causes behind the Wheatland Riot, which resulted in new legislation providing for the state inspection of labor camps.Daniel, Bitter Harvest, pg. 91. The California State investigation attracted federal attention and in August 1914 the US Commission on Industrial Relations conducted hearings on the Wheatland Hop Riot in San Francisco.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4, pg. 271. Testimony gathered further exposed the conditions faced by California agricultural workers in general and those on the Durst Ranch in particular, as well as the systemic violence practiced by private detectives working in cooperation with Yuba County law enforcement authorities. Appeals to the California Supreme Court on their behalf were unsuccessful and the two convicted leaders of the Wheatland strike remained behind bars for over a decade.Ryan McCarthy, \\"Hop Riots' Aftermath Echoes in Wheatland, 97 Years Later\\", Marysville Appeal- Democrat, September 7, 2010. Blackie Ford was eventually paroled in 1924 only to be immediately re-arrested and charged for murder by the Yuba City District Attorney, this time for the death of sheriff's deputy Reardon. A trial was held, after which the jury deliberated for 77 hours before returning a verdict of acquittal. Herman Suhr was pardoned not long after. Today, the site of the Wheatland hop riot is registered as California Historical Landmark #1003.

The final twenty minutes of the picture were photographed in Technicolor. The film stars Bebe Daniels, Everett Marshall, Bert Wheeler, Robert Woolsey, Joseph Cawthorn, Jobyna Howland, Ralf Harolde, Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson (in his film debut) and Dorothy Lee. The script was adapted by Luther Reed from a story by Anne Caldwell. This is the film in which composer Max Steiner received his first screen credit for orchestration. Additionally, it was Wheeler & Woolsey's third film; however, as they were not yet an official \\"team\\", they were still billed separately. Plot Dixiana Caldwell and her friends, Peewee and Ginger, are circus performers in the antebellum Southern United States. When Dixiana falls in love with a young Southern aristocrat, Carl Van Horn, she leaves the circus where she is employed and, with Peewee and Ginger, accompanies Carl to his family's plantation in order to meet Van Horn's family. At first thrilled with the news of their impending nuptials, Carl's father and stepmother, Cornelius and Birdie Van Horn, throw a lavish party for the couple. However, Peewee and Ginger inadvertently disclose Dixiana's background as a circus performer, creating a scandal for the elder Van Horns. Asked by the stepmother to leave in disgrace, Dixiana and her friends return to New Orleans, seeking to gain re-employment from her former employer at the Cayetano Circus Theatre, but they are regretfully refused by him, due to the way she had departed. Desperate, she takes employment at a local gambling hall, run by Royal Montague, who also has personal designs on Dixiana. As part of his plan, he intends to financially ruin Carl and his family and use Dixiana to accomplish that purpose. Things come to a head when Dixiana is crowned queen of the Mardi Gras. When Montague absconds with her, Carl challenges him to a duel, but, when a disguised Dixiana shows up in his stead, she tricks Montague into revealing his nefarious plans. Carl and Dixiana are reunited. Cast (Cast list as per AFI database) Copyright status At the end of 1958, the film entered the public domain in the United States because RKO did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Preservation status The Technicolor sequences were considered lost for years but were re-discovered in 1988 and subsequently included in the restored DVD. Reception Reviewer Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times wrote of the singing, \\"...one wishes there was more of it and less of the somewhat futile attempt at a story\\" and noted that Bill Robinson \\"...gives an excellent exhibition of tap dancing, which won a genuine round of applause\\" and concluded, \\"The early glimpses of the circus theatre ... lead one to expect more than one is apt to get out of this production.\\" The film reunited the director and most of the cast of RKO's most successful film of the year before, Rio Rita, but lackluster performances and direction, as well as a glut of movie musicals led to the film being one of RKO's biggest disappointments of 1930. The film lost an estimated $300,000.

In the US, the role is generally a requirement of US State law and is known as a registered agent, a resident agent or statutory agent. Process agents are also utilized in the US by truck drivers, brokers or freight forwarders for similar purposes. Process agents that provide nationwide coverage for motor carriers are commonly referred to as blanket companies. In the UK, a process agent is a contractual relationship, permitted by the Civil Procedure Rules. England and Wales Under English Civil Procedure Rules, it is necessary to serve papers to start proceedings correctly. If a party does not have an address within the United Kingdom, the procedure for serving these papers can be lengthy and complicated, with proof of service particularly difficult in some circumstances. It is therefore customary to appoint a process agent and contractually agree that service at the address of the agent will constitute proper service for the purposes of Rule 6.1.1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. In order to meet the requirements of Rule 6.1.1, an appropriate contractual clause needs to be inserted into the agreement specifying the details of the appointment. It is also possible to appoint a Process Agent for the purposes of arbitration proceedings in a similar manner. The role of a process agent is a vitally important service for many businesses dealing with suppliers, banks or tenders in the UK. Process agents accept service of notices, proceedings or documents on behalf of their overseas clients in situations where it is not possible for them to be served abroad. A process agent can act in a broad capacity for a company including but not limited to; acting as a process agent for court actions, receiving documents in connection with arbitration proceedings and receiving notices under contracts where an independent party is needed. A typical example of a process agency arrangement is where an overseas entity raises a loan from a city institution. Often the lending bank will require the appointment of a UK-based process agent to receive formal notices should the borrower default on the loan.

Overview Following their victory at the Battle of Heliopolis in July 640, and the subsequent capitulation of Alexandria in November 641, Arab troops had taken over what was the Roman province of Egypt. The newly installed Byzantine Emperor Constans II was determined to retake the land, and ordered a large fleet to carry troops to Alexandria. These troops, under Manuel, took the city by surprise from its small Arab garrison towards the end of 645 in an amphibious attack. In 645, the Byzantine thus temporarily won Alexandria back. Amr at the time might have been in Mecca, and was quickly recalled to take command of the Arab forces in Egypt. The battle took place at the small fortified town of Nikiou ( Pashati),https://st-takla.org/books/pauline- todary/coptic-language/egyptian.html about two-thirds of the way from Alexandria to Fustat, with the Arab forces numbering around 15,000, against a smaller Byzantine force. The Arabs prevailed, and the Byzantine forces retreated in disarray, back to Alexandria. Although the Byzantines closed the gates against the pursuing Arabs, the city of Alexandria eventually fell to the Arabs, who stormed the city sometime in the summer of that year. The defeat of Manuel's forces marked the last attempt by the Byzantine Empire to recapture Egypt for some 500 years, with only Emperor Manuel I Komnenos sending a failed expedition there in the 12th century. Then Amr ibn al-A'as wrote back to the Caliph: As ordered by the Caliph, he then left Alexandria and established a new capital, Fustat. References Further reading * Butler, Alfred J.

Though there were several major skirmishes after this battle, it effectively decided the fate of the Byzantine rule in Egypt, and opened the door for the Muslim conquest of the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa. Background to the Islamic conquests At the time of the death of Muhammad on 8 June 632, Islam had effectively unified the entire Arabian peninsula. Within the next twelve years, under the rule of the first two Caliphs an Islamic empire arose that annexed all of what used to be the Sassanid Empire, and most of the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire. The Muslim Caliphate continued to expand until by the turn of the 8th- century, it stretched from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to Central Asia in the east. Under the first Caliph, Abu Bakr, force was used to prevent unrest and rebellion from causing the collapse of the new Islamic state, and the first raids were carried out into the territory of the Sassanid Empire. But the all-out attack on the neighboring empires came with the ascension of the second Caliph, Umar. When the new Caliph began his rule in 634, the international situation in the Middle East could hardly have been more propitious for a new and ambitious power: the region's two traditional main powers, the Byzantine and the Sassanid Empires, had exhausted each other in a conflict that raged for over 20 years. By the 630s, Sassanid Persia had descended into a state of civil war, while Byzantium, under the aging emperor Heraclius, its manpower and resources depleted in the struggle with its old adversary, was struggling to re-establish its authority in its newly re- conquered eastern provinces. The two states were thus in considerable internal turmoil, and unable to either stop the Muslim expansion or to recover from its first blows. It is unknown whether Umar intended from the outset to conquer both the Sassanid and the Byzantine Empire, or simply allowed raids, and then, perceiving their weakness, followed up with full-scale invasion.\\"Umar (634-644)\\", The Islamic World to 1600 Multimedia History Tutorials by the Applied History Group, University of Calgary. Last accessed 20 Oct 2006  Arab conquest of Egypt  After successfully conquering Syria between 634 and 638, the Arabs turned their attention to Egypt. The attack on Africa took the Byzantines by surprise. Heraclius’s generals had advised him that the Muslims would need a generation to digest Persia before undertaking another wholesale conquest. The increasingly frail Emperor was forced to depend on his generals, and the result was complete disaster.Kaegi, Heraclius: Emperor of Byzantium. In 639, less than a year after the complete fall of the Sassanid Empire, an army of some 4,000 commanded by Amr ibn al-A'as, under orders of Omar, began the invasion of the Diocese of Egypt. That relatively tiny force marched from Syria through El-Arish, easily took Farama, and from there proceeded to Bilbeis, where they were delayed for a month. But having captured Bilbeis, the Arabs moved again, eerily echoing Heraclius’ successful campaign against the Sassanids just a short decade ago. A small force, commanded by a charismatic and tactically brilliant commander went behind enemy lines, and caused chaos all out of proportion to their size. They laid siege to the fortress of Babylon near modern Cairo, which withstood Amr's siege for seven months. In the meantime Amr and his army marched (or rode) to a point on the Nile called Umm Dunein. The siege of this city caused Amr and his horsemen considerable difficulty as they lacked siege engines and overwhelming numbers. After finally taking Umm Dunein, Amr crossed the Nile to Faiyum. There, on 6 June 640, a second army dispatched by Omar arrived at Heliopolis (the modern Ain Shams) and began to lay siege to it. Amr retraced his route across the Nile River, and united his forces with those of the second army. They began to prepare for movement towards Alexandria – but scouts reported the approach of the Byzantine army.Butler, Alfred, The Arab Conquest of Egypt and the Last Thirty years of Roman Dominion  The battle  At that point the united Arab army was confronted by a Roman army, which Amr, who had taken overall command, defeated at the Battle of Heliopolis. Just as Byzantine generals had failed in Syria, they did in Egypt, and the Empire's economically most valuable province after Anatolia was lost. The battle took place sometime in early to mid July 640, near the ancient city of Heliopolis, with Arab forces totaling approximately 15,000 under the command of Amr ibn al-A'as, and the Byzantine forces estimated at well over 20,000 under Theodore, commander of all Byzantine forces in Egypt. The Byzantine army could have responded sooner, but had not, for reasons that will never be known.The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon , Chapter LI. Though historians such as Butler blame the treachery of the Coptic Christians as well as the failure of the Byzantine generals for the swift fall of the Exarchate of Egypt, Gibbon does not blame anyone as much as he praises the character and genius of Amr for the victory at Heliopolis. Gibbon says \\"the conquest of Egypt may be explained by the character of the victorious Saracen, one of the first of his nation.\\" Whether through the foolishness of the Byzantine generals, including Theodore, contributed to what then occurred, certainly Amr fought a brilliant battle at Heliopolis. When the Byzantine army began approaching, Amr divided his army into three separate units, with one detachment under the command of a trusted commander, Kharija. This unit marched abruptly east to nearby hills, where they effectively hid. This unit was to remain there until the Romans had begun the battle, at which point they were to fall on the Roman flank or rear, whichever was more vulnerable. The second detachment Amr ordered to the south, which would be the direction the Romans would flee if the battle went badly. Once the Byzantine forces initiated contact with Amr's forces and commenced an attack, the detachment of Kharija attacked the Byzantine rear, which was completely unexpected by the Romans Theodore had not kept scouts out, or, if he had, he ignored their warning of the approaching Arab horsemen. This attack from the rear created utter chaos among the Byzantine ranks. As Theodore's troops attempted to flee to the south, they were attacked by the third detachment, which had been placed there for just such a purpose. This completed the final break-down and defeat of the Byzantine army, which fled in all directions. Theodore survived, but with only a tiny fragment of his army, while the remainder was killed or captured. In the battle's aftermath, most of southern and central Egypt fell to Amr's forces. The defeat at Heliopolis was crucial, as it removed the last Roman force standing between the Islamic invaders and the heart of Egypt. However, not only did the Battle of Heliopolis leave Egypt practically defenceless, it also encouraged the disaffected natives, most of whom were Monophysite Christians and had suffered on-and-off persecution at the hands of Constantinople, to rise up against their Roman oppressors. Although the Byzantine Empire was certainly by lineage the Roman Empire, its traditions, language, and ruling elite, by this time, were Greek. The Greeks of Egypt, whose numbers could scarcely equal a tenth of the native population, were overwhelmed by the universal defection of those same natives from obedience to the Roman Empire. As Bury wrote in the History of the Later Roman Empire from Arcadius to Irene: ::”The Greeks had ever been hated, they were no longer feared: the magistrate fled from his tribunal, the bishop from his altar; and the distant garrisons were surprised or starved by the surrounding multitudes.” Bishop John of Nikiu said, \\"And thereupon the Moslem made their entry into Nakius, and took possession, and finding no soldiers (to offer resistance), they proceeded to put to the sword all whom they found in the streets and in the churches, men, women, and infants, and they showed mercy to none. And after they had captured (this) city, they marched against other localities and sacked them and put all they found to the sword. And they came also to the city of Sa, and there they found Esqutaws and his people in a vineyard, and the Moslem seized them and put them to the sword.\\" It is notable that after the end of Amr's rule in Egypt, the population found their taxes ever increasing. Indeed, under the Umayyad Caliphate the Coptic Christians of Egypt found their taxes higher than the Byzantine Greeks had ever made them. Aftermath The next year and a half were spent on more maneuvers, skirmishes, and sieges before the formal surrender of the capital, Alexandria, took place on 4 November 641, but Sir Walter Scott was correct when he said “the fate of Byzantine Africa was decided at the Battle of Heliopolis.” The permanent loss of the Egypt left the Byzantine Empire without an irreplaceable source of food and money. The loss of Egypt and Syria, followed later by the conquest of the Exarchate of Africa also meant that the Mediterranean, long a \\"Roman lake\\", was now contested between two powers: the Muslim Caliphate and the Byzantines. In the event, the Byzantine Empire, although sorely tested, would be able to hold on to Anatolia, while the mighty walls of Constantinople would save it, during two great Arab sieges, from the fate of the Persian Empire.

Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler, Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters. Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, have made Kerala one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Growing at a rate of 13.31%, the tourism industry is a major contributor to the state's economy. Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination, with most tourism circuits concentrated around the north of the country. Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation—the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state—laid the foundation for the growth of the tourism industry. In the decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to transform itself into one of the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala - God's Own Country was adopted in its tourism promotions and became a global superbrand. Kerala is regarded as one of the destinations with the highest brand recall. In 2010, Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign tourist arrivals. Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists. Kerala is well known for its beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries. Other popular attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam, Varkala, Kollam and Kappad; backwater tourism and lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam; hill stations and resorts at Munnar, Wayanad, Nelliampathi, Vagamon and Ponmudi; and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries at Periyar, Parambikulam and Eravikulam National Park. The \\"backwaters\\" region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre on Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam, also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace, Hill Palace, and Mattancherry Palace, are also visited. To further promote tourism in Kerala, the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the Government of Kerala in 2007. Since then it has been held every year during the December–January period. The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture, wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local population. Efforts are taken to minimise the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment, and enhance the cultural integrity of local people. Historical context Resorts dot the lengths and breadths of Kerala. Since its incorporation as a state, Kerala's economy largely operated under welfare-based democratic socialist principles. This mode of development, though it resulted in a high Human Development Index and standard of living among the people, led to an economic stagnation in the 1980s (growth rate of 2.3% annually).. This apparent paradox—high human development and low economic development—led to a large number of educated unemployed seeking jobs overseas, especially in the Gulf countries. Due to the large number of expatriates, many travel operators and agencies set up shop in the state to facilitate their travel needs. However, the trends soon reciprocated, with the travel agencies noticing the undermined potential of the state as a tourist destination. The first travel agency in Kerala, Kerala Travels, was founded by Col G.V. Raja of the Travancore royal family along with P.G.C. Pillai. By 1986, tourism had gained an industry status. Kerala Tourism subsequently adopted the tagline God's Own Country in its advertisement campaigns. Aggressive promotion in print and electronic media were able to invite a sizable investment in the hospitality industry. By the early 2000s, tourism had grown into a full–fledged, multibillion-dollar industry in the state. The state was able to carve a niche for itself in the world tourism industry, thus becoming one of the places with the \\"highest brand recall\\".Kerala Tourism - Branding a Tourist Destination In 2003, Kerala, a hitherto unknown tourism destination, became the fastest growing tourism destination in the world.Kerala is the world's fastest-growing tourism destination says Renuka Choudhry.

Backwaters The backwaters in Kerala are a chain of brackish lagoons and lakes lying parallel to the Arabian Sea coast (known as the Malabar Coast). Houseboat or Kettuvallam rides in the backwaters are a major tourist attraction. Backwater tourism is centered mostly aroundKerala Tourist Places of Kerala like Alleppey, Kumarakom, Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam and Bekal. Boat races held during festival seasons are also a major tourist attraction in the backwater regions. The backwater network includes large lakes such as the Ashtamudi Lake, the largest among them, linked by 1500 km of canals, both man- made and natural and fed by several rivers, and extending virtually the entire length of Kerala state. The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range. Backwaters in Kerala for honeymoon and family holiday are quite popular. You may sort some of the best Kerala backwaters tour packages after reading about Kerala backwaters reviews available on various websites. Hill stations Munnar Hillscape Sithar Kundu View Point at Nelliyampathy, Palakkad Dist. Kerala, South India Eastern Kerala consists of land encroached upon by the Western Ghats; the region thus includes high mountains, gorges, and deep-cut valleys. The wildest lands are covered with dense forests, while other regions lie under tea and coffee plantations (established mainly in the 19th and 20th centuries) or other forms of cultivation. The Western Ghats rise on average to 1500 m elevation above sea level. Some of the popular hill stations in the region are Munnar, Vagamon, Paithalmala, Wayanad, Nelliyampathi, Elapeedika, Peermade, Thekkady and Ponmudi. Kurumbalakotta Hill in Wayand is becoming a great tourist attraction now. Wildlife Silent Valley National Park in Palakkad is home to the largest population of lion-tailed macaque. They are among the world's rarest and most threatened primates. The Konni Elephant Training Centre near Pathanamthitta Most of Kerala, whose native habitat consists of wet evergreen rainforests at lower elevations and highland deciduous and semi-evergreen forests in the east, is subject to a humid tropical climate. However, significant variations in terrain and elevation have resulted in a land whose biodiversity registers as among the world's most significant. Most of Kerala's significantly biodiverse tracts of wilderness lie in the evergreen forests of its easternmost districts. Kerala also hosts two of the world's Ramsar Convention-listed wetlands: Lake Sasthamkotta and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands are noted as being wetlands of international importance. There are also numerous protected conservation areas, including 1455.4 km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. In turn, the forests play host to such major fauna as Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), Nilgiri tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius), and grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macroura).. More remote preserves, including Silent Valley National Park in the Kundali Hills, harbour endangered species such as the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), Indian sloth bear (Melursus (Ursus) ursinus ursinus), and gaur (the so-called \\"Indian bison\\"—Bos gaurus). More common species include Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), chital (Axis axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), gray langur, flying squirrel, swamp lynx (Felis chaus kutas), boar (Sus scrofa), a variety of catarrhine Old World monkey species, gray wolf (Canis lupus), and common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). Many reptiles, such as king cobra, viper, python, various turtles and crocodiles are to be found in Kerala—again, disproportionately in the east. Kerala's avifauna include endemics like the Sri Lanka frogmouth (Batrachostomus moniliger), Oriental bay owl, large frugivores like the great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) and Indian grey hornbill, as well as the more widespread birds such as peafowl, Indian cormorant, jungle and hill myna, Oriental darter, black-hooded oriole, greater racket-tailed and black drongoes, bulbul (Pycnonotidae), species of kingfisher and woodpecker, jungle fowl, Alexandrine parakeet, and assorted ducks and migratory birds. Additionally, freshwater fish such as kadu (stinging catfish—Heteropneustes fossilis) and brackishwater species such as Choottachi (orange chromide—Etroplus maculatus, valued as an aquarium specimen) also are native to Kerala's lakes and waterways.

An International Coir Fest is conducted annually that is aimed at developing the coir industry of Kerala and tourism. Grand Kerala Shopping Festival To further promote tourism in Kerala, the Government of Kerala started the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival in the year 2007. Since then it has become an annual shopping event being conducted in the December–January period. During this period stores and shops registered under the GKSF offer a wide range of discounts, VAT refunds, etc. Along with the guaranteed shopping experience, shoppers are provided with gift coupons for a fixed worth of purchase entering them into weekly and mega lucky draws. As compared to shopping festivals held in other countries, this Festival converts the entire state of Kerala into a giant shopping mall, incorporating not just the big players, but also the small and medium scale industries. Through this shopping festival, the Kerala Government intends to transform the State into a hub for international shopping experience and thereby launch \\"Shopping Tourism\\" in the state. Ayurveda Medical tourism, promoted by traditional systems of medicine like Ayurveda and Siddha, is widely popular in the state, and draws increasing numbers of tourists. A combination of many factors has led to the increase in popularity of medical tourism: high costs of healthcare in industrialised nations, ease and affordability of international travel, improving technology and standards of care. However, rampant recent growth in this sector has made the government apprehensive. The government is now considering introduction of a grading system which would grade hospitals and clinics, thus helping tourists in selecting one for their treatments.Accreditation Of Hospitals To Promote Top Medical Tourism Destination In India Culture Face of a Kathakali artist (Kathi Vesham) Vishnu Moorthy Theyyam in Naduvilathu Kottam near Payyannur, Kannur. Thirayattam (kuttychathan ) An Ethnic Ritual Perforning Art Form in Kerala State, India The Padayani - Annual Ritual Performance of Kadammanitta & Thazhoor Bhagavathy Temple at Vazhamuttom near Pathanamthitta Kerala's culture is mainly Hindu in origin, deriving from a greater Tamil-heritage region known as Tamilakam. Later, Kerala's culture was elaborated on through centuries of contact with overseas cultures.. Native performing arts include koodiyattom, kathakali—from katha (\\"story\\") and kali (\\"play\\")—and its offshoot Kerala Natanam, koothu (akin to stand-up comedy), mohiniaattam (\\"dance of the enchantress\\"), thullal, padayani, thirayattam, and theyyam. Other arts are more religion- and tribal-themed. These include chavittu nadakom, oppana (originally from Malabar), which combines dance, rhythmic hand clapping, and ishal vocalisations. However, many of these art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among most ordinary Keralites, who look to more contemporary art and performance styles, including those employing mimicry and parody. Additionally, a substantial Malayalam film industry effectively competes against both Bollywood and Hollywood. Several ancient ritualised arts are Keralite in origin; these include kalaripayattu (kalari (\\"place\\", \\"threshing floor\\", or \\"battlefield\\") and payattu (\\"exercise\\" or \\"practice\\")). Among the world's oldest martial arts, oral tradition attributes kalaripayattu's emergence to Parasurama. Other ritual arts includeThirayattam, theyyam, poorakkali and Kuthiyottam. Thirayattam is a ritual performing folk aet form of south malabe region in kerala.This vibrant art form blend of dance, music, theatre, satire, facial & body painting, masking, martial art and ritualistic function.Thirayattam enacted i courtyards of \\"Kaavukal\\"(sacred groves)and village shrine. Kuthiyottam is a ritualistic symbolic representation of human bali (homicide). Folklore exponents see this art form, with enchanting well–structured choreography and songs, as one among the rare Adi Dravida folklore traditions still preserved and practised in Central Kerala in accordance with the true tradition and environment. Typical to the Adi Dravida folk dances and songs, the movements and formations of dancers (clad in white thorthu and banyan) choreographed in Kuthiyottam are quick, peaks at a particular point and ends abruptly. The traditional songs also start in a stylish slow pace, then gain momentum and end abruptly. Kuthiyotta Kalaris', run by Kuthiyotta Ashans (Teachers or leaders), train the group to perform the dances and songs. Normally, the training starts about one to two months before the season. Young boys between 8 and 14 years are taught Kuthiyottam, a ritual dance in the house amidst a big social gathering before the portrait of the deity. Early in the morning on Bharani, after the feast and other rituals, the boys whose bodies are coiled with silver wires, one end of which is tied around his neck and an arecanut fixed on the tip of a knife held high over his head, are taken in procession to the temple with the accompaniment of beating of drums, music, ornamental umbrellas, and other classical folk art forms, and richly caparisoned elephants. All through the way to the temple tender coconut water will be continually poured on his body. After the circumambulation the boys stands at a position facing the Sreekovil (Sanctum Sanctorum) and begins to dance. This ceremony ends with dragging the coil pierced to the skin whereby a few drops of blood comes out. Kerala elephants at the Thrissur Pooram On this day just after midday the residents of the locality bring huge decorated effigies of Bhima panchalia, Hanuman and extremely beautiful tall chariots in wheeled platforms, and after having darshan the parties take up their respective position in the paddy fields lying east of the temple. During the night, the image of Devi will be carried in procession to the effigies stationed in the paddy fields. On the next day these structures will be taken back. A big bazaar is also held at Chetikulangara as part of this festival. Kuthiyottam is the main vazipadu of the Chettikulangara temple, Mavelikkara. In respect of Fine Arts, the State has an abounding tradition of both ancient and contemporary art and artists. The traditional Kerala murals are found in ancient temples, churches and palaces across the State. These paintings, mostly dating to between the 9th to 12th centuries AD, display a distinct style, and a colour code which is predominantly ochre and green. Like the rest of India, religious diversity is very prominent in Kerala. The principal religions are Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam; Jainism, Judaism, Sikhism, and Buddhism have smaller followings. The state's historic ties with the rest of the world have resulted in the state having many famous temples, churches, and mosques notably 8 of the world's oldest churches—from the 1st century CE, founded by Thomas the Apostle when he reached Indian shores, the first mosque of India, which existed even before the death of the prophet Muhammad and the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations.

It is a 31-storey office tower, reaching at its roof, with each level approximately in height. From 1988 until 2019, it was the tallest building in Adelaide. It is set back from Currie Street near the intersection with King William Street, and is connected to two adjacent office buildings on Currie Street. It has four street frontages, and various pedestrian thoroughfares. The building was originally known as the State Bank building, before the 1991 State Bank Collapse, when it was purchased by Santos and renamed the Santos Building in February 1997. Since 2007, it has been known as Westpac House. History Opened in 1988 as the State Bank building, it became Santos House after the collapse of the State Bank in the early 1990s. Its major tenants have included Santos, PricewaterhouseCoopers, HWL Ebsworth, Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and the Australian Securities Exchange. In 2007, Santos moved its headquarters into a new building on Flinders Street, and Westpac acquired the naming rights to the building. In the lead up to (and during) major holidays, the windows are selectively lit up in formation. These include a white cross for Easter and Anzac Day, and a tree (in fluorescent green) for Christmas. Abacus Property Group acquired a half interest in Santos House in October 2004 and the remaining 50 per cent in 2015. It sold 50 per cent to Inheritance Capital Asset Management in 2016. Being the tallest building in Adelaide, it was chosen as the venue for the stair race events at the 2007 World Police and Fire Games. Between 11 and 15 May 2007, the 'Santos' sign on the building was removed and a single red 'W', the Westpac logo, had replaced it by 21 June. In October 2019, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat database, Westpac House was the 167th tallest building in Australia.

Wallace starts off as an ex-military civilian. He is a more upright, middle class citizen than Marv or Dwight McCarthy, but also not an epitome of righteousness like John Hartigan, none of whom he has any contact with. A demobilized Navy SEAL who received the Medal of Honor, he lives a life of relative peace and solitude against the backdrop of crime- ridden Basin City. Having left the Navy years prior, he makes a living as an artist (usually for sleazy magazines, to his great disgust) and as a short order cook. His life changes drastically when he saves a suicidal woman named Esther from drowning. She is kidnapped and enslaved by the Colonel, one of Basin City's most powerful crime bosses, sending Wallace on a single-minded journey to rescue her and take down those responsible, no matter who gets in his way. Appearance and personality In his late 30s or early 40s, Wallace appears to be around 5 foot 10 inches, to 6 foot tall. He has a lean, muscular build, long black hair, and stubble. His normal attire consists of a black T-shirt, black jeans, Converse All-Star shoes, and an ankle-length trench coat. Wallace dresses in such shabby clothing that he is sometimes mistaken for a bum. His long hair and stubble earn him frequent taunts from the police. He drives a Buick LeSabre convertible. Wallace is a skilled artist, and a talented painter (none of his paintings were seen, but every character who noticed them was impressed). For a citizen of Basin City he is quite prudish, as when he chose to tear up a nude portrait he created rather than allow it to be chosen over a more tasteful painting. He was caught by surprise when the assassin Delia (a.k.a. Blue Eyes) propositioned him. He is very respectful toward the opposite sex referring to women as \\"Ma'am\\" regardless of age or status. He does not, however, share Marv's aversion to hurting women, as shown by his lethal actions toward female opponents. He notices the smell of cigarette smoke quite easily. It is implied that his childhood was spent growing up in New England. Little is known about Wallace's past in the military, but he keeps scars from this part of his life. Most of the time Wallace is self-assured, self-confident and cool-headed, remaining so even in mortal peril, implying extensive combat training and experience. Though he is honest, warm-hearted, selfless and pacifistic, Wallace can be stirred to violent action when it is required, such as for revenge. He never shows exterior signs of panic and doesn't seem to fear anything. Wallace (understandably) dislikes the police, comparing them to the same people that worked for Stalin (the KGB). Whenever under intense stress, he meditates. This helps him clear his mind and recall things that might have escaped him in the heat of the moment. Using this method, he is able to recall how he was first drugged by the Colonel's subordinates and what happened to Esther when she was taken by them. It also seemed to lessen the effects of a powerful hallucinogen injected into him when men working for the Colonel try to frame him. He mentions that he has been meditating for much of his life, referring to things having \\"gotten bad\\" during his childhood. He also mentions that his meditation saved his life during \\"the mission,\\" alluding to the mission where he earned the Medal of Honor. Character history The main character of Hell and Back, Wallace is one of a few truly virtuous characters in Sin City. However, as an ex Navy SEAL, he also ranks among the deadliest. Hell and Back Wallace, a former navy seal, broke artist and occasional short-order cook loses his job as a pornography painter after ripping apart his sleazy contract work in front of the publisher. On his way home, he rescues a suicidal black woman named Esther after she jumped into the sea. At his home, Esther is looked after by Wallace\`s Landlady Mrs. Mendoza, a former nurse. Esther then offers Wallace to buy him a drink at a nearby bar. While taking a walk, they kiss, before Wallace gets hit by a tranquilizer dart and falls unconscious. When he comes to, he is arrested by abusive policemen for vagrancy. In the cell, he meditates and remembers that Esther was kidnapped by two men. When he reports this to the police Lieutenant Liebowitz, he is told to be quiet about the affair. On his way home, Wallace is intimidated to lay off his investigation of the kidnapping by the same cops who put him in jail. He attacks and robs them. Back at his home, Mrs. Mendoza tells Wallace that she took Esther's business card, with Esther's address on it. He heads to Esther's apartment where he finds Delia, who claims to be Esther's roommate and makes a pass at him. While there, they are attacked by Manute and a sniper. After Wallace defeats them, they leave and get chased by a Mercedes, which is also dispatched by Wallace. Since his car is bullet-riddled and easily identifiable, Wallace visits his former Navy seal captain and his male lover Jerry at a nearby farm. After changing cars, Wallace and Delia rent a room in a hotel. Wallace orders her to take off her clothes, lie in bed and close her eyes. Expecting sex, she complies and Wallace handcuffs her to the bed. He then tells her that he knows she is not Esther's roommate because her cigarette smoke scent was not on Esther, but immediately after he is shot by a sniper through the window. When Wallace returns to consciousness he is put in a car by Delia's henchman Gordo and is drugged by the pharmacologist Maxine. Inside the trunk of the car is the body of a young girl, to insinuate Wallace being a child killer who drove over a cliff while intoxicated. Wallace is then rescued by his former captain. The heavily hallucinating Wallace and his captain torture one of the surviving perimeter snipers to discern Esther\`s location, which is at an old factory complex. On their way there, the encounter Delia\`s group and attack them. The Captain is killed, but Wallace manages to force Maxine to administer an antidote for his hallucinations, before he accidentally shoots her too. He then also shoots the wounded Delia and takes the Captain\`s body back to Jerry. Wallace goes to the old factory complex where he finds a black market operation which trafficks babies, women and live organs. He goes to Lieutenant Liebowitz' house to tell him about the human trafficking, only to find out that the Lieutenant knew all along and is in on the take. While they are talking, the phone rings and Wallace is offered Esther's life in exchange for him letting the black market operation continue. Wallace accepts, and goes to retrieve Esther from the abandoned Roark Family Farm. When he finds Esther naked in the barn, he puts his Kevlar coat on her. While leaving, they are attacked by a helicopter, which is dispatched by Jerry who secured the perimeter. Wallace and Jerry take Esther to the hospital. Shortly after, the victims from the human trafficking factory are brought in by policemen, under orders of Lieutenant Liebowitz. After a few days, he and Esther move out of Sin City. Special abilities Wallace once worked as a short-order cook for a while. He is mostly a talented painter (his works are never shown but every character who sees them is impressed) and wishes to make a living through it. Wallace is one of the most skilled characters in martial arts, being able to take Manute down single-handedly and with relative ease. He tries to be patient with his opponents, giving fair warning to back off, but is always driven to violence, and proves to be far more dangerous than he looks. He is also a skilled gunman, often using Beretta 92F pistols. When acting in stealth, he uses a machete. As said before, Wallace is as calm as an executioner. Thanks to this and meditation, he keeps his senses to master the situations. He is also very observant. During most of his adventure, Wallace fights his enemies (and even police) all by himself. His only notable allies are two of his former comrades, 'Captain' and his life partner Jerry. Film appearance Wallace is set to appear in Sin City 3 (tentatively titled Frank Miller's Sin City: Hell and Back, if going with the naming pattern of the previous films), to be directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller. Rodriguez has said he wants Johnny Depp to play the part. Depp was originally supposed to play the part of Benicio del Toro's Jack \\"Jackie Boy\\" Rafferty. However, filming of Sin City conflicted with that of Depp's movies. Depp has expressed great interest in being a part of the Sin City franchise.

Simon & Schuster) The Devil's Teardrop is a novel published in 1999, written by author Jeffery Deaver. It, like other books of Deaver's, is a suspense-crime novel and contains several plot twists. Deaver, whose suspense fiction has been hailed as \\"a thrill ride between covers\\" by the Los Angeles Times, imagines a chilling scenario: a killer who is set to strike on the last night of this millennium – and unleash a devastation plot of murder and mayhem. The devil's teardrop is also a nickname for obsidian. It was the basis for the 2010 made-for-TV movie of the same name. Synopsis From the Back cover: New Year's Eve, 1999. An early-morning machine-gun attack by the Digger, an emotionless, robotic killer, leaves dozens dead in the Washington D.C. subway system. In a message to the mayor's office, a criminal mastermind demands twenty million dollars by midnight or the capital will again be at the mercy of his accomplice. But en route to the money drop, the devious extortionist is killed in a freak accident. The Digger, without orders to desist, prepares for his midnight massacre. With the ransom note as the only evidence, Special Agent Margaret Lukas calls upon Parker Kincaid, a retired FBI agent and top forensic document examiner, to join the manhunt. By midnight, they must track down the Digger – or for hundreds, the first moments of the new millennium will be their last moments alive. Plot summary On New Year's Eve morning, 1999, in Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C., a killer referred to as 'the Digger' guns down tens of innocent people at the metro station. A man, Gilbert Havel, sends a letter to the Mayor Gerald Kennedy demanding twenty million dollars cash to be dropped off at a park near Interstate 66 in bags. The letter goes on to explain that if his demands are not met the Digger will continue to strike at secret locations – at 3 p.m., 6 p.m. and at Midnight. Kennedy decides to deliver the money to the extortionist to ensure no more innocents are harmed and to make sure the town doesn't lose faith in the Mayor as election time is nearing. Agent Margret Lukas, the agent responsible for the case, wants to either put tracking on the bags, or take the extortionist down when he comes for the money. However, Havel is killed in a hit-and-run incident before he can make it to the drop-off point. All that Agent Margret has now is a letter, a dead body, and the knowledge that since the Digger had not been called off he will continue to carry on the remaining attacks. Assisting her in the investigation are officer Len Hardy and Detective Cage. At his home, retired FBI Document Examiner Parker Kincaid is spending time with his daughter and son and studying a letter that was supposedly written by late President Thomas Jefferson. It is when he is debating the authenticity of the letter that his ex-wife, Joan, comes and tells him that she wants the custody of their children. To Parker's dismay Joan's social worker will be at his house the next day. Parker receives an unwanted call from Cage, an old friend, and Cage tells Parker that he needs Parker's help with a letter based on the subway shootings. Sensing this as a bad idea because of his children, Parker declines. After some time pondering about the shooting and all the innocent children like his own that had died and ensuring his son Robby that 'the Boatman' (a suspect from Parker's past case that tried to break in Robby's window) won't show up, Parker shows up under Lukas' investigation site. Parker studies the letter and concludes that although the writer seems dumb or foreign by the mistakes he makes, that it is on purpose and the extortionist is actually intellectual. He also makes note of a strange stroke done over the letter 'i' which he dubs the 'Devil's Teardrop'. In scans conducted by Hardy and Parker there is an imprint on letter caused by being under another piece of paper. The imprint has '-tel' which the team concludes that the second attack site must be a hotel.

The last third of the film, which was filmed in early Technicolor, is basically a Follies production, with cameo appearances by Rudy Vallee, Helen Morgan, and Eddie Cantor. Rex Beach was paid $35,000 for the original story. The script for the film was written by J.P. McEvoy and Millard Webb and directed by John W. Harkrider and Millard Webb. The songs were written by Irving Berlin, Walter Donaldson, Rudolf Friml, James E. Hanley, Larry Spier and Dave Stamper. The film is in the public domain, and many prints exhibited on television are in black-and-white only, and do not include pre-Code material, such as nudity. Plot The plot involves a young woman (Mary Eaton) who wants to be in the Follies, but in the meantime is making ends meet by working at a department store's sheet music department, where she sings the latest hits. She is accompanied on piano by her childhood boyfriend (Edward Crandall), who is in love with her, despite her single-minded interest in her career. When a vaudeville performer (Dan Healy) asks her to join him as his new partner, she sees it as an opportunity to make her dream come true. Upon arriving in New York City, our heroine finds out that her new partner is only interested in sleeping with her and makes this a condition of making her a star. Soon, however, she is discovered by a representative of Ziegfeld.

It was named for Sir Thomas Dale, a 17th-century leader in the Virginia Colony. The high school is operated by the local school division, Chesterfield County Public Schools.  History Thomas Dale High School was named for Sir Thomas Dale, an English naval commander who served as colonial deputy-governor of the Colony of Virginia Buildings and names The school was built in 1906 and named Chester Agricultural High School. In 1917, it was renamed Chester High School. In 1942 it was given its current name of Thomas Dale High School. In the early 1940s, a new building was constructed on the western side of the original building. This building, formerly known as Chester Middle School, stands today as the Thomas Dale Ninth Grade Campus. The 1906 structure was later demolished. In 1964, another replacement facility opened less than a mile east on State Route 10. In the mid-1980s, the building saw a small expansion, followed in the early 1990s by some interior renovation and the addition of air conditioning. To alleviate overcrowding, an annex known as the Thomas Dale West Campus opened in 1997 in the former Carver Middle School building on Branders Bridge Road. This facility housed the 9th grade. Between 1999 and 2001, the 1964 building underwent a massive expansion and a complete interior and exterior renovation. Thomas Dale West Campus closed with the completion of this project. The Thomas Dale West Campus was later turned into what is now the Carver College and Career Center (formerly Community High School). Though the 2001 expansion was projected to accommodate the school's population for decades, the student population grew rapidly. It was decided that neighboring Chester Middle School would be shut down due to budget cuts and the overcrowding at Thomas Dale, thus the high school annexed Chester Middle. Ninth graders are currently housed at the former Chester Middle School, now known as the Thomas Dale Ninth Grade Campus, while 10th - 12th graders are at the main campus.  Sports  The athletic teams compete as the \\"Knights\\" and wear the school colors of maroon and gray. *Baseball: Following a 2007 District Tournament Championship, the 2008 team went 20-3 on their way to a regular-season and tournament crown. The 2009 team again won the regular- season championship and advanced to the regional semi-finals before a close loss to Deep Run. *Football: Thomas Dale won its first state football championship on December 12, 2009, defeating Lake Braddock. *Soccer: In 2005, the Knights varsity boys soccer team won the Virginia State AAA soccer Championship. They successfully defended that title in 2006. *Tennis: The Thomas Dale Boys tennis team claimed five titles in 2010: Coach of the year, Player of the Year and Boys Singles titles, Boys Doubles title, and Team District Champions. The 2011 season gave the Knights their 3rd straight district title, ending the year with a 14-0 record. *Volleyball: The Thomas Dale 2007 boys volleyball went 26-0, losing only three sets all season, on their way to Thomas Dale's third team state title in three years (Boys soccer 2005, 2006). *Wrestling: The wrestling team won the Central Region Championship in 1975, 1988, 1990, and 2008.

They forage in small flocks and creep and clamber in low vegetation. They breed in the pre-monsoon season from February to July and build a loose ball shaped nest made from grasses and leaves. Distribution In Bintan, Indonesia The species is widely distributed and is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. In India, there are disjunct populations in southern India. This population was recorded by Salim Ali from Antharasanthe near the Kabini reservoir.

He was a starting defensive back for the Philadelphia Eagles for seven seasons, from 1953 to 1961. He later paired with Pat Summerall on the primary broadcast team for National Football League (NFL) games on CBS during the 1970s. Early life Brookshier attended high school at Roswell High School in his hometown of Roswell, New Mexico. At Roswell, he received all-state honors in football, basketball and baseball. As a three-year letterman in football at the University of Colorado from 1950 through 1952, he was a defensive back, fullback and return specialist. One of his gridiron teammates was astronaut Jack Swigert, who was on the crew of the ill-fated Apollo 13. Brookshier was also a relief pitcher on the university's baseball team, and played one season of minor league baseball in 1954 for the Roswell Rockets of the class-D Longhorn League. NFL career He was a 10th-round NFL draft pick. He played defensive back for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League from 1953 to 1961, missing both the 1954 and 1955 seasons to serve in the United States Air Force. He was a starter on the Eagles' NFL Championship team in 1960, and was selected for the Pro Bowl twice. Brookshier's playing career ended because of a compound leg fracture, sustained while making a tackle on Willie Galimore in an Eagles' 16-14 victory over the Chicago Bears at Franklin Field on November 5, 1961. He was a member of the Eagles' Honor Roll and was one of only eight players whose numbers were retired by the team. Brookshier's number was 40. As a lieutenant, he was a backfield coach at the United States Air Force Academy for one year in 1955.Air Force Football, 2009, The Coaches p. 66 Broadcasting career Brookshier began sportscasting for WCAU-AM-FM-TV in Philadelphia in 1962, and became the station's sports director the following He joined CBS in 1965 as a color commentator for Eagles telecasts, and continued to call regional action after the network moved away from dedicated team announcers in 1968. In the early 1970s, Brookshier and Summerall co-hosted This Week in Pro Football, a weekly syndicated highlights show produced by NFL Films. After CBS dismissed its main pro football voice Ray Scott in 1974, the network went against its standard practice of using a professional announcer for play-by-play by promoting Summerall and partnering him with Brookshier. The two former NFL players became arguably American television's most popular sports broadcasting team for the remainder of the decade. Describing the pair's on-air rapport, Summerall said, \\"With Brookie, it was more of a conversation, like two guys in a saloon.\\" Besides many regular-season and playoff contests, most of which involved the Dallas Cowboys who were the National Football Conference's most dominant franchise at the time, the duo called Super Bowls X, XII and XIV. Brookshier also worked pre- and post-game shows for four other Super Bowls. He and Summerall also appeared as themselves on film in Black Sunday, which was partially filmed at Super Bowl X. Brookshier and Summerall called a heavyweight title fight between Muhammad Ali and Jean Pierre Coopman live in prime time on Friday, February 20, 1976. Brent Musburger and Phyllis George of The NFL Today co-hosted the telecast that night. Meanwhile, Don Dunphy supplied some commentary between rounds. A month earlier, CBS assigned Summerall and Brookshier to announce a Ken Norton bout against Pedro Lovell, a mere eight days before they called Super Bowl X. In 1981, Brookshier switched to calling play-by-play for the network, with John Madden taking his place as color commentator alongside Summerall. Controversy Brookshier became the subject of controversy in because of a remark he made during an NFL broadcast of an Eagles–Saints game on December 11. After a program note for an upcoming telecast of an NCAA men's basketball game between North Carolina State and Louisville, Brookshier said that the players on the Louisville team had \\"a collective I.Q. of about 40, but they can play basketball.\\" Given a chance to walk back the statement by partner Charlie Waters, Brookshier doubled down, saying \\"it's the truth.\\" This resulted in Neal Pilson, then president of CBS Sports, apologizing to Louisville school officials and later suspending Brookshier for the last weekend of the NFL regular Louisville's athletic director, Bill Olsen, felt that the remark was racist, since Louisville's starting five were all African American. Brookshier later apologized, calling his remark \\"stupid\\" and \\"dumb\\", but was angered over CBS's reaction, saying \\"I'm not about to be judged on one comment.\\" He added, \\"I've done a lot of things for charity. Now my own network is bailing out on me and taking me off the air. After 20 years at CBS, I deserve better than this.\\" The apology was accepted by the university and university president Donald Swain invited Brookshier to be the featured speaker at the school's annual football kickoff luncheon in Clarksville, Indiana on August 2, 1984. Brookshier was reinstated in CBS's announcing lineup for the 1984 season, continuing as a network commentator through 1987. Later life In 1989, he hosted the morning show of the then-nascent 610 WIP sports format; the program was called Breakfast with Brookshier, before he was paired with Angelo Cataldi and the program re-dubbed Brookie and the Rookie, and then finally simply Brookshier and Cataldi. He left broadcasting and was last known to be working as a consultant for CB Richard Ellis, an international commercial real-estate firm. Brookshier died of cancer at Lankenau Hospital on January 29, 2010. The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Brookshier into their Hall of Fame in 2007.

Grand Bay-Westfield (2016 population: 4,964) is an incorporated town in the western part of Kings County, New Brunswick, Canada. The town borders Saint John on its northwestern boundary. The town is an amalgamation of the original town of Grand Bay and the neighbouring village of Westfield immediately to the north. Grand Bay-Westfield is situated on the west bank of the Saint John River immediately north of the boundary between Kings County and Saint John County. The town is a suburb of the city of Saint John and its population is split with 3,405 residents in the Grand Bay neighbourhood and 1,544 located in Westfield. Many residents of Grand Bay-Westfield find employment in Saint John; many are tradespeople who work at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station, or the Coleson Cove Generating Station, as well as various J.D. Irving Limited pulp and paper factories and the Moosehead brewery - all located on the west side of the city. History House in Westfield, 1839The area was discovered by Samuel de Champlain, who named Grand Bay (Grande Baie) for its wide view. Westfield is either named after Westfield, MA, where some of its settlers came from, or for its geographic location on the west shore of the Saint John River and Nerepis River. The area started out as \\"cottage country\\" for the Saint John area, and remained so for a long time (and is still considered to be so by some). Due to the steep hills and rock, the area never became heavily engaged in agriculture, although some did exist and still does. The two municipal governments were merged in 1998 with the new municipality occupying much of the western portion of King's County.  Transportation  Rail Ice break-up on tracks at Westfield, 1936In 1869 the European and North American Railway Western Extension was opened through the area between Saint John and Vanceboro, Maine. The rail line changed ownership to the New Brunswick Railway before becoming part of the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline from Saint John to Montreal in the 1880s. CPR established several stations through the area (Grand Bay, Pamdenec, Epworth Park, Ingleside, Ononette, Hillandale, Westfield Beach, Lingley, Sagwa, and Nerepis). The rail line was sold in 1995 and is now operated as the New Brunswick Southern Railway. Roads Route 177 is the town's main road, called River Valley Drive in the Grand Bay section of town and Nerepis Road in the Westfield part. Other main streets are Woolastook Drive, which winds through the highlands of Grand Bay, and Inglewood Drive is host to the Pamdenec, Epworth Park, Brandy Point & Ingleside subdivisions on Grand Bay's shore front. Also, NB Route 102 which begins north of Fredericton ends in Westfield. Highway 7, the main route from Saint John to Fredericton, passes through the western extremity of the town. In September, 2008, part of the ground that supports the railway tracks were washed away after Hurricane Hannah. Marine The town has a ferry landing at the end of Ferry Road in Westfield. The Westfield Ferry, a cable ferry route operated by the provincial Department of Transportation using a pair of ferries, connects Westfield with the community of Hardings Point on the Kingston Peninsula. There is a popular campground just a few feet from the Hardings Point ferry landing. The Canadian Coast Guard maintains a seasonal (summer only) search and rescue station at Brundage Point near the Westfield ferry landing. Inshore Rescue Boat Station Saint John (IRB Station Saint John) operates a Zodiac Hurricane 733 fast rescue craft in the lower Saint John River, covering all areas downstream from Evandale to the Reversing Falls, including the Kennebecasis River and Belleisle Bay. IRB Station Saint John is tasked by Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax.  Neighbourhoods  Grand Bay  *Grand Bay- These three neighbourhoods (areas around Murray St, Thompson Rd & Bayview Rd) constitute the original Village of Grand Bay. It is the downtown core of the town. Most businesses are located here and the area borders the City of Saint John, although the closest hint of an urban environment is almost 20 minutes away. *Highlands/Round Lake- heavily wooded and very steep, wind through the backlands and end at Round Lake. *Pamdenec- Once a former municipality (Village of Pamdenec) itself, Pamdenec amalgamated with the Village of Grand Bay in the 1970s. The town hall and fire department are located here at 609-615 River Valley Drive. *Epworth Park- A former cottage community, it is nestled in the woods right on the Saint John River shore. The arena and middle school are located here. *Brandy Point Estates- A suburban-type neighbourhood built in the 1970s and 1980s. Historically part of Epworth Park, it is now much larger in population than Epworth. *Ingleside- The last community before Milligan Brook before you enter Westfield. *Panoramic Estates- This is a new neighbourhood being built just north of the Centrum. *Epworth Park Heights- This neighbourhood is west of Epworth Park and is much higher. Epworth Park Heights is very distinct from Epworth Park proper. *Beverly Hills & Valley View Estates- This growing neighbourhood is located off Woolastook Drive. The streets of the area are characterized by extremely steep hills and dense woods. *Brookdale Heights- A hilly neighbourhood on the edge of Milligan Brook. Brookside Park is a small garden area located near the entrance to the neighbourhood. Westfield  *Ononette- A very old community. Home of Unity Park. *Hillandale- Also very old, Hillandale stretches along the wide Saint John River and includes the school and ferry to Hardings Point. *Westfield Beach & Lingley- The former a very old cottage community, the latter a suburban-style neighbourhood stretching far back into the hills. Lingley is the last part of town to touch the Saint John River as it bends towards Brown's Flat at this point. Lingley is home to the highway exchanges from Route 177 to 102 and Route 7 to 102. The area also has a large steel bridge across the marshes at the mouth of the Nerepis River. Also, a small mobile home park is located off Carriage House Lane in the northern stretch of Lingley. *Sagwa & Nerepis Station- Two very sparse communities stretching along the Nerepis River, as the Saint John River has dramatically turns towards the northeast. Sagwa is home to a small subdivision, and Nerepis is home to historic Mount Hope Farm. Nerepis Station, commonly called Nerepis is not to be confused with the separate community of Nerepis, which lies immediately to the east of this Nerepis, across the Brittain Road Bridge.  Parks  Grand Bay-Westfield has many parks, from simple greenspace to ballfields and playgrounds. They are listed below, in geographical order from south to north. *Henderson Brook Nature Park: A tiny, new park, Henderson Brook is a great place to watch beavers and birds. It is located on Shannon Road. *Southwood Park: playground at corner of Bayview Road and Cavalier Lane. *Inglewood School: playground and baseball diamond. *Grand Bay Primary School: playground and fieldspace. *Grand Bay Tennis Courts: 3 regulation-sized tennis courts, located at the corner of Inglewood Drive and Pamdenec Road. *Pamdenec Place: simple park setting accessible from Pamdenec Road and Frederick Street. *Lions Field: On Inglewood Drive near Broad Street, two ballfields and a playground. *Epworth Park Field: green space at corner of Central Avenue and Smith Lane. *River Valley Middle School: Baseball field, soccer field, football field and, as of summer 2008, a running and walking track *Brookside Park: A small sitting area near the corner of Brookdale Avenue and Woolastook Drive. *Unity Park: Could be considered the town's commons, this park was created to symbolize the joining of the two communities. It is located next to Milligan Brook where the former boundary was (corner of Nerepis Road and Mullen Lane). The small stage is used in the summer for events every Wednesday, including children's nights, folk music, local talent, etc. *Westfield School: A large playground. *Brundage Point Trailhead/Westfield River Landing: Located at Ferry Road and Brundage Point Road.

Education and career Ackerman received a Bachelor of Arts in English from Pennsylvania State University and a Master of Arts, Master of Fine Arts and Ph.D. from Cornell University. Among the members of her dissertation committee was Carl Sagan, an astronomer and the creator of the Cosmos television series. She has taught at a number of universities, including Columbia and Cornell. Her essays have appeared in The New York Times, Smithsonian, Parade, The New Yorker, National Geographic, and many other journals. Her research has taken her to such diverse locales as Mata Atlantic in Brazil (working with endangered golden lion tamarins), Patagonia (right whales), Hawaii (humpback whales), California (tagging monarch butterflies at their overwintering sites), French Frigate Shoals (monk seals), Toroshima, Japan (short-tailed albatross), Texas (with Bat Conservation International), the Amazon rainforest, and Antarctica (penguins). In 1986, she was a semi-finalist for NASA's Journalist-in-Space Project—this program was cancelled after the Space Shuttle Challenger (carrying Christa McAuliffe as a payload specialist with the Teacher in Space Project) disaster. A molecule has been named after her—dianeackerone—a crocodilian sex pheromone. A collection of her manuscripts, writings and papers (the Diane Ackerman Papers, 1971–1997—Collection No. 6299) is housed at the Cornell University Library. Books Her works of nonfiction include, most recently, The Human Age: The World Shaped by Us, which celebrates nature, human ingenuity, and explores how we've become the dominant force of change on the planet; her memoir One Hundred Names for Love, about stroke, aphasia, and healing; Dawn Light, a poetic meditation on dawn and awakening; The Zookeeper's Wife, narrative nonfiction set in Warsaw during World War II, a tale of people, animals, and subversive acts of compassion; An Alchemy of Mind about the marvels and mysteries of the brain, based on modern neuroscience; Cultivating Delight, a natural history of her garden; Deep Play, which considers play, creativity, and our need for transcendence; A Slender Thread, about her work as a crisis line counselor; The Rarest of the Rare and The Moon by Whale Light, in which she explores the plight and fascination of endangered animals; A Natural History of Love, a literary tour of love's many facets; On Extended Wings, her memoir of flying; and A Natural History of the Senses, an exploration of the five senses.

He was the closest friend of the artist Albrecht Dürer,Corine Schleif (2010), “Albrecht Dürer between Agnes Frey and Willibald Pirckheimer,” The Essential Dürer, ed. Larry Silver and Jeffrey Chipps Smith, Philadelphia, 85-205. who made a number of portraits of him, and a close friend of the great humanist and theologian Erasmus. Born in Eichstätt, Bavaria, the son of a lawyer, Dr. Johannes Pirckheimer, he was educated in Italy, studying law at Padua and Pavia for seven years. His wife was called Cresencia, and they had at least a daughter, Felicitas. His elder sister Caritas (1467–1532) was Abbess of St Clare's Franciscan convent in Nuremberg (also in effect a girls' school for the city's upper class) and was also a gifted classical scholar; Dürer's life of the Virgin woodcut series was dedicated to her.The German wikipedia has a full life - link via Willibald He probably met Dürer in 1495. He was a member of a group of Nuremberg humanists including Conrad Celtis, Sebald Schreyer, and Hartmann Schedel (author of the Nuremberg Chronicle). He also was consulted by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I on literary matters. He translated many classical texts into German (as well as Greek texts into Latin), and was a believer in translating \\"by the sense\\" rather than over-literally, a great question of the day. Among other works, he edited and had published an edition of Ptolemy's Geographia in 1525. In 1499 Pirckheimer was chosen by the City Council to command their contingent of troops in the Imperial army during the Swabian War against the Swiss. On his return he was presented with a gold cup by the City. This may be referred to in Dürer's engraving Nemesis of about 1502. As Dürer had not received a classical education, it is usually assumed that much of the display of classical and humanist learning in his works, especially his prints, reflected his discussions with Pirckheimer. A notable example is Melencolia I. Pirckheimer lent Dürer the money for his second trip to Italy in 1506/07, and ten letters to him from Dürer in Italy demonstrate the closeness of the friendship, with much teasing. After the death in 1560 of the last of Dürer's immediate family, Pirckheimer's grandson Willibald Imhoff bought the remaining Dürer collections and papers. Most of Pirckheimer's own library, famous in its day, was sold by another Imhoff descendant to the Earl of Arundel in 1636. Most of the Arundel library was given to the Royal Society in 1678. Some of Pirckheimer's books therefore remain there (85 have been identified), but many more were sold out of the Royal Society, firstly to Bernard Quaritch in 1873, and secondly via Sotheby's in 1925.David Paisey, ‘Searching for Pirckheimer’s books in the remains of the Arundel Library at the Royal Society’, in Enea Silvio Piccolomini nördlich der Alpen, ed. F. Fuchs (Wiesbaden, 2007), 159–218. Pirckheimer died in Nuremberg, aged 60. Like Dürer, he is buried in the cemetery of the Johannis-kirche in Nuremberg. A portrait of Pirckheimer appears on the 100 Billion Mark note issued during Germany's Weimar Republic.

It is found principally in California's San Francisco Bay to southern Baja California. A member of the rail family, Rallidae, it is a chicken-sized bird that rarely flies. This species is closely related to the clapper rail, and until recently was considered a subspecies. It has a long, downward curving bill and is grayish brown with a pale chestnut breast and conspicuous whitish rump patch. The population levels of Ridgway's rail are precariously low due to destruction of its coastal and estuarine marshland habitat by prior land development and shoreline fill. It has year-long, circadian activity and is most vocal nocturnally and crepuscularly.David C. Zeiner, William F. Laudenslayer and Kenneth E. Meyer, California’s Wildlife Volume II Birds, State of California Department of Fish and Game (990) Habitat Pickleweed Creek, the upper arm of Richardson Bay looking toward Bothin Marsh Ridgway's rail forages at the upper end of, along the ecotone between mudflat and higher vegetated zones, and in tidal sloughs. Mussels, clams, arthropods, snails, worms and small fish are its preferred foods, which it retrieves by probing and scavenging the surface while walking. The bird will only forage on mudflats or very shallow water where there is taller plant material nearby to provide protection at high tide. At such high tides it may also prey upon mice, and has been known to scavenge dead fish.R.L. Zembal and B.W. Massey, The light-footed clapper rail, distribution, nesting strategies and management, Cal-Neva Wildl. Manage. 36:631-634 (1983) One of the largest population of Ridgway's rails is in San Francisco Bay, where a total of about 1100 are resident.L.

(2012) The photo above right was taken of a Ridgway's rail at the San Francisco Bay perimeter near the Dumbarton Bridge; the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in the area provides protected habitats for this and other native species. Other frequent sightings of this species around the San Francisco Bay include the Napa Sonoma Marsh, Bothin Marsh in Mill Valley, Gallinas Creek in San Rafael, Arrowhead Marsh and Damon Marsh in Oakland, the Palo Alto baylands,John Kemper, Birding in California Globe Pequot Press (2001) Charleston Slough in Mountain View, Seal Slough in San Mateo and Belmont Slough. For cover, Ridgway's rail seeks out emergent wetland dominated by pickleweed and cordgrass, or brackish emergent wetland with those two plants plus bulrush. It is not clear whether it requires any source of fresh water. Although not migratory in coastal wetlands, this species disperses juveniles into freshwater wetlands in late August through October. Ridgway's rail has been observed to forage in or near relatively disturbed areas, leading one to deduce the importance of protecting even numeral marsh areas; for example this species was seen foraging in a small mudflat area within Seal Slough in San Mateo, three miles from the nearest known breeding area in Belmont.T.E.

She is originally from Chelsea, Massachusetts and was identified with the San Francisco, California literary and arts community for many years. She currently lives in Los Angeles. Her books, mostly memoirs, are known for their exposition of the queercore community.  Early life  Tea grew up in Chelsea, Massachusetts in a working-class family. She felt different than other children, and she found early comfort in music. In high school, Tea identified with the goth subculture and artists such as Siouxsie Sioux. She was also drawn to literary work, including The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton, the poetry of Sylvia Plath, and the beat movement. When she was 20 years old, Tea read Angry Women from RE/Search Publications, which included interviews with radical female performers, writers, and thinkers. The book was highly influential to her: \\"That really made me see that there is a lineage [of female writers], and a path, and I could really put myself on that,\\" she explained in an interview. During her childhood, Tea's stepfather spied on her through a drilled hole in the wall of her bedroom. She struggled with this abuse, and she was in denial for many years. Tea began drinking alcohol as a teenager. When she 19 years old, her stepfather admitted to the abuse, but Tea's mother chose to stay with him. It was at this time that Tea decided to move out of her home and relocate to the home of her girlfriend at the time in Boston. During this period, Tea supported herself with two minimum wage jobs as a hair salon receptionist and deli shop employee. Her girlfriend, a sex worker, was earning significantly more money than she did. She decided to go into sex work as well. In the early 1990s, Tea broke up with her girlfriend and moved to San Francisco. Spoken word and Sister Spit In San Francisco, Tea immersed herself in the literary and spoken word scene. It was \\"...very democratic. There were open mics every night. The poetry was self-taught – punk and hip-hop inspired street poetry. It was perfect for me. I felt I could be my whole self, which at that point was queer, feminist, punk and working-class.” In 1994, Michelle Tea and Sini Anderson formed Sister Spit, a queer feminist collective. The group hosted weekly open mic nights in San Francisco, which attracted local and underground talent, as well as more established writers such as Mary Gaitskill, Eileen Myles, and Beth Lisick. In 1997, Sister Spit launched Ramblin’ Road Show, a spoken word tour that performed in bars, galleries, bookstores, community centers, and other venues in the United States and Canada. The tour was briefly revitalized in 2007 with Sister Spit: The Next Generation, which featured artists such as Ariel Schrag, Justin Vivian Bond, Blake Nelson, Nicole J. Georges, Cristy Road, Eileen Myles, and Beth Lisick. In 1998, her first book, The Passionate Mistakes and Intricate Corruption of One Girl in America, was published by Semiotexte/Smart Art Press. The book provided short stories in memoir form, exploring topics such as Tea's childhood in Massachusetts, her teenage interest in the goth subculture, and sex work.  Valencia  In 2000, the memoir Valencia was published. The book chronicled the life of Michelle, a young lesbian poet, in the Mission district of San Francisco. The plot primarily focused on the love life of the main character, as she dated multiple women over the course of a year. She explained in an interview, \\"The 'Michelle' in the book is definitely me, though if it makes a reader more comfortable to imagine it’s all a giant work of fiction, that’s fine too.\\" The book launched Tea into local and literary fame, especially after winning the 2001 Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Fiction.  Radar Productions  Tea is known for her work as an organizer and advocate for local artists and writers. In 2003, Tea founded Radar Productions, a nonprofit organization that produces events to showcase the work of queer writers and artists. She served as the Creative Director for twelve years before stepping down in 2015, so that she could focus on other pursuits. Juliana Delgado Lopera, a creative writing instructor at San Francisco State University, took her place. In 2015, Radar created Drag Queen Story Hour in San Francisco. The event, at which drag queens read books to kids, now happens in several cities around the United States and in Tokyo, Japan.  Recent work  Tea has toured with the Sex Workers' Art Show. She is also a contributor to The Believer magazine. In 2012, Tea partnered with City Lights Publishers to form the Sister Spit imprint. From 2012 to 2015, Tea wrote a column for XOJane, where she chronicled the difficulties she faced in trying to have a baby with her partner, Dashiell. Her articles documented the stress and difficulty that accompanied fertility treatments and artificial insemination, and additionally illuminated gaps that existed for queer couples in a system that was created with heterosexual couples in mind. In 2016, she created Amethyst Editions, an imprint of Feminist Press. Tea stepped outside her work as a writer to serve as the Executive Producer of Valencia: The Movie. Based on her novel of the same name, the experimental film was spearheaded with filmmaker Hilary Goldberg. Valencia was filmed by 20 different lesbian, queer and trans directors, each assigned a different chapter of her novel. The twenty one different 'Michelle' characters \\"vary in age, gender, size, ethnicity, style and era\\". Her experiences trying to conceive and preparing for parenthood led her to start the website Mutha Magazine, an alternative mothering/parenting website that caters to those parents that do not identify with mainstream parenting media. Of the project she says \\"I think there are a lot of women who get pregnant and have babies but they're not part of this cultural traditional ideas of what it means to be a mom and they're not interested in the media that's already out there.\\" In 2018, Against Memoir was published by Feminist Press. Academics In February 2008, Tea was the 23rd Zale Writer-in- Residence at the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College Institute at Tulane University. She did not go to college and, in interviews, has discussed the assumption that she has studied. Critical acclaim In February 2019, Michelle won the PEN / Diamondstein-Spielvogel Award for Art of the Essay for her book Against Memoir: Complaints, Confessions, and Criticisms! (Feminist Press, May 2018). While touring together in the year 2000, Tea and writer Clint Catalyst came up with the idea to solicit first-person narratives for their 2004 anthology, Pills, Thrills, Chills and Heartache. Described by Publishers Weekly as a \\"celebrat[ion of] the avant-garde,\\" the book, which includes work by JT Leroy, Dennis Cooper, and Eileen Myles, reached #10 on the Los Angeles Times non-fiction paperback bestseller list in its first week of release. Moreover, the book was a 2004 Lambda Literary Awards finalist in the Anthologies/Fiction category. Her books have often been nominated in the competition, beginning with the 2001 Lesbian Fiction nomination and award for Valencia. She was awarded the Jim Duggins Outstanding Mid-Career Novelists' Prize by the Saints and Sinners Literary Festival in 2008.  Personal life  Michelle Tea was in a relationship with Katastrophe, a transgender hip-hop artist, for many years. They shared an apartment in the North Beach district of San Francisco. In 2013, Tea married Dashiell Lippman at the Swedish American Hall in San Francisco. In 2015, her son was born.

This resulted in the company shutting down Black Isle, which in turn laid off the PC development team on December 8, 2003, effectively cancelling the game. Prior to its cancellation, Van Buren was set to carry on the Fallout series, but was not a sequel to Fallout 2. An official Fallout 3, unrelated to the abandoned Van Buren project, was developed by Bethesda Game Studios after Interplay sold the single-player rights of the franchise to Bethesda Softworks. It was released October 28, 2008. Several Black Isle staff members went on to form Obsidian Entertainment, and many themes, factions and characters of Van Buren were incorporated in Obsidian's Fallout: New Vegas, published by Bethesda Softworks in 2010. A trademark was filed for \\"Van Buren\\" on October 17, 2014, by Roxy Friday LLC, a company associated with inXile Entertainment.  Development  Prior to the development of Van Buren, two attempts to make a new Fallout game were halted by Titus Software in favor for other of Interplay's titles, notably console titles. When Interplay lost the rights to make Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate video games for the PC, their game Baldur's Gate III: The Black Hound, in development by Black Isle Studios, was canceled. With the cancellation of Baldur's Gate III, Black Isle Studio's team was immediately transferred to work on Fallout 3, codenamed Van Buren. During this time, Interplay's own team was working on Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, the teams had one meeting together to plan out the games. When many of Black Isle Studio's most talented developers left Black Isle Studios, the developer Damien Foletto responded by stating it was only the trust within the team and belief that they could finish the game that kept them going. The game was officially canceled when Titus decided to try to improve Interplay's console division. This led to a nearly completed Fallout 3 being canceled. Members of the Black Isle team were then either transferred to the development of Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel 2 or Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II, of which only the latter was released.  Plot  A town from Van Buren Although the complete story of Van Buren was never revealed, several details were divulged prior to its cancellation. The player's character would start the game as a prisoner; whether the character was wrongfully imprisoned or guilty was to be determined at character creation. The game would have started in a prison as it was attacked by an unnamed force. An explosion would knock the character unconscious, and the cell door would be open when he awakened. The player would then escape into the wasteland while being pursued by assailants. After leaving, the character would have the power to shape the destiny of the wasteland. Their interactions with organizations such as the Brotherhood of Steel and the burgeoning New Californian Republic (with both of these factions participating in a prolonged war with one another) could bolster or destroy the organizations, influencing people associated with them and eventually decide the fate of the region, much as in the previous two Fallout games. One of the more significant elements of the plot and back story of Van Buren was to be an ongoing war between the Brotherhood of Steel and the New California Republic. The player would be able to visit various prominent settlements and fortresses controlled by either of the factions and their actions there would influence the proceeding of the war. An example of the how the player's interactions could alter the flow of the conflict would be in the case of the settlement situated in the area around the Hoover Dam. Here the player could choose whether or not to aid the settlement and its people in a myriad of tasks, which would lead to this isolated frontier outpost eventually deciding the fate of the war. The game's ultimate plot line was planned so that the events in the beginning of the game would have been part of a scheme by a rogue New California Republic scientist, Dr. Victor Presper, to seize control of a U.S. orbital nuclear weapons platform dubbed B.O.M.B.-001 and use it to initiate a second nuclear holocaust, cleansing the world of all but his chosen few.Fallout: Van Buren - What's the Story? Retcon Raider (May 16, 2017) In the end, the player would not be able to stop all of the missiles from launching, and their decisions on where the missiles would strike would ultimately have decided the future of the world. Van Buren was to be centered on Utah and Colorado, however, a small part of Nevada would also be available. The player would be able to visit places such as Hoover Dam, Denver, Mesa Verde and the Grand Canyon. Fallout 3 does not follow the storyline of the cancelled project, but during an interview, Avellone revealed that aspects from Van Buren would make an appearance in Fallout: New Vegas. In particular, the NCR- Brotherhood of Steel war is mentioned, a companion from Van Buren (Joshua Graham) appears in heavily modified form, as does an antagonistic faction known as Caesar's Legion. He said that the Van Buren codename was based on President Martin Van Buren. Of the locales planned to be in Van Buren, only Hoover Dam appeared in Fallout: New Vegas, due to the change in location.  Tech demo  On May 3, 2007, the tech demo of Van Buren was leaked onto the Internet. The tech demo features three songs from the sampler Funeral Songs, released on June 26, 2001, as well as one music cue of unknown origin. All songs seem to be transcoded from MP3.

The term Electronic System Level or ESL Design was first defined by Gartner Dataquest, an EDA- industry-analysis firm, on February 1, 2001.Information and results for 'System-level design merits a closer look: the complexity of today's designs requires system-level. However, EDA-tools development is lagging behind the needs of semiconductor and systems companies, and EDA tools must provide support.(Cover Story)'  AccessMyLibrary - Promoting library advocacy. AccessMyLibrary. Retrieved on 2013-08-10. It is defined in ESL Design and Verification Brian Bailey, Grant Martin and Andrew Piziali, ESL Design and Verification: A Prescription for Electronic System Level Methodology. Morgan Kaufmann/Elsevier, 2007. as: \\"the utilization of appropriate abstractions in order to increase comprehension about a system, and to enhance the probability of a successful implementation of functionality in a cost-effective manner.\\" The basic premise is to model the behavior of the entire system using a high- level language such as C, C++, or using graphical \\"model-based\\" design tools. Newer languages are emerging that enable the creation of a model at a higher level of abstraction including general purpose system design languages like SysML as well as those that are specific to embedded system design like SMDL and SSDL. Rapid and correct-by-construction implementation of the system can be automated using EDA tools such as high-level synthesis and embedded software tools, although much of it is performed manually today. ESL can also be accomplished through the use of SystemC as an abstract modeling language. ESL is an established approach at many of the world’s leading System-on-a-chip (SoC) design companies, and is being used increasingly in system design. From its genesis as an algorithm modeling methodology with 'no links to implementation', ESL is evolving into a set of complementary methodologies that enable embedded system design, verification, and debugging through to the hardware and software implementation of custom SoC, system-on-FPGA, system-on board, and entire multi-board systems. Design and verification are two distinct disciplines within this methodology. Some practices are to keep the two elements separate, while others advocate for closer integration between design and verification.  Design  Whether ESL or other systems, design refers to \\"the concurrent design of the hardware and software parts of an electronic product.\\"  Tools  There are various types of EDA tool used for ESL design. The key component is the Virtual Platform which is essentially a simulator. The Virtual Platform most commonly supports Transaction-level modeling (TLM), where operations of one component on another are modelled with a simple method call between the objects modelling each component. This abstraction gives a considerable speed up over cycle-accurate modelling, since thousands of net-level events in the real system can be represented by simply passing a pointer, e.g. to model that an Ethernet packet has been received, SystemC is often used. Other tools support import and export or intercommunication with components modelled at other levels of abstraction. For instance, an RTL component be converted into a SystemC model using VtoC or Verilator. And High Level Synthesis can be used to convert C models of a component into an RTL implementation.  Verification  In ESL design and verification, verification testing is used to prove the integrity of the design of the system or device. Numerous verification techniques may be applied; these test methods are usually modified or customized to better accommodate the system or device under test. Common ESL verification methods include, but are not limited to: * Modular architecture * Constrained random stimulus generation * Error injection * Complete simulation environments Verification is often provided by the system/device designer, but in many instances, additional independent verification is required  Challenges and criticism  Some criticisms of ESL design and verification have been raised. These include too much focus on C-based languages and challenges in representing parallel processes. It can also be argued that ESL design and verification is a subset of verification and validation.

It is manufactured by the South African company Roundabout Outdoor. It operates in a similar way to a windmill-driven water pump. The PlayPump received heavy publicity and funding when first introduced, but has since been criticized for being too expensive, too complex to maintain or repair in low-resource settings, too reliant on child labor, and overall less effective than traditional handpumps. WaterAid, one of the biggest water charities in the world, opposes the PlayPump for these reasons. Design The PlayPump water system is a playground merry-go-round attached to a water pump. The spinning motion pumps underground water into a 2,500-liter tank raised seven meters above ground. The water in the tank is easily dispensed by a tap valve. According to the manufacturer the pump can raise up to 1400 liters of water per hour from a depth of 40 meters. Excess water is diverted below ground again. The storage tank has a four-sided advertising panel. Two sides are used to advertise products, thereby providing money for maintenance of the pump, and the other two sides are devoted to public health messages about topics like HIV/AIDS prevention. History The PlayPump was invented in South Africa by Ronnie Stuiver, a borehole driller and engineer, who exhibited it at an agricultural fair in 1989. Trevor Field, an agricultural executive, saw the device at the fair and licensed it from Stuiver. Field installed the first two systems in KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa in 1994, and began receiving media attention in 1999, when Nelson Mandela attended the opening of a school which had a PlayPump. In 2000, PlayPump received the World Bank Development Marketplace Award, and it became internationally prominent following a 2005 PBS Frontline report in 2005. At a 2006 Clinton Global Initiative ceremony, donors pledged $16.4 million to install more PlayPumps. By 2008, 1,000 PlayPumps had been installed, and Field set a goal of installing 4,000 by 2010. However, in 2009 PlayPumps International turned its inventory of uninstalled PlayPumps over to Water For People, and stopped installing new PlayPumps in order to focus on maintenance of existing ones. Criticism The Guardian calculated in 2009 that children would have to \\"play\\" for 27 hours every day to meet PlayPumps' stated targets of providing 2,500 people per pump with their daily water needs. In June 2010, PBS's Frontline/World aired an update about the failure of PlayPumps, particularly in Mozambique. Many older women, who were not consulted prior to the installation of the PlayPumps, found operating them to be difficult, especially when there were few children around. PlayPumps were also breaking down, with no way for villagers to make the expensive necessary repairs. A comprehensive report about these failures was released by UNICEF in 2007.

An antenna rotator is a device used to change the orientation, within the horizontal plane, of a directional antenna. Most antenna rotators have two parts, the rotator unit and the controller. The controller is normally placed near the equipment which the antenna is connected to, while the rotator is mounted on the antenna mast directly below the antenna. Rotators are commonly used in amateur radio and military communications installations. They are also used with TV and FM antennas, where stations are available from multiple directions, as the cost of a rotator is often significantly less than that of installing a second antenna to receive stations from multiple directions. Rotators are manufactured for different sizes of antennas and installations. For example, a consumer TV antenna rotator has enough torque to turn a TV/FM or small ham antenna. These units typically cost around US$70 . Heavy-duty ham rotators are designed to turn extremely large, heavy, high frequency (shortwave) beam antennas, and cost hundreds or possibly thousands of dollars. In the center of the reference picture, the accompanying image includes an AzEl installation rotator, so named for its controlling of both the azimuth and the elevation components of the direction of an antenna system or array.

Each sensillum is embedded in a cuticular socket and innervated by a single sensory neuron. The neuron is excited when strain in the cuticle deforms the socket edges (collar) and indents the flexible cuticular dome (cap). Top panel: Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of campaniform sensilla on the tarsus of Drosophila melanogaster. Bottom panel: SEM of campaniform on the base of the haltere of a sarcophagid fly. Campaniform sensilla are a class of mechanoreceptors found in insects, which respond to stress and strain within the animal's cuticle. Campaniform sensilla function as proprioceptors that detect mechanical load as resistance to muscle contraction, similar to mammalian Golgi tendon organs. Sensory feedback from campaniform sensilla is integrated in the control of posture and locomotion.  Structure  Each campaniform sensillum consists of a flexible dome, which is embedded in a socket within the cuticle and innervated by the dendrites of a single bipolar sensory neuron (see schematic cross-section). Campaniform sensilla are often oval-shaped with long axes of about 5-10 µm (see SEM). Distribution of groups of campaniform sensilla on a stick insect leg (anterior view). The inset shows a top view of the two groups on the dorsal trochanter (G3 and G4). The sensilla of these groups have mutually perpendicular orientations. Each sensillum is preferentially excited by compression along its short axis (arrows). The proximal group (G3) is oriented perpendicularly to the long axis of the trochanter and excited when the trochanter-femur is bent upward. The more distal group (G4) is oriented in parallel to the long axis of the trochanter and excited when the trochanter- femur is bent downward. Campaniform sensilla are distributed across the body surface of many insects. Sensilla with similar orientations are often grouped together in regions where stress is likely to be high, including on the legs, antennae, and wings. For example, stick insects have groups of campaniform sensilla on the trochanter, a group on the proximal femur, a group on the proximal tibia, and a small number of sensilla on the distal end of each tarsomere (see leg schematic). In Diptera like blow flies, the highest density of campaniform sensilla is found at the base of the modified hind-wings, or halteres, which function as gyroscopic sensors of self-motion during flight.  Function  The activity of campaniform sensilla was first recorded by John William Sutton Pringle in the late 1930s, who also determined that the oval shape of many sensilla makes them directionally selective. When cuticular deformations compress a campaniform sensillum along its short axis, the socket edges (collar) indent the cuticular cap. This squeezes the dendritic tip of the sensory neuron and opens its mechanotransduction channels, which leads to the firing of action potentials that are transmitted to the central nervous system. Campaniform sensilla signal the magnitude and the rate of cuticular deformation. In walking control, sensory feedback from leg campaniform sensilla is thought to reinforce muscle activity during the stance phase and to contribute to inter-leg coordination, much like sensory feedback from mammalian Golgi tendon organs. In flight control, sensory feedback from haltere and wing campaniform sensilla is thought to mediate compensatory reflexes to maintain equilibrium.

ACA Takes a Stand  In 2016, ACA moved its 2017 San Francisco Conference & Expo from Nashville, Tennessee to San Francisco, California after Tennessee's legislature passed a discriminatory bill, HB 1840/SB 1556, targeting members of the LGBTQ community and others. The bill allowed counselors in Tennessee to turn clients away based on \\"strongly held principles.'\\" \\"The legislation 'denies services to those most in need, targets the counseling profession' and violates the ACA's code of ethics, the group said.\\" \\"Tennessee's governor, Republican Bill Haslam signed the bill into law on April 27, insisting it was not meant to be discriminatory. But opponents said the law permits therapists and counselors to deny treatment to gay, lesbian, transgender and other patients. After Haslam signed the bill, ACA members debated the issue and decided not to hold the meeting in Tennessee. Officials said the association received bids from 13 cities after deciding to nix Nashville, but chose San Francisco as 'the best choice and ... an inclusive and inviting city' for its members.\\" References  External links  *American Counseling Association Category:Academic organizations based in the United States Category:Mental health organizations in Virginia Category:1952 establishments in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1952 Category:Organizations based in Alexandria, Virginia ","title":"American Counseling Association"},{"id":"4246664","text":"Linnean or Linnaean may refer to: General * Relating to Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus Linnean * Linnean Society of London * Linnean Society of New South Wales * Linnean Medal * Linnean Tercentenary Medal * Swedish Linnean Society Linnaean * Linnaean enterprise * Linnaean Garden * Linnaean Society of New England * Linnaean Society of New York * Linnaean taxonomy See also * Linnéska institutet ","title":"Linnean"},{"id":"4246665","text":"Album cover (2009) Myfanwy sung by Stuart Burrrows Stuart Burrows (born 7 February 1933) is a welsh operatic tenor. Biography The Cilfynydd-born singer scaled the peaks of musical distinction during his lengthy career which saw him give up teaching to pursue a new life on the opera stage. He was of a unique pedigree, having been born in William Street, which was the same birthplace as fellow opera star Sir Geraint Evans, Welsh rugby international Glyn Davies and politician Lord Merlyn-Rees. He began his working career as a teacher in Bargoed but his magnificent talent as a tenor soon brought him enduring fame and good fortune. His recitals included works by Beethoven, Berlioz, Schubert, Sullivan, Adams, Tippett, Tchaikovsky, Mallote, Mahler, Offenbach and Handel. He has earned worldwide recognition for being adept at oratorios, operas and specialising in the music of Puccini, Verdi, Donizetti and especially Mozart, earning him the title of \\"The King of Mozart\\". It was a far cry from the days when he sang as a boy soprano from his bedroom window to neighbours on the street below. As a member of the congregation at the local Bethel Chapel he first performed as a soloist by singing \\"Bless This House\\". He occupied the top rung of the operatic lyric tenor ladder for 20 years from the mid-1960s, particularly known for his fine performances of Mozart's works. Few people realise he could have been a professional rugby player before converting his career to the opera and concert stage. In 1963, Stuart Burrows debuted with the Welsh National Opera as Ismael in Verdi's Nabucco. In 1967, his phenomenal performance during the Athens Festival brought him international acclaim. The well-crafted version of Igor Stravinsky's Oedipus rex was certain evidence of Stuart being one of the world's finest lyric tenors of all time. It was a performance requested by Stravinsky himself. He performed in Don Giovanni in Brussels; Madam Butterfly in Vienna; in Milan, he played in Faust; he performed both in L'elisir d'amore and The Magic Flute in San Francisco; Die Entführung aus dem Serail at the Paris Opéra; in Buenos Aires, he performed in Tales of Hoffman at the Theatre Cologne and at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, Belgium; the Mozart Requiem at the Cardiff Festival of Choirs in Wales; Don Giovanni at the San Diego Opera; and many times with the Royal Opera including roles in Don Pasquale, Maria Stuarda and La sonnambula, and touring both Japan and the USA. He made his debut with La Scala in Milan in 1978 singing the title role in Berlioz's La damnation de Faust. In New York, Stuart has been accompanied with the talents of Sir Georg Solti, Zubin Mehta, Seiji Ozawa, Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Ormandy, among others at the prestigious Carnegie Hall. He has also appeared in major roles at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City and collaborated with several other top flight orchestral organisations including the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, the Boston Symphony, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He has also had several professional performances in the rarefied altitudes of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Although well known for live and recorded performances, Stuart was no stranger to television. He has appeared on the small screen in Australia, North America and Europe, including a successful BBC television series called Stuart Burrows Sings which featured a variety of different periods and genres over an eight-year period. The success of this musical review made it possible for more annual televised performances to follow. In 1981 he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Wales at Cardiff. A Fellowship was awarded to him in 1989 from Trinity College, Carmarthen where he also launched an International Singing Competition. The University of Wales at Aberystwyth presented him with an Honorary Fellowship and in 1992 the Eurotunnel granted him his own honorary plaque affixed to a Le Shuttle locomotive. His work for other organizations is prolific, having recently established an international voice award in Carmarthen's Trinity College where he studied as a young man. He is also the president of a variety of charitable organizations throughout south Wales, devoting much of his time to raising funds for these worthy causes.

These sea slugs are pelagic: they float upside down by using the surface tension of the water to stay up, where they are carried along by the winds and ocean currents. Glaucus atlanticus makes use of countershading: the blue side of their body faces upwards, blending in with the blue of the water. The silver/grey side of the sea slugs faces downwards, blending in with the sunlight reflecting on the ocean's surface when viewed facing upwards underwater. Glaucus atlanticus feed on other pelagic creatures, including the Portuguese man o' war and other venomous siphonophores. This sea slug stores stinging nematocysts from the siphonophores within its own tissues as defence against predators. Humans handling the slug may receive a very painful and potentially dangerous sting. Taxonomy This species looks similar to, and is closely related to, Glaucus marginatus, which is now understood to be not one species, but a cryptic species complex of four separate species that live in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. It shares the common name \\"Blue Dragon\\" with Pteraeolidia ianthina.  Description  At maturity Glaucus atlanticus can be up to in length. It is silvery grey on its dorsal side and dark and pale blue ventrally. It has dark blue stripes on its head. It has a flat, tapering body and six appendages that branch out into rayed, finger-like cerata. Cerata, also known as papillae, extend laterally from three different pairs of peduncles. The papillae are placed in a single row (uniseriate) and may be up to 84 inches total, (Forster, 1777). The radula of this species bears serrated teeth. Buoyancy and coloration With the aid of a gas-filled sac in its stomach, G. atlanticus floats at the surface. Due to the location of the gas sac, this species floats upside down. The upper surface is actually the foot (the underside in other slugs and snail), and this has either a blue or blue- white coloration. The true dorsal surface (carried downwards in G. atlanticus) is completely silver-grey. This coloration is an example of countershading, which helps protect it from predators that might attack from below and from above. The blue coloration is also thought to reflect harmful UV sunlight.  Distribution and habitat  The blue sea slug is shown here out of water, and thus collapsed; these were found on a beach. Picking up the animal can result in a painful sting, with symptoms similar to those caused by the Portuguese man o' war. The slug in the water This nudibranch is pelagic, and there is some evidence that it occurs throughout the world's oceans, in temperate and tropical waters. It has been recorded from the east and south coasts of South Africa, European waters, the east coast of Australia, and Mozambique. The G. atlanticus species geographical range increased northward by 150 km in the Gulf of California.Hernández, Luis, et al. \\"Occurrence of Glaucus Atlanticus in the Midriff Islands Region, Gulf of California, Mexico\\". American Malacological Bulletin, vol. 36, no. 1, 2018, pp. 145–149. Glaucus atlanticus was recently found in the Humboldt Current ecosystem in Peru in 2013, and off Andhra Pradesh in India in 2012. This is in line with the known habitat characteristics of the species: they live in warm temperate climates in the Southern Pacific, and in circumtropical and Lusitanian environments. Before finding Glaucus atlanticus off Andhra Pradesh, these nudibranchs were documented as having been seen in the Bay of Bengal and off the coast of Tamil Nadu, India, over 677 kilometers apart. Glaucus atlanticus was also recently found off Bermuda in January 2016. Although these sea slugs live on the open ocean, they sometimes accidentally wash up onto the shore, and therefore they may be found on beaches.  Life history and behavior  G. atlanticus preys on other larger pelagic organisms. The sea slugs can move toward prey or mates by using their cerata to make slow swimming movements. MacLellan, Amelia \\"Glaucus atlanticus (blue sea slug)\\". The Natural History Museum. Retrieved 2013-04-13 They are known to prey on the dangerously venomous Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis); the by-the-wind-sailor (Velella velella); the blue button (Porpita porpita); and the violet snail, Janthina janthina. Occasionally, individuals attack and eat other individuals in captivity. G. atlanticus is able to feed on the Portuguese man o' war due to its immunity to the venomous nematocysts. The slug consumes the entire organism and appears to select and store the most venomous nematocysts for its own use against future prey. The nematocysts are collected in specialized sacs (cnidosacs) at the tip of the animal's cerata, the thin feather-like \\"fingers\\" on its body. Because Glaucus concentrates the venom, it can produce a more powerful and deadly sting than the Man o' War on which it feeds. Like almost all heterobranchs, Glaucus is a hermaphrodite, having both male and female reproductive organs. Unlike most nudibranchs, which mate with their right sides facing, sea swallows mate with ventral sides facing. After mating, both animals produce egg strings. Studies have indicated that the G. atlanticus is not globally panmictic but is localized within ocean basins. Gene flow among Afro-Eurasian and American populations is thus hindered by physical obstructions and water temperatures in the Arctic and Southern Oceans.  Sting  The Glaucus atlanticus is able to swallow the venomous nematocysts from siphonophores such as the Portuguese man o' war, and store them in the extremities of its finger- like cerata. Picking up the animal can result in a painful sting, with symptoms similar to those caused by the Portuguese man o' war. The symptoms that may appear after being stung are nausea, pain, vomiting, acute allergic contact dermatitis, erythema, urticarial papules, potential vesicle formation and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

NASP is a constituent member of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and although NCATE accredits units (such as colleges of education), not programs, it does provide \\"national recognition\\" status to NASP-approved programs located in units accredited by NCATE. The organization also offers an opportunity for those who have successfully completed their graduate coursework, participated in a 1200-hour internship with at least 600 hours in a school setting, and received a score of at least 660 on the School Psychologist Praxis II Examination to apply for National Certification in School Psychology. While the American Psychological Association (APA) serves similar purposes through Division 16, one way that NASP differs fundamentally from the APA is in that it officially recognizes the specialist degree as the entry-level degree for the field, as opposed to the doctoral degree. The two organizations, however, are more complementary than competing. Many view NASP as the governing body for sub-doctoral school psychologists and the APA as the governing body for doctoral-level school psychologists, although there are many doctoral-level school psychologists who belong to NASP. Further, NASP approval of graduate programs does not compete with APA accreditation; the APA does not accredit non-doctoral programs, and NASP will more quickly approve programs that have already been APA-accredited. The National Association of School Psychologists currently distributes one journals: School Psychology Review, which is the second-largest psychology academic journal and includes research and theory related to school psychology. It previously distributed School Psychology Forum: Research in Practice, an electronic publication, but the final issue was published in spring 2019. NASP also publishes a periodical, Communiqué, which is the official newspaper of NASP that covers news, events, innovative practices, legislative developments, and other topics relevant to the field.  History  The National Association of School Psychologists was created on March 15, 1969 during a two-day national conference in St. Louis. NASP is the world's largest organization to serve the interests of school psychologists exclusively. NASP is govern by nationally elected officers and state-elected representatives to the NASP's primary legislative body, NASP Delegates Assembly. There are two delegate representatives in each of its four region with the executive council consisting of the elected officers and program managers. Including committee members, editors, etc. within the program manager areas, the governing body exceeds 200 individuals. The central office facilities is located in Bethesda, Maryland, where the policies and business of NASP are implemented . ; 2018/2019: NASP Executive Council *NASP President — Lisa Kelly- Vance *President-Elect — Leslie Z. Paige *Past President — John Kelly *Secretary — Wendy Price *Treasurer — Misty Lay NASP provides a year- round membership and access to evidence-based resources, periodicals exploring the most current issues, and networking opportunities. There are different rates and categories offered to become a member such as regular member, student member, retired member, international member, and so forth. The memberships run from July 1-June 30. NASP offers a Find-A-Mentor Program where an individual can choose to become a mentor or find a mentor. This program provides support at all levels of professional growth and development. NASP also offers awards, grants, and scholarships . NASP Practice Model represents NASP's official policy regarding the delivery of school psychological services. The NASP Practice Model is one of the four major of parts of Professional Standards NASP 2010 and creates flexibility for agencies and professionals to develop policies and procedures that meet local needs, while also providing sufficient specificity to ensure appropriate, comprehensive service provision. The NASP Practice Model consists of two parts: Professional Practices and Organizational Principles.

The Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry was a psychiatric hospital located on either side of Roosevelt Boulevard (US Route 1) in Northeast Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was specifically located in the Somerton section of the city on the border with Bucks County. The name of the institution was changed several times during its history being variously named Philadelphia State Hospital, Byberry State Hospital, Byberry City Farms, and the Philadelphia Hospital for Mental Diseases. It was home to people ranging from the mentally challenged to the criminally insane. The primary buildings were constructed between 1907 and the mid-1920s, and the newer buildings were constructed between 1940 and 1953. The facility included over fifty buildings such as male and female dormitories, an infirmary, kitchens, laundry, administration, a chapel, and a morgue. The hospital's population grew rapidly, quickly exceeding its capacity; the peak patient population was over 7,000 in 1960. Several investigations into the conditions at the hospital at various points revealed that raw sewage lined the hallways, patients slept in the halls, and the staff mistreated and exploited patients. The hospital has been featured in the paranormal television series Scared!. History The institution began as a small work farm for the mentally ill. Soon, plans were made to turn the farm into a cottage plan asylum. Construction began on the institution in 1906. Shortly after that, it was established in 1907 as the Byberry Mental Hospital and originally followed the theory of physician Benjamin Rush that mental illness was a disease and could be cured with proper treatment, but that the mentally diseased should be kept away from normal people until they were actually cured. Many of the original patients were transferred from Philadelphia General Hospital. Philadelphia General Hospital closed in 1977. All personnel were sent to other hospitals, and patients sent to Norristown State Hospital. State operation The hospital was turned over to the state in 1936 and was renamed the Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry. Conditions in the hospital during this time were poor, with allegations of patient abuse and inhumane treatment made frequently. The situation came to national attention between 1945 and 1946, when conscientious objector Charlie Lord took covert photos of the institution and the conditions inside while serving there as an orderly. The 36 black-and-white photos documented issues including dozens of naked men huddling together and human excrement lining facility hallways. The photos were shown to a number of people, including then-First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who subsequently pledged her support in pursuing national mental health reforms. In May 1946, Lord's photos were published in an issue of Life, creating a national \\"mass uproar\\". In his 1948 book, The Shame of the States, Albert Deutsch described the horrid conditions he observed: > \\"As I passed through some of Byberry's wards, I was reminded of the pictures > of the Nazi concentration camps. I entered a building swarming with naked > humans herded like cattle and treated with less concern, pervaded by a fetid > odor so heavy, so nauseating, that the stench seemed to have almost a > physical existence of its own.\\" During the 1960s, the hospital began a continuous downsizing that would end with its closure. During the mid-1980s, the hospital came under scrutiny when it was learned that violent criminals were being kept on the hospital's Forensic Ward (N8-2A). In 1985, the hospital failed a state inspection, and was accused of misleading the inspection team. Reports of patient abuse were still rampant through the 1980s. One patient had reported that one of his teeth was pulled without \\"Novocaine\\". Another state inspection team was sent to evaluate the hospital in early 1987. By the summer of 1987, five of the Philadelphia State Hospital's top officials were promptly fired after the Byberry facility once again failed the state inspection.  Closing and abandonment  On December 7, 1987, a press conference was held to announce the closure of the Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry. The teams most recently performing investigations described the conditions as \\"atrocious\\" and \\"irreversible.\\" Though originally supposed to close the following year, patient issues delayed the process. Most importantly, two released patients were found dead in the Delaware River in two successive days after their release. The hospital officially closed in June 1990, with the remaining patients and staff having been transferred to Norristown State Hospital or local community centers.  Period of abandonment 1990–2006  It did not take long for people to rediscover Byberry after it closed. The buildings were not demolished at first because of asbestos poisoning concerns. Looters broke in several weeks after the closing and began to steal everything of value, especially copper piping and wiring. After the looters had removed everything of value, vandals trespassed on the grounds, smashed windows, and started fires. Urban explorers wandered the halls and the extensive underground network that connected each building though tunnel corridors. By 2000, Byberry saw an explosion of people visiting the abandoned hospital. The internet offered extremely exaggerated stories and legends, as well tips on gaining access to the abandoned buildings while avoiding police and security. Satanists held ceremonies on the grounds, and amid reports of dead animals being found, the police were frequent visitors. By 2003, the Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry site was a complete and utter ruin; graffiti covered every buildings exterior and interior, every window was smashed, and anything flammable remaining when the hospital closed was now ashes. The residents of Somerton were now pressuring the City of Philadelphia to end the \\"Byberry Problem\\" once and for all. The city responded by sealing the buildings up with plywood and changing security contractors. However, the boarded windows just made it easier for trespassers to conceal themselves.  Demolition  Geppert Bros., Inc. was hired to demolish the buildings, while Delta B.J.D.S. Inc. was hired to remove hazardous materials; such as lead paint, and asbestos. Abatement and demolition started with \\"C\\" buildings, followed by the \\"W\\" buildings, and ended with the \\"N\\" buildings. On June 14, 2006, a ceremony was held to celebrate the complete demolition of the former Byberry hospital, and the future construction \\"The Arbours at Eagle Pointe\\" a 332-unit active adult club house community featuring single homes, town, and carriage homes. Popular culture The Byberry facility is a featured location in the Haunted Philadelphia pop-up books series by photographer Colette Fu.

This is usually a move that connects cleanly, with good form and with little opportunity for the opponent to defend against it. Kicks to the head of an opponent or judo throws followed up with a strike to the downed opponent are particularly likely to be considered a winning ippon technique. A competitor is declared the winner upon achieving a judgment of ippon. Occasionally, shobu nihon kumite is used, in which two decisive strikes (or four less-decisive strikes, scored as waza-ari) are required for a win. In many tournaments, sanbon scoring is used. This promotes a flashier style of fighting more suited to a spectator sport. More traditional tournaments usually use ippon scoring.

She and co- author Katherine Albrecht wrote the RFID privacy book Spychips: How Major Corporations and Government Plan to Track your Every Move. At one time, McIntyre was the Communications Director for CASPIAN (Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering), an organization that advocated free-market, consumer-based solutions to the problem of retail privacy invasion. She and Katherine Albrecht, founder and director of CASPIAN, made the term \\"spychips\\" synonymous with RFID, and started the anti-RFID website http://www.spychips.com. McIntyre continues to write and speak out on privacy issues and works as a privacy consultant. Publications Books McIntyre co-authored the book Spychips: How Major Corporations and Government Plan to Track Your Every Move with Katherine Albrecht. The book, winner of the 2006 Lysander Spooner Award for advancing the literature of liberty, lays out the privacy and civil liberties implications of RFID. Not surprisingly, RFID industry representatives have criticized the work, claiming it exaggerates some RFID privacy threats. McIntyre and Albrecht have rebutted such criticisms. McIntyre and Albrecht's second book The Spychips Threat: Why Christians Should Resist RFID and Electronic Surveillance explores how RFID could bring about a world that resembles the one described in Revelation—a world in which people cannot buy or sell without a number. The book includes a disclaimer that it explores the connection without calling RFID the \\"Mark of the Beast,\\" but McIntyre says it hasn't kept some from reading far more into her beliefs. At the Spychips website, McIntyre states the following: \\"Could a technology like RFID enslave us? Theoretically, yes. Is the RFID implant the prophesied method of controlling humans and forcing beast worship? I don't think so. Could I be wrong? Yes. I don't believe anyone here on earth knows definitively what the future holds and exactly how events will unfold.\\" She adds, \\"There are many smart people--people much smarter than myself-- Christians and non-Christians--who hold very strong contradictory beliefs on most matters of religion. I take this as a clue that I should remain humble and reverent when it comes to the mysteries of the universe. It's one thing to explore possibilities and keep a watchful eye. It's quite another to claim a hotline to God and infer that others have an inferior connection to the Almighty.\\" The authors use public documents and the words and deeds of the industry to support their arguments.

The show was hosted by Clark Race, a Los Angeles radio personality, with Johnny Jacobs as the announcer (although Charlie O'Donnell handled these duties on the first two episodes). The answers were commented by child psychologist Dorothy Thompson, who did not appear in-studio. The series was produced by Chuck Barris Productions. The show's theme song would later be used as a cue on the syndicated versions of Barris-produced The Newlywed Game, The Dating Game, and The New Treasure Hunt. Gameplay The format was very similar to The Newlywed Game, the difference between Newlywed and this show being that that Race would ask three couples a series of multiple-choice questions about their children. Their job was to match answers with a resident child psychologist. The first four questions allowed all six players to give individual answers, but on the fifth and final question each couple had to agree on one answer. Scoring For the first two questions, a correct response earned five points per teammate. Ten points were awarded per correct answer in the third question, and 15 points each in the fourth question. The final question was worth 30 points. The couple with the most points won the game and a grand prize. If there was a tie, the Newlywed Game tiebreaker was used.

In Portuguese Timor, the city was known as Vila General Carmona, after the Portuguese dictator António Óscar Carmona, but after World War II it was renamed. Aileu means \\"bent tree\\" in Mambai. History In 1903, a rebellion staged in Aileu against the colonial rulers failed. In January 1912, it served as a Portuguese base against the rebellion of Manufahi. Between 1942 and 1945, the Japanese occupied Portuguese Timor. On August 31, 1942, the town was invaded by Colunas Negras, the Timorese allies of the Japanese invaders. Five Portuguese soldiers, as well as several civil servants and missionaries, were killed. A memorial in Aileu commemorates the massacre today. Indonesian soldiers set up a relocation camp in Aileu for the East Timorese at the end of 1979. In early September, during the 1999 East Timorese crisis, residents of various sucos in the area were expelled from their homes by the Aku Hidup dengan Integrasi militia of Indonesia. The Seloi Craic suco was destroyed on September 6, the houses burned down and livestock slaughtered.

It has been in service for over 300 years. History The battalion was raised in 1704 at Padmanabhapuram, the capital of the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore. Raised as personal bodyguards to the Maharaja of Travancore, the unit, though redesigned through the ages, continues to retain its individual identity with no history of disbandment or re-raising. The Travancore Army, known as the Nair Brigade, completely exterminated the superior and better equipped Dutch Forces which landed at Colachal in July 1741 during the reign of Anizham Thirunal Veer Bala Marthand Varma. In the Battle of Colachel, during the Travancore–Dutch War, Capt Eustachius De Lannoy, the Dutch Naval Forces Commander, was captured and was asked later to train the Travancore Army. From 1741 to 1758, Capt De Lannoy remained in command of the Travancore Forces and was involved in annexation of small principalities. In 1935, the Travancore State joined the Indian State Forces Scheme and the battalion was named 1st Travancore Nair Infantry, Travancore State Forces. The unit was reorganised as an Indian State Infantry Battalion by Lieutenant Colonel H S Steward who was appointed Commandant of the Travancore State Forces. World War II In 1940, the battalion left for Padmanabhapuram and arrived at Military Station, Cannanore. The battalion served overseas in the 1940s. In 1945, Major General V.N. Parameswaran Pillai was appointed GOC Travancore State Forces. In the same year, the unit was asked to move to South East Asia Command. Embarked on at Taima, the unit sailed to Hong Kong. Disembarked at Kowloon Harbour, it was placed under the command of the 150th Indian Infantry Brigade. While at Kowloon, the unit was assigned the task of guarding Japanese prisoners of war, airfields and docks. It also looked after the repatriation of POWs to Japan. The unit left Hong Kong, disembarked at Madras and arrived at Trivandrum on 31 January 1947. Indian Army In April 1951, the battalion was integrated with Indian Army and on 1 May 1954, it was merged with the Madras Regiment and was re- designated 9th Battalion of the Madras Regiment (Travancore). After the integration of Travancore State Force with the Indian Army, the State Forces Colours were ceremonially laid up at Chetwode Hall, Indian Military Academy, Dehradun in 1956. The then-incumbent President of India, V. V. Giri, presented Colours to the battalion on 23 May 1970 at Barrack Square, Wellington at a solemn ceremony. In fond recognition of their bravery, people started calling them terrors. Post Independence, the battalion served from Siachen to Andaman and Nicobar Islands and from Nagaland to Rajasthan. Operational Achievement * The battalion actively participated in the Hyderabad Police Action (Operation Polo) during 1948 and was instrumental in restoring peace and tranquility in the riot-torn region. * For the first time, the unit was deployed in high altitude areas in the Sugar Sector in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh and occupied forward posts in inhospitable terrain during the 1962 Indo-China War. * During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the battalion located at Firozpur under the 65th Infantry Brigade fought the famous Battle of Burki and played a leading role in the capture of Barka-Kalan and Ichogil Bund.

History Lilienthal belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen.  Lilienthal monastery  The history of the small town (without Town privileges) of Lilienthal goes back to its founding as a nunnery by the prince-archbishop Gerhard II. In 1232 construction was begun on a convent of the Order of the Cistercians under the name of Vallis Liliorum (), and the finished building was sanctified in 1264. During the 15th century, the cloister enjoyed a time of prosperity. After the Reformation and the conversion of the Cistercian nuns, it became a Lutheran Women's Convent, and until the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648 it remained in deplorable conditions. In 1650, the city went through secularization. The land once belonging to the convent, which had become fragmented, developed into the small town of Lilienthal.  Sweden and Hanover  In 1648, according to the terms of the peace treaty that ended the Thirty Years' War (The Peace of Westphalia), the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, ruled together with the Principality of Verden, which were first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown. Queen Christina sent one of her commanders over, Graf Friedrich von Hessen-Eschwege, to the newly created barony (Herrschaft) of Osterholz, in which the charge of both Lilienthal and Osterholz were combined. After his early death in 1655, his wife Eleonora took over the government of the barony, with her seat in Osterholz, where she took an active role in the improvement of economic and sanitary conditions for the rural population. After her death in 1692, the barony fell back into the hands of the Swedish Royalty. Lilienthal remained a part of Swedish Bremen-Verden until 1712 (which is why the coat of arms contains the blue and yellow of the Swedish Flag), at which time it came under Danish occupation, and then in 1719 it fell under the sovereignty of the Electorate of Hanover, which ruled Bremen-Verden in personal union. In 1740, the buildings of the convent except of the church were dismantled.  Astronomy in Lilienthal  In 1782, Johann Hieronymus Schröter became chief magistrate (or bailiff, Amtmann). In addition to this administrative office, he also played a large part in the advancement of astronomy during his lifetime. On the grounds of his office in Lilienthal, he constructed an observatory. In the following years, the Lilienthal Observatory would become the best equipped observatory in the world. One of its technological advances was the \\"Riesenteleskop\\" (giant telescope), a telescope with a 50.8 cm (20 inch) aperture and an 8.25 m focal length. Due to the telescope, Lilienthal became well-known and was sought out in matters of astronomy by government and military officials. Schröter remained in contact with many of the important astronomers of the time. Together with Wilhelm Olbers and other scholars, he founded the Astronomy Association in Lilienthal in 1800. The asteroid 3 Juno was discovered September 1, 1804 by K. Harding at the Observatory. After Schröter's death in 1816, the observatory fell into disrepair. In 1850 the remaining structure was destroyed. A large part of the observatory was sent to the University of Göttingen before the demolition.  19th century  The Befreiungskrieg (a series of battles fought between 1813 and 1815 that ended the Napoleonic Wars) hit Lilienthal hard. After an incident during a retreat, French troops set the entire village on fire. Only the church, a few houses, and the observatory escaped the flames (but the observatory was looted and important records were destroyed). After the reconstruction, the then-municipality grew steadily. In 1939 there were 3,100 inhabitants, in 1974 12,500. After the incorporation of a neighbouring town in the same year, the population grew to 17,000. In 1823 Bremen-Verden was united in a real union with the Kingdom of Hanover and its territory became part of the Stade Region. In 1866, the kingdom of Hannover lost its independence. Lilienthal became Prussian, in 1885 the bailiwick of Lilienthal was dissolved and combined with that in Osterholz to form the new district of Osterholz.  20th and 21st century  From 1900 to 1956, Lilienthal was connected to Bremen and to the moorland region north of the town by a narrow gauge railway. Nowadays, its alignment is used as a bikeway. Since 1 August 2014, public transport in Lilienthal has been upgraded by a line of Bremen Tramway, passing through its main street. Today, in Lilienthal there are 6 wind turbines, producing 6.013.246,00 kWh, annually.

These species, which are referred to collectively as the notothenioids, account for approximately 90% of the fish fauna biomass in the continental shelf waters surrounding Antarctica.  Evolution and geographic distribution  The Southern Ocean has supported fish habitats for 400 million years; however, modern notothenioids likely appeared sometime after the Eocene epoch. This period marked the cooling of the Southern Ocean, resulting in the stable, ice- cold conditions that have persisted to present day, excepting abrupt, rapid warming in the region in recent years. Another key factor in the evolution of notothenioids is the preponderance of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), a large, slow-moving current that extends to the seafloor and precludes most migration to and from the Antarctic region. These unique environmental conditions in concert with the key evolutionary innovation of Antifreeze glycoprotein promoted widespread radiation within the suborder, leading to the rapid development of new species. The adaptive radiation of the notothenioids is characterized by depth related diversification. Comparison studies between non-Antarctic and Antarctic notothenioids have revealed different ecological processes and genetic differences between the two groups of fish, such as the loss of hemoglobin (in the family Channichthyidae) and changes in buoyancy. The notothenioids are distributed mainly throughout the Southern Ocean around the coasts of New Zealand, southern South America, and Antarctica. An estimated 79% of notothenioids reside within the Antarctic region. The notothenioids primarily inhabit seawater temperatures between −2 and 4 °C (28 and 39 °F); however, some of the non-Antarctic species inhabit waters that may be as warm as 10 °C (50 °F) around New Zealand and South America. Seawater temperatures below the freezing point of freshwater (0 °C or 32 °F) are possible due to the greater salinity in the Southern Ocean waters. Notothenioids have an estimated depth range of about 0–1,500 m (0–4,921 ft).  Anatomy  Notothenioids display a morphology that is largely typical of other coastal perciform fishes. They are not distinguished by a single physical trait, but rather a distinctive set of morphological traits. These include the presence of three flat pectoral fin radials, nostrils located laterally on each side of the head, the lack of a swim bladder, and the presence of multiple lateral lines. Because notothenioids lack a swim bladder, the majority of species are benthic or demersal in nature. However, a depth- related diversification has given rise to some species attaining increased buoyancy, using lipid deposits in tissues and reduced ossification of bony structures. This reduced ossification of the skeleton (observed in some notothenioids) changes the weight and creates neutral buoyancy in the water, where the fish neither sinks nor floats, and can thus adjust its depth with ease.  Physiology  Notothenioids have a variety of physiological and biochemical adaptations that either permit survival in, or are possible only because of, the generally cold, stable seawater temperatures of the Southern Ocean. These include highly unsaturated membrane lipids and metabolic compensation in enzymatic activity. Many notothenoids have lost the nearly universal heat shock response (HSR) due to evolution at cold and stable temperatures. Many notothenioid fishes are able to survive in the freezing, ice-laden waters of the Southern Ocean because of the presence of an antifreeze glycoprotein in blood and body fluids. Although many of the Antarctic species have antifreeze proteins in their body fluids, not all of them do. Some non-Antarctic species either produce no or very little antifreeze, and antifreeze concentrations in some species are very low in young, larval fish. While the majority of animal species have up to 45% of hemoglobin (or other oxygen-binding and oxygen-transporting pigments) in their blood, the notothenioids of the family Channichthyidae do not express any globin proteins in their blood. As a result, the oxygen-carrying capacity of their blood is reduced to less than 10% that of other fishes. This trait likely arose due to the high oxygen solubility of the Southern Ocean waters. At cold temperatures, the oxygen solubility of water is enhanced. The loss of hemoglobin is partially compensated in these species by the presence of a large, slow-beating heart and enlarged blood vessels that transport a large volume of blood under low pressure to enhance cardiac output. Despite these compensations, the loss of globin proteins still results in reduced physiological performance.

It predominantly serves students from the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania. Moravian Academy is an independent school, but traces its origins to the Moravians, who settled Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1741. The Academy descends from the first school for girls founded in the American colonies, Moravian Seminary, founded in 1742 by Countess Benigna von Zinzendorf. It is the ninth oldest independent school in the United States. In 1971, Moravian Seminary for Girls and Moravian Preparatory School merged, creating Moravian as it is today. It was formerly a boarding school, but is now for day students only. Moravian Academy has a religious heritage in the Moravian Church, but now refers to itself as a \\"church-related school\\",http://www.moravianacademy.org/podium/default.aspx?t=118570 welcoming students from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds. The school holds weekly interfaith chapel services for students that both celebrate the diverse religious traditions of the school community and honor the school's Moravian heritage. Moravian is made up of three divisions: The Upper, Middle and Lower Schools. The Upper School is located on the Merle-Smith Campus, and the Lower and Middle Schools are located in downtown Bethlehem on the Church Street Campus. The Middle School is based in the Devey Building, dedicated to Mr. Devey & Mrs. Devey, a former headmaster and his wife, and the 7 East Market Street Building, a former YWCA building. The Lower School comprises Primer through 5th grade, the Middle School comprises 6th through 8th and the Upper School contains grades 9 through 12. History In May 1742, Moravian Seminary was founded by Countess Benigna von Zinzendorf, daughter of Moravian Leader Count Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. The school was founded as a Moravian girls' school in Germantown, Philadelphia, but was moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in June 1742. Soon afterwards, a separate Moravian boys' school was founded. The two schools changed locations frequently in their early days, following the Moravian missionaries around as they fulfilled their vows to preach to the Native Americans in the region. In order to give the schools more stability, Moravian Bishop Joseph Spangenberg turned them into boarding schools to house and educate the children of missionaries. During the time of the American Revolution, Moravian schools opened up enrollment to non-Moravians with permission from the church leaders. Many people wanted to give their children the skills and education that the Moravians had cherished for a long time. The schools became so popular that they were unable to house the large number of students that wanted to join the school, despite recent expansions of the facilities. In the 1830s, the Moravian day schools (non-boarding) became public schools but still kept teaching their own religion. In 1850s, a co-ed Moravian Parochial School broke away from the public school system. This Moravian Parochial School went on to set up a college preparatory program to prepare students for nearby Lehigh University in 1885. The Moravian Parochial School was later renamed to Moravian Preparatory School. Meanwhile, Moravian Seminary was facing hard financial times at the same time that teachers were demanding higher pay. The Moravian Church originally had brought on teachers that would work for almost nothing as they felt that they were doing God's work. In 1971, Moravian Seminary and Moravian Preparatory School merged to become Moravian Academy. Moravian Academy draws inspiration from John Amos Comenius, the Moravian bishop from 17th century Europe. They follow his vision of \\"an education in which all would participate, and an education that would allow each individual to develop fully in mind, body, and spirit\\". Scholastic Scrimmage In 2006, Moravian Academy took second place in Pennsylvania's Scholastic Scrimmage, losing to Allentown Central Catholic High School in the finals. In 2008, they won first place with Liberty High School coming in second. In 2009, they won for the second consecutive year, with Wilson Area High School coming in second-place. In 2013, Moravian Academy won first place again with Freedom High School coming in second. The 2013 winning team consisted of captain Madhav Sekar, Evan Burke, Gareth Messman, and Kara Chyung. In 2018, Moravian once again received a 2nd place ranking at Scholastic Scrimmage, due to the diligent leadership of Angela Chen and Alex Adams. Athletics The girls' varsity field hockey team completed a near-perfect 25-1 season in 2016 and won the Colonial League, District XI and PIAA A titles.

Facilities Facilities include a performing arts centre, systems engineering centre, theatre, Visual Arts Centre, music centre, Junior, Years 5 and 6, Middle and Senior School buildings, Junior School STEM laboratory, two libraries, modern sports centre with heated indoor swimming centre, gymnasium, dance and aerobics studio, basketball and netball courts, playing fields and multipurpose sports courts. Technology St Leonard's College has a \\"bring your own device\\" (BYOD) technology program. Students in the middle years bring their own iPad to school every day while students in the senior years are able to bring any device of their choosing as long as it meets some very general specifications. In tandem with the BYOD program, the school runs a comprehensive online content management system, named STL Link, to provide its student, teacher and parent community with a wide range of learning and co- curriculum resources. STL Link includes classroom learning resources, assessment material, cocurriculum resources, subscribable calendars, student timetables, student reports, class blogs and staff contact information. Students in the middle years also use interactive electronic textbooks and an electronic diary system which enables teachers to push homework into their students diaries. They also maintain their own online electronic work portfolios. While the BYOD program enables most students to complete all of their digital learning, the school also have computers where required. Students studying Information Technology, Media and Visual Design do so using the school owned computers and software. St Leonard's College is widely recognised in educational circles as a centre of excellence in eLearning and is regularly visited by other schools to learn from their success. Hart Theatre Company In 2012, St Leonard's College launched the Hart Theatre Company, named after long-time drama teacher Roma Hart. The college hosts five productions a year: a year 5/6 musical, Middle School play, Middle School musical, Senior School play and Senior School musical. Recent productions have included Hairspray, Peter Pan, Romeo & Juliet, Mulan, The Wizard of Oz, Annie, Oliver!, The Ruling Class, Invisible Friends, Barnum, Amadeus, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Bugsy Malone, Wind in the Willows, Sweet Charity and Beauty and the Beast. Hart Theatre productions have consistently been received with critical acclaim, with the company and individual performers and directors receiving nominations and awards from the Music Theatre Guild of Victoria. The 2012 production of Barnum was awarded Junior Production of the Year and Direction of a Junior Production and was also nominated for Musical Direction of a Junior Production, Junior Male Performer in a Leading Role and Junior Female Performer in a Leading Role. In 2013 the Hart Theatre Company made history by winning Junior Production of the Year for a second year straight, this time for its production of Sweet Charity. The production was also awarded Junior Female Performer in a Leading Role and was nominated for Direction of a Junior Production, Musical Direction of a Junior Production, Junior Male Performer in a Leading Role and Junior Female Performer in a Supporting Role. In the same year the Middle School production of Beauty and the Beast was awarded Junior Male Performer in a Supporting Role and was nominated for Musical Direction of a Junior Production. Elsewhere in the performing arts, other performances relating to private drama and VCE/IB examinations are held. Students also have the opportunity take private speech and drama lessons and complete AMEB speech and dramas exams. Music A highlight of the music calendar is the House Music Competition, an event held annually for students in years 5 to 12. Held at The Plenary, each house presents two massed choir pieces, a small vocal piece and a small instrumental piece. Specialist judges from other schools are invited to select a winner in each category and overall. There is a multitude of other opportunities for students to be involved in music education and performance. The college has a full symphonic orchestra, as well as a range of other ensembles. As well as involvement at college events and assemblies, St Leonard's students have many opportunities to perform as part of music tours and competitions. Each year, St Leonard's College students perform at Generations in Jazz at Mt Gambier, a competition for school ensembles from around the country. Students also have the opportunity to participate in music tours to Europe, the United States and Japan. Sport In years 5 and 6, St Leonard's students participate in the Coeducational Independent Primary Schools Sports Association competition, competing in a range of team sports against other coeducational independent primary schools. Although the sport program at St Leonard's is not seen as a priority for the college administration, nor is St Leonard's well known for its sporting prowess, students are mandated to join a sporting team up until year 11. The college is part of the Association of Coeducational Schools (ACS) sport competition which involves other independent co-educational schools around Melbourne. All students from years 7 to 11 are involved in the ACS and it is optional for Year 12 students. Students participate in a range of team sports, through the summer and winter seasons, as well as the carnival sports of cross country, swimming and athletics. St Leonard's College also has a community sport program, providing a number of opportunities for students, parents, staff and alumni to be involved in sport and fitness activities. Yoga, aerobics, gymnastics, adventure racing, surf ski paddling, cheer sports and triathlon are some of the activities available. There are also community basketball and netball clubs and a touch football group. In 2014 the sailing team won the Victorian Schools Team Sailing Championships for the seventh time, and also regularly competes at the National Championships. The Hawkes Sport Centre has a large indoor pool, tennis courts, aerobics room, gym, multi-purpose hall and change rooms. The college also has outdoor hard courts and an oval. Social responsibility The St Leonard's College community is also involved in a range of social justice activities. The College aims to support children and education in local, national and international settings. Since 1992, St Leonard's College has been involved in Bangladesh, funding and building three schools. Each year, senior students organise a Bangladesh Dinner to raise funds for the ongoing operational expenses of these schools. The college also supports schools in Timor Leste and Nepal. All year 9 students complete local service activities as part their experiential learning program – CUE (Community, Urban, Environment). The CUE program culminates in Big Experience trips, in which year 9 students take part in an international journey to a country in South East Asia. These trips have a strong emphasis on global sustainability and community service. St Leonard's students are also involved in fundraising for a range of charities and awareness programs, for example Shave for a Cure, Relay for Life, Amnesty International and Uniting Church social justice programs and camps. Outdoor education Outdoor education is compulsory for students in years 3 to 10. Students attend year level camps at the college's dedicated campsite, Camp Ibis, located on the Gippsland Lakes where they take part in a range of adventure activities including sailing, mountain biking and canoeing. There is also a voluntary Outdoor Education Extension Program. Students can elect to take part in adventure camps, white water rafting, adventure racing, snowsports (primary to year 12) and hikes (years 10 – 12). In 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016 the St Leonard's College adventure racing team won the national Hillary Challenge, an interschool competition which tests basic outdoor skills and competencies. Talent development St Leonard's College has a dedicated Talent Development Coordinator who runs an extensive program allowing highly able students to participate in activities including Future Problem Solving, da Vinci Decathlon, Tournament of Minds and Spellmasters. Selected Middle School students also participate in the Metta Program which provides academic challenge and extension in English, maths and science, and allows like-minded students to meet in order to exchange ideas, investigate and problem solve.

In the 1960s he photographed pop and showbiz personalities, including the Beatles. Biography Hoffmann was born on 24 May 1912 in Banská Štiavnica, Kingdom of Hungary now Slovakia. After studying journalism in Prague, he worked at Twentieth Century Fox in Paris as a photojournalist. During Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia he was sent to make a documentary of the invasion. After returning from Africa he was sent to Spain to film the 1936 People's Olympiad (a protest against the official Olympic games in Berlin under Hitler's propaganda). Soon after he arrived in Spain, the civil war broke out and Dezo found himself on the barricades. In this period he met personalities such as Hemingway and Robert Capa. Dezo was injured a few times in war. The third injury was serious, leaving him without memory for several months. After recovery he moved to England and joined the squadron of Czechoslovak pilots flying with the RAF during World War II. After the war he remained in London, working for various newspapers and magazines. In 1955 he began his collaboration with Record Mirror magazine, which was the start of his career photographing show-business celebrities. In 1962 he went to Liverpool to photograph an unknown group—the Beatles. Mutual appreciation and sympathy led to a long-lasting relationship between Hoffmann and the group. Dezo also made an 8 mm colour film during this first Beatles assignment, also featuring scenes shot by the Beatles.

It was published in Japan in August 2003, by Shinchosha. In 2009, the English translation by Stephen Snyder was published.The Housekeeper and the Professor, translated by Stephen Snyder, New York : Picador, 2008. The story centers around a mathematician, \\"the Professor,\\" who suffered brain damage in a traffic accident in 1975 and since then can produce only 80 minutes' worth of memories, and his interactions with a housekeeper (the narrator) and her son \\"Root\\" as the Professor shares the beauty of equations with them. The novel's bibliography lists the book The Man Who Loved Only Numbers, a biography of the mathematician Paul Erdős. It has been said that Erdős was used as a model for the Professor. The novel received the Hon'ya Taisho award, was adapted into a film version in January 2006, and after being published in paperback in December 2005, sold one million copies in two months, faster than any other Shinchosha paperback. http://yayoi.senri.ed.jp/departments/SISMath/0702movie.htm http://www.hontai.or.jp/history/index.html J'Lit  Awards : Booksellers Award  Books from Japan  Plot summary  The narrator's housekeeping agency dispatches her to the house of the Professor, a former mathematician who can remember new memories for only 80 minutes. She is more than a little frustrated to find that he loves only mathematics and shows no interest whatsoever in anything or anyone else. One day, upon learning that she has a 10-year-old son waiting home alone until late at night every day, the Professor flies into a rage and tells the narrator to have her son come to his home directly from school from that day on. The next day, her son comes and the Professor nicknames him \\"Root\\". From then on, their days begin to be filled with warmth.  Characters  ;The Professor :64 years old. A former university professor who specializes in number theory. He loves mathematics, children, and the Hanshin Tigers (especially Yutaka Enatsu, who was playing for the Tigers at the time of the Professor's accident and whose uniform number was 28, the second smallest perfect number). After being in an auto accident at the age of 47, he can retain new memories for only 80 minutes. He keeps important information on notes that are attached all over his suits. He keeps baseball cards and other important mementos in a cookie tin. He has trouble interacting with other people and a habit of talking about numbers when he does not know what else to say. He has a talent for reading things backwards and finding the first star in the sky. His 80 minutes of memory eventually begins to fail, and thus he is moved to a nursing home where he spends the rest of his remaining days. But the Housekeeper, her son Root, and his sister-in-law continue to visit him. While the Housekeeper is working for him; he teaches her and Root about many of the math skills he knows and loves. ;The Narrator/Housekeeper :The Professor's housekeeper and a single mother. She was hired by the Professor's sister-in-law through the housekeeping agency and is the tenth housekeeper the Professor has gone through. She initially feels frustration at the Professor, who shows interest only in mathematics, but through observing the Professor's kindness and his passion for mathematics, comes to feel respect and affection for him. She first manages to connect with the Professor when he discovers that her birthday is February 20 (220), which is an amicable number with the number 284, which is imprinted on the underside of his watch, which he received as the University President's Award for a thesis he wrote in university on transcendental number theory. She cannot pronounce the title of the Journal of Mathematics (to which the Professor submits contest entries) very well, so she refers to it as \\"Jaanaru obu.\\" Towards the end of the novel and at a pivotal point in the story, she and Root give the Professor a rare baseball card of Yutaka Enatsu as a congratulatory present. ;Root :Ten years old. The Housekeeper's son. The Professor refers to him as \\"Root\\" on account of the top of his head being flat like a square root (\\\\sqrt{~~~~~}) symbol. He is the only character given something close to a name. He is an avid fan of baseball as well as the Hanshin Tigers just like the Professor, and gets the Professor to repair his old radio so that they can listen to baseball broadcasts together. His relationship with the Professor is close to that of a father and son, for the Professor is the first fatherly figure in his life. He eventually grows up to become a junior high school mathematics teacher. ;The Widow/Sister-in-Law :Sister-in-law of the Professor (wife of the Professor's brother). Initially, she fired the Housekeeper for disregarding the employment contract rules (bringing her child into a client's home, staying past her assigned hours) and accused the Housekeeper's affection as an attempt to extort money from the Professor. However, after the Professor writes down Euler's formula during this confrontation, the Widow immediately comes to accept the Housekeeper and Root. She cannot walk well, which the Housekeeper later discovers was a result of her being in the same auto accident as the Professor. While browsing through the Professor's baseball card collection in the cookie tin, the Housekeeper discovers an old photograph of a younger Professor and his sister- in-law. It is hinted that perhaps long ago the Professor and his sister-in-law once had romantic feelings for each other.  Mathematical terminology that occurs in the story  * root * imaginary number * factorial * amicable number * prime number * twin prime * perfect number * abundant number * deficient number * triangular number * Ruth-Aaron pair * Mersenne prime * Napier's constant * Euler's formula * Fermat's Last Theorem * Artin's conjecture  Film  A film based on the novel was released on January 21, 2006. It was directed by Takashi Koizumi. In contrast to the original work, which is told from the perspective of the narrator, the film is shown from the perspective of 29-year-old \\"Root\\" as he recounts his memories of the Professor to a group of new pupils. Though there are a few differences between the film and the original work (for example, the movie touches on the relationship between the Professor and the widow, while the book does not give much detail), the film is generally faithful to the original.

The rest of the United States is in light/pale-green because the Knights of the Golden Circle originally planned to have the US take over these areas. The Golden Circle () was an unrealized 1850s proposal by the Knights of the Golden Circle to expand the number of slave states. It envisioned the annexation of several areas — Mexico (which was to be divided into 25 new slave states), Central America, northern parts of South America, Cuba, and the rest of the Caribbean — into the United States, in order to vastly increase the number of slave states and thus the power of the slave-holding Southern upper classes. After the Dred Scott Decision (1857) increased anti-slavery agitation, the Knights of the Golden Circle advocated that the Southern United States should secede, forming their own confederation, and then invade and annex the area of the golden circle to vastly expand the power of the South.Woodward, Colin American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America New York:2011 Penguin Page 207 Background European colonialism and dependence on slavery had declined more rapidly in some countries than others. The Spanish possessions of Cuba and Puerto Rico and the Empire of Brazil continued to depend on slavery, as did the Southern United States. In the years prior to the American Civil War, the rise of support for abolition of slavery was one of several divisive issues in the United States. The slave population there had continued to grow due to natural increase even after the ban on international trade. It was concentrated in the Deep South, on large plantations devoted to the commodity crops of cotton and sugar cane, but it was the basis of agricultural and other labor throughout the southern states. Development Proponents argued that their proposed Golden Circle would bring together jurisdictions that depended on slavery. In 1854 George W. L. Bickley, a Virginia-born doctor, editor, and adventurer living in Cincinnati, Ohio, formed the Knights of the Golden Circle, a U.S. organization which aimed to promote and help create a Pan-American union of states. Membership increased slowly until 1859 and reached its height in 1860. The membership, scattered from New York to California and into Latin America, was never large. Some Knights of the Golden Circle active in northern states, such as Illinois, were accused of anti-Union activities after the American Civil War began (1861). Robert Barnwell Rhett, called by some the \\"father of secession\\", said a few days after Lincoln's election: > \\"We will expand, as our growth and civilization shall demand – over Mexico – > over the isles of the sea – over the far-off Southern tropics – until we > shall establish a great Confederation of Republics – the greatest, freest > and most useful the world has ever seen.\\" Description The Golden Circle was to be centered in Havana and was 2,400 miles (3,900 km) in diameter. It included northern South America, most of Mexico, all of Central America, Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, most other Caribbean islands, and the American South. In the United States, the circle's northern border roughly coincided with the Mason-Dixon line, and within it were included such cities as Washington D.C., St. Louis, Mexico City, and Panama City. Representation in media * The alternate history novel Bring the Jubilee and the similarly themed movie C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America explore the results of a Southern victory in the Civil War. Both works posit the Golden Circle as a plan enacted after the war.C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America, Official Website, archived link Both also have the Confederacy take over all of South America rather than the northern portion of the continent. However, in the former, the Confederacy annexes both Hawaii and Alaska, and in the latter the Confederacy also annexes all of the United States. * In the Southern Victory Series, the Confederacy's post-war territorial expansion into Latin America amounts only to the purchase of Cuba from Spain and the purchase of Sonora and Chihuahua from the Mexican Empire (for the purposes of constructing a transcontinental railway and establishing a Confederate naval presence in the Pacific).

The first of these was the Volkswagen Microbus Concept Car (also known as the New Microbus and Microbus Concept), first presented at the 2001 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS). Later concepts included the Bulli (2011), BUDD-e (2016), and ID BUZZ (2017), all battery electric vehicle concepts, and the ID BUZZ is anticipated to enter production in 2022. Design The new Microbus Concept was completely modern compared to the Type 2, featuring a 7-inch screen in the center console and a second ceiling- located 7-inch screen that allowed the driver to see behind the vehicle. Passengers had 8-inch screens mounted in the seatbacks for video entertainment. The Microbus Concept was approximately the same size as the contemporary Volkswagen Eurovan, and was powered by a newly-developed 3.2L V-6 engine with stated output of and . Styling of the Microbus Concept was handled by Volkswagen's California Design Studio in Simi Valley. History The Microbus Concept debuted at the 2001 NAIAS in Detroit. In June 2002 Volkswagen announced the Microbus Concept, using the platform of the forthcoming T5 light van, was slated for production commencing during 2003 at the company's Hannover plant, ramping up to 80,000 units annually by 2005. The launch was deferred, however, and the project was canceled in spring 2004. In 2005, VW instead announced that Chrysler would build minivans for Volkswagen in the United States, while in Europe the VW Transporter Multivan would fill the niche previously intended for the reborn Microbus. The Chrysler built Volkswagen Routan was released to the North American market in September 2008. Unrelated to the new Microbus, the Routan is a seven-seat minivan and is a rebadged variant of the Chrysler RT platform, fifth-generation Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country. Battery electric successors Bulli (2011) Bulli concept, on display at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show In September 2008, Autoblog reported that the Microbus Concept might actually yet be produced, and at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show, Volkswagen unveiled a second, smaller concept van (also reminiscent of the first generation Transporter) called the Bulli. In the event, the Bulli also was not actually produced as envisioned in 2011. The Bulli concept was powered by a motor that developed of torque, drawing from a battery for up to of range. Rear seats may be folded, expanding cargo room from . The interior featured two rows of bench seats and could accommodate six people; dimensions were similar to the earlier Space Up! concept car. BUDD-e (2016) Volkswagen announced that it was developing an all-electric platform in October 2015, as part of its response to the diesel emissions scandal. The platform was eventually named the MEB platform. The BUDD-e was revealed on January 5, 2016 at the Consumer Electronics Show, as the first concept based on the forthcoming MEB platform. That was the day after the United States Department of Justice filed suit against Volkswagen AG for its role in the diesel emissions scandal. Like the earlier Bulli concept of 2011, the BUDD-e used two rows of seating. The battery in the BUDD-e gave it an estimated range of . The MEB-based BUDD-e used two motors, one each on the front and rear axle for a total mechanical output power of . It was also fitted with photovoltaic panels in the roof. ID BUZZ (2017) The Volkswagen ID Buzz debuted at the January 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It was also based on the MEB platform.

The prize was created by Ferdinand Julian Egeberg, and consists of a bronze statuette modelled by sculptor Magnus Vigrestad. History In 1917 a donation of was given by Cabinet Chamberlain Ferdinand Julian Egeberg to the sports association Norges Riksforbund for Idræt. His donation was basis for the sports prize Kabinetskammerherre Egebergs ærespris for alsidig idrett. The statutes for the award were agreed on 10 February 1920. The basic capital was not to be touched, while the fund's interests should be used for a prize given to a sportsperson who, during the last two years, had excelled in one sport and also showed eminent performances in another, completely different sport. The prize is a bronze statuette modelled by sculptor Magnus Vigrestad, who won the design competition. The prize was regarded the highest achievement in Norwegian sport at the time. The statutes have changed slightly over the years. Today the prize is awarded by the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, and given to Norwegian sports people who have excelled nationally in at least two sports, and excelled internationally in at least one of these. The first awardee was skier and football player Gunnar Andersen, who received the prize for 1918.

It is best known as the summer residence of Crown Prince Frederick William (later King Frederick William IV of Prussia). Today it is maintained by the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg. Overview The park area with its various buildings can be traced back to the 18th century. After it had changed hands several times, King Frederick William III of Prussia bought the land that borders the south of Sanssouci Park and gave it to his son Frederick William and his wife Elisabeth Ludovika for Christmas in 1825. The Crown Prince charged the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel with the remodeling of an already existing farm house and the project was completed at low cost from 1826 through 1829. In the end, Schinkel, with the help of his student Ludwig Persius, built a small Neoclassical palace on the foundations of the old farm house in the image of a Roman villa. With designs he created himself the artistically inclined Crown Prince participated in the planning process for the palace and surrounding park. He referred to this summer residence as \\"Siam\\", which at the time was considered \\"the Land of the Free\\", and to himself jokingly as the \\"Siam House architect\\". Officially the palace and park were named \\"Charlottenhof\\" in honor of Maria Charlotte von Gentzkow who had owned the property from 1790 to 1794. The interior design of the ten rooms is still largely intact. The furniture, for the most part designed by Schinkel himself, is remarkable for its simple and cultivated style. The palace's most distinctive room is the tent room fashioned after a Roman Caesar's tent. In the tent room both ceiling and walls are decorated with blue and white striped wallpaper and the window treatments and bed tent and coverings continue that design. The room was used as a bedroom for companions and guests. The blue and white theme is continued throughout on the palace's window shutters, it seems, in deference to the Bavarian heritage of then crown princess Elisabeth. Between 1835 and 1840 the explorer and world traveler Alexander von Humboldt was invited and stayed in the tent room during the summer months.  Charlottenhof Park  The landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné was charged with the design of the Charlottenhof gardens. He completely recreated the originally flat and partly marshy area into an English garden with trees, lawn and water features. He also linked the new park at Charlottenhof to the older one at Sanssouci from the time of Frederick the Great. World Heritage Site Since 1990, Charlottenhof Palace has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\\". The palace is administered by the Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg.

It was built by Charles Warner and the Forest Conservation Club of Pasadena during the 1930s. After the deluge of 1938 most of the trails that accessed the mountain sides around Echo Mountain and the Mount Lowe Railway had been all but washed away. Sam Merrill found it important to maintain public hiking access to the railway ruins and other portions of the treacherous foothill. During the 1940s he overhauled and maintained the trail. As a young man Merrill had lived with John Muir for a summer, which inspired a lifetime commitment to the outdoors and the Sierra Club. Merrill, who served as Clerk of the Superior Court of Los Angeles, was an active volunteer in the Sierra Club, leading outings for almost twenty years, serving on the Executive Committee of the Angeles Chapter from 1926 to 1935 and on the National Board of Directors of the Sierra Club from 1936 to 1937. When Sam Merrill died in 1948 the Sierra Club named the Echo Mountain Trail after him. The trail originated at the old railway's right of way just above a point called Hygeia Station and climbed by switchback up the steep face of the Echo promontory. In the late 1960s a housing development was established over the trail, and the trailhead was moved to an access alongside the Cobb Estate gateway at the top of Lake Avenue. The portion of the trail which was maintained by Merrill leads an approximate 2-mile trip directly to Echo Mountain and the ruins of the White City of the Mount Lowe Railway. It is also sometimes referred to as Lower Sam Merrill Trail because a section of the Mount Lowe 8, an old mule trail from the days of the Mount Lowe Tavern, was reopened, giving a continued hike into Grand Canyon and the site of the Tavern, and is referred to as Upper Sam Merrill Trail. In 1996 the national USA Today newspaper published a list of \\"10 Great North American Hikes\\", which included the Sam Merrill Trail as one of them. The list had originally appeared in the October 1996 issue of Men's Fitness magazine.

It was constructed by the British in the early 1932 and was officially opened in 1934 by the late Almarhum Sultan Sir Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah and the British's Federated Malay States High Commissioner, Sir Lawrence Nuuns Guillemard. The mosque's architecture is a combination of Western Art Deco and Neoclassical cathedral styles. It was designed by the British architect Leofric Kesteven (1882-1974). Design credits go to the architect, Leofric Kesteven (Chairman of the Malayan Institute of Architects from 1931 to 1933); John Thomas Chester, the reinforced concrete specialist attached to United Engineers Ltd; and Rodolfo Nolli, the Singapore-based Italian sculptor who worked on the ornaments of the building. Its interesting features include the Tangga Diraja (royal stairs) from Istana Alam Shah and a royal mausoleum. The late Sultan Salahuddin was buried in the mosque's grounds. Architecture The design concept of the Sultan Sulaiman Mosque in Klang is quite different from other mosques in the state, as well as in the rest of Malaysia. Sultan Sulaiman Mosque is notable as it exhibits a combination of influences of Islamic architecture, Moorish, Neoclassical, English and most importantly, Art Deco architecture. The semicircular-shaped dome of the mosque is painted in egg yellow, not gold. The large dome of the main prayer space is surrounded by several smaller domes. There are eight smaller towers around the mosque and a large tower in the middle, with a higher entrance from the main porch. The tower is also decorated with yellow dome at the summit. The mosque was designed by Leofric Kesteven, and it can accommodate about 1,000 pilgrims at a time. The present mosque has been through a number of processes and internal modifications; the most recent restoration was completed in 2017, which restored its colourful bas-reliefs. The original design was like a cross bar when viewed from above, as is so often used in church plans in Europe. But now the mosque looks like a square customisation of the Selangor Islamic Religious Department (JAIS). The main prayer room Sultan Sulaiman Mosque is octagonal at the bottom, but it slowly smoothens into a circle at a height of 10 meters. The upper floors can be accessed with 'catladder'. There are decorative iron frames under the dome that support the multi-coloured patterned glass. History The Sultan Sulaiman Mosque was completed in 1932 and was officiated in 1934 by Sultan Sulaiman Alaeddin Shah, the then-Sultan of Selangor. During its opening, the mosque was reportedly the largest mosque in the then-Federated Malay States. Sultan Sulaiman Mosque served as Selangor's state mosque until the completion of Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Mosque in Shah Alam in 1988. The Sultan Sulaiman Mosque remained as the royal mosque. Between March 2015 and October 2017, the mosque was closed to the public for restoration works, which cost 12 million ringgit.

Professional wrestling career Randy Rose began his career in 1974 in Tennessee. In 1980, Rose formed a tag team with Dennis Condrey in the Alabama-based promotion Southeast Championship Wrestling. The duo initially feuded with Norvell Austin before joining forces with Austin to form a stable, The Midnight Express. The trio dominated the tag team scene there until 1983, when Condrey left SCW for Mid- South Wrestling, where he reformed The Midnight Express with Bobby Eaton. After spending some time in International Championship Wrestling, Rose reunited with Condrey in the AWA in 1987. Now known as \\"Ravishing\\" Randy Rose, he and Condrey called themselves \\"The Original Midnight Express\\", and claimed the right to the name, which had since been used by Condrey and Eaton and later by Eaton and Stan Lane. The duo were managed Paul E. Dangerously. Condrey and Rose defeated Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee for the AWA World Tag Team Championship on October 30, 1987, in Whitewater, Wisconsin. They would have a two-month title reign, losing the titles to the returning Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) on December 27, 1987 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Condrey and Rose resurfaced in NWA flagship promotion World Championship Wrestling (with Dangerously) in November 1988. During the November 5 episode of World Championship Wrestling, Jim Cornette kayfabe received an anonymous phone call. The caller ridiculed Cornette over Eaton and Lane's loss of the NWA World Tag Team Championship to The Road Warriors on October 29. Cornette recognized the caller and basically asked him to come say it to his face. At that point, Dangerously and the Original Midnight Express hit the ring and proceeded to pummel Cornette and Stan Lane, who was wrestling in a singles match. By the time Bobby Eaton showed up, it was three on one. Cornette showed up the next week on TBS carrying his blood stained suit jacket and the feud was on. The teams wrestled at Starrcade '88, but nothing was solved. The Midnights vs. Midnights would be the hottest feud in WCW for months, building up to a six-man tag match involving the managers on pay-per- view in February 1989. The one who got pinned would have to leave the promotion. However, WCW (the former Jim Crockett Promotions) was under new ownership and in transition at the time and many wrestlers were coming and going. At the last minute, Condrey decided to leave WCW. Jack Victory was brought in as his replacement and the match went forward, but at this point no one really cared. Rose would leave WCW for a time and Dangerously would go on to bring in the Samoan Swat Team or SST as his new team. Rose would return to WCW for a brief time in mid 1989. In 1990 and 1991, Rose wrestled for Georgia All-Star Wrestling and the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF). He retired from active competition in 1992 after 18 years. Rose was also very involved with charity work during his wrestling career and tried to use his status as a pro wrestler to raise money.

The SAT's approach is informal, flexible and transparent. The SAT: *aims to make the correct or preferable decision based on the merits of each application; *is not a court and, therefore, strict rules of evidence do not apply; *encourages the resolution of disputes through mediation; *allows parties to be represented by a lawyer, a person with relevant experience or by themselves; *holds hearings in public in most cases; and *provides reasons for all decisions and publishes most of them on the website.

Areas Given its broad jurisdiction, SAT matters are divided into four areas that enable procedures to be adapted to suit the type of matter and the needs of different people who use the SAT. The areas are: *Human Rights Makes decisions that affect some of the most vulnerable people in our community in relation to guardianship, administration and discrimination, and reviews decisions of the Mental Health Review Board. *Development & Resources Reviews decisions made by Government regarding planning, development and resources, and hears matters relating to land valuation and compensation. *Vocational Regulation Hears complaints concerning occupational misconduct and reviews decisions concerning licensing. *Commercial & Civil Deals with strata title and retirement village disputes, commercial tenancy and credit and reviews State revenue decisions and other commercial and personal matters. Organisation A Supreme Court judge is President of the Tribunal. The President is assisted by two deputy presidents, who are District Court judges, and a number of members who are experienced in relevant fields. The Tribunal is led by His Honour Justice Jeremy Curthoys and is supported by a member complement of 18 full-time members and over 100 sessional members. The 71 staff of the Tribunal are led by the Executive Officer, Mr Mark Street. In 2007 the WA Parliament (Standing Committee on Legislation) commenced an inquiry into operations of the SAT. The 2009 report \\"Inquiry into the Jurisdiction and Operation of the State Administrative Tribunal\\" can be found at Website of the Parliament of Western Australia. The report is complimentary of the operations of the Tribunal, notably the exceptional leadership of His Honour Justice Michael Barker, the work of the full time and sessional members and of the staff of Tribunal, led by then Executive Officer Mr Alexander Watt.

It is a flowering plant classified in the water lily family, Nymphaeaceae, although it is occasionally regarded as a distinct family, Euryalaceae. Unlike other water lilies, the pollen grains of Euryale have three nuclei. Etymology The name Euryale comes from the mythical Greek Gorgon by the same name. Growth Makhana or Euryale is a perennial plant native to eastern Asia and southern Asia , and is found from India - Bihar in nine districts of Mithila (region) viz, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Katihar, Sitamarhi, Purnea, Kishanganj, Araria, Saharsa and Supaul (local name Makhana) and valley and some hilly areas of Manipur (local name Thangzing) - to Korea and Japan, as well as parts of eastern Russia. Bihar produces 90% of the world production of fox nut.Flora of China, \\"Euryale ferox\\" It grows in water, producing bright purple flowers. The leaves are large and round, often more than a meter (3 feet) across, with a leaf stalk attached in the centre of the lower surface. The underside of the leaf is purplish, while the upper surface is green. The leaves have a quilted texture, although the stems, flowers, and leaves which float on the surface are covered in sharp prickles. Other leaves are submerged. In India, Euryale normally grows in ponds, wetlands etc. Recently the Indian Council of Agricultural Research has developed a technique for the field cultivation of Euryale. Uses Culinary The plant produces starchy white seeds that are edible. The plant is cultivated for its seeds in lowland ponds in India, China, and Japan. The Chinese have cultivated the plant for centuries. More than 96,000 hectares of Bihar, India, were set aside for cultivation of Euryale in 1990-1991. The plant grows best in locations with hot, dry summers and cold winters. Seeds are collected in the late summer and early autumn, and may be eaten raw or cooked. In India, in the northern (Punjab) and western parts of the country, Euryale ferox seeds are often roasted or fried, which causes them to pop like popcorn. These are then eaten, often with a sprinkling of oil and spices. It is used in cooking, especially to make a porridge or pudding called kheer. Evidence from archaeobotany indicates that Euryale ferox was a frequently collected wild food source during the Neolithic period in the Yangtze region, with large numbers of finds coming from the sites of Kuahuqiao, Hemudu, and Tianluoshan. The earliest recorded use of E. ferox was found in Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel, among artifacts of the Acheulean culture 790-750,000 years ago. The seeds are used in Cantonese soup. Traditional medicine The seeds of foxnut are used in Ayurveda preparations and in traditional Chinese medicine.

His reign began with the south again at war with the north in France and, though he was reluctant to join his father's old ally, Raymond VII of Toulouse, in revolt and he did not aid the king of England, Henry III, in his Saintonge War. Roger IV was a vassal of both the count of Toulouse (for his county of Foix) and the king of France (for his Carcassonne lands), then Louis IX. His loyalty to the king, however, took precedence and war broke out with Raymond VII (October 1242). Although Raymond was forced to submit to the king on 30 November, the war with Roger continued until January 1243, when the king ended it. The count of Foix was now solely a vassal of the king and Raymond spent the rest of his life (until 1249) trying to retrieve Roger's homage, to no avail. Like his father, Roger IV had troubles with the church and the bishop of Urgel in particular and, in 1257, he successfully released the viscounty of Castelbon from the bishop's jurisdiction. In February 1245, he gave many freedoms to his subjects and he signed paréages with the abbots of Mas-d'Azil (1246), Boulbonne (1253), and Combelongue (1255). In 1251, he built the church at Boulbonne, transferred his ancestors' remains there, and defended it against the exactions of numerous enemies. He persecuted Catharism, the heresy of his mother, Ermesinda of Castlebon, in order not to be at odds with the Inquisition. He died on 24 February 1265 and was interred in Boulbonne next to his father. Marriage and children Roger married Brunissenda of Cardona, a daughter of Ramon VIII, Viscount of Cardona. They had six children: *Roger- Bernard III of Foix (died 1302). *Peter of Foix. *Sybille of Foix. Married Aimery IV, Viscount of Narbonne. *Ines of Foix.

Robert Collison's account of the subject describes street literature as the \\"forerunner of the popular press\\".Collison, (1973), subtitle. Leslie Shepard's \\"History of Street Literature\\" identifies a range of different publications as indicated by his subtitle: \\"The Story of Broadside Ballads, Chapbooks, Proclamations, News- Sheets, Election Bills, Tracts, Pamphlets, Cocks, Catchpennies, and Other Ephemera\\". Street literature therefore includes several different printed formats and publication types.Shephard, (1973), subtitle. The main formats are: An 18th-century broadside ballad: The tragical ballad: or, the lady who fell in love with her serving-man. Broadside ballad Broadside ballads are traditional ballads printed on one side of a full sheet or half sheet of paper, often in landscape orientation. Intended to be pasted on to walls for public consultation. Chapbook An example of a chapbook history Chapbooks were small, paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet and folded into books of 8, 12, 16 or 24 pages, either stitched or unstitched. There are several sub-categories of chapbook, notably: *Histories - 12 or 24- page booklets containing popular accounts of historical figures, traditional tales, fairy stories etc. *Patters - 8 or 16-page publications containing simple religious texts, humorous or sensational stories such as accounts of murders or natural disaster. Sold by a patterer, which was ‘a noisy talkative street hawker of songs, last dying speeches, &c.;’Hindley (1886) p.185.. *Collections - 8 or 16-page publications containing collections of the lyrics of popular songs. A Catalogue of the Severall Sects and Opinions in England and other Nations. 1647. An example of a satirical popular print. Popular prints Popular prints encompass a wide range of cheap printed images of differing sizes and for different purposes. They were generally of low artistic merit and often contained sensational, humorous or bawdy subjects. An example of an 18th century slip-song Slip songs The lyrics of popular songs printed 4 or 8 to a sheet and cut into slips, to be sold to theatre- goers or those attending other places of public entertainment. Other terms used  While the term street literature (coined in the mid-nineteenth century) is common, there are several other terms used in association with street literature which categorise the type of content rather than the format. These terms are not mutually exclusive *Almanac - an annual publication listing a set of events forthcoming in the next year. *Catchpenny - cheap, mass-produced sheets printed on one side on unfolded sheets of paper. *Cock - fictitious narratives, in verse or prose, of murders, fires, and terrible accidents, sold in the streets as true accounts. \\"The man who hawks them, a patterer, often changes the scene of the awful event to suit the taste of the neighbourhood he is trying to delude.\\" Hotten, 1860), p,118. *Garland – originally used as an anthology of poems on a particular subject but the term was later used as a general descriptor in the titles of broadside ballads and chapbook histories (e.g. 'The amorous lady's garland; or, the handsome butcher of St. James's Market'). *New-sheet - single sheets containing accounts of sensational news (murders, accounts of battles, natural disasters etc.), the fore-runners of newspapers, but published intermittently rather than serially. *Squib – a handbill containing short humorous or satiric writing, often associated with elections. *Gallows literature - a collective term for the biographies, confessions, “last speeches,” and other verses supposedly written by felons, sold at public executions. *Tracts - Some religious and political tracts would come under the category of street literature, especially those (such as the Cheap Repository Tracts) designed for popular consumption and to replace other forms of street literature. *Other printed items such as advertisements, playbills, handbills, public notices, etc are sometimes listed under this term but since they are not sold they would be better described as printed ephemera.

The character appeared in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine portrayed by Will.i.am. Publication history Kestral first appeared in Wolverine Vol. 2 60 and was created by Larry Hama. Fictional character biography John Wraith was a member of Team X and later a test subject of the Weapon X Program.Marvel Comics Presents #25 He was part of Team X along with Wolverine, Sabretooth, Maverick, Mastodon and Silver Fox. John was a powerful teleporter, capable of getting the team out of sticky situations after their job was finished. He had a penchant for explosives, arming himself with shaped charges, explosives that were built to direct the force of their blast in specific directions based on how they are deployed. Like the other members of Team X, he was given an artificial age suppressant so he was likely much older than he looked. His time as a secret agent and a member of the Weapon X program left John somewhat paranoid. His house was a veritable death trap, as was the yard around it; John trusted no one.Wolverine #60–66 He made a habit of keeping his skill a secret from his compatriots as well as his foes, using it only sparingly, and if no one was looking directly at him — unless it was absolutely vital. The only time when his fellow Team-X members found out about his powers was when they went up against Omega Red. John was backup on that mission that Wolverine, Maverick, and Sabretooth ran in Germany to collect a carbonadium synthesizer, and when that trio burst out of the target compound with Red in pursuit, John stalled him with his gun until the others got away. Unfazed, Omega went to wrap John up and tear him to pieces, but John teleported to safety at the last second, with only Wolverine and Omega Red seeing this. There was also a certain animosity between him and Sabretooth. He was about as violent as his fellows from the Weapon X program, but a lot more merciful and didn't enjoy killing innocents while on a mission, which put him at odds with people like Sabretooth. Sabretooth once languished for quite a time in John's basement with several shaped charges strapped to his chest. Unless he had a really good reason to, Sabretooth wouldn't lift a finger to help John. Years later, John had tracked Wolverine and the rest of his old teammates down because it seemed that there was a problem with the age suppression factors given to them by Weapon X, as one of their number, Mastodon, had suddenly aged quite rapidly and been reduced into a pile of ooze. With their help, John discovered a list of termination candidates from the Weapon X project. They uncovered themselves on the list plus a man named Aldo Ferro, who they knew was a big time mafia chief, Il Topo Siciliano. They tracked Ferro to his secluded island where they discovered Maverick guarding him. After Ferro's transformation caused Carol Hines to die of fright, Maverick soon changed sides when Ferro reveals that he had used his psi-powers to speed the false memory implantation of the Weapon X subjects. After this fiasco, John hung out with Wolverine for a month or two, but then vanished. Wraith was later re-recruited into Weapon X by the \\"Director\\" and his mission was to recruit Maverick as well. However, Maverick fought back and Wraith was shot and then had his neck broken by Sabretooth, who was planning on betraying the Program and couldn't trust Wraith. He was left for dead, but managed to survive.Weapon X #23 John Wraith turns up alive and later became a preacher and was visited by Wolverine who confided in Wraith during soul-searching instigated by his being somewhat skeptical of his new start in life. However, a demon later possessed Wolverine's body (referred to as Hellverine) and lured Wraith into a trap by killing one of his parishioners. Whilst exiting the chapel and locking the parishioners inside so as to ensure they would not come to any more harm, Wraith armed himself with an assault rifle and set off to stop Logan's rampage only to be caught in one of his own traps, where he came face to face with Hellverine who managed to cast a spell of sorts on him, causing an assortment of deadly creatures (including scorpions and snakes) to crawl all over his body; seemingly killing him. Hellverine then directed its attention to Wraith's church (which was still locked with the parishioners inside) and used its demonic powers to set the building ablaze. Wraith emerged from nowhere and tried in vain to stop the demon, but was critically wounded by its claws. Helpless, Wraith could only watch as the parishioners were burned alive as he lay dying, as he was now depowered and could no longer teleport.Wolverine Vol. 4 #1 Powers and abilities Wraith had the psionic ability to phase-jump; meaning he could seemingly disappear at will from any point in space and appear at another, with what would appear to be an exceptionally-high range. He could move about space at will, appearing and disappearing in a fashion that left no flashy burst of light or sound and he could even take others with him. He also had a life-extending serum in his blood, due to his involvement in the Weapon X program. He liked using \\"shaped charges,\\" bombs whose blasts are precisely controlled. Other versions Ultimate Marvel The Ultimate Marvel version of the character is a Caucasian male. Colonel John Wraith was a mutant-hating commando who was in charge of the world's first mutant concentration camp. He was sanctioned by S.H.I.E.L.D. to head the barbaric Weapon X Program, which specialised in capturing mutants and forcing them to carry out covert missions for the US government. The program was co-headed by a Dr. Abraham Cornelius. He and his men (all who have anti-mutant sentiments as well) managed to capture and subject Canadian para-trooper James \\"Lucky Jim\\" Howlett to experiments which wiped his memories clean and bonded his skeleton with adamantium. They christened Howlett Weapon X and gave the fake name Logan. Wraith and his men enjoyed tormenting Logan by teasing with bits and pieces of lost memories and also caging and shooting Logan day and night since Logan could not die due to his own mutant healing factor. This conditioned Logan to become the perfect killing machine, or so they thought.Ultimate X-Men #2 During the Gulf War, they were transporting Logan in the desert, preparing for deployment, but the transport team was ambushed and Logan was accidentally set loose. Stumbling across a younger Nick Fury taken by surprise by the same ambush, Logan rescued and brought Fury back to base camp. Colonel Wraith, surprised that Logan retained his humanity by not killing Fury, ordered his men to shoot and cage Logan once again. He told Fury not to worry about Logan since he was nothing more than a living weapon. A couple of years later, Fury returned the favor by helping Logan escape from the Weapon X facility.Ultimate X-Men #7–12 Wraith sent Sabretooth, another one of his mutant agents, after Logan but came back empty-handed. Wraith then began capturing other mutants to take Logan's place, mutants including Nightcrawler, Rogue and Cain Marko. When he received news that Logan headed back to America (as an assassin for Magneto unknown to them), he and his men again attempted to recapture Logan, only to have their plans foiled by the X-Men. Wraith's face was scarred by Logan's claws. In retribution, Wraith ordered the capture of the X-Men, but again he failed to catch Logan. He had Charles Xavier hooked up to machines to harness the Professor's telepathy in order to help find other potential candidates for the program. The mutants imprisoned at the Weapon X facility were tortured on a daily basis; Rogue's arm was broken regularly and molten metal was poured on Colossus to test durability. It was also during this time that Beast gets mutated even further by Dr. Cornelius. To keep them in line, Wraith had implanted micro explosives into them and if anyone got out of line or tried to escape, it was their friends who would pay the price.Ultimate X-Men #11 The X-Men's first major mission forced them to split up. One team was assigned to free Nick Fury having been captured by a foreign country, while the other team was assigned to destroy a new bio-weapon being developed by terrorists. Jean Grey was given the order to execute one of the scientists they had captured but refused. Wraith threatened to detonate Cyclops's implants for insubordination, at which point Jean is forced to kill someone for the very first time. When General Ross threatened to phase out Weapon X, Wraith used Xavier to dispose of the General with a mental explosion. Wolverine eventually gets captured, but had secretly led the Brotherhood to the facility in an attempt of freeing the imprisoned mutants. When the mutants began to break free, Wraith shot Xavier and attempted to flee in a helicopter. The Blob held onto Wraith's helicopter, but eventually loses grip. Storm tried to zap Wraith with lightning, but Nightcrawler saved the Colonel who in turn tried to kill Nightcrawler. Fury killed Wraith and declared that all the mutants at the facility were free to go.Ultimate X-Men #38 Canadian government forces saved Wraith's life by injecting him with the Banshee drug, and he was made leader of Alpha Flight. He also gained superpowers. Wraith decided to call himself \\"Vindicator\\". His team went to retrieve Northstar, which led the X-Men to find out that Wraith's team all use Banshee.Ultimate X-Men #94 After the Ultimatum wave, Rogue sought out Wraith after finding out his identity during a previous battle when some of the X-Men went to rescue Northstar. Rogue convinced him to help kill Magneto. He needed a few more people to help with this mission, so he and Rogue captured Sabretooth and Juggernaut to reform Weapon X.Ultimate X-Men #98–99 Wraith was later killed by Stryker after blasting a hole in his armor. Ultimate X-Men #99 In other media Television * Kestrel is mentioned in X-Men Evolution. In the episode \\"Target X\\", Omega Red references both Maverick and Kestrel to Wolverine, mentioning the latter during a rundown of Weapon X adversaries. * A character based on the Ultimate Marvel version of John Wraith appears in Wolverine and the X-Men: Colonel Moss (voiced by Michael Ironside). He is in charge of the Mutant Response Division and has a vendetta against Wolverine as Moss has claw marks across his face thanks to Wolverine at some point in the past. He was a former head of Weapon X that worked under Professor Thorton and Abraham Cornelius. In the Sentinel- dominated future, he is a cyborg who handles putting power dampeners on mutants in prisons. Whenever his biological half is compromised by a telepath, his Sentinel mode would take over. Film * Recording artist Will.i.am (of The Black Eyed Peas) portrays John Wraith in the 2009 feature film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This version is a teleporting mutant and a member of Team X alongside Wolverine (James \\"Logan\\" Howlett), Victor Creed, Wade Wilson, Agent Zero, Chris Bradley and Fred Dukes under William Stryker's leadership. While initially loyal to the team, Wraith eventually quits the team due to morality issues as he and Logan didn't like what the team did but follows orders anyway (like abducting fellow mutants) and becomes a boxing manager. He appears to be the one member whom Logan fully trusts, being the first whom Logan pays a visit after many years. When Wolverine arrives for information about Stryker's base, Wraith tells him to ask an obese Dukes that he's boxing to keep in shape. Before giving Logan any information, Dukes challenges Logan to a boxing match. Logan wins thanks to the adamantium skeleton and Dukes directs him toward escaped captive Remy LeBeau. Wraith goes with Wolverine which leads them to a casino in Louisiana. Wraith guards the back, only to be confronted by Creed. Knowing that Creed killed Bradley as well as apparently Wade and Dukes, Wraith fights Creed despite Logan's wish to kill Creed personally. Wraith uses his teleportation ability to his advantage and manages to strike Creed multiple times, but Creed, predicting Wraith's move, eventually positions himself in exactly the right place to grab Wraith's spine as Wraith appears, mortally wounding him. Creed takes a sample of Wraith's blood and his teleportation ability is used for Weapon XI.John Wraith as portrayed by Will.i.am in X-Men Origins: Wolverine Video games * John Wraith appears in the X-Men Origins: Wolverine video game, voiced by Will.i.am. He first appears when Wolverine is rescuing him from the headquarters of Project: WideAwake with the aid of Raven Darkholme, during which it is implied that he is the father of Nightcrawler. He leads Logan to Team X colleague Frederick Dukes, then to Remy LeBeau, and covers the back of the casino. Victor Creed sneak attacks and kills Wraith.

He served the rural community of Tapanui for over 30 years. He was president of the Royal New Zealand College of GPs from 1998–99 and received their highest honour, Distinguished Fellowship, in 2001. He was a member of the Otago Hospital Board and its successor, the District Health Board. Education As a boy, Snow attended Auckland Grammar School, graduating with the class of 1948. While training in medicine he intended to become a surgeon, but was unable to do so because he wore glasses to correct his eyesight, so he took up general practice in Tapanui. Practice In 1984 he was presented with a number of patients with a prolonged exertional 'flu- like illness, but presenting no diagnosable condition. While some people thought they were no different from commonly found \\"tired all the time\\" (TATT) cases, Dr Snow was convinced that they were indeed sick and proceeded to investigate. Many were sheep farmers who previously had a perfect record of health. Observing a similarity between the symptoms of stock suffering from selenium deficiency and these patients, he was the first doctor in New Zealand to identify the disease which turned out to be an outbreak of myalgic encephalomyelitis, now classed as chronic fatigue syndrome. Owing to, often disparaging, publicity surrounding these discoveries and a study into them by Snow, Marion Poore, and Charlotte Paul, the illness came to be known in New Zealand as \\"Tapanui flu\\" after the town of the same name in West Otago. Snow also became concerned at the number of farmers injured in farm accidents, particularly those involving motorcycles, and made recommendations for improving farm safety. He campaigned unsuccessfully to prevent the closure of the Tapanui hospital, at which he was on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Retirement, death and legacy After more than 30 years in Tapanui, Snow and his wife retired to Lake Hayes. Peter Snow died on 28 February 2006. A memorial to Snow, comprising a moon rock and plaque, was unveiled in the main street of Tapanui on 8 August 2009. The moon rock was chosen because of Snow's belief that a meteor had collided with the moon in 1766 and dispersed debris across West Otago.

Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) was a 19th-century Danish philosopher who has been generally considered the \\"Father of Existentialism\\". During his later years (1848–1855), most of his writings shifted from philosophical in nature to religious. Kierkegaard's theology focuses on the single individual in relation to a known God based on a subjective truth. Many of his writings were a directed assault against all of Christendom, Christianity as a political and social entity. His target was the Danish State Church, which represented Christendom in Denmark. Christendom, in Kierkegaard's view, made individuals lazy in their religion. Many of the citizens were officially \\"Christians\\", without having any idea of what it meant to be a Christian. Kierkegaard attempted to awaken Christians to the need for unconditional religious commitment. However, he was also against party spirit in religion as well as other areas of study and system building. Religious background Kierkegaard Søren Kierkegaard was born to a Lutheran Protestant family. His father, Michael Pederson Kierkegaard, was a Lutheran Pietist, but he questioned how God could let him suffer so much. One day, he climbed a mountain and cursed God. For this sin, Michael believed that a family curse was placed upon him, that none of his children would live a full life. And indeed, Kierkegaard's family suffered with early deaths of Søren's siblings, ranging from childbirth to the age of 25. Only Søren and his brother Peter survived past 25. His father died in 1838, but before his death, he asked Søren to become a pastor. Søren was deeply influenced by his father's religious experience and life, and felt obligated to fulfill his wish. In 1840, Søren was awarded his theology degree and although Søren was eligible to become a pastor, he decided to pursue a degree in philosophy instead. He decided not to become a pastor or a professor either because if he had he would have had to write under the authority of the State or the Church. He craved freedom, and for that reason he wrote \\"without authority\\". He also believed in Christ as the ultimate authority in matters of personal faith. He was against beginning a \\"new religion\\", unlike Hegel, the religion of reason, and Schelling, the religion of nature. He always wrote to students of religion as a student of religion. J. Loewenberg of Harvard University described Hegel's God in the following terms in 1913: > as Hegel puts his fundamental idea, “the truth is the whole.” Neither things > nor categories, neither histories nor religion, neither sciences nor arts, > express or exhaust by themselves the whole essence of the universe. The > essence of the universe is the life of the totality of all things, not their > sum. As the life of man is not the sum of his bodily and mental functions, > the whole man being present in each and all of these, so must the universe > be conceived as omnipresent in each of its parts and expressions. This is > the significance of Hegel’s conception of the universe as an organism. The > World-Spirit-Hegel’s God-constitutes, thinks, lives, wills, and is all in > unity. The evolution of the universe is thus the evolution of God himself. > The task of philosophy, then, as Hegel conceives it, is to portray in > systematic form the evolution of the World-Spirit in all its necessary > ramifications.The Life of George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, p. 13-14THE GERMAN > CLASSICS OF THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES, Volume 7, published > 1913, edited by Kuno Francke Søren Kierkegaard questioned this evolution of God because if God is evolving in a systematic way then the awe and wonder of religion is replaced with speculations about where God is in relation to the system about God. > What does the task look like in everyday life, for I continually have my > favorite theme in mind: whether everything is indeed all right with the > craving of our theocentric nineteenth century to go beyond Christianity, the > craving to speculate, the craving for continued development, the craving for > a new religion or for the abolition of Christianity. As for my own > insignificant person, the reader will please recall that I am the one who > finds the issue and the task so very difficult, which seems to suggest that > I have not carried it out, I, who do not even pretend to be a Christian by > going beyond it. But it is always something to point out that it is > difficult, even if it is done, as it is here, only in an upbuilding > divertissement, which is carried out essentially with the aid of a spy whom > I have go out among people on weekdays, and with the support of a few > dilettantes who against their will come to join in the game.\\" Søren > Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postscript (1846) p. 466, Hong This \\"going beyond faith\\" for Kierkegaard means the same as going beyond oneself. Philosophers, theologians, historians, and anthropologists tend to go beyond themselves and apply what they learn to the course of world history or national history. In this view we come to a Christian nation or a Christian world, but Søren Kierkegaard felt that God comes into the single individual, and that's where the place of God is. It's not \\"out there\\" somewhere. This point was brought home by Kierkegaard in his 1845 book, Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life and in 1960 by Ronald Gregor Smith in his book, J G Hamann 1730-1788 A Study In Christian Existence, Denmark and Europe Kierkegaard accused Christian religious institutions of not being genuinely religious. Intellectual scholarship in Christianity was becoming more and more like Hegelianism, which he called Christian \\"evolution\\",Concluding Postscript, Hong p, 559 rather than Christianity. This made the scholars of religion and philosophy examine the Gospels from a supposedly higher objective standpoint in order to demonstrate how correct reasoning can reveal an objective truth. This was outrageous to Kierkegaard because this presupposed that an infinite God and his infinite wisdom could be grasped by finite human understanding. Kierkegaard believed that Christianity was not a doctrine to be taught, but rather a life to be lived. He considered that many Christians who were relying totally on external proofs of God were missing out a true Christian experience, which is precisely the relationship one individual can have with God. Kierkegaard's audience Kierkegaard's primary religious audience was Christian readers, especially those who did not fully grasp what Christianity was all about. It was not his intention to convert non-Christians to Christianity, although much of Kierkegaard's religious writings do appeal to some non-Christian readers. For example, Martin Buber was a Jewish existentialist theologian who critiqued many of Kierkegaard's ideas. Kierkegaard delivered religious discourses because he didn't become a theologian or a philosopher of religion. His audience was any single individual who is laboring to become what God wants him to become. Striving can be done for the individual goal of becoming famous or just striving to make a living and the hope to have a future. Kierkegaard writes about the \\"divinely appointed teachers\\" of what it means to be a human being. And Christ is the prototype for what it means to be a human being from Kierkegaard's point of view. He put it this way in his Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits (1847): He wrote for individuals who struggle with sin and forgiveness and he began this in Either/Or (1843) and continued through 1851 with a repetition of his theme from his three discourse of 1843 Love Will Hide a Multitude of Sins. He sees the spiritual connection between God and the single individual much akin to Luther's idea of the priesthood of all believers. Themes in his theology Faith Faith is a hallmark of Kierkegaardian philosophical and religious thought. Two of his key ideas are based on faith: the leap to faith and the knight of faith. Some regard Kierkegaard as a Christian Universalist, writing in his journals, \\"If others go to Hell, I will go too. But I do not believe that; on the contrary, I believe that all will be saved, myself with them—something which arouses my deepest amazement.\\" However, this view is not always supported by Kierkegaard's own writings. He presupposes the individual who has decided to become a Christian has an interest in becoming that, is interested enough to attempt to develop a relationship with Christ, and has enough faith to believe that the possibility extends to all individuals equally. Faith is what makes each individual equal before God. He put it this way in his Four Upbuilding Discourses 1844 (Against Cowardliness). He wrote the following in his 1846 book, Concluding Unscientific Postscript: > Although an outsider, I have at least understood this much, that the only > unforgivable high treason against Christianity is the single individual’s > taking his relation to it for granted. I must therefore most respectfully > refuse all theocentric helpers and the assistance of helper’s helpers to > help me into Christianity in that way. So I prefer to remain where I am, > with my infinite interest, with the issue, with the possibility. In other > words, it is not impossible that the individual who is infinitely interested > in his own eternal happiness can some day become eternally happy; on the > other hand, it is certainly impossible that the person who has lost a sense > for it (and such a sense can scarcely be anything but an infinite concern) > can become eternally happy. Indeed, once lost, it is perhaps impossible to > regain it. Page 16 And reinforced the same idea in his 1850 book, Practice in Christianity: Faith, for Kierkegaard, was more than intellectual understanding. He began his great book Either/Or with a quotation from Edward Young, \\"Is reason then alone baptized, are the passions pagans?\\"Title page Either/Or, Hong and later explained what he meant in his Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, which Rollo May called \\"the declaration of independence for existentialism\\".Rollo May, The Discovery of Being, 1983 p. 54 Intellect is important but not all-inclusive in the realm of religion. \\"A\\" in Either/Or wanted to use the arts to teach Christianity. \\"B\\" wanted to use the science of ethics to teach Christianity. Both can lead to an intellectual understanding devoid of passionate involvement in the act of becoming a Christian. Richard McKeon (1900–1985) thought the imitators of Plato had misapplied his ideas and left the passions out of philosophy in favor of intellectualism. He wrote the following in his 1953 book Thought, Action, and Passion: The Young Man in Repetition was mediated by his psychologist, Constantin Constantius, as he tried to solve his problem. They represent the intellectual side of the human being and Abraham in Fear and Trembling represented the passion of inwardness because he was alone with God. Abraham believed in the actuality of God and could say nothing either artistically or ethically about it. Yet neither the Young Man nor Abraham is the prototype for the Christian, because the Christian is to follow Christ as the example. Paradox Briefly stated, a paradox is an apparently true statement or group of statements that seems to lead to a contradiction or to a situation that defies intuition. It is said to be resolved when we show that the contradiction is only apparent. Kierkegaard's story of Abraham in Fear and Trembling exhibits such a paradox. Abraham could not prove he had heard the voice of God, yet he believes, and risked his only son based on this belief. The paradox of Abraham is that the believer acts and risks much on less than complete knowledge (incomplete knowledge is not sufficient for faith for Kierkegaard; one must believe by virtue of the absurd, that is to say because something is a contradiction). The god in time is a paradox just as much as the statement that \\"God is love\\" is a parody for an individual existing in time. Was it so easy for Abraham, Job, and the Apostle Paul to continue to believe that God is love? Kierkegaard continually stresses the tension between the inner and outer self before God. > What a human being knows by himself about love is very superficial; he must > come to know the deeper love from God-that is, in self-denial he must become > what every human being can become (since self-denial is related to the > universally human and thus is distinguished from the particular call and > election), an instrument for God. Thus every human being can come to know > everything about love, just as every human being can come to know that he, > like every human being, is loved by God. Some find this thought adequate for > the longest life (which doesn’t seem surprising to me); so even at the age > of seventy they do not think that they have marveled over it enough, whereas > others find this thought so insignificant (which seems to me very strange > and deplorable), since to be loved by God is no more than every human being > is-as if it were, therefore, less significant. The work of praising love > must be done outwardly in self-sacrificing unselfishness. Through self- > denial a human being gains the ability to be an instrument by inwardly > making himself into nothing before God. Through self-sacrificing > unselfishness he outwardly makes himself into nothing, an unworthy servant. > Inwardly he does not become self-important, since he is nothing, and > outwardly he does not become self-important either, since he is nothing > before God – and he does not forget that right where he is he is before God. > Alas, it can happen that a person makes a mistake at the last moment, in > that he, though truly humble before God, becomes proud of what he is able to > do as he turns toward people. It is then a temptation of comparison that > becomes his downfall. He understood that he could not compare himself to > God; before him he became conscious of himself as a nothing; but in > comparison with people he still thought himself to be something. That is, he > forgot the self-denial; he is trapped in an illusion, as if he were before > God only during specific hours, just as one has an audience with His Royal > Majesty at a specific hour. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love 1847, Hong 1995 > p. 364-365 Isaac was \\"the whole world\\" to Abraham and God had just introduced Abraham to the notion of \\"the soul\\". Was Abraham willing to give up the whole world in order to save his soul? Kierkegaard dealt with this question in Either/Or in this way: \\"The Bible says: For what would it profit a person if he gained the whole world but damaged his own soul; what would he have in return? Scripture does not state the antithesis to this, but it is implicit in the sentence. The antitheses would read something like this: What damage would there be to a person if he lost the whole world and yet did not damage his soul; what would he need in return?\\" This question brings Abraham to despair.See Either/Or Part II, 217-227 Abraham was used as a prototype in Fear and Trembling and The Young Man was his counterpoint in Repetition. Abraham followed the inner voice without mediation from his wife, Sarah, his servant, or Isaac. He just heard and obeyed. The Young Man made a promise and wanted to change his mind. He consulted with a psychologist who was engaged in trying to prove the theory of eternal return. Then he appealed to Job and complained not only to the world but also to God himself. Abraham's love of God never changed but The Young Man's love for his fiancé was ever changing. Change was the theme of Kierkegaard's Three Upbuilding Discourses of 1843. These three books were published on the same day and should be considered together. The paradox and the absurd are ultimately related to the Christian relationship with Christ, the God-Man. That God became a single individual and wants to be in a relationship with single individuals, not to the masses, was Kierkegaard's main conflict with the nineteenth-century church. The single individual can make and keep a resolution. Those who aren't interested in becoming a Christian claim they can't understand Christianity and quite often they will point to historical events to justify their position. Kierkegaard is against basing Christian belief solely on external events because it leads to doubt since externals are in constant flux. Doubt leads to speculation and this detracts from the single individual making a decision to imitate Christ. He wanted to be known as the philosopher of the internal and was against scientific proofs of Christianity through history, anthropology, and philosophy and the creation of systematic theology. Becoming a Christian is a decision to be made in time, just like becoming good is a decision/resolution made in time, and not just for consideration because the individual offers the \\"self\\" to God. Kierkegaard said Socrates was his teacher and that Christ was his Teacher. (See Philosophical Fragments) This Christian belief in the absurd notion that God became man separates one from the world in such a way that the Christian is estranged from the world. The world believes that reason guides all our actions, or should, and can't accept Christianity and is therefore offended and the Christian can't accept the reason of the world and is therefore offended by the world. Kierkegaard put it this way in his Attack Upon Christendom: Despair and sin According to Kierkegaard, the self is freedom. Not simply the freedom to choose, but the freedom to create choices for oneself. Therefore, human beings are fundamentally neither their thoughts nor their feelings but rather they are themselves. The self relates directly to itself and is subject to no one and everyone at the same time. Yet this self is that which is in relation to his body and his soul in Kierkegaard's view. The spirit constitutes the relationship in which the self is established in totality by and unto God, and unto his body and soul. His body is his being in the world, his actions and outworked decisions, and his soul is his self- conception (that which determines his actions), and his spirit is the self which relates the soul and the body, and therefore itself, to God. In effect, when a person does not come to a full consciousness of himself or herself, then he or she is said to be in despair. Just like a physician might say that no one is completely healthy, it follows that human beings must despair at certain moments in their lives. To be in despair is to reflect upon the self. If someone does not engage in the art of despair, then he or she shall become stuck in a state of inertia with no effective progression or regression and that is the worst state of all. Kierkegaard calls sickness, the sickness of the spirit. He wrote the following in Concluding Unscientific Postscript in 1846. Kierkegaard asked sharp questions that can only be answered by the \\"single individual\\" him or her self. This is an example from his 1847 book, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits where he speaks of the third person and the crowd.: Sin is separation from God but despair over sin is separation again. Kierkegaard said, \\"The consciousness of sin definitely belongs to the consciousness of the forgiveness of sin.\\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript Hong p. 524 Why would someone sit and reflect on sin to such an extent that an eternal happiness is exchanged for an eternal unhappiness or even a temporal unhappiness? This reflection is done in time but the consequence of the reflection leads one to lose hope in the possibility of any good coming from oneself. Kierkegaard says Christianity invites the single individual to become a partaker not only of the consciousness of sin but also of the consciousness of forgiveness but we seem to concentrate on the former to a remarkable degree. He said the following in Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions (1845) and Practice in Christianity (1850): Christian doctrine Kierkegaard believed that Christ was the originator of Christian doctrine and he had discussed some of the doctrinal points in his Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses. In these he discussed love, patience, equality, hope, and faith. It's easy to think you have faith but tougher to think your \\"neighbor\\" has faith. Kierkegaard made that point in his first Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843. > Therefore, faith is qualitatively different. It is not only the highest > good, but it is a good in which all are able to share, and the person who > rejoices in the possession of it also rejoices in the countless human race, > “because what I possess.” He says, “every human being has or could possess.” > The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the > person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, > because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is > different from him but is that by which he is like him; that by which he > possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by > which he is altogether like all. It was that kind of wish the perplexed man > was seeking, one he could wish for another person with all his heart, with > all his might, and with his whole soul, a wish he would dare to go on > wishing, ever more fervently, even as his love became ever more fervent. > –That was the wish that he would wish. * Soren Kierkegaard, Eighteen > Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 10 Christianity has two parts, law and gospel, and Kierkegaard emphasized that Christ put an end to law with his law of love. \\"Just make the attempt, whether you find the sum that way no matter how long you go on counting, and you will see that it is useless labor, because the concept of the Law is to be inexhaustible, limitless, endless in its provisions; every provision begets of itself an even more precise provision, and in turn a still more precise provision by reference and in relation to the new provision, and so on infinitely. The relation of love to the Law is here like the relation of faith to understanding. The understanding counts and counts, calculates and calculates, but it never arrives at the certainty that faith possesses; in the same way the Law defines and defines but never arrives at the sum, which is love.\\"Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love Published in 1847 Edited and Translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong 1995 Princeton University Press p. 105 Loving the neighbor has a \\"double danger.\\" The same with faith and hope. We not only wish that we could have love and peace but that our neighbor can have the same because it is a free gift from God. He nicely summed up the idea he had in his 1847 book Works of Love.

He spent 11 years in Major League Baseball, from to . On November 17, , Martin and Kansas City Royals teammates Willie Aikens and Willie Wilson each received three-month prison terms on misdemeanor cocaine possession charges. They became the first active major leaguers to serve jail time. Furman University Paladins Basketball team Martin was born in Columbia, South Carolina, and attended Olympia High School there. He then attended Furman University in Greenville. He starred in basketball, and was named the All-Southern Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player in after leading the Furman Paladins to their first conference championship. Philadelphia Phillies Despite his prowess in basketball, he decided to follow his father, Barney Martin, who pitched in the majors with the Cincinnati Reds, as well as his younger brother, Michael, a left handed pitcher selected fifth overall in the 1970 Major League Baseball draft by the Philadelphia Phillies. A year later, Jerry signed with the club as an amateur free agent. Despite having spent three seasons together in the same organization, the brothers were never teammates. Martin earned Western Carolinas League MVP honors in , when he batted .316 with twelve home runs and 112 runs batted in for the Spartanburg Phillies. Over four seasons in the Phillies' farm system, Martin batted .303 with 43 home runs and 290 RBIs to earn a September call-up to the majors in . Making his major league debut as a late inning defensive replacement for Greg Luzinski on September 7, Martin did not log an at-bat. When given his first major league at bat two days later, he drove in Luzinski with the first run of the Phillies' 2-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. After splitting the season between the Phillies and the triple A Toledo Mud Hens, Martin spent the entire season serving as a late inning defensive replacement for Luzinski. He appeared in 130 games, but logged only 129 at-bats. He made just one plate appearance in the 1976 National League Championship Series against the Cincinnati Reds. He reached first base on an error, and scored on Jay Johnstone's triple in the ninth inning of the third game. Despite having been a promising prospect for the Phillies, Martin would never rise above fourth outfielder status over his next two seasons with the Phillies. Just as pitchers and catchers were reporting to Spring training in , Martin was sent to the Chicago Cubs in a blockbuster deal. He, Barry Foote, Ted Sizemore and minor leaguers Derek Botelho and Henry Mack went to the Cubs for Greg Gross, Dave Rader and Manny Trillo. Chicago Cubs Finally given the opportunity to start, Martin had a career year his first season in Chicago. Playing centerfield and batting sixth in the Cubs' line-up, Martin clubbed nineteen home runs, and drove in 73 runs while scoring 74. He followed that up with a career high 23 home runs in . After a contract dispute, Martin asked to be traded, and was sent to the San Francisco Giants with Jesús Figueroa and a player to be named later for Phil Nastu and Joe Strain at the 1980 Winter meetings. San Francisco Giants Martin signed a five-year deal shortly after arriving in San Francisco, however, his tenure with the Giants ended up being shorter than expected. His numbers dipped in the strike shortened season, as he hit just four home runs and drove in 25 while batting .241. After just one season with the Giants, Martin was dealt to the Kansas City Royals for pitchers Rich Gale and Bill Laskey. Kansas City Royals A new position came with his change of scenery, as Martin was shifted to right field with the Royals. He got off to a hot start in Kansas City, batting .304 with five home runs and 25 RBIs through May. Though he would cool off by the end of the season, his .266 batting average, fifteen home runs and 65 RBIs in was a marked improvement over his previous season. He got off to a fast start in as well, but a muscle tear in his right wrist ended his season on April 24. Toward the end of the 1983 season, Martin and several of his Royals teammates were questioned by U.S. Attorney Jim Marquez in connection with a federal cocaine probe. Following the season, he, Willie Aikens and Willie Wilson pleaded guilty to attempting to purchase cocaine, while former teammate Vida Blue pleaded guilty to possession of three grams of cocaine. On November 17, Martin, Aikens, Blue and Wilson were all sentenced to a year in prison, with nine months of it suspended, and ordered to surrender to a Fort Worth, Texas minimum security federal correctional institution on December 5 (Aikens was given until January 5 in order to complete a drug treatment program). New York Mets Martin was released early from prison on February 23, , however, Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn subsequently suspended all four players for the entire season. The suspensions were reduced after appeal, and the four were allowed to return to their teams on May 15. By then, Martin had signed with the New York Mets. Martin joined the Mets on May 16 in San Francisco. Through 51 games with the Mets, Martin managed just a .154 batting average, three home runs and five RBIs, and was released on September 30. A bid for a comeback in found no takers, so he retired. Martin took a coaching job in the Phillies' minor league system shortly after his retirement. He spent the first six weeks of the season as interim first base coach for the eventual World Champion Phillies while Davey Lopes was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. Martin most recently served as hitting coach for the Detroit Tigers' double A affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, in and .

The NICA has a National Intelligence Board that serves as an advisory board to the director-general before he would submit his findings to the president relating to national security matters affecting the Philippines.. Retrieved on December 27, 2007. History Main office of NICA along V. Luna Avenue in Quezon City Founded in 1949, it was created by President Elpidio Quirino under the authority of Executive Order 235 with further powers relating to intelligence work added by a Government Survey and Reorganization Commission in 1954. The agency was reorganized in 1958 under Executive Order 291 by President Carlos Garcia. It was abolished on September 16, 1972, by President Ferdinand Marcos under Presidential Decree 51 and replaced by the National Intelligence and Security Authority (NISA) headed by General Fabian Ver and the Civil Intelligence and Security Agency, assigned to counterintelligence and supervision of all civil security units in Philippine government offices. The agency was primarily used to track down and eliminate anti-Marcos opponents before President Marcos was forced into exile. During his reign, it was one of the main government organizations accused of human rights abuses. After the first EDSA Revolution, it was renamed the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency in 1987, replacing the NISA, and was merged with the Civil Intelligence and Security Agency when the Philippine Constitution was revamped, where it refocused its priorities in tackling the communist movement. Their work has resulted in their weakening in the late 1990s. In 1990, the Philippines' national security advisor was given responsibility to oversee management and control of the agency to be responsive to the needs of the president and the National Security Council. Executive Order Number 492, issued on February 1, 2006, orders the NICA to activate the National Maritime Aerial Reconnaissance and Surveillance Center or NMARSC, which shall serve as the primary IMINT provider for the Philippine intelligence community. Under the supervision and oversight of the National Security Adviser, the NICA-directed NMARSC will operate unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs to cater to the imagery intelligence demands of various government agencies. NICA agents were responsible for the arrest of several Abu Sayyaf members, including Al Qaeda-linked bomber Abdulmukim Edris. The NICA is also active in the Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Council, as mandated by the Human Security Act signed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on March 6, 2007.https://web.archive.org/web/20190616060635/http://senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%209372.pdf In 2005, it started activation of two directorates involving economic intelligence and counterintelligence. House Bill No. 7111, or the proposed Foreign Electronic Surveillance Act by House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas would allow NICA agents to covertly conduct electronic surveillance operations against foreign countries, terrorists and private groups without the need of having a warrant or a court order in an emergency situation. A warrantless operation outside Philippine soil would need approval from the director general and the secretary of the Department of Justice. Organization The NICA is organized with the following: * Office of the Director-General – Led by Director-General * Directorate of Operations – Led by Assistant Director- General for Operations * Directorate of Production – Led by the Assistant Director-General for Production * Directorate of Administration – Led by the Assistant Director-General for Administration * Management and Planning Office * Office of the Comptroller * Various field stations in various regions – Led by Regional Director Known directors-general * Gen.
